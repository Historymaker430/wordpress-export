The truth is worldly standards don&#8217;t stand the test of time. They are bio-degradable. They are exposed to wear and tear. They don&#8217;t have a great re-sale value. They might be the in-thing in your part of the country, but up there in heaven, they don&#8217;t mean a thing.<br \/>\n* And Let me also add, &#8220;unless you aren&#8217;t of sound mind, and have a really bad head towards investment, you\u00a0 wouldn&#8217;t really seek anything of the world!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>* The Lord&#8217;s WORD is powerful. The WORD is full of God&#8217;s promises- Promises that were made to be kept. We don&#8217;t even have to claim those promises. [ You claim something that is lost\/ stolen]. The promises were always there, all we had to do was take &#8217;em by faith. Sight will tell you, that you will be in the same job sulking month after month, working for the same pay, under the same boss. Faith will tell you that out of you shall flow living waters, which inturn will be a blessing for many.<\/p>\n<p>* If you have been praying for something real hard, and not much has been happening, then you might want to try out this little exercise. Ask yourself this question. Whatever be it that you are asking for, does it glorify God or your SELF? Check the motive behind the prayer.<\/p>\n<p>* You may have CARAVAN of requests lined up &#8211; A car, a own flat, a decent job in a big-time company etc. And you may even tell yourself that, you are going to glorify God through them. Nothings wrong with your motive! Its actually wonderful that your priority is to lift His Name on high. But there is something about God&#8217;s nature that we need to understand here. His LOVE towards us is such that, all the plans\/ blessings\/purposes He has for us are designed in the best interest of us. i.e. He knows what is best for us and also the time when it can be best imparted on us.<\/p>\n<p>* At times the blessings that we seek become so important, that they begin to determine our relationship with the Lord. They start to dictate our moods, temperament and even attitude. They allow apprehension and stress and frustration and whole lotta stuff like that to come into us. They may also take us away from God. Now, You don&#8217;t want that to happen, in your right minds. Do you?\u00a0 So beloved seek Him, not the blessings. If you were thinking I am not being realistic, then I must say you are yet to taste HIM. Try Him! He is matchless. No one can beat Him. He is all that we ever need.<\/p>\n<p>* Its true, that the Lord wants us to have the best of everything. Underline that statement and keep it in the back of your minds. Look forward for the best, anticipate for it! No harm. But don&#8217;t make that your primary priority. When it comes, it comes. I want you to take a notice of God&#8217;s awesome nature, which is often at display. He takes notice of the minutest of details. He knows what exactly our heart desires! And without us even asking for it, He sets it right before us in due time, processed and packed! And you wouldn&#8217;t even realize that it was something that you were wanting so badly &#8230; I tell you .. He is lovely! He already is what you wanted your boy friend\/ girl friend to be.<\/p>\n<p>to be contd&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Before you read this, I would urge you to read the previous two mails &#8230;

How many did you share the gospel with? It not that these are criteria for the Lord to bless you, but then the question is, now that we belong to Christ, are we doing what we are expected to do. Why is it always a &#8216;I&#8217;, rather than &#8216;Christ in me&#8217;? The Lord doesn&#8217;t want us to worry about our careers. They are in his hands. We call it stagnation, but in the Lord&#8217;s view it could be unfinished work.<\/p>\n<p>For all you know, YOU not getting a promotion could be the Lord&#8217;s way of keeping you away from 6 day weeks and16 hour work schedules, so that He can enjoy your fellowship better.

Our prayers somehow end up to being self centered. hmmm &#8230; we don&#8217;t want to hear this, do we?2. My spiritual father, once gave me a great insight into one of the possible reasons why God delays in answering prayers &#8230;   &#8220;&#8230;At times when we are praying for a very important request\/ desire of our heart\/ job\/ promotion\/ healing of family-friends\/ salvation, we make sure that we are walking right &#8230;.. we make sure that we spend maximum time in prayer &#8230;  we even postpone movie plans\/ skip television\/ eat outs\/ fun activities and tend to get ourselves into the so called PRAYER MODE&#8221; &#8230;these are righteous requests. No denial. And this is the general tendency. And we tend to be in that mode till the time the Lord actually answers that prayer. And I suppose we all can trace back ourselves to situations like that in our own lives&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Our God is a good God. He always answers our prayers. But the question here is, what happens to that prayer mode after the prayers get answered? Most of the cases there&#8217;s a wonderful\/ Spirit filled thankzgiving. And after that somehow, the prayer time tends to shrink in size. i.e. NOW that the prayers are answered, the time that we otherwise spent with God lifting up our requests, now gets allocated into other areas that suddenly attain importance.     And God knows this. And that is the reason why He delays. Sounds like a very SELFISH strategy.<\/p>\n<p>But the truth is, its a desperate measure taken by a Loving Father who Longs to have fellowship with His kids. He knows what&#8217;s right for us and what&#8217;s not. He knows what&#8217;s Good for us and what&#8217;s not. So lets stop being anxious about our future. &#8216;cuz it&#8217;s in His hands.

A woman broke a vessel at the feet of  Jesus and anointed Him. Jesus took bread and  broke it as a picture of His body given for us.  God uses broken things, and He starts with broken  hearts. This is what repentance is all about. God  doesn&#8217;t listen to the lips. He doesn&#8217;t measure a  material sacrifice. He looks at the heart and  says, &#8220;If your heart is broken, then I can  cleanse it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When David sinned, he could have brought all  kinds of sacrifices. But they would not have  pleased the Lord. God was waiting for the  sacrifice of a broken heart. That&#8217;s why David  said, &#8220;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,  a broken and a contrite heart&#8211;these, O God, You  will not despise&#8221; (v. 17). David&#8217;s sins should  have brought him condemnation and death. He  committed adultery, and he murdered a man. No  sacrifice could be found in God&#8217;s sacrificial  system for this kind of flagrant, rebellious,  deliberate sin. But David did not die. Even  though no sacrifice was available for his sin at  the time, God looked down the corridors of time  and saw a cross where Jesus Christ would die for  David&#8217;s sin.<\/p>\n<p>God looks at the heart, not the hand. He wants  sincerity from the heart, not religious routine.  A broken heart is not remorse, nor is it regret.  It is repentance, a turning away from sin. It&#8217;s  telling God you hate sin, are judging it and  claiming his forgiveness.

The historical account shown in the first three chapters establish the legitimacy of Jesus\u2019 life and work. While on earth, He kept the OT command (Exodus 20:12; Ephesians 6:1-6) -which carried with it the full faith and credit of God, Himself. Jesus obeyed His parents (Luke 2:51). Because He pleased his parents and because He obeyed the law, He was at peace at home and in the community. And what was the result? He grew in influence with God and men (Luke 2:52). Several messages can be written regarding the significance of chapters 1-3, but for brevity sake, I\u2019ll get to my point. Chapter four represents a turning point in the book. From this point, the works of Jesus expand and the ultimate beauty of His final sacrifice necessarily follows His stellar example of daily surrenders.<\/p>\n<p>Luke 4:1 (KJV) 1And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness<\/p>\n<p>The narrative opens with Jesus preparing for His ministry. The abundance of God\u2019s fullness ruled to the uttermost parts of His humanity. Here He is- being full of God\u2019s Spirit. He had steadily lived His Life in a town that wasn\u2019t big enough for a stop sign, a traffic light, a McDonald\u2019s or a Wal-Mart.  Nazareth had small-town, family values- where the water was pure and where everybody knew each other. Nazareth was a hole in the wall- full of nothing special and where simplicity was routine- enough to drive anybody jaded by the night sky of city lights (like me) absolutely crazy. However this was not true of Jesus. This dude was a piece of work. He took advantage of the opportunity and wholeheartedly sought after ways to prepare Himself to do God\u2019s will. He had made a life decision to follow after God and up to this point; Jesus had lived consistently with His decision. Clearly, the fruit of that commitment was evident. I imagine that His homegrown wholesomeness and purity could be reasonably discerned by anyone blessed enough to have met His acquaintance. Nazareth had been an incubator for His strength of spirit, mind, and character. There, Jesus could grow up like any normal Jewish boy without criminal and sinful influences interrupting or interfering with His growth. Nazareth\u2019s proximity to Jordan was more than incidental. During this time, all of Jordan was experiencing a spiritual renewal lead by John the Baptist. No doubt, Jesus attended all of the revival services. As Jesus followed God, one day the Spirit lead Jesus into the wilderness where violence was no longer restrained by the righteousness of a community that restricted the limits of aberrant behavior- like Nazareth had done. God had taken Jesus to the place where it was harsh and where survival of the fittest was the law and controlled the surroundings. In the wilderness, it was every species for itself! Lo and behold, the devil shows up and assaults the stamina and integrity of Christ. Christ maintained his commitment to God through the experience.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday was Father\u2019s Day, and a child needs to hear the voice of their father.  In Matt. 3:17, God the Father said, \u201cThis is my Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased.  In the desert Jesus would cling to the words of His Father and use them at the time the Devil would assault him and attempt to deter Jesus from His mission.  It\u2019s amazing that God allows us to place us in life, and along the way He lead us to Him, we received faith in Christ, and one day that faith would be tested. How are you during the wilderness tests in your life?  Does your faith in Christ sustain you?  What happens when you come through the test?  Tomorrow we well look at the result of Jesus\u2019 wilderness test.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good Morning, I find Luke\u2019s Gospel to be unique regarding how readers view the humanity of Jesus.

It is He who has made us\u201d (Psalm 100:3)<\/p>\n<p>Most people&#8217;s feelings and thoughts about themselves fluctuate some what based on their daily experiences. The grade you get on an exam, how your friends treat you, ups and downs in a romantic relationship-all can have a temporary impact on your wellbeing. Your self-esteem, however, is something more fundamental than the normal &#8220;ups and downs&#8221; associated with situational changes. For people with good basic self-esteem, normal &#8220;ups and downs&#8221; may lead to temporary fluctuations in how they feel about themselves, but only to a limited extent. In contrast, for people with poor basic self-esteem, these &#8220;ups and downs&#8221; may make all the difference in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Where Does Self-Esteem Come From? Our self-esteem develops and evolves throughout our lives as we build an image of ourselves through our experiences with different people and activities. Experiences during our childhood play a particularly large role in the shaping of our basic self-esteem. When we were growing up, our successes (and failures) and how we were treated by the members of our immediate family, by our teachers, coaches, religious authorities, and by our peers, all contributed to the creation of our basic self-esteem. Self-esteem is largely developed during childhood.<\/p>\n<p>Healthy Self-Esteem &#8211; Childhood experiences that lead to healthy self-esteem include &#8211; Being praised, being listened to, being spoken to respectfully, and getting attention and hugs, experiencing success in sports or school, having trustworthy friends.<\/p>\n<p>Low Self-Esteem &#8211; Childhood experiences that lead to low self-esteem include &#8211; Being harshly criticized, being yelled at, or beaten, being ignored, ridiculed or teased, being expected to be &#8220;perfect&#8221; all the time, experiencing failures in sports or school. People with low self-esteem were often given messages that failed experiences (losing a game, getting a poor grade, etc.) were failures of their whole self.<\/p>\n<p>Biblical self esteem consists in seeing ourselves as God sees us, and accepting ourselves as God accepts us. This is founded on the humble acknowledgment that God is responsible for every positive attribute we possess. \u201cKnow that the Lord is God. It is He who has made us\u201d (Psalm 100:3). See 1 Corinthians 4:7. This foundation enables us to enjoy and use every good quality, without a trace of pride or false humility, because God receives the glory.<\/p>\n<p>A biblical perspective on our self esteem enables us to see ourselves realistically and accept ourselves as we are both in our human condition and as we are in Christ&#8211;new creation .<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Hope you all had a wonderful weekend.

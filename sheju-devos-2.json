It is with these alone that we discern the things of God. Being first opened, and then enlightened &#8211; By his Spirit. How easy to lose hope when you forget who is on board and who called you. I would align assurance, confidence, faith side by side with hope. Hope is the expectation of good. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Christianity is our calling. God has called us to it, and on that account it is said to be his calling. There is a hope in this calling; for those who deal with God deal upon trust. And it is a desirable thing to know what this hope of our calling is, to have such an acquaintance with the immense privileges of God&#8217;s people, and the expectations they have from God, and with respect to the heavenly world, as to be quickened thereby to the utmost diligence and patience in the Christian course.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In Luke 8:22-, Jesus told the disciples to cross with him to the other side. This required a boat for that service, vs. 22, \u201c\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And they launched out. 23&nbsp;But as they sailed He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy\u201d<\/span>. Here was a situation that threatened their lives, a great windstorm which rocked their boat to the point that water was beginning to fill the boat threatening to break it into pieces. For a moment, they lost hope, all that they could see was death. They forgot the hope of His calling especially Christ being in the boat with them. When they came to their senses, they went to wake fast asleep Jesus who was very comfortable in the storm with their complaint, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c\u2026Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?\u201d<\/span> (Mark 4:38). They accused the Son of God for not caring. When we lose hope, it\u2019s easy to default&nbsp; to accusations like these disciples. We wonder if the Lord cares, we wonder if He is present. Those who know the hope of His calling don\u2019t have to see to believe, they don\u2019t have to feel to know, the assurance they have is that Christ in the them, the hope of glory (<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Colossians 1:27<\/span>). We may feel like He is fast asleep in the boat, the comfort they all need &nbsp;is that Christ the Son of God, God Himself can never drown.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Luke 8:24, \u201c\u2026 Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm. 25&nbsp;But He said to them, \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d<\/span>. His disciples should have encouraged themselves with His presence and ply the oar of prayer rather than their other oars and accusations. Their confidence should have lay in this, that they had their Master with them; and the ship that has Christ in it, though it may be tossed, cannot sink; the bush that has God in it, though it may burn, shall not consume.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">I believe is the same way Paul would have wanted the readers of this letter to know the hope of His calling, to pray the same in preparations for some of the windstorms of life and to have that assurance that He who called them will never leave them nor forsake them.&nbsp; A number lose their peace and joy when the road gets bumpy, this ought not to be, if anything it should strengthen us that Christ is our hope. If Christ called us, He will keep us, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Philippians 1:6, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">being confident<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;\u201d<\/span>.&nbsp; Hope is another resource in Christ, may you make this your prayer, \u201cLord, open the eyes of my understanding that I may know the Hope of your calling in my life\u201d, to continue, blessings Ev<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; Ephesians 1: 18,\u201d the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling\u2026\u201d &nbsp; Paul prayed 2. \u201cfor understanding that believers would know the hope of His calling\u201d.

Not because of the eloquence in their prayers or having more power, but the content, the richness of their prayers. In this book, I would have loved to have Paul praying for me because of the content, the depth of the prayers that reminds me of the resources I have in Christ. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">From Vs. 15-22, we hear Paul praying which is almost parallel to his prayer to the Colossians. This prayer is deep in the sense that it touches on something in the Lord&#8217;s prayer most people neglect, &#8220;Your kingdom come&#8221;. Your kingdom come is about spiritual blessings from above effected in the believers to advance God&#8217;s kingdom here on earth. Matthew 6:33, Colossians 3:1. God has laid up spiritual blessings for us in His Son Jesus Christ; but requires us to draw them out and fetch them in by prayer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In these few verses he gives the prayer of thanksgiving and supplication. In vs. 15, he heard of their faith and love for all saints indicating that there was growth taking place and in that he gave thanks. As you read on you find he does not stop there, he prayed 4 points I think everything believer should incorporate in their daily prayers if we are to tap into the resources in Christ.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">He prayed 1. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">For Spiritual wisdom Vs. 17<\/span>. \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him<\/span>,\u201d. He is here speaking of that wisdom and Revelation which are common to all real Christians, same prayer made in Colossians 1:9-. This wisdom is about knowing Him, discerning and making better judgments. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James<\/span> says <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">3:13-18<\/span>, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter envy and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">self-seeking<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth. 15 This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic. 16 For where envy and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">self-seeking exist<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, confusion and every evil thing are there. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. 18 Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace<\/span>\u201d. For this reason <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James 1:5<\/span> tells us to ask for wisdom if we lack, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In seeking spiritual wisdom and the revelation in the knowledge of Him, Paul evaluates what is important in his walk with Christ and he tells us what has changed and his new desires, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Philippians 3: 7&nbsp;But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">that I may gain Christ<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> 9&nbsp;and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">10&nbsp;that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">This prayer was for God to make these believers wise unto salvation, and revealing to them the deep things of God to be pursued as new desires in their hearts. This is about the centrality of Christ in our lives. I see this with my two nieces, they could be playing with things but when I show them something new, different, they are no longer interested in what they have but what I have shown to them. If they were satisfied with what they have, they could care less if there is anything else. Paul knew there was more, he therefore prayed and pursued, and he prayed for others for the same. When was the last time you prayed for the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him? This is one of our resources in Christ we cannot take lightly.

It\u2019s hard to live what is expected of you without learning it first. Paul lays ground work of what believers ought to know, then he prays for the believers to know them, then he lays out how to live the life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">This is his letter of encouragement and admonition to the believers to remind them of their immeasurable blessings in Jesus Christ. The blessings mentioned here are way more than physical but rather spiritual many believers are deficient of because most rarely include them in their prayers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Believers out to know their resources in Christ, pray they be activated and lived in Christ. We need to know that in the mind of God, our sanctification was planned before the world began, it was accomplished at Calvary; it became ours potentially at the point of repentance; it became ours experientially as we saw ourselves in union with Christ and it will be effected to us through the ages by the Holy Spirit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">And here Paul begins with the source of blessings<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201cBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d. \u201c<\/span>Blessed\u201d here stems from high praises<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span>to the One who deserves it and we see where we are grafted in. God&#8217;s blessing us is His bestowing all spiritual and heavenly blessings upon us. Our blessing God is the paying him our solemn and grateful acknowledgments, both on account of his own essential blessedness, and of the blessings which he bestows upon us. He is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, as man and Mediator<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">,\u2026 \u201cWho has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ<\/span>\u201d- With all manner of spiritual blessings, which are heavenly in their nature, original, and tendency, and shall be completed in heaven. This is the reason we always should pray \u201cYour kingdom come\u201d. God is the author and giver of all blessings, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James 1:17<\/span> confirms it, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Every good gift and every perfect gift is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">from above<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">comes down from the Father of lights<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning\u201d. <\/span>These are eternal blessings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">The first blessings I see is in vs. 4, \u201cHE CHOSE US\u201d, Vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">4\ufeff\u201cjust as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love\u201d. <\/span>While this may be miss construed, it\u2019s not us who chose Him; He did choose us before the foundation of the earth that we be holy which is entirely His work.

If you asked him what was the most important thing on a house is, he would tell you the foundation. A house is only as strong as the foundation that it is built upon. Jesus uses this language of foundations when he speaks in Matt 7. Jesus shares that there are two kinds of builders (people), those that have built their lives upon the solid foundation on Christ the rock, and those that have built their house upon the unstable foundation of religious sand. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Have you ever seen those incredible sculptures of sand art? Click to check it out. <a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=sand+art&amp;ndsp=20&amp;svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=60&amp;sa=N\">http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=sand+art&amp;ndsp=20&amp;svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=60&amp;sa=N<\/a>. There is so much time that goes in the aesthetics, but it can be easily destroyed because it still is only sand. There are many that build their lives upon the shifting sands of religion, and tradition. However Jesus said of those that do this are foolish. The reason for their foolishness is because although they heard the Words of Jesus, not the words of a religious leader, but Christ, they refused to put them into practice. It is not hearing but doing that shows a true convert. The foolish man was the one who heard the sayings of Jesus, but did not obey them. It\u2019s not the world that hears the sayings of Jesus and doesn\u2019t obey them. Most know only the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d and \u201cJudge not,\u201d and even then their understanding is darkened. However, the Church is filled with false converts who sit among God\u2019s people and hear His words, but don\u2019t obey them. They build their house on sand rather than on the firm foundation of Jesus Christ and His words (Ray Comfort).\u201d<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> A. W. Tozer<\/span> said, \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">It is my opinion that tens of thousands of people, if not millions, have been brought into some kind of religious experience by accepting Christ, and they have not been saved<\/span>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The true convert builds his house upon the rock. \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he.<\/span> (Deut.32:4). Paul wrote \u201c\u2026and that rock was Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4).\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=foundation+%2B+house&amp;svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=\">http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=foundation+%2B+house&amp;svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The test will show the foundation! Jesus said that the rain will come down, the streams will rise, and the winds will blow and<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> beat<\/span> against that house (the sand house, and the rock house). The rain of tribulation, the streams of temptation, and the winds of persecution will beat against your life. If Christ is not your foundation, you will fall with a great crash; ultimately Hell will be the place you \u201ccrash\u201d for eternity. Don\u2019t build your house on religion, or tradition, Jesus has made this abundantly clear. If you do, you are playing Russian roulette with a fully loaded gun! If Christ is who you have built your house upon, His words alone,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> not the words of a pastor, priest, tradition, creed, or culture<\/span>, then Christ will protect you.

Isn\u2019t it great to listen to preaching that helps you to comprehend God\u2019s Word more clearly? There are some people that just seem to be able to break down the Word of God in such a masterful way. I have learned many things throughout my years as a Christian from others. There are particular people in my life that have helped me to learn about a particular spiritual discipline, or a certain biblical truth or principle, etc.\u2026. Why is it that there is so much learning of truth, but so little doing of truth? We learn very much, and appropriate so very little. We learn how to pray, but then do we actually pray? We learn how to study God\u2019s Word, but then are too busy to study it. We learn how to share our faith, but then walk by thousands of people, never sharing God\u2019s truth with those that are Hell-bound. James (the bother of Jesus) wrote that listening to God\u2019s Word is not enough. James said about God\u2019s Word:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Do what it says<\/span>.\u201d If we only listen to God\u2019s Word, whether listening to a preacher or listening to God Himself and we don\u2019t do it we deceive ourselves. Do you know that failing to do God\u2019s &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Word after you have heard it shows that you are deceiving yourself. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">2. Don\u2019t forget what you look like<\/span>. James uses the illustration of one that stands in front of a mirror and looks at oneself, but then walks away and forgets what one looks like. Imagine if one checked oneself in the mirror and was on their way to an interview, this person had all kinds of stains on their clothing, but off to the interview he went. This person saw what he looked like in the mirror, but then seemed to forget what he looked like, because he didn\u2019t do anything (clean his stain, or change his clothing) to make a change. Yet so many do this with God\u2019s Word, looking into it as a mirror, seeing the change that needs to take place, and going on without making the change.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">3. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">The blessing comes to those that are doers of His Word<\/span>. James says that the one that looks into the Word of God intently (carefully, with purpose) and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it \u2013 he will be blessed in what he does. Are you deceived, have you forgotten what you look like (what His Word says), or are you doing what God is speaking to you. What is God speaking to you? Write it down, and then do it. If you need help appropriating speak to a mature believer, or a spiritual leader. You can always write Evans and I for help, and we would be glad to help if we can. Christianity today has much learning, but little application. Be the type of Christian that Jesus wants you to be, one that does His Word. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessing Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; \u201cDo not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves.

The thinking is that after giving the best years to work; now, one can sit back and enjoy the fruit of those labors. However, when does one \u201cretire\u201d from serving the Lord? Is there an age that one should say, \u201cWell Lord I have put my time in these many years, and now I will rest from ministry?\u201d When Moses sent out the spies to spy out the Land, Caleb was a much younger man at the time, with much strength and vigor. At Kadesh Barnea Caleb was 40 years old and the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for thirty eight years, then the conquering of the Land took seven years (ca. 1405\u20131398 b.c.). In the above Scripture Caleb is now eighty five years old, and says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cNow therefore, give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day\u2026\u201d <\/span>Did Caleb retire from moving forward, did he hang up his ministry belt, did he sit back and decide to rest at this point, NO! He was determined, at eighty five years old to move forward in all that God had for him. However, sadly in this day and age I see many older folks in churches sit back reflecting on the former years, yet failing to create new memories and continuing to minister unto the Lord, and serve people now. Paul writes, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine: \ufeff2\ufeff that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience; the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things\u2014 \ufeff4\ufeff that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, \ufeff5\ufeff to be discreet, chaste, \ufeffhomemakers, good, \ufeffobedient to their own husbands, \ufeff\ufeffthat the word of God may not be blasphemed. \ufeff6\ufeff Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded, \ufeff7\ufeff in all things showing yourself to be \ufeff\ufeffa pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, \ufeff\ufeffincorruptibility, \ufeff\ufeff\ufeff8\ufeff sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of \ufeff\ufeffyou. \ufeff9\ufeff Exhort \ufeffbondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back, \ufeff10\ufeff not \ufeff\ufeffpilfering (thieving), but showing all good \ufeff\ufefffidelity (honesty) , that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things\u201d<\/span> (<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Titus 2:1 \u2013 10<\/span>).\u201d According to Paul, and in light of Caleb, when one becomes older, it is not time to just rest, because it is only in this time of one\u2019s life that one is able to pass one certain things, impart certain things, train the younger in specific things that one would not have been able to because the wisdom and experience for the most part, would not have been present to impart. Perhaps one of my most favorite testimonies about an older man serving the Lord is called \u201cI got off at George Street.\u201d Click here and listen soberly to the eight minute testimony-<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0rXhHhNwHZk&amp;feature=gv\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0rXhHhNwHZk&amp;feature=gv<\/span><\/a>. WOW, wasn\u2019t that an incredible testimony?<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> This man was willing to do in his condition, what many are not willing to do in their \u201chealthy\u201d condition. <\/span>Perhaps that is why Samuel said that<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201c&#8230;The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart (1 Samuel 16:6),\u201d <\/span>speaking of young David. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">David wrote the famous Psalm 23 in his golden years, not as a shepherd boy in the field. After he slayed Goliath, was on the run from Saul, committed adultery, made a leader over all the downtrodden and destitute in Israel, took a census, and was betrayed by Absalom, etc\u2026then and only then did he pen the famous Psalm. Caleb was ready still to take land, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">So Moses swore on that day, saying, \ufeff\ufeff\u2018Surely the land \ufeffwhere your foot has trodden shall<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> be your inheritance and your children\u2019s forever, because you have wholly followed the Lord my God<\/span>\u201d. Wow, this blesses my heart abundantly to hear this great news that Caleb was such a great example to follow as he WHOLLY followed his God, and would leave inheritance to his children as God\u2019s blessing upon him. His servant hood into his older age was blessed by the Lord. The older ones must<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> wholly follow the Lord<\/span>, and not just in the younger years of their lives, and must disciple the younger ones or else how will they grow, as<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> the Great Commission has no expiration date on it<\/span>. Pass this one to those in your church that are perhaps in this era of life, and have the retirement mentality, and encourage them that there is still much work to be done, and they are needed for such a time as this. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Are you looking to retire or TAKE THE LAND in your older years?

Christ took a little boys lunch and fed 5,000. Christ directed Peter to fish for a coin to pay taxes to the government of that day. And God\u2019s ultimate provision is when Christ paid for our transgression in His life\u2019s blood. Israel experienced the provision of God as they wondered in the wilderness for those forty years. There were some specific things that God commanded Israel to do on their way to possess the land. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">(Deut. 8:1 \u2013 5)God said, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Every commandment which I command you today \ufeffyou must \ufeff\ufeffbe careful to observe, that you may live and \ufeffmultiply, \ufeff\ufeffand go in and possess the land of which the Lord \ufeff\ufeffswore to your fathers<\/span>.\u201d It is crucial that a follower of Christ takes Him at His Word. If one does not believe God\u2019s Word, one is calling Him a liar, and we know God cannot lie. Israel was commanded to obey the commandments of God. There are professing believers who treat the Bible like Thomas Jefferson, who ripped out every account written of a miracle in the Bible. As believers, we must not pick and choose what commands we will follow, and which we will neglect. One area many neglect is evangelism. Why is that? Perhaps one reason can be found in the following verse. \ufeff2\ufeff \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And you shall remember that the Lord your God \ufeffled you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you and \ufeff \ufefftest you, \ufeff\ufeffto know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.\u201d<\/span> Many believers seem to forget what the Lord did to pull them out of their sin when they were converted to Christ. The Lord wants His children to be humble before Him, and this is made manifest in times of testing. How one responds in various situations (tests) reveals what is in one\u2019s heart, and if someone is obedient to the Lord or not. How do you measure up when tested? I have found that there were times in my life that when I was tested, pride rose up in my heart instead of humility. It is always better from one to humble oneself, or God will step in and make sure that He humbles you. Each plague sent hardened Pharaoh\u2019s heart, instead of humbly letting Israel GO! It wasn\u2019t until his son was killed that he released the Israelites, and even then would chase after them to kill them. After God killed the Egyptian army, and the Israelites were in the desert, they began to complain about their situation in the desert, especially in terms of what they ate in Egypt (even though they were being physically abused in the process), comparing their current food, manna, to the leeks and onions of Egypt. \ufeff3\ufeff<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> So<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> He humbled you<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \ufeffallowed you to hunger, and \ufefffed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> man shall \ufeffnot live by bread alone; but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. <\/span>Jesus quoted this very verse when tempted of Satan in the desert. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Do you hunger for the Word of God, like Job who said \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I esteemed the Words of His mouth more than my necessary food<\/span> (23:12)?\u201d Paul writes of the armor of God in Eph 6, and the Word of God is the offensive sword used to attack. The breastplate of righteousness was worn to protect the vital organs (heart and lungs). Do you love the Lord with all your heart; is he the focal point of all your affections? Moses mentioned wrote of the Israelites, \u201c4\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Your garments did not wear out on you,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> nor did your foot swell<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> these forty years\u201d<\/span>. We are to rest in the righteousness of Christ, as His righteousness does not and cannot wear out. Paul writes to believers to have their feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. We are to stand in the authority of Jesus Christ, and to carry this great gospel to areas and people that are going to Hell. These shoes are unlike any others because with them we can go into the enemy\u2019s territory and preach the gospel that others may walk out of the enemy\u2019s camp in freedom, no longer a prisoner of sin and Satan. The Israelites FEET DID NOT SWELL for forty years, yet many Christian\u2019s feet is swollen with pride, laziness, and disregard for the lost, and prejudice. They are like Jonah whose feet took him in the complete opposite direction to the direction God commended him to go in. His feet were swollen with the things previously mentioned, and God just didn\u2019t let him off the hook (no pun intended). Moses wrote of the Israelites, 5\ufeff<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \ufeffYou should \ufeff\ufeffknow in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> the Lord your God chastens you\u201d<\/span>. Perhaps if you\u2019re feet are swollen for failing to share your faith, then God is chastening you unto obedience today. Don\u2019t rely on \u201cprofessional ministers\u201d to do the work, be obedient to the work. \u201cFor four hundred years the Christian church had no great preacher by rhetorical standards. The first great preacher was Chrysostom. Yet during those centuries, Christianity conquered the Mediterranean world by the faithful witness of the common believer.\u201d (Warren Wiersbe and Lloyd Perry). While there<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> were no professional missionaries<\/span> devoting their whole life to this specific work, every congregation was a missionary society, and every Christian believer a missionary, inflamed by the love of Christ to convert his fellow men.\u2026 Every Christian told his neighbor, the laborer to his fellow laborer, the slave to his fellow slave, the servant to his master and mistress, the story of his conversion as a mariner tells the story of the rescue from shipwreck (Philip Schaff, about the early days of the post-apostolic church). There is no plan B that Jesus has in place! Consider the following: According to a legend, when Jesus returned to heaven following his death on the cross and resurrection from the tomb, the angels gathered in amazement. They gazed at the wounds in his hands and feet, and shuddered to recall his suffering. Finally Gabriel spoke: \u201cMaster, you suffered terribly down there. Do they know and appreciate the extent of your sacrifice.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Jesus. \u201cNot yet. Right now only a handful of people in Palestine know.\u201d \u201cThen what have you done to let everyone else know?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Peter, James, and John, and a few others to spread the news. They will tell others who will tell others until the message spreads to the ends of the earth\u201d. \u201dBut Gabriel, knowing the nature of human beings, asked, \u201cWhat is Plan B?\u201d \u201cI have no Plan B,\u201d replied Christ. \u201cThere is no alternative strategy. I\u2019m counting on them.\u201d Twenty centuries later, he still has no other plan. He\u2019s counting on you and me. Rom 10 reads, \u201c14 <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things<\/span>!\u201d You are called to take the land now! Are your feet beautiful or swollen before the sight of a holy God to who you have to give an account of what you did with the glorious Gospel of Christ?, Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Phil the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, God is surely a God of provision.

Although of little strategic value, US command ordered assaults to clear the area around AP Bia, which led to pitched battles on the heavily fortified Hill 937. As the battle was primarily carried out by infantry using small arms fire, the fighting was akin to WWI trench warfare with the US Airborne troops moving up the highly sloped hill against experienced and well equipped entrenched troops. Attacks were repeatedly repelled by weather, friendly fire, accidents, and especially the highly effective PAVN defenses. Nevertheless the Airborne troops took the hill through direct assault, causing extensive casualties to the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PAVN\">PAVN<\/a> forces, and taking such in their own units. The backlash due to the high casualties over a strategically unimportant point led to dramatic changes in the conduct of the war, and Hamburger Hill would be the last major US ground assault of the war.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">It is amazing that men gave their very lives to take over a hill in the midst of a war. This tells me that the hill was of great value to them, this tells me that someone commanded the men to do so; this tells me that these men placed their very lives on the line to obey the command. I would imagine that taking the land would be an important victory in the battle against the enemy, and that it would please the one that called for the Hill to be taken. The enemy was not going to just give up the hill, the soldiers had to take it from the enemy by being proactive, moving forward, risking their lives, being resolute and mission minded, could not deter them from the mission, defeat was not an option. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Moses wrote in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Numbers 13,1-2, 17-20 \u201cAnd the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, \ufeff\ufeff\u201cSend men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, everyone a leader among them.\u201d \ufeff17\ufeff Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, \u201cGo up this way into the South, and go up to \ufeffthe mountains, \ufeff18\ufeff and see what the land is like: whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, few or many; \ufeff19\ufeff whether the land they dwell in is good or bad; whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds; \ufeff20\ufeff whether the land is \ufeffrich or poor; and whether there are forests there or not. \ufeff\ufeffBe of good courage. And bring some of the fruit of the land.\u201d Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">God had promised that He was going to give The Promised Land to His people. However, he still called Moses to send forth spies to spy out the land and to see the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">What was the condition of the land, were the people strong or weak, was the land good or bad to dwell in, were the cities like camps or strongholds. As the spies took inventory of the land and the people, they were to finally bring back some of the fruit of the land to show Moses. There were two different reports that returned, one team of ten brought back a fearful report, and the team of two brought back a faithful report. Verse 32 states of the ten fearful spies \u201cAnd<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> they brought and evil report\u2026to the children of Israel.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d <\/span>The ten (the majority) reported that the land was good; however the people were allegedly giants to be feared, and the cities were a stronghold. The two faithful spies returned (Joshua and Caleb) and Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, and reported <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cWe should go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it<\/span>.\u201d Does not fear and faith oppose each other? Which report would you have believed? It is interesting to note, most Christian can name the two spies from memory, Joshua and Caleb, but cannot name the ten spies from memory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Did you know that God too has called us to look out over the land, and believe that although the enemy, Satan is the god of the world (land) we can go and possess the land by winning the lost to Jesus Christ? However, just as most of the spies, ten, did not see the need to reality of taking the Land, but only two did, so too are 98% of professing Christians not seeing the necessity of sharing their faith, but 2% only obey Christ\u2019s command to take the land by seeking and saving the lost by His hand. The two saw what the ten did not and perhaps would not see victory. Paul wrote, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What then shall we say to these things? \ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">If God<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\"> is<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> for us, who<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\"> can be<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> against us<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> (Rom 8)?<\/span> Can the \u201cgiants\u201d really have any effect on us when God is on our side? It seems that the giants of fear, lack of zeal, feeling unequipped, lack to compassion, media, political correctness, etc\u2026, have really scared off so many professing Christian from taking the land to reach the lost. Jesus spoke to His disciples in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">John 4<\/span>, and said, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\"> then<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest<\/span>. The land has people ready to be harvested, so what is the problem? Jesus said in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Luke 10, \u201cThe harvest truly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\"> is<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> great, but the labourers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\"> are<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. 3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.\u201d<\/span> Jesus has called the few laborers (Joshua and Caleb were among the minority) to go face the land, despite the possible \u201cgiants\u201d in the land. Jesus calls us to be proactive, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force\u201d<\/span>. The force that we are to take the land by <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cis Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts (Zech 4:6).\u201d<\/span> If soldiers can give their lives to take a hill, should we not give our lives to serve the Lord? <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Are you obeying Jesus, by faith, and are resolved to go in and TAKE THE LAND NOW!

His message showed he was a prophet. Rather than the bible call him a prophet, the bible called him a man of God. I believe this was done deliberately because there were prophets in the land both true and false as you will see, and God wanted us to learn the difference. We are not told of who he was rather whose he was.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">His message was simple, God will raise a child by the name of Josiah to take over, and a sign of the altar shall split apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out. To even attest that this was prophet, when king Jeroboam ordered for him to be arrested, his hand became withered and had to ask for the man of God to entreat the Lord on his behalf that his hands would be restored. And to this he believed that he was sent of God. The prophets of the day received rewards for their services (miracles), it was accustom for people to give out rewards because the Lord allowed it. So what does king Jeroboam do, he does the same,&nbsp; vs. 8, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> But the man of God said to the king, \u201cIf you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">9 For so it was commanded me by the word of the Lord, saying, \u2018You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you came.\u2019<\/span>\u201d. Mission accomplished. He made good choice, he listened to the Lord to bring the message and also he let go what was ok for a prophet to receive because the word of God commanded him to. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. \u201d 10 So he went another way and did not return by the way he came to Bethel<\/span>\u201d, as he journeyed back, there met him an old prophet who sent for him. And the old prophet asked him to come with him and eat bread. Again you see him choose to obey the Lord, he answered vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">16, \u201cI cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place. 17&nbsp;For I have been told by the word of the Lord, \u2018You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Here is where things fell apart<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, vs. 18, \u201cHe said to him, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">I too am a prophet as you are<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, saying, \u2018Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.\u2019\u201d (He was lying to him.)\u201d 19 So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water\u201d. <\/span>He listened to him when the old prophet added a twist to his message, \u201cI am a prophet too and I speak for the Lord\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">This is one of the things plaguing our churches, many choose not to receive from the king, they also choose not to listen to another man until like this man who declared himself a prophet claiming to be speaking for the Lord that many believe him\/her. He went in and sat down in his house and ate bread and drank water choosing to disobey God. Many believers have chosen to sit, eat and drink with that old false prophet, listening to another voice. While all looks good, it\u2019s a trap, a tragedy waiting to happen.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The good prophet&#8217;s weakness, in suffering himself to be thus imposed upon, he that had resolution enough to refuse the invitation of the king, who promised him a reward, but could not resist the insinuations of one that pretended to be a prophet. Choose this day whose voice you will listen to, the voice of God through His word, or the voice of the old lying prophet who claims to speak for the Lord.

Absolutely. Can I false prophet say true things biblically, absolutely. Does saying some good things make them true prophets? Absolutely not. From what I read, anytime God used a false prophet, it was not to bring blessings but to bring judgment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Here we see God use the false prophet to deliver a message of judgment to the man of God,&nbsp; vs.\u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">20 Now it happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back; 21 and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, \u201cThus says the Lord: \u2018<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Because you have disobeyed the word of the Lord, and have not kept the commandment which the Lord your God commanded you<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, 22 but you came back, ate bread, and drank water in the place of which the Lord said to you, \u201cEat no bread and drink no water,\u201d your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.\u201d <\/span>I was puzzled by this for a minute. How come the Lord is not punishing the old lying prophet and punishing the man of God who listened to him? I believe the old prophet\u2019s time of punishment would come but for now, God was not going to let His name tarnished because He appears to have given a contradicting message. God used a false prophet to bring doom to the man of God and I believe God is letting the false prophets\/teachers to be on the loose in our time because people have chosen to listen to them rather than turn to God\u2019s word as the measuring standard for every teaching, preaching or prophecy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">God has spoken to us by His word and others have risen to challenge His word to appear to be contradicting. And God is His mercy has not left for us to figure this things out ourselves but rather, He has given us His precious word to be the test to every teaching, preaching and prophesy. Therefore, God&#8217;s people are more in danger of being drawn from their duty by the plausible pretenses of divinity and sanctity than by external inducements; we have therefore need to beware of false prophets, and not believe every spirit. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The man of God should have taken time to beg direction from God, and not have complied so soon.

God has given to all men a free will, to choose as we desire. Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, and they were cast out of the garden. The disciples chose to follow after Jesus, leaving behind their nets, a picture of the Christian leaving behind the world in their pursuit of Christ. Achan chose to hide the accursed things in his tent, and his punishment was dealt to him and his house. Abraham chose to trust God, and he became the father of many nations. The Holy Scriptures are filled with such stories, of the choices that have been made, and how it affected the lives of men and women. We too are faced with choices everyday. We either choose to obey God or not to, we choose to honor Him in our lives, or not, and the scriptures teach us that we will reap in&nbsp; the end the results of those decisions when we stand before a holy God. Sin is not an inevitability, sin is a choice. Sin is my will going against what God has said. I choose to follow, or I choose not to follow. I either choose as God\u2019s Word teaches, or I choose based upon my own judgments.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;As I see these things, and I see the day we live, I see how deceiving the days we live are. Recently, headlines were made when the President of the United States made history when he blatantly went against the Word of God and endorsed homosexual marriage, something the Bible very clearly states is sin. He is also someone who claims to be a practicing Christian. Here I see a choice, a bad one for this gentleman, but what about us? When God\u2019s word and public opinion begin to contradict each other, what do we do? Do we listen to the compromise of a world system that despises holiness, or do we stand upon the Word, declaring <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">that God is true, and every man a liar(Romans 3:4<\/span>). This is just one scenario, I only bring it up as it is an important topic in our day, something that, appallingly, the \u2018church\u2019 is divided over. Think about it, the \u201cchurch\u201d of God divided over what God has clearly declared to be sin. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Joshua exhorts the people in our text, he tells them that they must choose, they themselves must decide whom they will follow. They can follow the sinful god\u2019s their father\u2019s followed, or they can serve the Lord. So many today are on the fence, they are stuck between two opinions (I Kings 18:21). They have not fully decided to follow Jesus, they have made a mental decision, but their heart remains unchanged, ensnared by the worldly lusts (I John 2:15-17). But today\u2019s word is a word of exhortation, to those who sit on the fence, to all of us, to myself, to see the time, that now it is time<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\"> to awake out of sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light(Romans 13:11-12).<\/span> The day of our Lord is fast approaching, are we ready? If we were to stand before Him now, would He find us dressed in white, holy garments, or would we be found unready, dirtied by sin, and by the world? Jesus tells us in Luke 21:36 that we are to watch and pray, that we may be counted worthy to stand before the Son of Man. Paul exhorts Timothy in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">I Timothy 6:14- that you keep this commandment without spot, blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ\u2019s appearing. <\/span>Paul urges Timothy to choose, to pursue holiness, to be blameless. He doesn\u2019t urge him to go become a successful businessman, or to be sure to enjoy himself, or to take it easy, he urges him as Jesus urged His disciples in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Luke 13:24- Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able. <\/span>Let us choose to follow after Jesus with all our lives, to hunger and thirst for Him. What will you choose? Who will you choose to serve? As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all,&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Brother Benjamen<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Joshua 24:15b- ..\u201dchoose for yourselves this day whom you will serve&#8230;\u201d &nbsp; The last week or two I have been thinking about choices, and the ones we face everyday.

Reflecting in his life style and his great sins, he could not understand how a just God would be kind to save him and render him righteous. I feel that way many time and the more I think about it, the more I thank God for His saving grace. We are not justified by keeping the law as many people believe, we are justified by faith through our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Justified means, made as though one never sinned. <\/span>What a kind God He is!!, imagine of all the things we did, when we repented of our sins and put on the Lord Jesus Christ for our eternal salvation, our sinful accounts was wiped out clean and He credited to our accounts righteousness. This is what is called imputed righteousness. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Imputed righteousness through justification is credited righteousness not by works, and by this we have peace with God. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Christ was delivered for our offenses that we may be the righteousness of God.<\/span> God the Father delivered Jesus Christ to the cross of Calvary, not as an example, but to make atonement for our sins (2Corinthians 5:21). God the Father also raised Jesus Christ again <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">for our justification.<\/span> The meaning of the resurrection for us today is that Christ Jesus died on account of our sins, and was raised from the dead in order to render us righteous in the eyes of God. Faith imputes righteousness. There isn\u2019t a thing anyone can do to become clothed with God\u2019s righteousness except have faith in Jesus Christ as his Savior from sin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">The Swiss reformer Robert Haldane said<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">, \u201cAnd it is by Him (Jesus Christ) they enter into the state of grace, so by Him they stand in it, accepted before God; secured, according to His everlasting covenant, that they shall not be cast down. <\/span>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8230;Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221;, Colossians 1:27<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">It is the death of Christ which effects our salvation (justification); but it is the life of Christ which sustains it (sanctification). Christ died for our sins and was raised for our justification to make continual intercession for us (Hebrew 7:25). The life of Jesus Christ did not take away the penalty of our sins, His death did. But Christ ever lives to take away the dominion of sin over us (sanctification). This is how we are continually kept saved by His intercessory life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">We thank God for His righteousness imputed in us through justification by faith in Jesus Christ. On judgment day, the righteousness of God through Christ is what will cause us to enter into heaven. There will be no sin on our account because our sin account was wiped clean by His blood and righteousness was credited to our account. This should give us unspeakable joy full of His glory.

God\u2019s heart is to be a father to the fatherless as the Psalmist wrote in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 68:5<\/span> \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">A father to the fatherless\u2026 is God in his holy dwelling<\/span>.\u201d&nbsp; Job seemed to have God\u2019s heartbeat for the fatherless.&nbsp; Many people, especially young boys, walk with a limp like Jacob (Gen. 32:25), because they have grown up without a father.&nbsp; They are left to wrestle through life without a father in their corner imparting into their lives.&nbsp; However, what choice does the fatherless have?&nbsp; It therefore becomes the responsibility of the church to care for the orphan, the fatherless.&nbsp; We live in the most fatherless generation ever and statistics tell the grave testimony of fatherlessness.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Job rescued the fatherless<\/span>.&nbsp;

Job didn\u2019t merely talk about the need to help fatherless children, he did something about it.&nbsp; What did he do, I am not exactly sure, but in any case, he did something that merited rescuing them from their situation as Isaiah wrote, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cDefend the cause of the fatherless (1:17)<\/span>.\u201d&nbsp;

Let judgment fall particularly on those parts which have either done wrong, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">or refused to do right when in their power<\/span>.\u201d&nbsp; Solomon wrote, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to act<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(Prov 3:27).<\/span>\u201d&nbsp; Job seemed to see a means of helping the need at some level.&nbsp; I imagine that he felt that if he failed to meet the need that he saw, he deserved the consequence of his arm falling off from his shoulder blade and breaking once it hit the ground.&nbsp; WOW, that is a vivid picture of caring!&nbsp; God gave Job an arm to reach out to meet the need, and it would have been purposeless for Job to have an arm, if he would not extend it to meet the need toward the fatherless.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">It\u2019s the Job (occupation) of the church to be like Job (the person)<\/span>.&nbsp; We are one body with many parts as the body of Christ.&nbsp; One part of that body is the arms to reach out as God\u2019s arms extended.&nbsp; If we don\u2019t reach out as the body of Christ, then should not our arm fall off and break as well if we fail to use it in the manner in which God intended?.&nbsp; Of course there are many needs to reach out to meet; perhaps that is why the body has two arms showing that this is an endeavor which we should be doubly diligent in.&nbsp; If Job\u2019s arm failed to bring healing to the broken heart of the fatherless, then he felt that his arm should feel the brokenness that their hearts feel, a constant throbbing pain that does go away by placing a \u201cband aid\u201d on it.&nbsp; There are many without a physical father, and of course many without a heavenly Father.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Application<\/span>:&nbsp;

If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp.&#8221; So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp. (Judges 7: 9 &#8211; 11)<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Gideon&#8217;s army was less than 1 percent of its original size after the shifting took place, when God cut the majority of troops from the team through the leadership of Gideon. Gideon is resting at night, and God interrupts his rest with urgent orders to respond to divinely urgent news. Gideon is commanded to get up because God was going to give him victory if he would attack immediately. Knowing Gideon&#8217;s heart, God sees Gideon&#8217;s fear, and responds to it with encouragement. Although faith is the opposite of fear at times we need to be navigated from one point to the other on the vehicle of encouragement. God told Gideon if you are too afraid to attack right now then spy on your enemies and eavesdrop on their conversation, you will be encouraged by what you hear. What could they possible hear from the enemy that would give them encouragement?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">In sports competition I would love it if the opposing team would begin to fight against themselves, or when they would somehow lose heart. A divided team can&#8217;t stand, and a team that has no heart because it is gripped by fear has crippled themselves before engaging in the battle. At this point both armies were fearful of one another, but God was about to rip the fear from Gideon&#8217;s heart and encourage him, thus replacing fear with faith. Gideon and Purah (most likely his armor-bearer) eavesdrop on the enemies camp and, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. &#8220;I had a dream,&#8221; he was saying. &#8220;A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.&#8221;<\/span> His friend responded, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands<\/span>.&#8221; No doubt this dream came from God to their enemies, as the fear of Gideon&#8217;s sword ransacked their minds, gripping them with fear, discouragement, and defeat, before the battle was even engaged. I believe it was at this point that Gideon finally believed God. There are some great truth here for God&#8217;s present day soldiers, you and me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">1. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">God&#8217;s Word<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> is timely<\/span>. We are bound by the realm of time, and God is not. God told Gideon to go now to either battle or eavesdrop and Gideon obeyed. Our enemies are defeated already, but we need to listen to God&#8217;s Word to be reminded of that truth. Jesus said in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">John 8:31 &#8211; 32, &#8220;If you&#8230;continue in my Lord&#8230;the truth will set you free.<\/span>&#8221; God&#8217;s Word brings freedom if we apply it. Are you a hearer of God&#8217;s Word and a doer of God&#8217;s Word?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">2. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">God&#8217;s Word is encouraging<\/span>. We&#8217;ve all been discouraged. Gideon&#8217;s army was decreased yet the battle was still on the horizon. Both armies were gripped with fear, but God cares for his people, and meets our discouragement with encouragement, fighting fear with faith. Are you discouraged today, I&#8217;ve been there many times, go to God&#8217;s Word but you need not go alone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">3. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">God&#8217;s Word brings partnership.<\/span> Gideon was commanded to go with Purah, his confidant, his close trustworthy partner. I can picture them smiling with huge grins at each other and being able to encourage one another. Now there were two people bringing encouragement back to the camp together. We need a close partner, who is yours? Do you encourage each other? Battles are here, more are coming, but God&#8217;s Word is timely, encouraging, and brings partnership. God is victorious, let us act by faith upon his Word by being obedient to Him, regardless of the fear that grips our hearts. Go to God&#8217;s Word and allow it to silence the fear that grips you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; &#8220;During that night the LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.

In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her,&#8221; (Judges 7:2)<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">When you are facing a difficult battle ahead does it make sense to decrease your weapons? Gideon was the leader of Israel&#8217;s army, and God would decrease the size of Gideon&#8217;s army with a battle just on the horizon. The Lord&#8217;s instructions probably came as a complete shock to Gideon. I can imagine the he was confused upon hearing, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands<\/span>.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t sound very sensible to me; decrease your army size, because there are too many men for battle. Gideon&#8217;s army was already outnumbered four to one. When I was trying out for sports teams growing up, if one didn&#8217;t qualify for the team they were cut from the team, so that only the best players were left to produce a winning team. There were usually two cuts that took place. This is what God did when he sifted Gideon&#8217;s army. God cut the first wave of people from the team by having Gideon announce, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead<\/span>.&#8221; The result was that <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained<\/span>.&#8221; The first cut allowed the cowards to disqualify themselves and go back home to mommy. Now God would have second cuts, and reduce Gideon&#8217;s army even further. A special examination or screening was set up based on the manner of water drinking among the 10,000 remaining soldiers. There the LORD told him, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink.&#8221; (7:4) Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink<\/span>.&#8221; Those that kneeled down to drink were cut, and those that apparently crouched down to scoop up water by using their hands as a dog uses its tongue remained. The LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands<\/span>.&#8221; The size of the army went from 32,000 to 10,000 to a mere 300 men to fight. Why would God do such a thing?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">1. God can do a lot with a little. God can bring a victory with a few as easily as he could with a large army. Israel would not be able to boast about their victory, as the Lord removed all ground for boasting. Sometimes God reduces you in order to prepare you to move forward, and increase you. John the Baptist said, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">He must Increase, I must decrease (John 3:30)<\/span>.&#8221; But this is not all.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">2. God decreases us to show Himself strong. God said<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, &#8220;&#8230;for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;<\/span> [Paul replied] <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ&#8217;s power may rest on me<\/span>.&#8221; The world needs to see God&#8217;s power through your weakness. Are you shining brightly, or dimly? <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">3. God Knows those that are willing to take risks for Him. Not everyone is willing to obey God when things seem illogical on the surface. Sifting Gideon&#8217;s army for battle is not good military strategy in the natural, but in the supernatural it was just what the Master ordered, and Gideon obeyed. What would you have done?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">God can do a lot with very little to show Himself strong, and He knows those that are willing to take risks for Him even when &#8220;reason&#8221; says otherwise. I, you, we serve a victorious God. What is He asking you to do without to accomplish His will? Are you willing to take that risk?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;The LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands.

If something is stolen, it may be easy to identify what is missing however when something is planted, it takes time to grow and by the time you get to see the symptoms, the damage would have already been done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Let&#8217;s look at the weeds the enemy planted in the lives of God&#8217;s children <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 3:8, &#8220;Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Has God indeed said, &#8220;You shall not eat of every tree of the garden&#8217;?<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8221; <\/span>While man did not know what to plant in his life, God planted good seeds and everything was ok until Adam was absent (a sleep) that the enemy sneaked in to plant weeds. I wonder why the serpent waited till Eve was alone. I see an indication of the husband being the protector, defender, fighter of the home. Standing for the truth and leading the family in the truth. And the first weeds I see in this verse, the enemy <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">planted lies, confusion and doubt <\/span>and immediately those weeds began to chock out the truth they always lived by. Today many question the validity of God\u2019s word especially about marriage (between a man and a woman, or about divorce, how to raise children, many question, \u201cdid God really say that? or, or concluding that God did not mean it the way it appears\u201d. Look at how Joshua protected his family from allowing the enemy to plant weeds <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;as for me (Joshua) and my house, we will serve the Lord, (Joshua 24:15). <\/span>There were evil weeds the enemy was planting in the lives of the Israelites and Joshua gave the people a choice as to who to serve (gain good seeds) then he mentioned to them about his stand, to stay awake and watch in order to protect his family from allowing the enemy to plant weeds. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The enemy is cunning and if he can&#8217;t take away from you, be ready because he will try to find ways to plant something else mostly doubt<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In our world today even Christians have too many weeds growing in their lives, this has stunted growths in many lives. One of the greatest weed is deception, being deceived by strange doctrines that appear like the truth. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It&#8217;s not that enemy has taken the truth away from you, he has distorted the truth by planting something else that competed with the right seed <\/span>and now you are wondering which this of this is the good seed and the weeds. A number nurture weeds they should get rid of and pay little or no attention to the good seeds. Adam and Eve were deceived and they could not tell what the truth was and what was a lie. That is the work of the enemy, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">if he can&#8217;t steal it, he will plant something else<\/span>. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">What do we do when we see the weeds in our my garden?. One day while working on the front yard of my parents\u2019 house, there were too many unwanted weeds growing on their yard, we had tried uprooting them before, but they came back. The reason they came back was because when you uproot, the seeds still remain and that is what begins to germinate again. So I went to the store and found a spray that could ONLY KILL THE WEEDS WITHOUT DESTROYING the flowers planted. Not only would it kill the present growing weeds, it would kill even their unborn seeds. I didn&#8217;t have to be out there the whole day trying to pull them because I could destroy the flowers too, all I needed to do was spray and let the spray do its work. We have the truth of the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">BLOOD OF THE LAMB <\/span>to spray on our gardens. Yes we have good seeds and weeds, and if we can&#8217;t identify the weeds, the truth will. If we are scared of damaging the good seeds while uprooting the weeds, the truth of the blood will preserve the good seeds and destroy the weeds. If we fall asleep and the enemy plants weeds, don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s over, take the blood and spray it over your garden (family, job, position, ministry, while you drive) , the weeds will die with their seeds too, and you will have another chance to grow stronger and blossom.

As you open your wallet or purse, you notice that it is empty. This would not be good. Empty hopes, empty promises, empty dreams, empty homes, and dare I say some seem to relate to those with empty minds. When one thinks of empty things, there is usually negativity attached to it. Emptiness usually speaks of something finished, over, void, etc&#8230;. The first time the term empty was used in the Scriptures it referred to the earth being <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters<\/span>.&#8221; Emptiness was present, but so was the Spirit of God!<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Let&#8217;s fast forward to the time of Jesus, where emptiness was the greatest word that could have filled the air<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. &#8220;The angel said to the women, &#8220;Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay<\/span>.&#8221; Upon seeing where Jesus&#8217; body had been placed by Joseph of Arimathea, they saw emptiness. The angel said it, but Jesus would confirm His words concerning the empty tomb. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them.&#8221; Greetings,&#8221; he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, &#8220;Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">This empty tomb is what all of Christianity hinges upon, an empty tomb! Paul said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;If there is no&nbsp; resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith (1 Cor. 15:14).<\/span>&#8221; All of Christianity hinges on this one time, occurrence, namely the empty tomb, hence the resurrection. If Jesus didn&#8217;t rise from the dead<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">then all of Christianity is dead, and deserves to be buried in a tomb never to be thought of again! We should not believe because someone told us to, because we have to believe in something, or even out of tradition. We should believe or disbelieve based on truth. After all who wants to believe a lie? However if the empty tomb is still speaking today of the truth of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, we should embrace it, and worship Him and the risen Lord and Savior, because he defeated death, hell, and the grave, paying the penalty for the law that we broke. Is the empty tomb the biggest hoax in history or the great truth of all time? It is one or the other, and all must decide which side they are on, because in reality one\u2019s life depends upon the empty tomb. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">If Jesus didn&#8217;t rise then God is a liar and we are all still in our sins, and our preaching and faith is in vain. If the dead are not raised, &#8220;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The empty tomb speaks of fulfilled promises of prophecy, restored dreams, transcendent truth, peaceful patience, and future hope. Yes my whole life hinges on Christ&#8217;s resurrection, I don&#8217;t want to be religious, but rather right (a follower of absolute truth). Can you say with full that your faith is hinged upon emptiness, the truth of the empty tomb. If so then pass your faith on, for neither your faith nor your labor is in vain.

Where you are fully convinced that if the Lord does not come through for you, you are destined to fail.&nbsp; If you are like me, you may find it hard to wait for what you have prayed for and know what God&#8217;s will is for the situation you are in. This verse sheds light clearly and I will use it to set the ball rolling. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Hebrews 10:35&amp;36, &#8220;Cast not therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward, for you are in need of patience that after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">This verse ties with the next few verses we will look at. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 40:1, &#8220;I waited patiently for the Lord; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry<\/span>&#8220;. As I have mentioned before, the word wait has different meaning and the first meaning is sitting down waiting for someone or something. The other meaning is busy serving others just like in the restaurant. We have waiters waiting on people and I believe this is what the Psalmist is telling us that he patiently served the Lord and the Lord heard him. In serving (waiting) on God, he was also bringing his petitions to Him. In his faithfulness in serving, the Lord was heard his cry and attended to Him. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Not only did the Lord hear his cry and attended to him, in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 40:2, &#8220;He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, And set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps<\/span>&#8220;. As you are busy waiting (serving) the Lord, hell won&#8217;t be too happy with you serving. Remember Jesus words in, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">John 16:33, &#8220;These things have I spoken unto you, that in me you might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world<\/span>&#8220;. There is truth about what will happen however there is a promise that comes with it. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1John 4:4, &#8220;Ye are of God little children for you have overcome them. For greater is He that is inside of you than he that is in the world<\/span>&#8220;. Attacks will come, the good news, He is the greatest living inside than we and the enemy that lives in the world. With that established, don&#8217;t be surprised at times when you are in horrible pits or in a miry clay for He will pick you up and set your feet upon a rock. He is the Rock of Ages <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 18:46, &#8220;The Lord lives; and blessed be my Rock; and let the Lord of My salvation be exalted&#8221;<\/span>. He will set you on Himself, the Rock. The Lord heard his cry, attended to him, brought him up out of the pits, set his feet upon the rock and believe me, the Lord is still doing much more in his life. &#8220;\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And established my steps&#8221;<\/span>, the Lord establishes our steps, in other words recognizes our steps. Our steps could be into good ministries, good friends, dealing with issues, meeting deadlines, dealing with arrogant people. In short, all that you need to deal with He recognizes and establishes your step that you may walk worthy of His vocation. Walking with Him requires patience, back to Hebrews we looked at, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">For you are in need of patience&#8221;<\/span>. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 37:23, &#8220;The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way&#8221;.<\/span> The word order here could mean bring something from somewhere else which is missing in the present situation and using it to accomplish what He had in mind. The present things have no capability of making it work but when He orders it from his warehouse (heaven), it comes complete.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 40:3, &#8220;He has put a new song in my mouth &#8211; Praise to our God; Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord<\/span>&#8220;. I know the power in singing for it has a way of encouraging you to overcome. It may not be very easy to pray in certain situations but singing a song, will make a great impact. Singing helps you lift Him up and what did He say in<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> John 12:32, &#8220;And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me&#8221;<\/span>. You lift Him up, you will be part of the people who will be drawn. The neat thing about this verse is that He does not even ask you to look for a song, He puts one in your mouth that you may praise Him. Certain songs that we sing out of our mouths, I wonder whether they praise Him?.&nbsp; &#8220;\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord<\/span>&#8220;, whenever the Lord is doing something in your life and mine, He has someone else in mind that they may see the goodness of the Lord in your life and fear Him. The fear here is reverencing fear and say something like this, &#8220;the God whom so and so serves is a true God&#8221; and they will in turn trust Him. Sad enough, many Christians walk as though they have no God to help them and the unbelievers have no one to set an example for them. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 40:4, &#8220;Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust&#8221;<\/span>, there are so many things you will not understand about how God operates but trust Him. My wife and I are in situations right now where we don&#8217;t know what to expect but sure enough, we are making my Lord our&nbsp; trust. He has heard our cry and attended to it, He has brought us up from the pits and miry clay, He has set our feet upon a rock, He has established our steps, He has put a song in our mouths, And He has set people to see what He has done in our lives what else can we do but make Him our trust<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. Hebrews 10:36, &#8220;&#8230;after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise<\/span>&#8220;.

But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, \u201cMay the good Lord provide atonement for everyone 19 who prepares his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.\u201d 20 And the Lord listened to Hezekiah and healed the people\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">I was reading&nbsp; 2 Chronicles chapter 30 this morning in my devotional time,&nbsp; this chapter as you all know is about king Hezekiah and how he was instrumental in bringing true worship back to all Israel and Judah&#8230;. you read in the previous chapter how he went right to work with opening up the temples, and getting the Levites and priesthood to return back to true worship , chapter 29. This king did not give up, but encouraged everyone, that there was work that needed to be done. The people needed to return to God, because they went after other things and the GOD Israel was not first in their lives. In chapter 30 we read, that the feast of Passover could not be celebrated until all were cleansed, and purified, including the officiating priest&#8230;.. but the verses that I want to highlight here is in chapter 30 v 17,18.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Since many of the people had not purified themselves, the Levites had to slaughter their Passover lamb for them, to set them apart for the Lord., later in that verse it says that King Hezekiah prayed for them. and v. 20 says and the Lord listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people&#8230;&#8230;.what example of prayer, he just did not want to have a &#8220;religious rite&#8221; or &#8220;service&#8221; but knew that God hears, and knew that the condition of the heart was far more important than a religious festival or rite. May we as God\u2019s people not fall into that snare, but may we come to God, daily on our knees, weeping, and breaking before him. We need to be a HOLY people, and to be Holy we must pray and read his word daily and live that life of holiness&#8230;..I just wanted to share this from my heart, it is not criticism but an encouragement to &nbsp;me. As a Holy priesthood of believers let\u2019s make prayer top priority, I too am working in this discipline as I walk in the Lord from day to day. Love you guys,., you mean the world to me. continue to lift me up in prayer&#8230; I need to be disciplined in this area and other areas as well. MARANATHA! Blessings Bro.

Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> I have chosen one of his sons to be king<\/span>.\u201d 1Sa 16:12 &#8220;So he sent and had him brought in. He was ruddy, with a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the LORD said, \u201cRise and anoint him; he is the one.\u201d <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">1Sa 16:13 So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him<\/span> in the presence of his brothers, and<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came upon David in power<\/span>. Samuel then went to Ramah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Can you imagine if one were a king, but had no kingdom? This is where David found himself for a time, when he was first anointed to be the King of Israel. The prophet Samuel was in mourning for Saul, the current one in the position of king, because Saul had been disobedient to God. The Lord has taken the Kingdom away from Saul (1 Sam 15:28) to give it to another better than Saul. That other person became none other than David. At this point David had been a shepherd boy, he did not have a fancy resume\u2019 that \u201cqualified\u201d him to be king. However I appreciate the word that I\u2019ve heard Evans often say to people, \u201cGod does not call the qualified, He qualifies the called.\u201d David became a King without a kingdom for quite a number of years. Many seem to forget that although we are bound by time, God is not. Sometimes we also forget the following truths as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">1. God chooses whoever He wills<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201cI have chosen one of his sons to be king<\/span>.\u201d God sets up authorities and God tears down authorities. Don\u2019t forget who is really running the universe! God is still in charge, and there is still no authority greater than He. God will raise up whosoever He chooses. A man sings a song which says, &#8220;when others see a shepherd boy, God may see a king.\u201d God chose David, because of how God was going to work in David\u2019s life. What has God chosen you for? <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">God anoints His chosen vessel for His chosen will<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201c\u2026Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him\u2026\u201d <\/span>When God calls you for something, he will anoint you for the task. Even though David at this point was a king without a kingdom, he was still anointed for the position of king. This kind of thing boggles our minds especially in America because we are very selfish people. We want instant gratification. We have minute rice, instant coffee, TV dinners, etc\u2026. We are a microwave generation. God works more like a farmer that plants the seed, and over time, as we are bound by time, the change begins to take place.

Many people want power for their own selfish purposes. However, God gives power to carry out His purposes. If God calls you, anoints, then He will empower you. That is why God has empowered the church with the Holy Spirit to be His witnesses. We need only to walk in the power He has given us to do the task He has called us to do. Are you walking in God\u2019s power, anointed by Him, to accomplish His will for you? Jesus said, \u201cB<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">ut you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth<\/span>.\u201d Are you seeking and saving the lost?

The true man of God preaches and practices self denial. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Compare this with what the pillow prophets focus on! God said of them, &#8220;They pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley, and for morsels of bread&#8230; they lie to my people&#8221; (Ezekiel 13:19). A modern translation is, &#8220;These pillow prophets have money on their minds. It has made liars of them.&#8221; Here is the full picture of a pillow prophet. He lets his imagination run wild. He operates on the idea that prosperity will last forever. He builds on dreams and schemes. To do it, he needs money &#8212; lots of it. His need for money becomes the focus of ministry. He ends up telling lies to God&#8217;s people to get it. Then he pollutes it all by saying, &#8220;God told me&#8221; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The message of Jesus Christ is painfully blunt &#8212; deny yourself and take up your cross. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&#8220;Then said Jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me&#8221; (Matthew 16:24). <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Self denial &#8212; what a foreign sounding concept in this day of self-pampering and ease. The pillow prophets have rejected it flat out. Self denial is the giving up and forsaking of all and everything that hinders the constant presence of Christ. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">There is no merit in self denial. We are saved and secured by grace alone. It is not to be entered into to earn benefits from God. But self denial removes hindrances to constant communion with Christ. Paul said, &#8220;I bring my body under&#8230; and bring it under subjection: lest by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway&#8221; (1 Corinthians 9:27). <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">We are not bringing our bodies under control; our passions and appetites are not under subjection. Sensuous television programs now whet the appetites among Christians for pornography. Lust is nearly out of control, even in the ministry. Almost daily I hear of ministers that are spending hours viewing X-rated movies and cassettes. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Multitudes of God&#8217;s people, including preachers of the gospel, waste precious hours lounging before the TV idol. Like Lot, our minds are getting vexed by the things we see and hear. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Food is becoming the narcotic of believers. We don&#8217;t need cocaine or alcohol &#8212; we have a legalized sedative &#8212; food. Never in all my ministry have I seen so many Christians with appetites out of control. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The deepest truth about self denial goes beyond giving up material things. You can sell your TV, shun all erotic sights and sounds, and bring all appetites under control, and still not have denied self. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">What Christ is calling for is a kind of devotion to Himself that expels everything in the heart that hinders. It is a commitment to becoming absolutely nothing before God and man. It is being able to say with Paul, &#8220;I no longer live&#8211; it is Christ living in me. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The world must lose its charm to us. We must die to all self ambition &#8212; to all attachments to earthly things, until we can honestly say, &#8220;I am dead to this world and all it represents. I no longer live.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Physically alive, yes! But I must die to all that hinders my vision and love for Christ. Whatever it is &#8212; it must go. Lust? Self-made plans? Bitterness, grudges? Recognition, self esteem? I must die to it all.

These prophets would have nothing to do with the message of righteousness and impending judgment. Instead, they prophesied an era of peace, ease and prosperity. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Ezekiel 13 is the very word of Jehovah against preachers and prophets who accommodate people with flesh pleasing words they said were from the Lord. Their words were designed to make God&#8217;s people comfortable in the face of impending judgment. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In fact, they were not satisfied to prophesy good times ahead from their great houses and ivory beds of ease &#8212; they sought to provide a pillow for every elbow (Ezekiel 13:18). &#8220;Woe to those who apply pillows unto all elbows&#8230;&#8221; (Original Hebrew by Spurrell) &#8220;&#8230;Behold, I am against your pillows wherewith ye entice souls&#8230;&#8221; (Ezekiel 13:20). <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Ezekiel was horrified at the sight of prophets who had developed an art of making God&#8217;s people comfortable. The Lord had said, &#8220;My people have set up idols in their hearts; they are brazenly setting up stumbling blocks in iniquity; they are all estranged from me because of their idols&#8221; (Ezekiel 14:1-5). <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The true word of the Lord was, &#8220;Jehovah says &#8212; eat your bread with trembling, and drink thy water with grieving and fainting &#8212; and say unto the people, her land shall be emptied of its fullness, because of the violence &#8212; cities will be laid waste, the land made desolate &#8212; there shall be no more vain visions or flattering prophecies&#8221; (Ezekiel 12:17-24). <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">While Ezekiel went about calling the people to humility and repentance, trying to prepare God&#8217;s people for the soon coming judgments, these pillow prophets went about prophesying the dreams and imaginations of their own hearts. God had not spoken to them, even though they prefaced their predictions with, &#8220;Hear the Word of the Lord.&#8221; God said, &#8220;I did not send them: they do not speak for Me. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">They carried with them fancy pillows to place under every elbow for all who flocked to hear their false prophecies. They placed handkerchiefs on the heads of every one of their disciples, a statement to others that meant, &#8220;Nothing but good times ahead. I see nothing ahead but peace and luxury.&#8221; They walked among the poor and sick, with a lace kerchief on the head, as a sign of their confidence in the message of the prophets of self-indulgence and comfort. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Ezekiel thundered the Word of God at them, as the masses congregated to hear their pleasant words. &#8220;You see for God&#8217;s people a vision of prosperity, when there is no prosperity, saith the Lord Jehovah&#8221; (Ezekiel 13:16, Spurrell). &#8220;You follow after your own imagination &#8211; when actually you have seen nothing.&#8221; (Ezekiel 13:3). <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The pillow prophets are still with us! They talk about the Word of God, about prophecy, and they salt their soothing messages with a lot of Scripture. But there is a falseness in what they preach. They are not preaching the Cross or holiness and separation. They make no demands on their followers. They seldom speak of sin and judgment. They abhor the very mention of suffering and pain. To them, the heroes of Hebrews were faithless cowards and penniless losers who were afraid to claim their rights. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Like the pillow prophets of Israel, their one supreme desire is to promote luxurious lifestyles and make people comfortable in their pursuit of the good life. They are not speaking for God. All they are doing is passing out pillows. One for every elbow of every follower. No wonder the crowds flock to sit under their message &#8212; it&#8217;s painless. There is not the call of Christ to deny self and take up a cross. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">What is the difference between pillow prophets and Jehovah&#8217;s true prophets? The preacher or parishioner who doesn&#8217;t know the difference is on dangerous ground. With so many going about gathering huge followings, it is imperative to have Holy Ghost discernment. The confused prophets must be exposed by truth. Most of them and sound like sincere, Bible loving men of God. But the Lord has given His people infallible tests to prove what is true and what is false. We are to test every man and every message &#8212; by the whole Word of God. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Let me bring to your attention three characteristics of a true prophet of God.

And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice. And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.&#8221; 1 Sam. 18:10-12 <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">It has been said &#8220;the pen is mightier than the sword.&#8221; However, few may know that Edward George Bulwer Lytton (1803-1873), an English novelist, wrote this for the first time in 1839. He wrote, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Beneath the rule of men entirely great, the pen is mightier than the sword.&#8221;<\/span> In the natural this doesn&#8217;t make sense, but there are great spiritual truths to be learned in principal. In the days of David, King Saul&#8217;s jealousy toward David grew to a place of attempted murder.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In the heat of battle I would much rather have a javelin than a harp. What can I do with a harp in battle? Perhaps with my musical ability I could play the harp in such a manner that my lack of talent would cause the enemy to cover their ears and retreat. A harp was a grounded instrument, a stable instrument, while a javelin in a weapon that one can carry around. This reminds me of that character of Saul and David. David was grounded in God, as the presence of God rested upon him. Saul was flighty and unstable; one never knew when Saul would &#8220;loose it&#8221; and snap. Saul lived by his emotions and his title as king. David lived by his godly character and His anointing to soon become the king. David was patient and obedient, while Saul was hurried and disobedient.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Now David had a harp in his hand while Saul had a javelin in his. With the harp David pleased God, drove evil spirits away from Saul and thus served the king. With the javelin Saul purposed to pin David to death upon the wall. David was growing in popularity as the people said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands<\/span>.&#8221; Although Saul had the title as king, he feared David greatly because the Lord was with David and had departed from Saul. The Apostle Paul penned the words<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, &#8220;&#8230;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221;<\/span> God was for David because David was righteous. He had a right standing before God. As a spiritual boxing match, God was in David&#8217;s corner, just as He was when David killed Goliath. David&#8217;s behaved very wisely and Saul behaved very fearfully. I imagine that Saul was quick skilled with the Javelin, but when he threw it at David, David dodged the weapon. Although Saul tried to kill David, David NEVER tried to retaliate in any way against Saul. In this day and age many pride themselves on subverting authority when one feels they are in the right. David had the Spirit of God, and therefore was defended by God. David teaches us many things.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">1.

Many are puzzled by this thing I will call a giant in the room. it has put fear in people. Those who could be trusted to kill it and get rid of it are sometimes left defeated and helpless to do something about it. Some appears to have succeeded in getting rid of it, only for it to come back sometimes more aggressive. They have tried to contain it, slow it down, cut it out, change the tactics in dealing with it but still. This giant in the room is none other than Cancer. A few months ago, I lost an aunt to it and my wife also lost an aunt too. The most prayer requests that come my way are cancer related requests. If I was to ask you, you will say you know at least one person battling this giant. As this a result of Adam\u2019s sin all human are plagued with diseases starting with sin.&nbsp; How do we respond and deal with this elephant in the room that has terrorized people?.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In the bible days, in my judgment, leprosy would be equivalent to cancer, not how it was perceived and dealt with but how it left people with little or no hope. There was no cure for it unless a miracle happened. Miracle for this kind of disease was very rare example of Moses&#8217; sister Miriam, Naaman the Syrian and several people Jesus healed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">One of them is of this man who we are not told of his name but his condition. After preaching the sermon on the mount, this man meets him at the bottom of the mountain. People with such diseases were not allowed around people. In fact this disease was associated with sin, therefore those who had it were to be isolated. Some lived on the mountains, tombs constantly chanting unclean. The only time they would be allowed back is when they were miraculously healed and only the priest could inspect and pronounce them clean.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">This man broke everything that was required of him as a leper just to meet Jesus. When he met him, he worshiped him, saying<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201cLord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.\u201d <\/span>With such humility and such confidence in the one who had the ability to make people clean. Mark that he does not use the word \u201cif you CAN\u201d. The \u201cCAN\u201d was settled in his heart. He echoed the prayer of <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Jeremiah 32:17, \u2018Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">There is nothing too hard for You<\/span><span style=\"color:black;\">\u201d. Whether He wills was his dilemma. With such great faith in Christ\u2019s ability, Jesus first touched him and spoke the words he was anxious to hear, He said, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I am willing; be cleansed.\u201d Immediately his leprosy was cleansed\u201d. <\/span>No one touched the lepers, but Jesus did and healed him \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: \u201cHe Himself took our infirmities And bore our sicknesses.\u201d Matthew 8:17<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Regardless of how great this giant is among others and has caused havoc in our families, the question whether God can touch and heal has been settled. What many are battling is whether He is willing. I believe that if it\u2019s going to bring Him more glory, to advance His kingdom, He will for there is nothing too difficult for Him. This man\u2019s healing was a big picture of Christ who has the ability to deal with the leprosy of sin plaguing us and only He the priest can cure and pronounce us clean. Whether He uses doctors, supernatural healings or not heal<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201cNow this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us\u201d 1John 5:14<\/span>. &nbsp;For He will get all the credit for how great He is. We have a part to play like this man, pray and pray and trust God to bring through those who are battling it. We help them make it by the mountain where they meet the One who identifies with our infirmities, the outcome is in His hands. May the Lord strengthen our faith to believe that He can and is willing if it\u2019s a means by which He will make His name great<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. 2 Corinthians 12: 9 \u201cAnd He said to me, \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.\u201d Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ\u2019s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong\u201d, <\/span>the giant in the room is but a shadow of greater things to come, it was defeated at Calvary.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span>Blessings Ev<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; Matthew 8:1, \u201cWhen He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. 2 And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, \u201cLord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.\u201d 3 Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d Immediately his [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2708","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-HG","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2708","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=2708"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2708\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2710,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2708\/revisions\/2710"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=2708"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=2708"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=2708"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":2711,"date":"2012-05-02T18:22:00","date_gmt":"2012-05-02T12:52:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=2711"},"modified":"2012-05-08T07:15:09","modified_gmt":"2012-05-08T01:45:09","slug":"when-you-cant-get-what-you-want-by-evans","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2012\/05\/02\/when-you-cant-get-what-you-want-by-evans\/","title":{"rendered":"When You Can&#8217;t Get What You want, by&nbsp;Evans"},"content":{"rendered":"<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Good morning,<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Genesis 39:16, \u201c So she kept his garment with her until his master came home. 17 Then she spoke to him with words like these, saying, &#8220;The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to mock me; 18 so it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.&#8221; 19 So it was, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, &#8220;Your servant did to me after this manner,&#8221; that his anger was aroused. 20 Then Joseph&#8217;s master took him and put him into the prison\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">One of the most frightening things in my opinion is the damage a tongue can do. James speaks extensively about the tongue, how deadly it is left unattended. Have you ever wondered why God gave us one mouth to speak and two ears to listen instead of the other way round? Yet we find that a lot of people are quick to speak and slow to listen; They jump to conclusions without facts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Joseph here finds himself in Potiphar&#8217;s house, he is serving well even his master can sense something different about him. Of all the servants he had, Joseph was unique; he sensed the Lord was with him. And whatever Joseph did in Potiphar\u2019s house, God blessed it. Then here comes Potiphar&#8217;s wife who eyes this young man, wanting something from him, his innocence, and his purity before the Lord. And when she could not get what she wanted, Joseph vowed to be pure before God, she takes something from him to accuse him of something bigger, attempted rape. Now that is a serious accusation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">When you don&#8217;t get what you want, how do you deal with it? When I was a teenager, I liked this girl and wanted to go out with her. She seemed to hang out with this other guy more. Instead of accepting the reality of things, I began to slander their names, making other people believe what I said about them I knew to be untrue. What a damage I made I regret till today. That is something that happens even today, it&#8217;s easy to slander, lie about someone, tarnish their names because they have something you want but you can&#8217;t have. Instead of accepting things the way they are, you turn to frustrate them, lie about them, find people to convince to side with you against such a person. That is what Potiphar&#8217;s wife did, because she could not accept the fact that she could not have what she wanted, she purposed in her heart to destroy Joseph by lying about his intentions. She knew that if she could not destroy his purity, her tongue would be sufficient to destroy his reputation. After all, who were they going to believe?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">There are certain people if someone told you that they did this and that, you would probably not believe them because you know the character of that person. That may not mean they could never do what they are accused of, their nature, their lifestyle would suggest otherwise. Then there are those whom if you are told&nbsp; of what they did, you would be prompt to say something like this, &#8220;I would not be surprised if they did such and such a thing&#8221;. Well in Joseph&#8217;s case, he is accused of attempted rape, his master is not even stopping to say or even think , &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t sound like Joseph&#8221; so as to find facts and truths to turn upon. The other servants seem to be quiet and it doesn&#8217;t seem he&#8217;s been given a chance to defend himself. The wife was the bigger influence on the verdict. God who had blessed him and been with him seemed silent when he needed him the most yet knows the whole truth. Who will stand with Joseph? His name is tarnished, he has lost his job, he is going to jail, he is further away from his dream because of false accusation and it&#8217;s all because of the tongue that would not accept that she could not have what she wanted and therefore turned to destroy another life. The bible says in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 12:22, &#8220;Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, But those who deal truthfully are His delight&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Are you being driven right now to destroy another person&#8217;s life through lies because you are unable to get what you want and if you can&#8217;t get, then you feel it&#8217;s not fair for the other person to have it, be blessed, or prosper while you are miserable? Are you getting people to rally behind you to accept what you say about someone without sharing the true facts or having them do the same<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">?

I do struggle to get the word inside, meditating on it and memorizing it but I know that the more I do what I struggle with, the more I can see my way clearly because getting hold of the word means getting hold of the One who knows the way. People who do not know and are unsure of the way tend to go in circles wasting time and getting lost again and again, finding themselves in wrong places. They are not progressing and growing because they are stuck in the same place. When we are confident of who is leading the way, though we may go through the valleys of the shadow of death, we will not fear evil for He knows the way and we are following.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">How much of the word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path?. Are we reading the word without fail, let me go a step forward, are we STUDYING the word or are we waiting for Sunday morning for the word to be preached? Are we memorizing the word and applying them in our lives? Are we checking the words we hear from preaching, teachings and devotions to prove they are preached, written and are applied correctly? Even in my weakness I desire to know the word and the God of the word.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Psalm 86:11 &#8220;Teach me your ways oh Lord and I will walk in your truth, unite my heart to fear our name&#8221;, Psalm 25:4&amp;5, &#8220;show me your ways O Lord, teach me your paths.

He who says, \u201dI know Him,\u201d and does not keep His commandments, is a liar and the truth is not in him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">It never ceases to amaze me when I read the first epistle of John, and the strength with which he writes. He portrays the truth so clearly, with such distinct definition and emphasis. He was a preacher of righteousness, a messenger of holiness. He is known as the apostle of love, yet his words cut quickly to the depths of the heart, revealing the true state of our soul. He writes with a love that is largely unknown in our day. He loved those around him as Jesus had loved them as well, he loved them enough to share the truth with them, no matter what it cost him. John was a faithful man, he loved God above all, and he proclaimed boldly the true way that a Christian was to walk. He was unwilling to let any live in the deception of false religion. In these two verses he gives us truth worth looking at, worth examining our lives by, searching our hearts, testing ourselves as Paul encouraged, to be sure we are in the faith. To be sure that our profession is true, that our life backs up what we claim to be. Jesus says if we love Him, we are to keep His commandments. To disobey Him is to not love Him, John here says that if we do not obey Him, we don\u2019t know Him. He goes further to call that person a liar, very plainly, they are deceived in their thinking. To say we believe, but not to follow and obey, is false. The whole meaning of the word believe speaks of someone who as a result of this belief, has given their life wholly to God, and follows after Him in obedience. How someone can call themselves a Christian, yet have no time to read the word or pray is beyond me. How we can disobey God by drinking, smoking, cursing, watching inappropriate shows and films, living together out of wedlock, and so much more, yet claiming to be Christians utterly breaks the heart of God, and John says this individual is a liar. Friends, we must wake up, we must hear the truth, turn from our ways, repent of our sins, giving ourselves completely to the Lord. We must follow Him in obedience out of love for Him, our Great Redeemer. If we will see God move in this generation, it begins with us. Cleansing the temple, that the Lord may come and reign within our hearts. So much falsehood abounds today. But hear the faithful words of John, sit down and read this epistle. I can remember reading these words, and having my heart pierced, knowing I was not who I claimed to be, and God in His mercy called me from that place of darkness and self-centered living. My wife and I were talking tonight about <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">II Chronicles 7:!4. God says \u2018IF\u201d, if we will humble ourselves and pray, but more than that, if we will turn from our wicked ways, then God WILL hear from Heaven, forgive us, and heal our land. God WILL, the only IF is on us. IF we will turn and live (Ezekiel 18:30-32), God will restore us. <\/span>But the question always remains, will<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;<\/span>we? Will we have our sin and the world, or will we have God? It has to be one or the other, there cannot be both, no matter what anyone says. Read John\u2019s words again, how that cuts away anything else, that brings it right to the heart. And he echoes the words of Jesus Himself throughout the gospels, so many IF statements, IF we abide, IF we love Him, IF anyone enters, IF you keep etc. I know these things challenge my heart, for I love God and I desire to be with Him, to see His wonderful face. And from this love I obey Him, there is no pleasure, nothing of this life that is worth is. May God richly bless each one that would seek for Him with all their heart.&nbsp;In the love of Jesus, the soon and coming King, Brother Benjamen<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; I John 2: 3-4- Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.

Jesus goes to Bethany and while in route, Lazarus dies. This death so moved Jesus that He cried. God then manifested His ultimate power by restoring Lazarus to life. Through this awesome miracle, many people came to believe in Jesus.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">God&#8217;s overall intent for humanity is to have life and to enjoy it. When considering the abundance of natural and spiritual gifts He has bestowed upon us to achieve this end, we can do nothing but marvel in the excellence of His work as our hearts are filled with such transcendent joy that we can barely comprehend the full heights of His splendor. Everything God does, has done, and will do involves the furtherance of His desire that we have, enjoy, and preserve life. I want you to consider this point. Think about the commandments of God. The only things that God has forbidden are those things that will cut our lives short! Think about it. I challenge you to name a single thing that God has forbidden that does humanity any good. God only wants us to walk in the beauty of creation experiencing life without insulting His majesty by reducing our dignity through base living.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The chief priests who represented the established church of the day harassed the Lord at every opportunity despite overwhelming evidence signaling His Identity. We are not told why Lazarus was sick, but it was clear that even the last effect of sin and the ultimate condition of man was eclipsed by the love of God, which brought life. The established church witnessed God&#8217;s great work and shortly decided that they would KILL Lazarus.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Imagine that. The Lord Jesus raises a man from the dead and because the chief priests were so fixated on limiting Jesus&#8217; actions and preventing Him from expelling the death that resulted from the law that the chief priests decided to assassinate Jesus and flat-out MURDER Lazarus. They wanted to kill Life itself- the Source of Life, and all things that Life impacted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Much can be said about all of this. I want us to remember that the mission of Christ&#8217;s church is to champion life and remember to value people over systems, rules, laws, and religions- all of which create and maintain death. Beloved, our agenda in this society encompasses more and is broader than our struggle against abortion. Jesus has the ability to remedy every irritant that impacts humanity and is presently restoring life and setting at liberty every thing that encounters His Presence and embraces His Word. Whenever people were in danger, Jesus did not miss a single opportunity to suspend the mechanism that empowered death in order to allow life to prevail. Let us go into the world with the same mission. Our message? Receiving the gospel brings spiritual life and obeying the gospel causes natural life to take on new dimensions that will ultimately bring about the fulfillment that we all seek, as our will is conformed to His!

When you know the restoration to your life depends on an extraordinary thing, you will not care about what people say or think. A woman with the issue of blood is in a situation where she has spent everything to fix her condition for 12years She has spent money, visited worthless physicians with no improvement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Her condition has robbed her of freedom, relationships, comfort, joy, peace and even money but she is determined to get well. At times you just need assurance that there is still hope in the midst of hopelessness and knowing that whatever is impossible with man is possible with God. She gets to hear about many things Jesus had done and she perceives in herself that her health will only come back through Jesus Christ. She is ashamed of herself and her condition that all she can say is that, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8221; if I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole&#8230;&#8221;<\/span>. Her faith is so much boosted to the extent that she knows that if just His name is a strong tower, then even power would flow through what He is wearing. I see her telling herself how she doesn&#8217;t even have to talk to Him or get noticed after all no one wants her around or be around her anyway.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In my life I have seen areas that I really needed to touch the hem of His garment because I knew what I was going through and not everyone would understand my situation. A desperation propelled me find Jesus and touch His garment. I believe that many times you will not have someone to help you find Him but yourself and you have to be strong enough to encourage yourself. &#8220;It shall be well&#8221; ought to be your attitude. She encouraged herself in the midst of hell and her encouragement helped her make the first move. Crawling under people trying to find her way to Jesus was her move. We don&#8217;t hear her telling people how she is too sick and she needs special help to reach to the Master, she decides to find her own way. When there is no one to carry you to the Master, calm and encourage yourself, crawl if need be, push the obstacles aside and make it to the Master.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Something amazing is that everyone had been walking with Jesus and I bet there was no distance between Jesus and those that walked with Him. With that in mind, at least people touched Him whether they wanted to or not and Jesus never questioned them, but when this woman touched Him, He felt power leave Him and He stopped, looked around and asked, &#8220;WHO TOUCHED ME?&#8221;. Isn&#8217;t it funny that many people can walk around the Lord and even touch Him but there is no great impact but for someone who has an extraordinary faith who needs something encourages herself just to touch His clothes and be made whole? When I have a desperate situation and I execute a desperate measure, I know that when I touch Him, He will stop and turn around to find me. Make prayers that causes heaven to be in motion and hell to be in chaos.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">All of sudden all attention is on a woman of faith. She was not even supposed to be there, she wasn&#8217;t even looking for attention to make the matters even more interesting, she wasn&#8217;t even expecting Jesus to look around and be concerned about her life but there she was. She has just touched His garments, she is made whole according to her faith and now the process is about to end. When she confesses that she is the one who touched Him, He turns around and says, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Daughter, your faith has made you well, go in peace and be healed of your affliction<\/span>&#8220;. Can you imagine being called son or daughter when you were hopeless at one point? His love goes beyond our afflictions and He does care about what we go through. If He was able to pause for a second when He was on a journey and attend to this hopeless lady, don&#8217;t you think He will do the same for you? One last thing, if she touched His garment and got healed, why would Jesus tell her again to be healed? This was to let her know that it wasn&#8217;t a temporary healing but eternal, her sins were forgiven and complete restoration of all things were called back to her life (money, relationships, peace, joy etc). Dig your way through today and touch His garments.

Genesis<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> 31: 24 \u201cThen God came to Laban , the Aramaean, in a dream at night and said to him \u201cBE CAREFUL not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad\u201d<\/span> We can imagine ourselves in this situation \u2013very tensed , but God Himself intervening and warning our enemy, How marvelous it is. Yes, if we recede from fighting but allow God to do the same for us, we can see God planning and moving greatly \u2026 Usually, though we all know the verse well that the battle is the Lord\u2019s , we take turn and try to fight it out ..But the plan may not be right and so is the timing and the approach. It may not even suit the situation correctly \u2026 If we rely on God to fight for us, we can see the results \u2026Since Laban was warned he did not dare to do any harm to Jacob , though he was very angry .Laban mentions to Jacob in<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Gen 31:29 \u201cI have the power to harm you<\/span>\u201d. Yes, though he had power and was heading to harm him, God fought the battle and finally safeguarded Jacob and everything he had\u2026.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SETTLEMENT<\/span>&#8211; We see Mary ,who was only a virgin and betrothed to Joseph, to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Joseph was shocked to hear about this, since they had not yet come together. Since he was a righteous man, he did not want to expose her to public disgrace. So he had in mind to divorce her quietly . ..But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name \u2018Jesus\u2019 because he will save his people from their sins<\/span>\u201d Mathew 1 : 19 So he took home Mary as his wife .We can imagine the situation of Mary. She never requested someone to pacify Joseph or convince him or speak to him herself and what not. There were so many ways for Mary for fighting the life\u2019s real battle\u2026She completely depended on the Almighty for every minute details happening in her life \u2026. God was mindful of the humble state of his servant and set right ,this marriage, rather home &#8230;Yes, God is capable of settling our lives, no matter how many fears \/doubts arise. If we trust the Lord for our battle, we can be rest assured<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">TESTIMONY<\/span>-Another instance where God speaks to the wife of a person in authority&#8230;&#8230;.. Pilate was seated a judge and when he was about to pronounce judgment on Jesus, his wife sent for him this message<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201cDo not have anything to do with that INNOCENT man for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him \u201c.<\/span>Yes , when Jesus was facing opposition from all sides \u2013all the people in the area were shouting against Jesus, but this testimony gave comfort to our Lord\u2026May be if any other person would have conveyed this message, he would not have considered. But it was his dear wife. So God gave him an opportunity to realize the greatness of Jesus before he could decide whether to release Jesus or Barabbas<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">GUIDANCE<\/span>-Peter saw heaven opened ,while he fell into a trance, and also saw something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. It contained all kinds of four footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. Then God corrected Peter in his thoughts saying \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Do not call anything impure that God has made clean<\/span>\u201d Yes, he was guided to go to Cornelius, where he along with his friends and relatives assembled. The Holy Spirit had been poured out on all of them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">A dream may look simple but God can use it to convey his message. Even when the king himself forgot the dream he had, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Yes, the God had used a dream as a means to warn Laban while heading to harm Jacob and to reconcile them, to show Joseph the factual situation and build the home, which was going to be shattered, to inform Pilate that Jesus was Lord and totally innocent\/blameless\/pure, to correct Peter so that he should go to the Gentiles to preach the goodness, to exalt Daniel before the king and his entire kingdom.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">So we need worry for any situation because He can warn our enemies in face of danger and safeguard us, he can fabricate \/put together broken homes, he can prove a person innocent, when the entire world is against the same and he can also correct us so that we may be used for His higher purposes.

You hear him ask brethren to pray for him, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1Thessalonians 5:25, 2Thessalonians 3:1<\/span> etc. Every time he wrote, he always mentioned that he was praying for those he wrote to. We see in his life God\u2019s sovereignty and his human responsibility response.

You don\u2019t need to pray, you don\u2019t need to even belong, invoke the name of Jesus and all will happen. It\u2019s even said in our time, salvation is as easy as ABC while the bible says it\u2019s hard, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Luke 13:24, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Strive<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> to enter through the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">narrow gate<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, for many, I say to you<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">, will seek to enter<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">will not be able\u201d<\/span>. And while this is hard, here we find some Jewish exorcist, people who claimed to have a means to drive out evil spirits took upon the name of Jesus as a means to get what they wanted especially to build a name for themselves. It was not about Christ and His glory but about themselves. The name to them was a magic gene you rub to get what you want. They may have known some truth (light) intellectually, but they had no heat, they did not belong.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Vs. 14&nbsp;Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so. 15&nbsp;And the evil spirit answered and said, \u201cJesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span>How else can we believe Paul was a praying man? By what happened to the sons of Sceva. Seven of them tried to expel an evil spirit from a man through the name of Jesus Paul preached. The evil spirit\u2019s response<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201cJesus I know and Paul I know; but who are you?\u201d<\/span> The evil spirits know praying people, the devil is known as the prince of air (Ephesians 2:2). He knows those who are intercede,&nbsp; he knew Daniel as a man of prayer that when he prayed, he tried to stop his answer from coming back to him and Michael battled him (Daniel 10). We also see this in the life of Job, you read about Job praying for his family and then you hear Satan accusing him (Job 1).&nbsp; The disciples went out in Jesus power in Mark 6 and cast out demons, healed the sick and preached the gospel, less than a year later, 9 disciples left behind as Jesus went up the mountain to pray (Luke 9) could not cast out evil spirits from 1 child. Jesus said to them later, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mark 9:29, \u201cThis kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Satan and his demons know those who pray and those who don\u2019t. if we invoke the name and are not a praying people, none of these moves him. Those who are a threat to him and his kingdom are those who are \u201cconstantly submitting to God in prayer and resisting him through the power given to them to overcome\u201d. If you have power cables but not connected to the power, the cables are no good. If we are engaged in everything but not praying, we have demonstrated that we don\u2019t honor God because by prayer do we demonstrate our dependence on Him. \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Prayer is the greatest of all forces, it honors God and brings Him into active aid<\/span>\u201d, E.M. Bounds \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The one concern of the devil is to keep Christians from praying.&nbsp; He fears nothing from prayerless studies, prayerless work and prayerless religion.

By that I mean going back to sound biblical teaching. That the current fads in the land are not moving them, in fact they are refuting those who contradict the word of God including big names. I have listened to radio programs, read blogs, listened to sound teachings and I am amazed at the depth of knowledge. And while this is good and most necessary, I am concerned that little is wrote, mentioned or encouraged about praying. The danger I foresee in my judgment is becoming a generation that has light (the word) but no heat (prayer) and you cannot separate the two. You cannot separate heat and light from the fire.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The Lord speaking to the church of Ephesus in Revelation 2 talks about great things about this church. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Revelation 2: 1<\/span>, \u201cTo the angel of the church of Ephesus write, \u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2 \u201cI know your works, your labor, your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil.

From what we read, they spoke about truth, preached it, even defended, what they were lacking was love. The first love here I would speculate to be loving God, communing with Him, praying to Him among other things. They lost the foundation on which everything else was built upon. Something known about the ministry of Christ here on earth was His prayer life. When the house was turned into everything but a house of prayer, we are told the zeal of His house consumed Him to do something about it. His service did not cloud His communion with the Father. If anything, He would often withdraw from the crowd to be alone with the Father. The rest were result of that time. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">This church may have loved doing God\u2019s work but without God\u2019s spirit revealed and empowered as we pray. In Acts 19, Paul is in Ephesus where this church mentioned in Revelation. Vs. 11 then says, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Now God worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul, 12&nbsp;so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them\u201d. <\/span>Paul had all the things mentioned about the church in Ephesus, however he had more than that. He had the love for Christ to seek Him, in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2 Corinthians 5:14<\/span> he says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c&nbsp;For the love of Christ compels us\u2026\u201d.&nbsp; <\/span>He constantly died to himself and made Christ the object of his faith, the one whom he sought even concerning his ministry. On the day of his conversion we see him right away becoming a man of prayer. God sent Ananias to go Paul (Saul) in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Acts 9:11<\/span>, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">one<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> called Saul of Tarsus, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">for behold, he is praying<\/span>\u201d .The miracles were the outworking of the internal.

Hebrew custom establishes the idea that Jewish parents name their children based on certain characteristics. Barabbas means \u201cson of the fathers\u201d; that is, \u201cBar\u201d means son and \u201cabbas\u201d means fathers. Growing up, I bet Barabbas thought he was something special. He was the hope of Jewish history (son of the fathers). His name suggests that the Jewish nation had a lot riding on his shoulders (son of the fathers). Barabbas was the product of the long line of Jewish wise men and sages (son of the fathers). He embodied and represented them. Little is known about his parents other than that they were political figures and did not raise him themselves. It is said that Barabbas was raised by the community- being groomed for a purpose. He was not raised with a lot of discipline.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Historically, Barabbas came on the scene during the interim between the old and new testaments. At that time, the Jewish people were subject to Roman power. Some said that Barabbas was a \u2018robin hood\u2019 character. He was hot-headed, quick tempered, and had little difficulty using violence to accomplish his goals. To him, the end justified the means and he didn\u2019t mind doing whatever he wanted, whenever, or by whatever means necessary. This lifestyle got Barabbas on Rome\u2019s top ten list of wanted men. He had led a revolt in which several Roman soldiers were killed. He had stolen from the roman and Jewish treasuries. He was known for ambushing people and taking their belongings to finance the initiatives of his motley crew. And, interestingly, we find him (the son of the fathers) in Roman custody when he is first mentioned in the gospels.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Romans kept their notorious criminals in a jail that was located in the garrison of soldiers. This jail would be equivalent of the maximum-security prisons of today. This jail was about a half mile from the governor\u2019s palace and tribunal. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">The story opens with the Roman governor judging the case of Jesus. And, the governor gives the people a choice of choosing Jesus, the Son of God, or, Barabbas, the son of the fathers. Jesus was divine, Barabbas was not. Jesus was Son to God the Father and heir to heaven, Barabbas was son of human people and heir to a collapsed history and dejected people. Jesus represented choosing the divine while Barabbas represented choosing the least admirable qualities in us all. Truly, there was no comparison and the obvious choice of the people should have been to choose Jesus. Instead, the Jewish people chose Barabbas; the lesser figure, the substitute, the crook, the man.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">But, this is not where I want us to contemplate. Let\u2019s contemplate the story as it unfolds from the viewpoint of Barabbas. He was locked up about a half mile from where Jesus was at. From where he was located, Barabbas could hear the words of the crowd as they shout their responses in unison.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Imagine living close enough to Yankee Stadium whereby you could hear the chants of the crowd.&nbsp; While you don\u2019t hear the umpires, yet you can easily hear the crowd shouting \u201clet\u2019s go Yankees\u201d or \u201cde-fense\u201d. You can predict what are going on because you can hear the crowds\u2019 woes, boo\u2019s, chants, and their cheering.&nbsp; Now leave Yankee stadium, if you will, on this Resurrection Sunday, and go with me to the jail cell of one, Barabbas.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">So, here\u2019s Barabbas- locked up in jail. Now, remember, he could hear the crowds shouting in unison &#8211; but he couldn\u2019t hear the governor. He hears the crowds scream:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not this man, but Barabbas<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crucify him, crucify him<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar\u2019s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Away with him, away with him, crucify him<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His blood be on us, and on our children.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Can you imagine what was going on in the mind of Barabbas? He had been in custody for a long time. He had not seen the face of another common person nor had he had a visitor in years, besides a Roman soldier.&nbsp; By this time, he was accustom to seeing the routine faces of the roman guards. No doubt he thought that the people had betrayed him- after all, he did all of his bad deeds FOR them, right? How dare they turn on him like this? He just heard the death sentence be pronounced on him.&nbsp; This may sound all too familiar, but the crowd that perhaps once supported him was not turning on Barabbas, the son of the fathers, but on Jesus, the Son of God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Now, imagine the dread and the fear that seized his soul. Imagine what the other prisoners thought or said to their \u201cchampion\u201d as they heard the sentence. No doubt a reverent, dreadful silence fell over the place. I imagine that there was a long wait. And then, they heard the footsteps and the keys clinging in the distance- getting closer and louder. They heard the guards returning for Barabbas. For all intents and purposes, they all, including Barabbas, thought Barabbas was going to be summarily executed. But, something happens when the doors are opened to his cell, and the instruments of death tell him that he was free to go. Imagine the fear- yet excitement he felt as the chains and the instruments of his captivity and imprisonment were removed. Then, imagine the solemnity that gripped him when he was told or came to realize that Jesus took his place!<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Application:&nbsp; This is the week of Christ\u2019s passion. As we reflect on these events, let\u2019s consider how many times we chose Barabbas over Jesus in our lives.&nbsp; Let us not forget the significance of the story. In Barabbas\u2019s mind- he was as good as dead. He heard the death sentence. But, Christ took his place. It is entirely possible that Barabbas went on to live a holy life after that. Perhaps, he realized the true meaning of the exchange and sacrifice that Christ made on HIS behalf- and it was enough to turn him around and truly live a life that was worth his dying for.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">You may be Barabbas today locked up in the jail cell of your sins.&nbsp; Perhaps you will have diner today, with Barabbas, one that is chained to their own sins.&nbsp; Will you be like the Roman guard that released Barabbas?&nbsp; How you ask.&nbsp; Simple, show a person, a family member,&nbsp; a loved one a friend, a neighbor, your mother, your father, your children, that they have violated God\u2019s Holy Law, His 10 Commandments, and therefore are on death row, deserving of God\u2019s capital punishment, eternity in hell, because they are in bondage to their sins.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">This sounds harsh.&nbsp; Does it?&nbsp; Does it not sound harsher, perhaps evil, to let one you say you say you love, die in their sin.&nbsp; We love getting together with family, but that is not what Easter, Resurrection Day is all about.&nbsp; It\u2019s always been about Jesus, his death, his burial, and most importantly HIS RESURRECTION!&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Tell your loved one, AFTER YOU HAVE HELPED THEM TO SEE THEIR SIN AND THEIR BONDAGE that Jesus died in their place to set them free.&nbsp; Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if today, there were those that repented and put their trust in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; What are you waiting for, you may or may not have tomorrow and the following days to live.&nbsp; If you have not repented, and put your trust in Christ, today is the day.&nbsp; If you have not been a true and faithful witness then when you sit with your family, talk in a side room, be faithful to your Lord.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">When you hear give us Barabbas, think, give us, Michael, Andrea, Anthony, my dad, my mom, my children because you desire them to be released but the Son of God, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">May God richly bless you as you obey,<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil, and David <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; Due to computer issues among other things this week, I have not been able to deliver devotions.

O woman, great is thy faith! He that gave life would not disappoint The sorrowful mother begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet at once. There was a drive, a passion, a burden for her once upon a time living child. Her faith perhaps was driven by the testimony of how Elijah raised the widow of Zarephath&#8217;s son (1Kings 17) who was laid on his bed, of which she may have heard. The Zarephath\u2019s son was raised in Elijah\u2019s room and since the spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha, she had faith to believe that a miracle that happened before could happen to her too. So she took the boy put him in Elisha\u2019s room and journeyed to find him while concealing his death from her husband and family, and to prevent grief, and that they might not bury him until she returned. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">She had faith and that faith was demonstrated in her action. Those who would convey spiritual life to dead souls must feel deeply for their case, and labor fervently in prayer for them especially for their&nbsp; children. Though parents, ministers cannot give Divine life to children, they must use every means, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">with as much earnestness as if they could do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Nothing was going to stop her or slow her down. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 25 And so she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cLook, the Shunammite woman! 26 Please run now to meet her, and say to her, \u2018Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?\u2019\u201d And she answered, \u201cIt is well.\u201d<\/span> It was well that she had found the man of God; and it is well with us when we have found Him who is able to raise our children when we seek Him on their behalf. It is not well only when the miracle happens, it is well when we have done our part. God will do for us what He has done for others, however we have to find what others have done like this woman and engage in that because it builds our faith to believe God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Despite Elisha sending his servant with his stuff, nothing could change the situation until Elisha came. I love something about this woman, persistence, she says, vs. 30 <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cAs surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.\u201d So he got up and followed her\u201d. <\/span>We must continue laboring in prayer persistently until the Lord shows up in the impossible situation. Many have given up and now have a shovel in the hands preparing for the burial of their prodigals. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">If you believe in resurrection the last thing you would want is prepare for burial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The rest of the story tells us how Elisha came and raised the boy because of a mother\u2019s faith and persistence. Imagine what would have happened if she did not seek resurrection for her son? She and her family would have buried the boy. Don\u2019t bury the dead yet, why, \u201cBy this faith <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">women received their dead raised to life,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Hebrews 11:35.<\/span> Faith in God activated through prayer does not prepare for funeral but for resurrection.

We may love the story and the outcome, but would we want the process like she did? We all love results, the question is, would we want to endure the process? I am the first to admit that I hate processes but I sure love the outcome.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">If you know this story, you recall she had a child out of a promise from Elisha due to the kindness she showed Elisha and his servant<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.&nbsp; <\/span>Then something happened<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Vs. 18 \u201c And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. 19 And he said to his father, \u201cMy head, my head!\u201d<\/span>.&nbsp; Everything looked ok from the time he was a baby until now. Even though we are not told of his age, I would speculate that he was a teenager for it appears to be old enough to go to the field with his father to the reapers.&nbsp; He is also old enough to say what is troubling him.&nbsp; On this day, he cried my head and his father had one of his servants do something, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u2026So he said to a servant, \u201cCarry him to his mother.\u201d&nbsp; <\/span>From the past experience maybe the husband knew his wife well enough to know what to do. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 20, \u201c When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died\u201d. <\/span>Out of her great affection, she took him on her knees, and laid his head in her bosom to sooth the pain, and in this posture he continued until the middle of the day before he passed. All the mother&#8217;s tenderness could not keep alive a child of promise. I think this is where many parents especially the mothers are. The children they hoped for, labored to show love and tender care, battled and provided for all of a sudden is (are)&nbsp; dead (spiritually) on her lap and she does not know what to do. She hoped someone would give her answers, however she discovers she is left to figure things out. If anything, they have always expected her to have answers. She is the one considered the woman of faith.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">From this story and many others in the bible, there is something about a mother\u2019s love that is unique.&nbsp; Being a mother is a very important role that the Lord chooses to give to many women. A Christian mother is told to love her children (<a href=\"http:\/\/ebible.com\/query?utf=8%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Titus%202%3A4-5&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=http:\/\/www.gotquestions.org\/eBible.html\">Titus 2:4-5<\/a>), in part so that she does not bring reproach on the Lord and on the Savior whose name she bears. Mothers have a unique and crucial role in the lives of their children because of their intuition, strength, persistence etc. Many times you hear about a persistent praying mother or praying grandmother. We will see these qualities in the Shunammite woman in our next devotional.

In other words, it\u2019s in the gospel where the righteousness of God is revealed, the more it\u2019s revealed the more it truly reveals who we are Isaiah 6. How do we define righteousness? Being made in right standing order with one who is wronged Or The character or quality of being right or just. In contrast to Holiness, holiness is to set apart, uncommon.

It is not found solely in intellectual understanding, nor in rapturous displays of emotion. These examples can all be faked, many of these are displayed in the most wicked of lives. Just look at the Pharisees. True religion, at its core, is what Paul speaks of here, the life of God in the soul of man. It is a union of the soul with God, a rejoining of the life to Christ through repentance and faith in the cross. Colossians 1:27 says that Christ \u2018in\u2019 us is the hope of glory. It is not our works, or words, but the reality of the presence of Jesus Christ within us. It is His holy life, His nature imparted within me. This cannot be faked, you either have it or you don\u2019t. In Romans 8:16, Paul teaches us about the witness of the Holy Spirit, which this joining produces. It is the testimony of a clear conscience before God, and of an upright life. It is an inner life of holiness displayed outwardly as it defines everything we do. Simply, look at what you did last night. Did you spend your time in careful study of scripture, prayer, or Christ centered discussion? Or In front of the T.V., watching some godless program? Now one might say this is too much, but look at what else Paul says in regards to this life within us, earlier on in Romans 8, v. 5-8. He says that those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, in v. 6 he says to be carnally minded (which is to have the mind of the flesh) is death, and in v. 7 and 8 he closes this thought stating that this mind is in warfare with God, and that the individual in this state cannot please God. No acts of devotion, no outward works matter here, for those in the flesh cannot please God. We must be joined to Him, as Peter says, being made a partaker of the Divine Nature. The life of Christ in me produces this nature, and God\u2019s nature is holiness, not worldliness. An inner, vital spiritual union with God is the goal of the Christian, counting all as loss to attain this. I must come to the end of myself, and surrender my all to Christ. Jesus cannot merely be a part of my life, He must be my life. And I willingly forsake all else that is not of Him. All sin, all self, anything, I cast it away lest it stop me from entering His blessed presence. More than that, I cast it away, for I love God with all my heart, I love Him more than myself, and so I willingly do those things that are pleasing to Him. The true, born again experience produces this life. I cease to exist, only Christ lives. Friends, nothing in this life compares to the majesty of knowing God, and all those who have truly experienced God know this. If you lack this true experience, then seek God until He pours Himself into your life. Cast all else away, knowing God is the greatest.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In the love of Christ, and all for His glory, Brother Benjamen<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, I Corinthians 6:17- But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.

The struggles comes when people are pushing you out of God\u2019s will because they want you please them whatever the cost or you are punishing them because of their struggles. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In this chapter, as always, the Israelites complained about lack of water.

And the glory of the Lord appeared to them\u201d. <\/span>He and Aaron went before the Lord to intercede for them and vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">7, \u201cThen the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 8&nbsp;\u201cTake the rod; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will yield its water; thus you shall bring water for them out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their animals.\u201d 9&nbsp;So Moses took the rod from before the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Lord<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> as He commanded him\u201d.<\/span> God graciously hears their cry and promises to provide with simple instructions, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">speak to the rock<\/span>\u2026\u201d and more than that \u201c\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">before their eyes<\/span>\u201d.

Must we bring water for you out of this rock?\u201d. <\/span>Even in the midst of complaints by the Israelites, God always did great things not because the Israelites were awesome but because God was awesome. Just as He did to demonstrate His power and glory unto Pharaoh.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was destined to do the same with the Israelites through Moses, however <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Moses was so disgusted with people that he forgot that the miracle was not about the people but about God<\/span>.

Just because something works does not mean that is how God intended it for it work. God will still do something things for His own name sake but you will be out of His will . Moses had clear instructions, he failed to execute it blowing his chances of making it to the promised land even though he had come this far with the Israelites.

In order to suppress the witness of the ordered structure of the universe, and the innate testimony of the conscience, fallen men had to develop a reasoning process of imagination. This reasoning is described by God as vain because the whole structure of man-made philosophy is devoid of divine truth and therefore invalid. Thus, by suppressing the truth of God and believing their man-made falsehood, they plunged their foolish heart deeper into darkness. When they exalted their human reasoning and paraded their wisdom before their peers, they acted as fools. The foolish heart is not one deficient in intelligence but one deficient in the moral understanding of who God is\u201d, <\/span>John McArthur.

And the gospel addressed in Romans 1:16-18 makes no sense until you have addressed Romans 1:19 to chapter 3 which unveils the problem with man.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;text-decoration:underline;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 1:21-23, \u201c21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify (honor) Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile (vain) in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man\u2014and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span>There are four crucial things addressed in this verse, 1. Although men realize God\u2019s existence, they do not glorify Him as God (v. 21);&nbsp; 2. Men are universally guilty of ingratitude to God, (lack of thanksgiving) (v. 21); 3.&nbsp; In the process of time men become increasingly \u201cfutile\u201d (\u201cempty\u201d or \u201cvain\u201d) in their imaginations, darkening their minds (v. 21).&nbsp; 4. Finally, the process climaxes in a tendency to distort the concept of God and of His creation (v. 23). From this develops IDOLATRY (v. 23) and distortion, even of the biological designs of the eternal God (1:24\u201327).<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The violation of these four opens doors to all kind of sins mentioned in vs. 24-32 where God let\u2019s man have his way and that is tragedy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cThey did not glorify him as God<\/span>\u2026\u201d, Glory according to Nelson\u2019s new illustrated bible dictionary is beauty, power, or honor; a quality of God\u2019s character that emphasizes His greatness and authority. The word is used in three senses in the Bible: 1. God\u2019s moral beauty and perfection of character. 2. God\u2019s moral beauty and perfection as a visible presence. 3. Praise offered to God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">1.

What a lesson in Christian running technique we have in that little preposition \u201coff, away from,\u201d which is prefixed to this verb. The minute the Greek runner in the stadium takes his attention away from the race course and the goal to which he is speeding, and turns it upon the on looking crowds, his speed is slackened. It is so with the Christian. The minute he takes his eyes off of the Lord Jesus, and turns them upon others, his pace in the Christian life is slackened, and his onward progress in grace hindered.

He has written His laws in our hearts, our conscious bearing witness Hebrews 8:10. Go to any of the most primitive regions and encounter with those who have never heard of Jesus or the bible or even learned believe there is a creator, a being powerful to make things. This is because God has given all men conscience (sense of awareness), <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 2: 14, \u201c&nbsp;for when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do the things in the law, these, although not having the law, are a law to themselves, 15&nbsp;who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them)\u201d. , <\/span>Everyone has the gift of conscience when they come into the world, (Being aware).

We ought to be reminded that God&#8217;s work must be done by God&#8217;s Spirit; and God\u2019s Spirit is not in active operation unless the prayer power is activated. It is not if you are doing God&#8217;s work but how you are God\u2019s work, by what means you are doing it. The means will determine if it is by secular spirit or sacred spirit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The tragedy of our time is that we have become too busy working for the Lord that we have neglected spending time with the Lord.

Paul wants to show us that it is not good men that are in trouble with a bad God, but bad men are in trouble with a good God. Most people put God on the stand to question Him rather than men being on the stand. In order for God to express His nature (holiness, truth, and justice), God must punish sin. God\u2019s wrath is a holy wrath, justified wrath that calls for judgment (I am yet to hear songs on the wrath of God). How do we know God is angry with the wicked? look to the cross where He poured His wrath on His Son who bore all our sins <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Isaiah 53: \u201cHe was bruised for our iniquities<\/span>\u201d, who bruised Him? God the Father when Jesus drunk the cup of wrath. The cross is foolishness to them that perish because men have not understood verse 18 and what it means.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The Good news makes no sense unless you deal with bad news first. From Paul, fear becomes the first pressure applied to evil men. How can people understand anything about love if they do not understand God&#8217;s hate?; How can they understand anything about His grace if they do not know about His law (nature)?;&nbsp; How can they understand forgiveness if they do not understand the penalty of sin.

There is nothing we could do of OURSELVES to get saved. Convincing, Convicting, Converting, Containing is ALL from God. That is why salvation is the greatest miracle a person can experience.

But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God, 9 who has saved us and called us to a holy life\u2014not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, 10 but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel\u201d, 2Timothy 1:8-10 (NIV). <\/span>We recently talked about Amazing Grace, we see this grace in operation in Paul\u2019s life. He could be and do what he could do because of the grace given in Christ Jesus. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Not only did he receive grace, he also received the calling of apostleship.

These rates are very alarming.&nbsp; <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">If the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, shouldn\u2019t the same power that saves be the same power that keeps unless the power that keeps never saved in the first place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">In my reading I believe vs. 16-18 is the key that unlocks the door to understanding the message in this book also explained in other verses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Two analogies that will make this book interesting to understand, \u201ca little girl was looking outside where she saw a white sheep. She was amazed by how white, nice and clean the sheep looked, then it began to snow and she wondered how dirty the sheep now looked. Same sheep but under a different back ground.&nbsp; Another analogy, a lady had just finished sweeping her house, cleaned everything. She then opened the curtain for the morning sunlight. To her amazement, she saw dust on the table and in the air. As long as the light had not come in, the table looked dust free. Did the light create the dust? No, it merely exposed what she could not see. This is what this book does especially the first three chapters, Paul\u2019s writing causes the righteousness of God to rain down before we the sheep that we may see ourselves in our true state, that we look at ourselves under the background of God\u2019s white snow righteousness. The same with the second analogy, he is drawing the curtain that the light of Christ may shine brighter exposing unrighteousness in our lives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Chapter 1:1-5&nbsp; Vs. 1 \u201cPaul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel ( Mark 1:1) of God<\/span>\u201d, in this first verse we meet THE MESSENGER, HIS POSITION, HIS CALL, HIS MESSAGE, however the center of the opening verse is not WHO Paul is but rather the person WHOSE Paul is and that is JESUS CHRIST. He calls himself a BONDSERVANT and by definition, this is a servant who willingly commits himself to serve a master he loves and respects without expecting to be repaid. He is bought, owned and ruled by God. He is Paul, his position is servant hood, his call is to be an apostle, his message is the gospel of God (good news).&nbsp; Here Paul wants his readers to understand that the message he is bringing is not of men but of God, it originated with Him. It is the message that God will forgive sins, deliver from sin\u2019s power, and give eternal hope.&nbsp; Vs. 2 makes it clear about the promise through His prophets concerning Jesus Christ conceived in a virgin\u2019s womb by the Holy Spirit, and was delivered normally. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">John makes believing that Christ has come in the flesh a crucial test of orthodoxy because He is fully human as well as fully God.

When I finally understood it\u2019s message and application, it has become one of my favorite books. I wonder if you have ever spent some time studying it. I hope to share from the first chapter which lays a foundation for the entire book. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Allow me to lay a ground work and in the next couple of sessions do some study from the first chapter.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">This epistle\u2019s name comes from its original recipients: the members of the church in Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire (1:7). To understand some background and setting, we learn that Rome was the capital and most important city of the Roman Empire founded in 753BC. Paul was martyred outside Rome. Some of those converted on the day of Pentecost probably founded the church at Rome Acts 2:10 and Paul had sought to visit the Roman church but had been prevented from doing so (Rom 1:13). In God\u2019s providence, Paul\u2019s inability to visit Rome gave the world this inspired masterpiece of the gospel doctrine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The book of Romans is a doctrinal book, it\u2019s a book that lay out the logic Christianity. The first 11 chapters are orthodoxy (theological truths doctrine, teaching) and the remainder 6 chapters are Orthopraxy (practical living or right practice). Paul\u2019s primary purpose in writing Romans was to teach the great truths of the gospel of grace to believers who had never received apostolic instruction. The letter also introduced him to a church where he was personally unknown, but hoped to visit soon for several important reasons:-1. To edify the believers, Vs.11 2. To preach the gospel vs. 15, 3. To get to know the Roman Christians, so they could encourage him vs. 12; Chapter 15:32, better pray him Chapter 15:30, and help him with his planned ministry in Spain Chapter 15:28<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">This epistle to the Romans is placed first, not because of the priority of its date, but because of the superlative Excellency of the epistle, it being one of the longest and fullest of all, and perhaps because of the dignity of the place to which it is written. The overarching theme of Romans is the righteousness that comes from God: the glorious truth that God justifies the guilty, condemned sinners by grace alone through faith in Christ alone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">If you read the first 3 chapters, you discover that Paul\u2019s first mission is to pull the curtains to expose unrighteousness that condemns man, Romans 1:18-3:20, he wants to prove that all men are guilty before God and instead of just saying it, he paints it in in full color. I\u2019m glad he does not stop there praise God.<span>&nbsp; <\/span>I pray we learn a little bit about this amazing book.

To be honest, I had no planned vision. I hated writing since I was not good at it (still struggling). I was still growing in the word so I was the wrong candidate to even share. I had no team to work with but God is God. I am a living testimony of how God can use the least likely to do His work for His glory.&nbsp; I remember when I came to work here at GE 14 years ago, as I was walked through the doors, the Lord impressed in my heart to know He did not send me here primarily to make money but to work for Him. I did not know what that meant at the time until almost three years later the call was realized. The daily devotion ministry was born out of a desire to reach those who were newly saved and needed a word to encourage them each day as they started a new day. A great inspiration came from one of our devotion team members <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">France Neptune<\/span>. Before her conversion, she used to pass by my cube and ask if I had a good word for that day as I had my Bible opened. Later she got saved and it was like the Lord was now saying, these are the kind I sent you here for. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">I began to ask myself, how best I could be an encouragement to her and others; this is when the email tool came about. I trusted that if God was going to minister to His people, then He would have to tool me for the service. I remember praying, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lord dictate and I will type<\/span>\u201d. The Lord was faithful; He gave me a word each morning to share. I had six people on my list who received devotions. Then the Lord sent <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Jemima Elizabeth<\/span> from India with a team to come here in the US for training. Out of the entire group, she was the only believer. I came to know she was a believer when she saw 10 Commandments on a big poster in my cube. She asked me what church I attended and if I was a believer. That started a friendship, she even visited my church. When she went back to India, she began to receive devotions and started spreading the message around. Before long, India was my largest subscriber of the daily devotions. Before long, I was getting emails from Africa, Australia, Europe, South America and Canada, the message was spreading like wild fire. One doctor from Canada Dr. Sunil has been using our materials for their bible study. People were receiving devotions and forwarding to friends and families. Some were emailing me directly to add them to the list. At one point over 1000 people were receiving devotions from me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">In 2003, God brought Pastor Phil to help me do ministry. Since God had used him to build me in the word, who better minister a long side of you but your best friend and a minister of the gospel. We came to know each other in 1997 when my family moved from Kenya (Africa) to USA. I met him one time at a prayer meeting. He was praying in one corner and I was praying in another corner. I remember one verse in his prayer <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Hebrews 12:1, \u201cTherefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2 looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God\u201d. <\/span>What a prayer time not knowing each other, thereafter we both felt we should hang out, the rest is history. He was strong in the word, I was strong in prayers. God brought us together to build one another in the areas we were both weak in. Pastor Phil has been such an instrument in this ministry; he has been a great blessing, and the best of friend you can ask for. He loves the Lord and he loves people, I must testify of that. No one introduces me like Pastor Phil. When we get on the phone, all we talk about is the word of God. I would not be strong in doing devotions had the Lord not sent him. I could say more about him but I hope you\u2019ve been blessed by his ministry.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">My dad <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Boaz Olang<\/span> also came on board on and off. I am so blessed to have such a great dad, a man who began to have vision that God would one day use me; this began while I was only 4years old. He would take me to missions with him. He would pray and speak destiny in my life. At an early age all that meant nothing, now I see it all. He has labored for our family and his impact in my life is his heartfelt prayers that have helped shape me to be what I am today as a man, a minister and a husband. He has ministered along side of me many times. Many of you have been blessed and touched by his ministry. He is a pastor, a man with such great vision, a risk taker and practical living encourager. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">There is a brother I must mention here, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">She<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">eju Jacob<\/span>, a brother in India who has taken all our devotions and created a blog\/website and posted them all there. This brother was so touched with the devotions that he took upon himself to have others tap into the blessings he was receiving. Because of him, you can now Google my name and our devotions will come up on the search engines. What a blessing. Also <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Bro. Benjamin<\/span>, a man I have come to know and love for His passion for the Lord even through his writings that have been an encouragement and a challenge in my life to pursue more and more of Holiness. I believe you\u2019ve been blessed and challenged at the same time. God sends the right people at the right time to challenge you. There have been others also who have shared devotions with us, To God be the glory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Last but not least, my dear <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">wife Judy<\/span>, a blessing from the Lord. God brought her at the right time and through our experience as a couple, God has used it to minister to others as we have shared on devotions related to relationships. She has also shared devotions with us which impacted lives; I received testimonies concerning the words she shared. She has been instrumental in proof reading my writings, we are not perfect yet (may never be) but I hope the messages have come very clearly. I am blessed with a good wife.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">What\u2019s the point of sharing all these? This is to show God\u2019s faithfulness when willing vessels avail themselves to be used of God. I always say, it\u2019s not about ability but availability.

The task of a Christian is to know what he confesses to believe and Peter tells us in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1 Peter 3:15, \u201cBut sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; \u201c. <\/span>The doctrine of Trinity is key to knowing God and key to our salvation. The challenge we all have, we cannot full understand Trinity but sure we can study to know the much that has been revealed to us. One man said, \u201cTo try to understand Trinity is to lose your mind, to deny Trinity is to lose your soul\u201d. Let this teaching by Pastor John MacArthur open your eyes and understanding as He dives into the word to teach us about \u201cOur Triune God\u201d blessings Ev<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-decoration:underline;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:#1F497D;margin:0;\">Our Triune God, by John MacArthur<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The Trinity is an unfathomable, and yet unmistakable doctrine in Scripture. As Jonathan Edwards noted, after studying the topic extensively, \u201cI think [the doctrine of the Trinity] to be the highest and deepest of all Divine mysteries\u201d (An Unpublished Treatise on the Trinity). <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Yet, though the fullness of the Trinity is far beyond human comprehension, it is unquestionably how God has revealed Himself in Scripture\u2014as one God eternally existing in three Persons. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">This is not to suggest, of course, that the Bible presents three different gods (cf. <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Deut.%206.4\">Deut. 6:4<\/a>). Rather, God is three Persons in one essence; the Divine essence subsists wholly and indivisibly, simultaneously and eternally, in the three members of the one Godhead\u2014the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (We considered the deity of Christ last Thursday, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gty.org\/Resources\/Articles\/3317\">in this post <\/a>.) <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The Scriptures are clear that these three Persons together are one and only one God (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Deut.%206.4\">Deut. 6:4<\/a>). <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2010.30\">John 10:30<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2010.33\">33<\/a> explain that the Father and the Son are one. <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/First%20Corinthians%203.16\">First Corinthians 3:16<\/a> shows that the Father and the Spirit are one. <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Romans%208.9\">Romans 8:9<\/a> makes clear that the Son and the Spirit are one. And <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2014.16\">John 14:16<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2014.18\">18<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2014.23\">23<\/a> demonstrate that the Father, Son, and Spirit are one. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Yet, in exhibiting the unity between the members of the Trinity, the Word of God in no way denies the simultaneous existence and distinctiveness of each of the three Persons of the Godhead. In other words, the Bible makes it clear that God is one God (not three), but that the one God is a Trinity of Persons. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">In the Old Testament, the Bible implies the idea of the Trinity in several ways. The title Elohim (\u201dGod\u201d), for instance, is a plural noun which can suggest multiplicity (cf. <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Gen.%201.26\">Gen. 1:26<\/a>). This corresponds to the fact that the plural pronoun (\u201dus\u201d) is sometimes used of God (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Gen.%201.26\">Gen. 1:26<\/a>; <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Isa.%206.8\">Isa. 6:8<\/a>). More directly, there are places in which God\u2019s name is applied to more than one Person in the same text (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Ps.%20110.1\">Ps. 110:1<\/a>; cf. <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Gen.%2019.24\">Gen. 19:24<\/a>). And there are also passages where all three divine Persons are seen at work (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Is.%2048.16\">Is. 48:16<\/a>; <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Is%2061.1\">61:1<\/a>). <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The New Testament builds significantly on these truths, revealing them more explicitly. The baptismal formula of <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Matthew%2028.19\">Matthew 28:19<\/a> designates all three Persons of the Trinity: \u201cGo therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.\u201d In his apostolic benediction to the Corinthians, Paul underscored this same reality. He wrote, \u201cThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God [the Father], and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all\u201d (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/2%20Cor.%2013.14\">2 Cor. 13:14<\/a>). Other New Testament passages also spell out the glorious truth of the Triune God (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Romans%2015.16\">Romans 15:16<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Romans%2015.30\">30<\/a>; <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/2%20Cor.%201.21%E2%80%9322\">2 Cor. 1:21\u201322<\/a>; <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Eph.%202.18\">Eph. 2:18<\/a>). <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">In describing the Trinity, the New Testament clearly distinguishes three Persons who are all simultaneously active. They are not merely modes or manifestations of the same person (as Oneness theology incorrectly asserts) who sometimes acts as Father, sometimes as Son, and sometimes as Spirit. At Christ\u2019s baptism, all three Persons were simultaneously active (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Matt.%203.16%E2%80%9317\">Matt. 3:16\u201317<\/a>), with the Son being baptized, the Spirit descending, and the Father speaking from Heaven. Jesus Himself prayed to the Father (cf. <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Matt.%206.9\">Matt. 6:9<\/a>), taught that His will was distinct from His Father\u2019s (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Matt.%2026.39\">Matt. 26:39<\/a>), promised that He would ask the Father to send the Spirit (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2014.16\">John 14:16<\/a>), and asked the Father to glorify Him (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2017.5\">John 17:5<\/a>). These actions would not make sense unless the Father and the Son were two distinct Persons. Elsewhere in the New Testament, the Holy Spirit intercedes before the Father on behalf of believers (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Rom.%208.26\">Rom. 8:26<\/a>), as does the Son, who is our Advocate (<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/1%20John%202.1\">1 John 2:1<\/a>). Again, the distinctness of each Person is in view. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The Bible is clear. There is only one God, yet He exists, and always has existed, as a Trinity of Persons\u2014the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (cf. <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%201.1\">John 1:1<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%201.2\">2<\/a>). To deny or misunderstand the Trinity is to deny or misunderstand the very nature of God Himself. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Today\u2019s article was adapted from John\u2019s commentary on 1-3 John. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, I would like to share on a very important doctrine many Christians believe but have little or no understanding of it leave alone explaining it.

We believe that because we are Christians that no bad thing can happen to us. When unpleasant things do happen to us &#8211; they can challenge our faith. We<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">forget that God has not promised to keep us away from harm, but God has promised to keep us through harm. This lesson is hardest for those of us who are still just barely starting out on our Christian journey \u2013 or those of us who are restarting our Christian journey for the thousandth time. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Does this scenario sound familiar? You start going to church regularly again. Then you start reading the Bible and taking time to pray. You notice a change. You can feel God working in your life. Encouraged, you start working hard at listening for God&#8217;s voice and giving up your old self-destructive habits. At first the results are amazing. God&#8217;s voice is clear and God&#8217;s blessings are abundant. You are certain that you are walking on the road that God has chosen for you. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Then you hit a snag. The road that you were so sure of takes an unexpected turn. If you are following God, isn&#8217;t God supposed to take care of you? You feel abandoned by God. You feel betrayed &#8211; the safe road that you were on is now gone. You don&#8217;t understand that God is still standing right beside you and that you are still on the road on which you are supposed to be.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">This part of our faith journey can be like standing at the edge of a cliff beside a wide, bottomless canyon. Somehow you know that far away on the cliff on the other side of the canyon is the path where you are supposed to be. But how are you supposed to get all the way over there? When you look behind you, you see an easy path going back down the cliff. This is the path back to your old habits, back to your old life. What do you do? <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">When we reach this point we can become so discouraged that many of us give up and go back down the path we know. We stop going to church and reading the Bible and listening for God&#8217;s voice. We never get to see the other side of the canyon. The next time that you get to this point remind yourself that the edge of a cliff is the perfect place to learn to let the Spirit carry you. Don&#8217;t forget that God has given you wings.

He had learnt to pick up his cross and follow Christ daily. He had been a living example to many who might have not thought it possible to lay it all on the line and be like Christ. In<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Philippians 3:8<\/span>, he says, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Yet indeed I also count all things loss<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> my Lord, for whom<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> I have suffered the loss of all things<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, and count them as rubbish<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">, that I may gain Christ<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d.<\/span> By the standards of the world before his conversion, Paul had it all, meeting Christ on his way to Damascus to persecute Christians altered and changed his life forever. He had not walked with Christ physically like the other disciple but to imitate Christ, he was going to have a taste of what it means to walk with Him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Paul\u2019s life was not an easy road, having been stoned and left to die, survived shipwreck, had been beaten, had been jailed, rejected yet in all this he was fulfilled because Christ did not have it easy in this world and still accomplished His mission,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> Paul being a bond servant of the Lord saw himself finishing his mission through Christ who he imitated and gave him strength<\/span> (Philippians 4:13). Something about Christ propelled Paul to ride out what had made many men give up. Something about Christ fascinated him that he tells us of his desire in<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Philippians 3:10, that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death\u201d.<\/span> You would think that Paul desiring to imitate Christ was for him to be successful in this life, have a lot of money, have respect and be happy. It turns out that his desire was to operate in the power that resurrected Christ<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> 1Corinthians 2:4, \u201cAnd my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power<\/span>\u201d, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And the fellowship of his suffering<\/span>\u201d, Paul had a taste of what it meant to suffer for Christ.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201cBeing conformed to His death<\/span>\u201d. As Christ died for the purpose of redeeming sinners, so Paul had that same purpose in a lesser sense; he lived and would willingly die to reach sinners with the gospel. His life and death, though not redemptive, were for the same purpose as his Lord\u2019s. In imitating Christ, Paul made himself of no reputation, he was a bondservant, humbled and was willing to suffer for Christ. I believe with all my heart that in his hard times, he would have not cried, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Jesus bring me OUT of this<\/span>\u201d his prayer would have been, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Jesus bring me THROUGH this<\/span>\u201d. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">To bring us out is to escape, to bring us through is to endure<\/span>. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">By saying, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ<\/span>\u201d Paul is not suggesting to us that he counted himself something; he is teaching us what it means to follow Christ because he was a living proof. He was also glad that the Corinthians had received his teachings but he wanted to make it clear that He was not the head, that he was not making it by his own strength or his own teachings. This is why he pointed them back to his reason for being who he was. He tells them in vs. 3,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ,..\ufeff\u201d<\/span> <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Our spiritual leaders ought to point us back to the head; Christ and their lives should be an imitation of Christ in every way and if that\u2019s not the case, then one should change the course. Their lives ought to be an example to us that despite how tough it is to pick up the cross and follow Christ, if they are making it through Christ who strengthens them, we too can through Christ who strengthens us. If we have other people who look up to us as spiritual leaders then like Paul let us strive to imitate Christ in every aspect of our lives. Paul had a desire to imitate Christ and also NOT fail Christ by leading the followers of Jesus a stray. What about you?

This is an important word, as it encompasses all those who have placed their faith in Jesus. The word for church in the Greek is \u2018ekklesia\u201d, which means, the called out ones. What have they been called out from? They have been called out from the world (John 17:16). What do they do? They take up their cross and follow Jesus (Matthew10:38). How do they do this? By denying themselves, serving Christ in holiness and righteousness Luke 1:74-75). I find it increasingly important to differentiate between what the popular voices say and what the scriptures say.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;Many individuals make up their own religion by their own reasoning. They decide for themselves what they will and will not follow. We live like the world, in drunkenness and fornication, and then we enter God\u2019s house as if all is normal. The divorce rate goes higher and higher in the church, couples live together out of wedlock, worldly entertainment is reveled in, all things the scriptures call sin, but many engage in them anyways. How many churches held super bowl parties? How many held prayer meetings? Think about it, we celebrate some idolatrous game, on the Lord\u2019s day nonetheless, and we neglect what the scriptures describe as what a true disciple does. Friends, I declare to you, in the great apostles words, the true church of God is comprised of those who have heard the call and have responded. For this call is an invitation, \u2018called out\u2019, in the Greek, means invited. This is not some un refusable call, it is the divine declaration of the Almighty, to whosoever would come after Him, and follow Him upon the road that leads to everlasting life. They have been separated unto God, consecrated wholly to Him. Separated from the world, for the scriptures tell us that the friend of the world is the enemy of God(James 4:4). The friend of the world is the one who loves the things of the world. They desire and revel in the things of the world. This one has not the love of the Father(I Jon 2:15). <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The true disciple is called a saint, and they are , in reality, what they are called. They are commanded to be holy(I Peter1:15-16), and they are, in fact , holy. They are personally involved, not merely in profession, but in practice. The righteousness of Christ is imparted within them, they are partakers of His holiness. I believe this to be so important to understand, this life is not some ideal we look at, it is to be the life we live. We are called to \u2018be\u2019 saints, in reality, in actual practice and experience. It involves our effort, our will, and it is our privilege. So, will you hear the call? And again, be encouraged to respond with any thoughts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Hearing His call, Brother Benjamen<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><a href=\"mailto:brotherbenjamen@gmail.com\">brotherbenjamen@gmail.com<\/a> <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; I Corinthians 1:2-.. to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints\u2026 Paul addresses his letter to the church of God in the beginning of v.2.

The word &#8220;GRACE&#8221; in Hebrew are hesed and hen which means undeserved<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> love<\/span> and<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> favor<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">. God is love, and grace is the out flowing of His love toward undeserving sinners<\/span>. Grace is love in action. \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">For God so loved the world that He gave (action word)\u2026\u201d John 3:16<\/span>. We are making it because of the favor of God.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Ephesians 2:8&amp;9, &#8220;For it&#8217;s by grace that we&#8217;ve been saved through faith and not of ourselves, it is the gift of God and not of works lest any man should boast of&#8221;<\/span>. While many Catholics and others believe in salvation by grace plus works, the truth of the matter is, there is nothing that one can do or add to salvation. Think of it this way, if you passed out, what can you do to be resuscitate yourself? Absolutely nothing. Your revival is purely in the hands of Him that is reviving you and all you can do is respond to the resuscitation. Of course the response is not your doing but His doing and He gets all the credit. The bible says that a man cannot come to the Lord unless he is drawn of the Father,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> John 6:44<\/span>. So we need to be reminded that we&#8217;ve been saved by the grace of God, grace fought for us in the courts of law when the judgment had been passed that we were guilty. Were it not for grace and mercy, we would still be dead in sin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2Cor 12:9, &#8220;But He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, my strength is made perfect in weakness&#8221;.<\/span> This is a message that came to Paul while He was going through something he did not understand. He had no proper words to describe it, he called it a thorn in the flesh. The bible says that he prayed three times that it would be removed and instead of God removing it, He gave him grace to endure. The amazing grace will cause you to endure hardship, making you comfortable (not happy) in the situation you are in. His grace is more than enough to keep you intact until He has rescued you. After knowing that His grace would keep him, he rejoiced in his infirmities as he understood that this too would pass. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Grace keeps you on hold position<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Hebrews 4:16, &#8220;Therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness that you obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need&#8221;.<\/span> Already we have established a foundation about grace being a favor not something worked for or earned. Anytime we deal with grace, we understand our debts were paid by Jesus on the cross. The grace of God makes it a reality in our lives when we repent and trust.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> We can stand before God in our fig leaves, knowing we are accepted and beloved.<\/span> Listen to this,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">he grace of God does not compromise the holiness of God, it provides a way out<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.<\/span> Now that we have been accepted as beloved we have been given the keys to access the throne of grace when we need mercy and grace to help in time of need. While positionaly we are perfect, experientially we are a working progress sanctified daily in this walk of grace growing in holiness. When you have<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> grace<\/span>, you will not<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> disgrace<\/span> yourself and the people around you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">To sum up, God in His kindness saved me a dirty wretched sinner by His grace through faith by His Son without compromising His Holiness by providing a way out, that\u2019s what makes grace so amazing.

If I was of the world, I would have done something stupid but one thing that I received that I had always talked about but never experienced was peace. Let us look at different kinds of peace. There is <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">PEACE WITH GOD<\/span>, this is where when we were once living in sin, we were enemies of God and by His salvation, we made peace with Him. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 5:1,\u201d Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have[a] peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,\u201d,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James 4:4, \u201c\u2026Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God\u201d<\/span>. If you are not saved, you have no peace with God and you won\u2019t have other benefits that come with peace. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">There is<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> PEACE OF GOD<\/span>, the peace that comes from above. This is not even worked from within. If you ever find yourself in a situation that is so bad and you can still be cool about it, that is not even your peace, that is the peace of God in action. Daniel had the peace of God in the lion\u2019s den and so was David, Elijah and the rest who found themselves in different situations.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Philippians 4:7, &#8220;And the peace of God that surpasses all human understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus&#8221;<\/span>. This is a type of peace that cannot be defined by man as it can only be sensed, there is nothing on earth that can be used to define, describe or breaking it down in a way you and I can understand. During the time I was going through my tough time, God gave me this peace, till today I cannot describe it in words.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The peace we are dealing with this morning is <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">PEACE IN GOD<\/span>. The other types of peace we have looked at are for a given period of time when they are really needed, but the peace in God is a continuous peace that every believer desires. We are told that <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">God will keep him in perfect peace anyone who has His mind stays on Him<\/span>, why? because He does trust Him. By keeping your mind on Him may not mean coming out of your situation right away but having peace to go through it because you are in perfect peace. It is the type of peace that has no errors, we don&#8217;t need to try it and see if it works. We don&#8217;t need to order it for 30days and if it does not work, we can send it back to the manufacturer. I have proven this to be true and so constantly I am living in perfect peace because my mind is on Him. I believe that the more your mind stays on Him, the more you meditate on His word and the more you think about His goodness and perfection the more you will be in His peace. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Vs. 4 <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Trust in the Lord forever, For in Jehovah, the Lord, is everlasting strength&#8221;.<\/span> Those who have peace in God have no problem trusting Him, not for a season but forever, why? because in Him there is everlasting strength. I may not know what you are dealing with that has stolen away your peace and I&#8217;m not talking about peace with God, you passed that the moment you gave your life to Christ, I&#8217;m talking about the peace of God but stressing on the peace in God. Have you left your mind to wonder, worry and get confused? Get your mind back on His word (Him). <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mathew 11:28, &#8220;Come unto me all ye who labor and are of heavy laden and I will give you rest&#8221;. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">PEACE COMES ABOUT WHEN YOU BEGIN TO REST IN HIM<\/span> and God is offering us rest this morning that we may be in that perfect peace.

Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">!<\/span> (Genesis 19:17)\u201d I read four instructions here in what seems to me, a purposed order. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol style=\"margin-left:.375in;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;font-family:&quot;font-size:12pt;\" type=\"1\">\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">First he says <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">flee for your lives<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">. Death was on its way from God, and just as God gave     Noah a way of escape through the ark, Lot\u2019s family was directed to a way     of escape as well from impending wrath.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Don\u2019t look back<\/span>. Sometimes we are not given the why behind the command from God, but are simply told to just obey. Lot\u2019s family knew judgment was ensuing and were told not to look back. Jesus said, Remember Lot\u2019s wife, referencing to her looking back. For whatever reason she turned her head, I don\u2019t know the reason for returning to house or field is to salvage possessions. The Expositors Bible Commentary says, \u201cLot&#8217;s wife, reluctant to leave her old life, looked back to Sodom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Don\u2019t Stop anywhere in the plains<\/span>. Many times stopping and looking back go hand in hand.

On that day no one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything<\/span> (Luke 17:29-31).\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">When the Son returns, there will not be time to look back let alone go back. Luke 17:34 \u2013 35 reads, I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.\u2019\u201d Even those closely associated (in bed and at work) are separated. Those who look back now and not fit for the Kingdom, and at Christ\u2019s return will not inherit the Kingdom, despite their close relationship to someone that will be taken by Christ. False converts don\u2019t just look back, they go back!

I can remember in school having to do a certain amount of push-ups, situ-ups, and various other exercises as part of testing to see if I was physically fit or not. Obviously all people are not physically fit, and in light of this all, are not spiritually fit either. The Apostle Paul wrote to Timothy these words, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cFor physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.<\/span>\u201d The Apostle was not saying that physical fitness had NO value, but rather it did not have the same value as godliness (spiritual fitness). <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Jesus is approached by one that said to Him, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cI will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family<\/span>.\u201d Jesus replied, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.<\/span>\u201d Like the man that wanted to first go and bury his father to which Jesus replied \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Let the dead bury the dead but you go and preach the Kingdom of God<\/span>,\u201d this man desired also to go to say goodbye to his family. This seemed to be like a reasonable request as well, and respectable in nature. However, Jesus replied again in an unexpected manner. Jesus gives an analogy about plowing, and looking back as seemingly disqualifying someone from the Kingdom. This is until one knows the key word in that verse for \u201cfit,\u201d which in the Greek is <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">euthetos<\/span> which means \u201cready for use.\u201d Lot\u2019s family was told not to look back and Lot\u2019s wife chose to look back and she turned into a pillar of salt. Jesus said, \u201c\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">no one in the field should go back for anything. 32 Remember Lot\u2019s wife<\/span>! Why would Jesus tell this man not to even look back?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol style=\"margin-left:.75in;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;font-family:&quot;font-size:12pt;\" type=\"1\">\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">When     one looks back, one cannot look forward<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">. Jesus was     looking for mission minded people, not mountainous minded people along for     the ride who just desired to maintain the status quo. Some people follow     as long as it doesn\u2019t cost them anything, as long as it doesn\u2019t \u201crock the     boat,\u201d of the nice little world one has built for oneself. Mission minded     people are engaged in the mission at hand, and will pay the cost, rock the     boat, all of which will create a ripple effect in the lives of those     closest to them. Some of those people may not appreciate this, yet Jesus     still calls us to the mission of following Him<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0 0 0 .375in;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">When Christ calls us to work, He expects work<\/span>. If you\u2019ve ever been hired to work at a job, the boss doesn\u2019t appreciate lazy employees. Laziness doesn\u2019t advance his business, and laziness doesn\u2019t advance God\u2019s Kingdom. Jesus said to the disciples, \u201cCome follow me and I will make you fishers of men.\u201d The key is follow, when Christ moves forward as the leader, His followers MUST follow.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0 0 0 .375in;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">When one looks back one is not ready for use<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. <\/span>As a light bulb was made to shine light, so too was the Christian made to shine the light of Christ. What would happen if a light bulb could somehow unscrew itself so that it was not connected to the socket? It would not be connected to the source that it needs to do its job, shine! When one looks back to the world one is unfit, not ready for use, disconnected to his or her purpose. Don\u2019t look back, and definitely don\u2019t go back. Stay focused, ready for the Master\u2019s use, with your hand to the plow.

The terms &#8220;minutemen&#8221; and &#8220;militia&#8221; are often thought of as one and the same. However, in early America&#8211; especially in the 18th century&#8211; there was a distinct difference. Minute-men represented a small hand-picked force selected from the ranks of local militia companies and regiments. Approximately one-third of the men in each militia unit were chosen &#8220;to be ready to march or fight at a minute&#8217;s notice.&#8221; If they were eating with their families, putting the kids to bed, bathing, sleeping, etc\u2026, when the call came they were to immediately switch into battle mode and GO! This sounds like the commitment that Jesus was after we He calls. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Matthew 11:12<\/span> reads, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">\u201cAnd from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">violent take it by force<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">.\u201d<\/span> The minute-men had the mentality that Jesus was after, those ready in an instance to obey the call and GO! <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Looking back to the man with the deceased father, I envision what Jesus was saying to him, was, \u201cCome now, not later, I have an urgent job for you, that is to go preach the Kingdom of God! Go preach this living, active, forcefully advancing kingdom. You are spiritually alive, follow me, be my disciple, and preach the Kingdom\u201d . It sounds kind of rough reading, the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force,\u201d however Jesus needs those that have that kind of soldiers\u2019 mentality, ready to \u201cviolently fight\u201d for the kingdom. Jesus was saying to this man, \u201cI am calling you for such a time as this.\u201d Remember Jesus said to him, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Let the dead bury the dead, but you go and preach the Kingdom of God<\/span>.\u201d I will always appreciate years back when a dear friend named Pastor Paul came to celebrate my wedding even though his dad had just died. He was able to rejoice with me in what God was doing in uniting my wife and I. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">John McNeill, a well known Scottish preach of a past generation, used to tell how he found this saying directly relevant to him. When his father died in Scotland, towards the end of the nineteenth century, he was in the English Midlands, and was advertised to address an evangelistic meeting in a certain city on the very day of his father\u2019s funeral. People would have understood had he sent a message to say that he was compelled to cancel his engagement. \u2018But I dared not send it,\u2019 he said, \u2018for this same Jesus stood by me, and seemed to say, \u201cNow, look, I have you. You go and preach the gospel to those people. Would you rather bury the dead or raise the dead?\u201d And I went to preach\u201d. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">When Jesus told the man, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Let the dead bury the dead<\/span>,\u201d it seems that this man did not obey Jesus to go. This sounds like much of the church when this same Jesus calls you and me to go and preach the kingdom of God. When he does most make an excuse and fail to obey the call! \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Until we stop relying upon our own efforts, we will be unable to rely upon God<\/span> (James Beall).<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201d<\/span> Burying the dead is not a work of the Spirit, obeying Jesus to preach His Word, is a Spirit work.

When Christ calls someone, he or she may be \u201con top of the world\u201d or \u201cin the depths of despair,\u201d or anywhere in between. Think for a moment of where you were when Christ called you to follow Him? I can recall that I was a young teen, an average student, heavily involved in sports, and religiously attending the Roman Catholic Church at the time. However upon realizing that \u201cmy goodness\u201d would not merit eternal life in heaven, my previous understanding of God was shattered. Upon hearing the truth from the Bible for the first time, I was enlightened and convicted of my sins (breaking God\u2019s 10 Commandments), this caused me to repent toward God and put my faith in Jesus Christ Sometime afterwards I began ministry in my school, on the streets, and in other venues as began to unfold. Jesus had a conversation about commitment with three individuals. With that said let\u2019s focus on the first of the three people Jesus encountered, in light of the above Scripture. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The first person we are introduced to in the context of Luke 9:62 read, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">man<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> said unto him, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest\u201d<\/span>. (9:57). This man makes a presumptuous claim that he would go wherever Jesus traveled. Many say they will follow Jesus, but Jesus is looking for followers not fans, not those that want to jump on the \u201cband wagon. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">\u201c\ufeffAnd Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head <\/span>(9:58).\u201d Jesus travels to places that not all that say they are willing to go, actually follow when He looks to their level of commitment. There are numerous examples of this throughout the Scriptures, the rich young ruler (Mark 10), the various persons described in Luke 14, the famous John 6:66, and of course the examples given here in Luke 9:57 \u2013 62. Jesus\u2019 chief destination was to the CROSS! How many want to follow before one sees the cross? How many want to continue to follow after one sees the cross?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">\u201cThe Son of man has no where to lay His head.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">This can give us a few things to note about Jesus<\/span>:<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol style=\"margin-left:.375in;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;font-family:&quot;font-size:12pt;\" type=\"1\">\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Jesus cannot be found in one sole location as perhaps a     fox in hole, or a bird in a nest<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Jesus is the King of a moving     Kingdom <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Jesus did not have an earthly     place that He called home<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Jesus\u2019 home was not of this     world<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Jesus went where the Spirit     of God directed Him<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Jesus\u2019 rest was not from     physical comfort, but spiritual obedience to His Father\u2019s will<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Although one may request to follow Jesus, realize he will go places that will be uncomfortable to many.

Children are famous for this kind of questions. Picture a child asking his mother (who is not pregnant) \u201cmom I want you to have a child now, so to have someone to play catch with.\u201d The child doesn\u2019t really know what he or she is asking. In Mark 10 we read that James and John make a request to Jesus to sit on his right and left hand in Jesus\u2019 Kingdom. John Macarthur shares, \u201cMatthew reveals that their mother accompanied them and spoke first (Matt. 20:20, 21), after which James and John reiterated her request. If she was Jesus\u2019 aunt, the 3 undoubtedly hoped to capitalize on the family ties.\u201d Jesus replies, \u201cYou know NOT what you ask: Are you ABLE to drink THE CUP that I DRINK\u2026? <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Why would Jesus reply that they did not know what they were asking? What was the cup that Jesus said that he drinks? Jesus would drink the cup of sin-bearing death. The Expositor\u2019s Bible commentary shares, \u201cJesus&#8217; answer is sharp and penetrating. The two disciples did not really know what they were asking. The way to privileged position in the messianic kingdom is not by grabbing for power but by relinquishing it through suffering and death. Jesus explains this to them by using the analogies of the cup and baptism. The cup, symbolizing trouble and suffering, is found in the OT. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs&#8221; (Psalm 75:8). <\/span>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rise up, O Jerusalem, you have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of his wrath, you who have drained to its dregs the goblet that makes men stagger&#8221; (Isaiah 51:17; cf. also Mark 14:36; Jeremiah 49:12; Ezekiel 23:31-34).\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Not understanding Jesus, They said to him \u201cWe are able.\u201d Jesus responds<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201c\u201cYou will indeed drink the cup that I drink\u2026\u201d<\/span> If Jesus was the ultimate cup bearer then what cup would His disciples drink? In a sense they can and will drink from his cup of suffering. James would become the first apostolic martyr (Acts 12:2); and John would suffer exile on the Isle of Patmos, A.D. 63 (Rev 1:9). Jesus is the ultimate cup bearer of course. However, He is calling those that are His to be willing to lay down their lives for Him. Laying down ones\u2019 life is a daily process. If one cannot give Christ their time, talents, and treasures, how can one give one\u2019s life for Him? In closing the words of a song by Christafari, \u201cHe died for me, so I live for Him, he gave His life, for me, so I can give mine to Him, He became like me, so I can become like Him.\u201d How are you drinking the cup today? You may desire the cup be taken away, even as Jesus prayed, \u2026take this cup from me,\u201d however will you pray like Jesus, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Not my will, but Thy will be done.\u201d<\/span> Realize as you pray Thy will be done, you must also pray, my will be gone.\u201d Do His will and see, God will never let you down.

This was actually a very high profile job in biblical times. The cupbearer was one who tasted and served wine to the king. Ancient kings had to be very cautious about what they ate and drank. They used trusted servants to taste everything before they consumed it. If the servant lived or did not get sick, the king and queen then ate or drank. The \u201cchief butler\u201d in the Joseph account (Genesis 40) headed the king\u2019s cupbearers. Nehemiah held this highly trusted position under King Artaxerxes (Neh. 1:11), influencing the king politically. King Solomon also employed cupbearers (1 Kin. 10:5). In modern times there are tests scientists and pharmacists can run to discover if something contains poison. One man had sole responsibility of being the one to test if the king\u2019s wine was poisonous or palatable. This was a position of great trust I would imagine as the cupbearer may be killed in the service of the king. I am sure there were conspirators who attempted to take the life of the king through poisoning the wine. The trusted cupbearer would be the one to discover the true contents of the wine even at the cost of his very life. The cupbearer then was a high court official, one that was close to the king and having the trust of the king. The cupbearer would also sit at the right hand of the king. The cupbearer had to have the king\u2019s best interest in mind, and not his own. This would be likened to the President\u2019s bodyguard. The bodyguard, the cupbearer, may have to give his life for the sake of the king. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">At the Last Supper, Jesus took the cup and said, \u201c\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">Take this cup<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\"> and drink from it all of you. This is the cup of the New Covenant, which is shed for you and for all<\/span>.\u201d <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">In the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">(Matt 22:40-46 pp\u2014;Mt 26:36-46; Mk 14:32-42) Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done<\/span>.\u201d Please meditate on this in your mind and spirit. Jesus Christ was ultimate cupbearer and yet the King simultaneously. The cupbearers throughout the Scriptures sat in the high, noble, and trustworthy position at the right hand of the king and placed their lives on the line for the King. Here in the New Testament Jesus Christ is the cupbearer that places His life on the line as the King of Kings (in His humanity) that God\u2019s wrath might not come upon you and I. Christ submitted to the will of His Father and now sits at the right hand of His Father. Jesus was reminding the disciples that He would soon fulfill the ultimate role of the cupbearer. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">This is why Paul makes such a big deal about the manner in which one takes communion. The cupbearer Jesus Christ, willingly, lay his life down for you (see 1 Cor. 11: 27 \u2013 33), lest one dare partake in His sacrifice in an unworthy manner. When you partake in communion, realize that in doing so it is not just some religious ritual, but a remembrance of what Christ did in the past, is doing in the present, and will do in the future, because He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Thank the Lord today, and daily for even having the opportunity to partake in communion together.

In that process, Moses\u2019 hands got tired, thank God for Aaron and Hur \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it.

It\u2019s shameful for us believers to let those who are battling, battle alone. If we are in a season of victory, we should trust God to direct us to help bear burdens of those living in defeat. I\u2019ve discovered with the Lord, sometimes is not when you have everything in place that he sends someone, at times is when you have little or nothing to give that\u2019s when he sends someone your way. In 1King 17, God sent Elijah to a widow in Zeraphath to take care of him. Upon getting there, he finds the widow has nothing but a little jar of oil and a handful of floor. She was gathering sticks to prepare last meal for her and her son and die. Here comes Elijah who has nothing and asks to be provided for first.

We who are strong ought to bear to the glory of God. Let\u2019s also be ready at any time because the Lord may require us right when we are weak to reach others. Your restoration could be positioned in lifting up others who are weak while you are weak yourself. I find many times I am more encouraged and strengthened while lifting up others either through prayers, encouragements, giving assistance financially, helping hand etc. We are blessed to be a blessing and sometimes our blessings are on verge of extending a helping hand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0 0 0 .375in;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Divine Master invites his disciples, and encourages them by showing himself as meek and lowly in spirit.

I do not mean prayers of getting things or prayer for blessings but effective prayer that avails much according to James 5:16. We have neglected to be doers of the word and have become only hearers only according to James. What we have done in our time is we have talked about prayers but little attention has been given to it. The early church had prayer and the word as the nucleus of their call, everything else worked around it. Today it is the opposite, prayer works around everything. We say it is primary, however we treat it as secondary. It was Leonard Ravenhill who said \u201cSunday morning service attendance will show how popular your church is, Sunday night services will show how popular your pastor is, prayer meetings attendance will show how popular God is in your church\u201d, (paraphrased), ouch but how true that is.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Prayer is the nucleus, glue that hold all things together. This is why Jesus is quoted in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Matthew 21:19:46, \u201cIt is written, \u2018My house is a house of prayer,<\/span>.\u201d He did not call it a house of worship, or preaching, or programs even though all these are important and most necessary in our churches. He wanted people to know that powerful preaching, worship, unity, victories etc hinges, \u201cPrayer\u201d. Jesus continues\u201c\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">but you have made it a \u2018den of thieves\u201d, <\/span>I believe that if we are doing everything in our and neglecting to put prayer as priority, we have then have made it a den of thieves\u201d. But you ask how, if it is not for God\u2019s glory then it is robbery<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span>because \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Unless the LORD builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, The watchman stays awake in vain\u201d Psalm 127:1. <\/span>If we are not praying, it is not God building however spectacular things may be, the bible says we are laboring in vain. If we are not praying, we are watching in vain however hard we try, therefore if God is not building and watching, He is not getting glory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Pastor Phil shared this with me, so powerful<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Christ was the Word of God in he the flesh, yet still prayed. He showed the perfect balance of prayer and the Word of God. John Chapter 17 records the high priestly prayer of Christ. However just prior to this, E.M. Bounds reminds us that &#8220;Jesus had just finished instructing His disciples (John 13-16). Now He prayed for them, because prayer and the Word of God go together. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">If we have all Bible but no prayer, we may have a great deal of truth but no power<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">It would be &#8220;light without heat<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">.&#8221; On the other hand, if we have all prayer but no Bible teaching, we are in danger of becoming fanatics-heat without light! Zeal is a good thing, but zeal without knowledge is usually destructive. A proper balance of Bible study and prayer is important to a balanced Christian life. &#8220;Moreover, as for me,&#8221; said the godly prophet Samuel, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">&#8220;far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way&#8221; (1 Samuel 12:23).<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> Note the balance of prayer and the Word of God. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">&#8220;And now I commend you to God [that\u2019s prayer] and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up&#8230;&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">We need the prayer power back in our lives, in our churches, in our nation if anything is to be built and watched over. All must be done for God, through God and by God for His glory.

Seeds usually come in mind when talking about garden. Anything planted in that garden has the capability spring forth if natured, watered and kept well. There are things that we tend to look after or work on that are actually weeds and because we have put so much energy trying to care for the newly growing plants, we have also taken good care of weeds which work against good seeds. I heard this line from a preacher; <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cThere is more power in the seed than in the sower\u201d<\/span>. Anyone can plant a good seed regardless of who they are but in as much as the sower might have skills if he has bad seeds, nothing will materialize.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">People get overwhelmed with responsibilities daily. While you are still working on this, there comes another one. While trying to work on another one, here comes a new one. Everything has its season and how we deal with situations during certain seasons may determine the outcome of it. The overwhelming situations have choked out peace, confidence and courage, as the weeds do know how to choke out good plants. I know that someone this morning is dealing with overwhelming situations not just at work but even at home, let us see what the Lord has for us this morning.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Vs. 1 \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Hear my cry, O God, attend to my prayer\u201d, <\/span>the first thing talked about in this line is prayer, have you prayed over your situation or are you waiting for someone to come and lay hands on you to make it? Lay your own foundation and let someone else help you build the wall. I have met people that wanted to see things happen in their lives and the first question I would ask them, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Have you laid your foundation?\u201d,<\/span> What is the foundation, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">faith. <\/span>Vs. 2 \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">From the ends of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed, Lead me to the rock that is higher than I\u201d, <\/span>of course our hearts will get overwhelmed and so are our minds and bodies, but what happens when they get overwhelmed? Please do not lead me to temptation, friends, neighbors, programs you name it, lead me to the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rock, <\/span>not just any rock, but the Rock that is higher than I. Why the rock? because the rock cannot be overwhelmed, moved or shaken and if the rock is higher than I, I will make it my dwelling and hiding place. Vs. 3 \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">For you have been a shelter for me, A strong water from the enemy\u201d, <\/span>I truly believe this as the bible says in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Prov 18:10, \u201cThe name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous run into it and they are safe\u201d, <\/span>just His name alone is a strong tower in other words a strong rock. When you find yourself overwhelmed, calm your nerves, keep your mind on Him for peace and be led to the rock that is higher than us. The bible says that in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Nehemiah 8:10, \u201c\u2026for the joy of the Lord is your strength.\u201d<\/span> The unbelievers ask me why I always have this joy even when things at times do not go right or when I am overwhelmed. It is the joy of the Lord is that gives me strength. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 8, \u201cSo I will praise Your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows\u201d, <\/span>just because you are under a shelter does not exempt you from work, this is the reason we continue to praise and be glad and daily perform our vows. We have vowed to be the best we can be at our jobs by God\u2019s grace without complaining or murmuring \u201c..<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">for it is God which works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure\u201d, Phil 2:13. <\/span>So keep on fighting the good fight of a soldier, enduring for He is your Rock of Ages, Strong Tower, Firm Foundation, Solid Rock, Anchor of your Life and more.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">To sum up, we are all children in warriors gear. God is our armor therefore we make it however there are times when it gets too much that we have to cry.

This what Isaac needed to do, revive the wells to be effective, productive, living and flourishing. Are you reviving your wells? God could have told him to dig new wells but the word of God says, He is a God of restoration (reviving). Bringing back to life that which is dead, for example God is speaking about restoration in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Joel 2:25, He says, &#8220;So I will restore (revive) to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, The crawling locust, The consuming locust, And the chewing locust, My great army which I sent among you&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 26:25, &#8220;So he built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD, and he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac&#8217;s servants dug a well<\/span>&#8220;. God will not say something He has no answer for. To us it may sound foolish but to Him He knows what He is doing. If you are living by facts, you will not make it with God for long because many things that God does and asks us to do not make sense but they sure work. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">You go and revive your wells Isaac and I will cause water to flow says the Lord<\/span>. At the place they revived the wells, is the place they built an altar and pitched their tents there.

His Water will quench the thirst you always have when nothing else satisfies. Thank God for His promises that never fails. Men may fail but God will never, the bible says that \u201cHe is not a man that he should lie neither is He the son of man that He should repent, if He said it, surely it will come to pass\u201d paraphrased. \u201cSurely\u201d means without fail, we may not know the timing but surely we know He will. If He created out of nothing, He will make His water run from the unexpected.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Because Isaac was obedient to go back and dig the wells, God caused the water to flow and the Philistines saw clearly and in vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">26 \u201cThen Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phichol the commander of his army. 27 And Isaac said to them, \u201cWhy have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?\u201d<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">28 But they said, \u201cWe have certainly seen that the LORD is with you\u201d<\/span>.

To be effective, we have to have our wells with water. Why are you not affecting your department, is it because you have allowed an enemy to fill your wells of joy, peace, favor, confidence, hope with guilt, shame, pride, fear and habits? You have a reason now to undo what has been done because you need your well of salvation running and then build an altar and pitch your tent around the wells you have dug.

No one in their right mind digs wells for fun. Human survival depends on water. God has referred Himself as the Living Water that quenches the thirst of men. The Samaritan woman in the John 4 came to the well to draw water and right at the well, she meets Jesus who asks for water then later claims that He has water she needs to make her thirst no more. She desired this water. How about us?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">To desire water sounds so good but here is the problem. In Genesis, Abraham had dug wells, at a later time, the philistines (enemies) came and filled them with earth (soil). They covered them up and water would not flow anymore. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 26:15, &#8220;Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his father&#8217;s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with earth<\/span>&#8220;. Do you realize that you have an enemy constantly trying to fill your wells with dirt? You lost your effectiveness because water is not flowing in your well, the enemy covered it up. You have become rigid, dry and gasping for breath. The desert scotching sun has left you weary to the point of giving up. You wonder what happened to the healing, restoration and deliverance promised by God to His children. And the most important thing, you have lost connection with God. The explanation is simple, &#8220;your well is covered up&#8221;. Don&#8217;t expect new wells to be dug when there are wells to be uncovered. You have to go back to the old wells and dig them up. Running from place to place is not the answer, self-pity will not work, you have a job to do, rise up and go to work. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 26:18, &#8220;And Isaac <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">dug again <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father&#8221;. <\/span>Your survival depends on whether you have water running. Dig your wells again, you need that first love, that fire to serve Christ, the passion to witness, desire for greater things in line with His will. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">You encounter with the living water, you will not thirst again, but <\/span>no one will do it for you, this is between you and God. You have to take a stand and say, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I will dig my wells again&#8221;. &#8220;I can&#8217;t go on living a defeated life because I allowed the enemy to fill my wells&#8221;<\/span>.

For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">I would like to talk to you this morning about the life of a disciple of Jesus, the true disciple, no longer self seeking, but surrendering their will to the Father, even as Jesus did. Today\u2019s message is very different, so I feel it pertinent to share on this topic the best I can, may God bless His word today. False teachers have crept in unawares, who have corrupted the way of truth. You see them at the bookstores, smiling from the covers. Names like Osteen, Meyer, Dollar, and Hinn have profited from a message that is leading many away from the cross to seek their own comfort and prosperity, ultimately they are being led away from Jesus. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The message Jesus gives us is very different here in Luke\u2019s gospel. If anyone desires to come, He says, let him deny himself. Desires here means they have chosen, they have determined this to be truth. The individual is presented with options, to come or not, and they, upon consideration, have chosen to follow the path that leads to life, knowing the other path, the one of self-comfort and ease, leads to death. Now they must deny themselves, meaning to renounce(to give up, to reject) oneself fully in all respects, to die daily as Paul says to their own desires and ambitions, to all worldliness, to all distractions. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">They take up their cross daily, and follow after Jesus. A.W. Tozer used to say you knew one thing about a man with a cross, he wasn\u2019t coming back. He was going to die. This is what Jesus is saying to us. When I decide to follow Him, it is not so I can benefit from Jesus, as if He owes me something. Christ has saved me, now my life belongs to Him. I take up my cross and go to my death, out of my love for Him. I seek to live as Christ lived, not seeking my own will, but the will of the Father. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Don\u2019t listen to the other voices, if what they say is leading you away from the cross, stop right where you are, repent, and give your life wholly to the Lord Jesus. For Jesus says, whoever desires to save(to protect, preserve) his life will lose it, but whoever loses(to put out of the way, to destroy) his life will save it. What a paradox, and a tremendous contradiction to the popular pulpit of our day. The very thing they are desiring to save, they are going to lose. Where are we today? Are we desiring to save our lives for ourselves? Don\u2019t be fooled friends by what you are hearing. Look at Jesus, learn from Him, He is the way, truth, and life, look to Him, desire Him above all else. Blessed, Jesus says, are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for holiness, for a life entirely devoted to Jesus, surrendered completely to Him, out of a love for Jesus that burns within their heart. He is the true treasure, He alone is life. Are you beaten down today? Abandon yourself to the Lord, be satisfied in Him. Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in His wonderful face, and the things of Earth will grow dim.

I see many on medication to suppress or treat depression. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer. For this reason I think it is one major cause for suicide.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">In the previous chapter we see Elijah gain huge victory over the prophets of Baal when he called fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice he set before the Lord, demonstrating to the people that there was(is) only one true God. He witnessed the prophets of Baal call on their false God who did not answer them for he did not exist. What he does next have all the false prophets killed. Ahab goes home and tells his mean, nasty wife of what Elijah did. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 2 \u201cThen Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time\u201d<\/span>. Hearing such news would sadden you immediately especially from a person you know is capable making it happen. Jezebel declared Elijah a dead man, instead of Elijah being bold representing the God of heaven like he did in mount Carmel, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 3 says, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">\u2026 he arose and ran for his life<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, and went to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there\u201d. <\/span>He forgot about God who had given him victory and shifted his attention on what he heard from Jezebel. As he runs for his life, he abandons his servant so as to be by himself and maybe have pity party. Depression will do this to you, isolate you from people causing you to want to be alone. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Listen to his cry Vs. 4\u201d\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> . And he prayed that he might die, and said, \u201cIt is enough! Now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!\u201d. <\/span>If this could happen to a prophet of God, you may face or are already facing this thing called depression. He became suicidal, desired death, lost hope, lost strength. He forgot his mission and all he could do is sit under a broom tree and wish for death. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">I love what the Lord does with him <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 5, \u201cThen as he lay and slept under a broom tree, suddenly an angel touched him, and said to him, \u201cArise and eat.\u201d 6 Then he looked, and there by his head was a cake baked on coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and lay down again. 7 And the angel of the LORD came back the second time, and touched him, and said, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.\u201d 8 So he arose, and ate and drank; and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God\u201d.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span>Instead of the Lord giving him his wish, the Lord knew what he needed best and that was rest but not just rest but rest in Him. That rest also needed to be fueled with food and water. This is what we need in our depressing times, rest in the Lord, His Word as our food and His Spirit like water to our soul for the journey is long. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">The Lord is not done with making much of Himself thorough the vessels He has raised to show Himself strong on behalf of those that trust in Him<\/span>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Psalm+37:7&amp;version=NKJV\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 37:7<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">,<\/span> \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Do not fret<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> because of him who prospers in his way, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. 8 cease from anger, and forsake wrath; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Do not fret\u2014it only causes harm<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d. <\/span>Have you been dealing with minor depressions because of the Jezebel\u2019s threatening everything in your life causing you to flee?

Many times we speak what we see. What we see indeed can be a fact but believers are not called to live by facts but by faith. In our story, the fact is, there were giants in the land of Canaan but the truth was God had given them the land regardless of the facts. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Yes the Israelites looked like grasshoppers before the Canaanites, however they needed to look at who was with them. If the people of Canaan would have also seen them, they would have looked like grasshoppers before the children of Israel simply because God was with them and God was way bigger than the giants. If you are going to face this year in your own strength and abilities, be ready for disappointments as you face greater obstacles. But when you choose to face it with God on your side, then what is set before you will not be an issue for God is about God in your situation. 2012 will present you with its giants but GOD. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">They that know their God shall do exploits<\/span>&#8220;. You have to know who Your God is and what He is capable of doing to make it in this year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Numbers 13:30, &#8220;Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, &#8220;Let us go up at once and take possession, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">for we are well able to overcome it<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;. <\/span>The name Caleb means a slave or a dog but even with such name, he is a man of God, who has seen God in action many times and whatever they are about to face is not a march to God. His advice, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Let us go at once and take possession<\/span>&#8220;, no time to waste even as we have started the year 2012. Conquerors make every move when they know the time has come. If you saw the giants in the land already, do not be discouraged cause we are able to overcome them. This is not for those who are going by feelings but by faith. Faith negates the facts. The obstacles present cannot be compared to the possessions God has in store for us. Different reports came in but only two had the report the Lord had for His people. Things may be looking tough and complicated, and it may not look like we will make it but God who is able has encouraged us to move in and make it. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ephesians 3:20, &#8220;Now unto Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">according to the power that works within us<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">The power of Christ working within us is propelling us to attempt the impossible because He has made us more than conquerors<\/span>. We can only conquer what God has already conquered. God will not tell you to do something without His help. If He said do it, know that it is been done. Whose report shall you believe?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Numbers 14:1, &#8220;So all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night&#8230; complained against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, &#8220;if only we had died in the land of Egypt!&#8221;.<\/span> It is very easy to forget all the miracles that have happened when you are faced with new obstacles. Looking back at where you came from can bring a temporary relief and desire. God has brought us this far not to take us back but to move us forward. We are climbing from glory to glory. We have gone too far to go back, too deep to turn around and go back. A strategy is needed to fight through and make it to the other side. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What will make you change how you see things is by checking your thoughts, confessions and actions. Caleb&#8217;s thought was &#8220;victory&#8221;, his confession was, &#8220;we are able&#8221;, his action was, &#8220;let&#8217;s move in at once and take possession&#8221;<\/span>. He is associated with many complainers but his faith in God is not shaken by that. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">In this whole story, the reason for their move and victory is not primarily about the Israelites but about God. Ten spies were going to rob God of the glory He would gain through them simply because what they saw, and even discouraging others from doing the same.

Hope you are encouraged with some truth to assist you in this journey that only God can bring us through. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">I am occasionally asked what kind of resolutions I am I making for the new yea. I do not like making resolutions, they tend to backfire, instead I prefer making statements. Resolutions often times goes by one&#8217;s effort, statements in my world is putting it in someone&#8217;s hands I have proven faithful to carry it through me. God&#8217;s Resume does looks good and shines. Tell me who has a good Resume and I will show you who has THE BEST Resume, He has done so much we cannot tell it all. Resolutions are good, they embark on determination but statements are better because they are the acts of declaring. I cannot make a statement on my own but I now can because of who God is.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Numbers 13:1, &#8220;And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, vs. 2, &#8220;Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel&#8230;&#8221;. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">No. 1 spy 2012, SPY THE LAND, see opportunities to grow and progress<\/span>. Spy the possibilities growing deeper and stronger in the Lord in comparison to last year. From day one to this very moment, God had promised the Israelites the land of Canaan. It was described as a land flowing with milk and honey, it had abundance of figs, dates, and nuts there. It was a well-established land but why did they have to spy it when they were already told of what it was all about?, maybe to prove to the Israelites that God meant what He said. 12 spies were sent by Moses saying in<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> vs. 17, &#8220;Go up this way into the south, and go up the mountains vs. 18, and see what the land is like: whether the people who dwell it are strong or weak, few or many&#8230;\u201d. <\/span>Another possible reason<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span>for sending the spies into the land was to see if there were obstacles or not. Yes Moses tells them to check if the land is rich or poor but Moses already knew the richness of that land, only that God did not share with them about obstacles and this is where the 12 spies will bring the message about Canaan&#8217;s richness and obstacles. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Spying the land is not to discourage anyone from going forward but to prepare someone on how to get there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Numbers 13:26, &#8220;Now they departed and came back to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness&#8230;they brought back <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">a word<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> &#8230; and showed them the fruit. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">No. 2, GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE LAND YOU ARE SPYING<\/span>.

Here comes the obstacle, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 28. &#8220;Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong and the cities are fortified and very large<\/span>&#8220;. Can you imagine people&#8217;s first reaction when they heard about the abundance of the land? Very exciting. What melted their hearts was hearing about the obstacles in the land, fortified cities and giants. The entire team of 12 people spoke of the richness of the land, 10 added the reality of the obstacles. Would you rather go by two people&#8217;s reports or ten? Gathering info about the land assist us in decide whether to still embark on the mission or terminate it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Touched on two things, still three to go I will share. I want us to know that we can make it with God in 2012. We can be the channel by which He will glorify Himself when He brings us through facing giants in our lands as He provides for us according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:20). It&#8217;s greatness will depend on your confession on who you rely on. Whose report shall you believe?

He was a just and devout man, waiting, the scriptures teach, for the consolation of Israel; he was waiting for the promised Messiah, having received the promise in himself that he would not see death until he saw the Lord\u2019s Christ. His story is brief, but important, as he gives us a great example of an individual who sought for Christ, and received Christ. No one told Simeon who this child was; he saw Him and knew immediately, that this child was all he ever sought for, and all he ever desired. He was all his joy, the culmination of his life, all he had ever done paled in comparison to this one moment, when he saw Jesus. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Now we see him taking Christ into his arms, which is to us a picture of one truly receiving Christ. He did not merely gaze at the child, but he opened himself, if you would, his heart was open, and more than just entering his arms, Christ entered his heart, Simeon was emptied of himself, he wanted only Jesus. Simeon personally experienced Christ in his life, as we are all called to, not once, but continually, and he desired Jesus more than all else, as we should, with a desire that grows and grows, if we have truly tasted of His goodness. This is what Peter speaks of in I Peter 2:2-3, the continual desire for God, if we have indeed tasted\/experienced Him. His language here speaks of something that is savored and enjoyed, not for personnel gain, or for a mere moral improvement, but out of something much deeper created in the heart, a desire that when satisfied brings about a continual change into the likeness of what is desired, Jesus. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">This knowledge of the Holy One, is the blessed privilege of all in Christ, and Jesus gave His precious life for this purpose. To be holy as He is holy, to know God in divine fellowship is our privilege, neglected by many. The shallowness of the inner experience of God in Christianity today is a travesty, keeping us on the outskirts of the temple, when God has called us to be priests, ministering to Him in the Holy of Holies, in the very Presence of God. It is the pure in heart that will see God(Matthew 5:8), those who strive after God, allowing Him to create in them the pure and holy heart that He will truly inhabit. Simeon sang that his eyes had seen God\u2019s salvation, he knew the hope of Israel within his own heart, he saw and experienced the blessedness of God. He let go of all else, and took hold of the pearl of great price, as must we. Truly coming to Christ will cost you your life, but you will receive much more, and in the end, eternal fellowship with God, when He will take each true believer into His arms, into His presence forever and ever.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">That Christ alone may be glorified, Brother Benjamen<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 2:28- he took Him up in his arms and blessed God..

Imagine that this was a routine of the Lord, and that there was a particular place that he would go to pray and they knew therefore where to find him at that time. However, what about, or perhaps this was the first time he did this? They searched and found him in prayer, or to say another way, they caught him praying. R.C. Sproul shares, &#8220;<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The verb used for their search is more better conveyed as the disciples were hunting high and low to find Jesus. And when they do find him they question him in the form of a thinly veiled rebuke as if to say to him, &#8216;there is no time for you to pray, your fame is spreading and many seekers are awaiting you to minister to them, there is much ministry to do<\/span>.'&#8221; The people wanting to meet with Jesus could care less about is prayer time with the Father&#8217; and realize there are times when many will not care about your prayer life either. This unfortunately includes some leaders in the local church. Do you care more of using your gifts and talents that God gave you, even if your private spiritual disciplines of prayer and Bible reading are neglected? Oh how I have seen pastors place new believers quickly into leadership when there is no prayer life&#8230;what a tragedy! Many are more interested in what you can do, than who you are in Christ.

How much more important is the God that we serve, to get alone with Him, and seek him. It is true that one can meet with God anywhere, but one should establish a place as free from distraction as possible. It was Susanna Wesley mother of John and Charles Wesley that had nineteen children, but still would make it a point to get alone with God. Her kids knew when mom threw her apron over her head, not to disturb her because she was meeting with God. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Jeremiah 29:12<\/span> states, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">&#8220;Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. 13&nbsp;You will seek me and find me, when you seek me \ufeffwith all your heart. 14&nbsp;I will be found by you, declares the Lord&#8230;\u201d. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">We must seek him, because if we do we will find Him!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Praying-Christ centered prayer<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. <\/span>Again if there was one that could have forsaken prayer, one would certainly think that Christ would be the one. After all He knew the will of the Father, and walked perfectly in His will. Yet He loved the Father and desired, departed, and went to have intimate fellowship with Him. One might set up one\u2019s life in discipline, and then end up doing something other than praying. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Christ was the Word of God in the flesh, yet still prayed. He showed the perfect balance of prayer and the Word of God. John Chapter 17 records the high priestly prayer of Christ. However just prior to this, E.M. Bounds reminds us &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Jesus had just finished instructing His disciples (John 13-16)<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">. Now He prayed for them, because prayer and the Word of God go together. If we have all Bible but no prayer, we may have a great deal of truth but no power. It would be &#8220;light without heat.&#8221; On the other hand, if we have all prayer but no Bible teaching, we are in danger of becoming fanatics-heat without light! Zeal is a good thing, but zeal without knowledge is usually destructive. A proper balance of Bible study and prayer is important to a balanced Christian life. &#8220;Moreover, as for me,&#8221; said the godly prophet Samuel, &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">&#8221; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">(1 Samuel 12:23).<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> Note the balance of prayer and the Word of God. &#8220;And now I commend you to God [that\u2019s prayer] and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up..<\/span>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">When you are in prayer, you must be guided be the Holy Spirit but of course the Holy Spirit will certainly move and flow in perfect alignment with the Word of God. George Wood stated, &#8220;<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The Holy Spirit is like a river, and the sword of God is like the banks of the river. The river will never overflow beyond of the banks of the river<\/span>\u201d Make sure that your prayer life is bathed in the Word of God.

When do you go to the Father in prayer, is it when you need something, when you are out of solutions, or perhaps when you have exhausted all your other resources and options?. I think we can all testify that we are guilty at some level of a lack of prayer for one reason or another. Can the man that has a busy work schedule, or a mother busy with her children, or an athlete busy with his or her schedule use the excuse that there is simply not enough time? Funny isn&#8217;t it how people can use the provisions of God, the job He provided, the talents He showered upon us, the relationships He blessed us with yet would He provide these things all at the expense of being in relationship with the very ones He calls His own children? We must pray, and I am not referencing those that claim that they pray all day long, whole driving, while at work, while walking, etc&#8230;. Imagine having a relationship like that with your spouse, children, or a dear friend, how intimate is that relationship going to be if you are not actually sitting down apart from distractions together? If there was anyone that did not need to pray, but that certainly modeled prayer it was certainly our Lord Jesus. Mark records the routine prayer life of Christ in the first chapter and verse thirty-five of the book bearing his name. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">The ESV study Bible states, there are four verbs (rising\/departed\/went\/prayed) [and thus might I add modeled which] emphasize Jesus\u2019 resolve to have fellowship with his Father. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Rising-Prayer begins with desire and manifests in discipline. <\/span>First, Jesus rises at a very early hour while it was still dark. He had just endured a rigorous day of ministry the previous day, but he nevertheless arises early to refresh Himself in prayer. Why? One must establish a discipline of waking up early, at a time free from distractions to enter into an atmosphere to get alone with God and get refreshed from labor whether it is ministry specific or not. Christ desired to be alone with His Father to be in intimate relationship with Him. Consider this: Christ never lost something that he needed to pray to find, He was never sick (as far as Scripture records) so he did not need to be healed from an infirmity, he didn&#8217;t seek a prestigious occupation, actually he left his carpentry shop for the road ministry. He did not own His own home that he needed to beautify. He yearned however to be in intimate fellowship with His Father, and made provision in His life to do just that. Oh that I would have that same constant desire and yearning.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Departing<\/span>&#8211;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Prayer begins with departing from others to enter into fellowship with the Father. <\/span>Christ left His twelve disciples for a time being, the same ones that the Father gave Him (John 17) to raise up, and departed from their company so he could get alone with the Father. Perhaps if He would have stayed there he would have been distracted by the sounds of sleeping or perhaps, if I may use some preaching license here, snoring disciples. Perhaps he would have thought about the activity and even the shenanigans they displayed throughout the previous day as he looked upon them as they slept. Do you ever get distracted by attempting to pray where you are, perhaps in a room with a television, computer, or some other hobby or pastime your enjoy? Do you find yourself being drawn toward those other things rather than to the Lord? I ask these questions because I have been there. I just wanted to check my email real quick, to the neglect then of my &#8220;knee mail&#8221;. Would I prefer hearing from another or from the Lord? When Jesus asked the twelve if they were going to leave Him and depart like the false converts of John 6:66, Peter replied, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, 69&nbsp;and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.\u201d<\/span> Do you and I believe that?

The moment you are labeled a Christian or identified with Christ, the moment eyes are watching you. To this end it becomes difficult to identify with Christ when your words and actions ado not line up. I have people who are still waiting to hear me cuss under pressure, throw stuff around. We live in a world where bad news sells faster than good news and it takes one bad news to override all the good. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">As believers, there will be those times we will stumble, get weak, weary, tired and even fall, however, we are overcomers because we identify with Him. When you know there are people on the lookout, you will strive to please God knowing that it\u2019s by Him and through Him. Everywhere we go, we are to be Christians, Christ like representing Him. Yes we will have people waiting for us to fall but that shouldn&#8217;t change how we feel about ourselves a in Christ. We are not out to please men, but God who raised us from things we couldn&#8217;t raise ourselves from. Our display of His glory is not even to show that we are better than the unsaved, it is to show that we have found a Treasure. We ought not to be ashamed of who we are in Christ. When I look back where He pulled me from, I cannot but brag of Him before people. John the Baptist identified with Him and actually bragged about Christ, he said<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, Matthew 3:11, \u201c I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire\u201d<\/span>. How many waited to see John stumble? How about Jesus Himself?. The Pharisees kept on trying to find fault with Him, tested Him but still they could not. How much more will we be faced with the Pharisees of today? <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The bible says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Let us lay aside every weight<\/span>&#8220;, what are the weights that weigh a believer down, guilt, fear, doubt, failing to please people like you want to. Our aim is to please God through our <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(3W) Worship, Walk and Work<\/span>. Anything we do, we do it to please Him, we shine to please Him as we also salt to please Him. We eliminate anything standing in the way of serving Him. God knows how to bring you where He wants you because He has confidence in His hands. People will only tell you of what they think but not do anything about it, God will do the opposite. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;And the sin which so easily ensnares us&#8221;, <\/span>we know of those sins that are easy to fall into over and over again that we got to deal with. Sin is simply doing what God does not approve off. Very easy to sin than to stay pure but God&#8217;s standard still remains. What are we doing to deal with those sins that easily ensnares us?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And let us run with endurance the race that is set before us&#8221;. <\/span>God is not in a hurry. Yes there is a rush to get the sinners saved but when it comes to worshipping, walking and working with Him, He is not in a hurry. Ask Jeremiah who went to the Potter&#8217;s house. The Potter was busy working on clay on the wheel. He happened to have noticed the Potter taking His sweet time working on that vessel. This is a long journey that requires patience in the race, fighting obstacles and barriers on the way looking towards the mark of the high calling. It is not a race to see who will get to the finish line first, it is a race that requires faithfulness till the end. Look at it this way, the marathon runners do not allow themselves to be distracted by the people lining by the road watching them, they have a number on the chest that identifies them in the race, they keep their eyes on the finish line. Do not allow yourself to be distracted on your race by the Pharisees. Lay aside what weighs you down, repent of the sins that easily ensnares you and then continue to run with endurance the race set before you as identify with Him.

You will agree with me that how you perceive yourself has a way of affecting your life. I would say that what we think of about ourselves in Christ matters a lot. If you continue to see yourself defeated, sooner or later you begin develop those symptoms. What comes out your mouth is a reflection of what you have inside. Speaking defeat indicates you are harboring defeat inside. This boils down to, whose report will you believe? Either you are going to be like Joshua and Caleb who brought good report or the other 10 spies the bible does not even waste time giving us their names who brought a different report, report of defeat.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">What comes out of your mouth can be build or tear, can sweeten or poison. The Shunamite woman saw her dead situation, however faith inside drove her to believe God. Because of what she believed, she pushed it out of her mouth with such great confession of faith, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">All is well with my soul<\/span>&#8220;. We also see the woman with the issue of blood knowing her condition still sought for healing which propelled her to push out of her faith, she said &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">If I may but touch the hem of his garment, I know will be made whole<\/span>&#8220;. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Two common things with these women, they both had evident problems but they did not allow them to define how they felt about themselves in the situation<\/span>. They understood the concept of as &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">you think in your heart so are you&#8221;<\/span> and therefore they refused to give in to defeat. I am not saying ignore and deny reality, I am saying <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">see the reality as a means by which God will do something and make a stand on God\u2019s promises by faith<\/span>. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">A part from what we think of ourselves, we have to be very careful about what we speak into others especially our kids. Parents, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 22:6, says &#8220;Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it<\/span>&#8220;. You call your child dumb, stupid, worthless, he will grow seeing himself that way. Parents ought to invest in their kids that regardless of what other people see and say to them, you have greater faith in God for them so you invest in them. You have the passion, the zeal to bring them up in the way God desires of you. Kids learn mostly from what they observe, and who better observe than you. Who better lay a foundation but you. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">A husband abusing his wife exposes his kids and sends a message that it\u2019s ok to abuse a spouse and may one day repeat what they see. If they comes from abusive home physically and verbally, they may likely do the same. Parents have to set an example by their life style and what comes out of their mouths. I fail to understand why many parents are frustrated with their kids when they sowed wrong seeds in them, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Galatians 6:7, &#8220;Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap<\/span>&#8220;. You are the role model for your kids. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Parents instead of worrying about what your kids will turn out to be when you turn them loose, go into prayer closet, intercede for them. Lay your hands on them, speak life into them and let them know that you are there for them. Encourage them, build confidence in them to trust God. A strong foundation laid will not be shaken by what others may say contrary to what you have invested in them. Provide discipline a sign of love, lead them to church a place of growth and be the one who they look up to. Most kids feel their dads are the most valuable people, strong; one they want to be like when they grow up, do not take that away from them by the wrong things you do and speak over them. How do you think of yourself, what are the confessions to show what is inside? how does what you do or say affect the younger generation?

It started off with Elijah and Elisha, then Moses, and it can certainly go on and on. Training people is a key element if one wants their legacy to live. Military leaders train soldiers to engage enemies in war, and place their lives on the line if need be. How does a man convince another man to be in a place that bullets are flying all around?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">The twelve had the best training, by the greatest communicator ever, Jesus Himself. However there was one element missing and Jesus said that He would have to leave for another to come upon them. They needed the Spirit of Christ to be in them, as He would illuminate all that Jesus taught them. Jesus sends His Spirit to rest upon the disciples and the others in the Upper Room. Jesus was forthright and confident telling them, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you&#8230;&#8221;<\/span> There was no question in the mind of the Master, this was going to happen!. If they were going to do God&#8217;s work, God&#8217;s Spirit upon their lives was a necessity. They were going to make sure that the Gospel would reach the world. It was by this very Spirit that the blind eyes were opened, that the deaf ears were released, the dumb could speak, the lame could walk, the sick were made whole, and even the dead were raised!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">If we are to win the lost to Christ it must be done through the power of the Spirit of God. The Spirit of Christ is a Spirit that compels us to love our neighbor as ourselves enough to share our faith with them. There are many unsaved people that will spend eternity in Hell, because the Holy Spirit is not in their lives. How does that rest with you? If His spirit is in you it will shine out of you. Do you have His Spirit in you?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">1. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Jerusalem will have a witness<\/span>. Those in closest proximity to you will hear the Gospel because of you. Perhaps speaking to your family and friends about the things of God seems like a grueling task. Who else is going to tell them? Do you love them enough to swallow pride, fear, etc&#8230;, and share the truth with them? If you haven&#8217;t already, why not tell them today!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">2. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Judea and Samaria will have a witness.<\/span> &#8220;Social outcasts&#8221; are around.

Perhaps your job, your family situation, a medical condition, recent news, responsibilities, etc\u2026. Moses found himself with a heavy burden upon him as the children of Israel were crying and complaining that they had no meat to eat. Now they did have fresh manna each morning, but they were chocking on their blessing with their attitude. Here is what Moses said to God vs. 11-15, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">He asked the LORD, \u201cWhy have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me? Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers? Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, \u2018Give us meat to eat!\u2019 I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me. If this is how you are going to treat me, put me to death right now\u2014if I have found favor in your eyes\u2014and do not let me face my own ruin.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Despite the fact that Moses felt that the burden was too heavy for him, God doesn\u2019t tell Moses that He will remove the burden from Moses\u2019 shoulders. Instead God is going to share the burden and take some of the weight of the burden off Moses shoulders. God summons Moses and, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 16 \u201cThe LORD said to Moses: \u201cBring me seventy of Israel\u2019s elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you. 17 I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">God knew that Moses\u2019 had the right spirit for the task at hand, but that Moses\u2019 spirit needed to be upon others if Moses was going to last in the long hall and not burn out. Moses wanted the Lord to actually take his life \u2013 he wanted to die! The spirit that was upon Moses was the Spirit of God fleshed out in the life of Moses. By God\u2019s Spirit Moses applied his faith and defied the Pharaoh, called down plagues, opened the Red Sea and went through it on dry ground. This was the spirit that God would place upon others to preserve His servant Moses. Elijah\u2019s spirit rested upon Elisha, and now Moses\u2019 spirit would rest upon the seventy. Just as the proof of Elisha had Elijah\u2019s spirit upon him shown in the parting of the Jordan, Moses spirit upon the seventy would be manifested in their prophesying. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">God saw fit to take Moses\u2019 spirit and place it upon others to accomplish His work. Would God take your spirit and place it upon others? What kind of spirit do you have? Perhaps you\u2019ve not defied a Pharaoh, or parted a sea, but there are some things perhaps that you have done by the hand of God that have been amazing. This whole thing as well is the process of discipleship, one\u2019s spirit being imparted by the Lord upon another. Allow God to work on your spirit that he may place it upon others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Happy New year from all of us here.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good Morning! &nbsp; \u201cAnd I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. \ufeff(Numbers 11:17) NIV &nbsp; What comes to [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2531","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-EP","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2531","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=2531"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2531\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2533,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2531\/revisions\/2533"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=2531"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=2531"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=2531"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":2528,"date":"2011-12-29T19:33:00","date_gmt":"2011-12-29T14:03:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=2528"},"modified":"2011-12-30T07:30:21","modified_gmt":"2011-12-30T02:00:21","slug":"who-craves-your-spirit-part-2-by-pastor-phil-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2011\/12\/29\/who-craves-your-spirit-part-2-by-pastor-phil-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Who Craves Your Spirit &#8211; Part 2 By Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Good Morning, <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">\u201cThe company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, \u201cThe spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha.\u201d And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him\u201d, 2 Kings 2:15<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Elisha was like the vice-present prophet in the days of Elijah. He was chosen by Elijah, and through the time spent together he craved the spirit that was upon Elijah. Before being taken up in a chariot of fire by a whirlwind of God, Elijah asked to Elisha, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cTell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?<\/span>\u201d To which Elisha replied, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cLet me inherit a double portion of your spirit<\/span>.\u201d Elisha didn\u2019t want a material possession of Elijah. He wanted that which can only come through impartation, Elijah\u2019s spirit. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Elijah is taken up by God, and Elisha picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. Vs. 14. \u201cThen he took the cloak that had fallen from him and struck the water with it. \u201cWhere now is the LORD, the God of Elijah<\/span>?\u201d he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over. WOW! He wanted to know if God was going to be with him, in the power that God was with Elijah. He craved Elijah\u2019s spirit and wanted to know if he had received the double portion that he desired. He had a cloak in is hand (tangible), but did he have the spirit (intangible)? At one time Elijah had placed the cloak upon Elisha when he first chose Elisha to follow him as his disciple (1 Kings 19:19-21). The cloak (mantle) was once placed symbolically upon him, but now it would be upon him permanently.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Elisha retraces the steps of his master and goes back to Jordan to perform the exact same miracle that Elijah had done by parting the waters of the Jordan (2 Kings 2:8). He strikes the water with the cloak and the water divided. Then the company of prophets who were watching said, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH IS RESTING UPON ELISHA. And they went to meet him and BOWED TO THE GROUND.\u201d<\/span> Elisha wasn\u2019t trying to make a spectacle of himself, he was just exercising by faith the \u201cproof\u201d of the spirit that was upon him by putting his faith to the test. If the spirit was truly upon him, it would be evident. Elisha didn\u2019t brag or boast, he simply asked and believed. The impartation was clearly recognizable to the prophets that knew Elijah. They bowed in reverence to the chief prophet Elisha<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol style=\"margin-left:.375in;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\" type=\"1\">\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Whose spirit do you have upon you?

If only that were possible for me! In trying to win a girls heart over they are having a toast, and I think that perhaps this is the sixth or seventh toast of that repeated day and finally he says let\u2019s drink to world peace. Many people want world peace, and then above verse have been used to substantiate that sort of wishful thinking, especially around this Christmas season. Why is it wishful thinking, because the Scripture reads that there is condition for this peace spoken of and that is that God\u2019s favor is resting upon a person\u2019s life?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Peace is not the absence of war as some might think. It is not the serenity of sitting on a beautiful beach under the palm trees. It is not the absence of trouble in one\u2019s life. Peace is not any of these things. The Scripture reads, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">but righteousness, and peace, and joy<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> in the Holy Ghost (Rom 14:17). Look at the particular order in which peace comes, after righteousness, and then follows joy.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Let me illustrate what I mean as I believe that this is the ultimate picture of peace. IN Matt 8, Jesus leads his disciples into a boat, and then he goes and takes a nap. \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Without warning, a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. 25 The disciples went and woke him, saying, \u201cLord, save us! We\u2019re going to drown!\u201d Mt 8:26 He replied, \u201cYou of little faith, why are you so afraid?\u201d Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">When one follows Jesus, repents of their sins and submits their will to His, for the first time righteousness is in their character instead of worldliness. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James 4<\/span> reads, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.<\/span>\u201d Once someone repents of their sin, and knows that the victor of death, hell, and the grace lives in them, how can that person help but to experience the peace that God desires for their lives? This is because their will becomes aligned with God\u2019s will. There is a sort of magnetic attraction that takes place that pleases the Lord. When one has the righteousness of Christ, and the peace is realized of spending eternity with Him, and no longer separated from Him, joy erupts! What is joy? Again let me share what joy is not. Joy is not getting a new \u201ctoy\u201d a raise at work, entering into a new relationship, etc\u2026. No, these are things that bring us happiness. Happiness is circumstantial and contingent upon things. However, the circumstances change and the things wear down, break, and could be stolen. The constitution tells us that we have the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but I believe that God tells us that He gives life (more abundantly) (John 10:10), liberty (because He is the perfect Law of liberty) (James 1:25) and the pursuit [and gain] of righteousness. Paul said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Phil 3:9, \u201c\u2026and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ-the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith [in Christ].\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Application: Humanity can never have peace on earth, until righteousness begins in one\u2019s own life and heart. Apart from the Lord, there is no peace. If you have no peace in your life, then today is your day to repent and align your will with God\u2019s. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Blessings <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Pastor Phil<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 2:14, \u201cGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.\u201d When I think of world peace, I think of the movie Groundhogs Day, where Bill Murray lives the same day over and over until he gets it right.

Oops, I didn\u2019t mail out the phone bill on time nor the electric bill. Sound all too familiar? Yes at times we forget things over and over that so desperately need to be remembered. And because we live in the world and think of things in the natural, we often forget about the things we don\u2019t see, behind the scenes in the spiritual realm. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">There is a whole lot more going on in our lives than most of us have been led to believe. Take Christmas for example, most of you probably have a Nativity scene that you set up on a mantel, coffee table, or under your Christmas tree. Most Nativity sets have the usual cast of character: shepherds, wise men, maybe a few barnyard animals, Joseph, Mary, and of course Baby Jesus. Yes, some also have an angel or two, but that\u2019s about as far as the supernatural gets. What is the overall mood of such a scene? Don\u2019t they all have a sort of warm pastoral atmosphere to them, a quiet, intimate feel like one you would experience while singing softly the songs of Silent Night or Away in a Manger? And while that\u2019s all true it\u2019s also very deceiving, because it\u2019s not a full picture of what is going on. For that you have to turn to Revelation 12, and see the behind the scenes of what is really going on, something I never realized until it was brought to my attention by two completely different resources, one being a book called Wild at Heart, and the other being some good friends of ours. I knew God wanted me to grasp this reality of the spiritual atmosphere of the Christmas story. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Revelation 12:1, \u201cA great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads. His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born. She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter\u2026 (v. 7) And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 8 But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. 9 The great dragon was hurled down&#8211;that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">As Philip Yancy says, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I have never seen this version of the Christmas story on a Christmas card. Yet it is the truer story, the rest of the picture of what was going on that fateful night. <\/span>Yancy calls the birth of Christ the Great Invasion<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201ca daring paid by the ruler of the forces of good into the universe\u2019s seat of evil<\/span>.\u201d Spiritually speaking, this is no silent night. It is D-Day. It\u2019s almost beyond my comprehension altogether, yet it is part of the foundation of my faith. We live in parallel worlds or realms. One world is that which we can see of buildings, politicians, moneys, computers, etc\u2026, while the other is a world which most don\u2019t see which consists of angels and demons, and the reality of the spiritual realm. I say most don\u2019t see because Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, etc\u2026, all saw angels plainly. Some of us can discern demonic activity, but to see it, is rare. I have seen into the spiritual realm after an attack on my faith by the Enemy to turn from Jesus and serve him only once. And once was enough. Needless to say, I submitted to God, called on the name of Jesus, and he fled.\u201d It was a fierce battle for my soul when I was just a teen, not very strong in the Lord, but the Lord was very strong in His protection over me, because all I knew was to reject the devil and call on Jesus. Never had something like this happen to you, that\u2019s good, but it happened to me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">In Rev. 12, the child is born, the women escapes and the story continues like this: Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring&#8211;those who obey God&#8217;s commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus. We are the rest of the offspring that obey God\u2019s commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus. Do you realize there is more going on than meets the eye? Do you know how to fight spiritually? Read Ephesians 6:10-17 learn, and mediate on it. Have a band or brothers or sisters that fight with you. Be committed to a good local church and don&#8217;t be an orphan Christian.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Blessings,<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; Whoops I forgot to turn off the coffee pot again.

Exodus tells us about the Israelites\u2019 moving from Egypt through wilderness to a land God promised them. Exodus means a journey by a large group to escape from a hostile environment. This also means departure of a large number of people from one place to another. Always Egypt becomes the type of the world we are brought out of and we see the Israelites being brought out of it. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">As believers, we have the tendency of wanting to look back from where we have come from when the road is hard. Trying to compare it with where we are going. The Israelites kept on reminding themselves of where they had come from and could make it back there easily if they wanted to. Not only were they in a position to go back, the Egyptians were also chasing after them until they had a Red sea experience that would divide them for once and for all. Red sea experience always separates the old from the new. It causes you to cross over with no way of coming back to the other side. Hear Moses speaking to the Israelites just before they crossed in<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Exodus 14:13, &#8220;And Moses said to the people, &#8220;Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which He will accomplish for you today. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall see again no more forever<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.\u201d<\/span> Their complaint was that though they had it rough in Egypt, at least it was better than being in the wilderness and being pursued. To make it worse, they had come to what they would call the end of the road, dead end; however, Moses tells them that they will see the Egyptians no more. Before them was a sea, behind them was an army and right in their midst they have a man with a promise. Both behind and before are facts, in the middle requires faith. They are told not to be afraid, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord but how? They cry to God and <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 15, &#8221; the LORD said to Moses; &#8220;Why do you cry to Me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward<\/span>&#8220;. Time to progress, move to new things, yes there seems to be an obstacle, going back is not an option as easy as it may be. They could have begged for forgiveness from the Egyptians than face the sea and drown. This was not the time to cry, this was a time to act on God\u2019s word.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Don&#8217;t we want to move forward when we know what we are moving forward to? Don&#8217;t we want things done before we can move? God wants us to take Him at His word even when it sounds foolish and unrealistic. This is faith, less dependent on instincts and more dependent on God&#8217;s word. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Isaiah 43:16,&#8221;Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea, And a path through the mighty waters<\/span>&#8220;, by moving forward, God made a way where there seemed to have been no way.

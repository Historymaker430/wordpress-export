              "<strong>Luke 22:39-46,“39 When He came to the place, He said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</strong>\r\n\r\nOne struggle in our lives as believers is having a prayer life. Even men mightily used of God confess their struggle too. Daily prayer is essential in our walk with God. We need to understand that God does not need prayers to be God, we need prayers to be like God (Jesus), to walk in His ways for we are His children. We do not pray because we want to, we pray because we need to.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAs Jesus time for crucifixion grew near, He began to prepare His disciples for what was to come. The very best was to tell Peter to be ready for the devil had desired to sift him as wheat and to assure him of His prayers for him. This was not just for Peter but also for the rest of the disciples. Jesus already warned them, Peter in particular that an egregious trial was imminent. Sadly, that warning as well as His imploring them to pray went unheeded. It did not burden them to do something about what Jesus had told them. This leads me to make this point, those troubled have little or no sleep in their minds. Those troubled will be in vertical position rather than horizontal position. They understand that it is time to watch and pray.\r\n\r\nJesus went up the mountain to pray and He brought with Him Peter, James and John. He left them somewhere to pray while He went further to another division of the mountain to pray. <strong>He prayed earnestly, faithfully, agonizing and in anguish</strong>. It was an intense prayer time unlike other times. While He prayed, He came to check on the disciples and said to them <strong>\"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak\"</strong>, <strong>Matthew 26:39. </strong>To stand strong in the face of what awaited them, they needed to pray. Jesus also knew their spirit was willing but their flesh was too weak. Another point, <strong>the willing spirit must concur unwilling flesh to yield to what is needed the most in this crucial hour. </strong>The flesh does not like the idea of praying, however it needs it to escape temptations. The body needs it for provision, guidance, protection etc. Coming back to check on His friends, He found them fast asleep, when they awoke, He asked them, \"<strong>What! Could you not watch with Me one hour?”, Matthew 26:40. “</strong>Watch” here means pray. Wow, the Lord would have loved for them to pray with Him at least an hour.\r\n\r\n<b>Luke 22</b> gives clear reasons why they needed to pray. If the Master was arrested as He would, 1. Their faith would be shaken to the point of denying Christ. 2. Their unity was going to be in jeopardy. You take away the shepherd, the sheep is destined to scatter, 3. They needed to stay solid in God’s will even in the midst of the trial ahead of them. 4. They needed to be strong. Prayer was desperately needed in their case.\r\n\r\nWhat is currently happening in the world ought to remind us that we are in a very crucial moments in life. The question is, are we watching and praying? I don't see any hope outside of praying. We can champion for morality all day long, support political activities that bring about change, rally against things threatening, families, lives. Without watching and praying, our labors will profit a little. Paul says, “<strong>For bodily exercise profits a little...”, 1Timothy 4:8 </strong>to make it clear. Will we give ourselves to prayers?

              "<strong>1Kings 21:1-21, vs. “15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” 16 So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite”. </strong>\r\n\r\nIn reading this story, something that might have started very small and very innocent snow balled to something big because of Ahab’s ambition that clouded his judgment, to the extent that he would not restrain his wife from doing wicked. Then his next actions after what happened indicates he approved what was done.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe first thing, he approached Naboth about his vineyard, <strong>vs.</strong> “<strong>2</strong> <strong>So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it <em>is</em> near, next to my house; and for it I will give you a vineyard better than it. <em>Or,</em> if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.” </strong>I do not see anything wrong with his approach to desiring the vineyard and offering money or a better vineyard to Naboth. Where things began to change for Ahab is when Naboth chose to honor God by not willing to sell his vineyard. The reason was that the vineyard was his ancestral property. The Lord, the owner of all of the land of Israel, had forbidden Israelite families to surrender ownership of family lands permanently (<strong>Leviticus 25:23–28; Numbers 36:7–9).</strong> Out of loyalty to God, Naboth declined Ahab’s offer. Instead of Ahab accepting Naboth’s explanation, his ambition to get this vineyard drove him into depression indicating coveting and obsession spirit had come in. He would rather have Naboth disobey God so as to get what he wants. He had everything but still wanted Naboth’s vineyard. How do you react when you can’t get what you are ambitious to get? What are you willing to do to get it? How far are you willing to fulfill your ambitions? At what and whose expense? You may not think and act like Ahab, but the question is, would the Lord be pleased with what you are pursuing and how you are pursuing it?\r\n\r\nUpon Jezebel hearing what happened when she saw Ahab depressed and would not eat, <strong>vs.“7 Then Jezebel his wife said to him, “You now exercise authority over Israel! Arise, eat food, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”</strong> His wife response sounded something like this \"<i>you are the king, you can do whatever you want and get it. Forget about the true judgment, get what you are ambitious to have and if you find it hard, I will get it for you\"</i>. Jezebel then wrote letters and sealed them with Ahab’s name. In the letters there were lies accusing Naboth of blaspheming God and the king. This led to his death by stoning. One man who wanted to honor God was accused of dishonoring God because one man was ambitious to get whatever did not belong to him. <strong>Vs. “16 So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIs it not sad that ambitions have brought wedges upon some family members? Sometimes people will go against their judgments so as to get what they are ambitious for, that which does not belong to them? That they would do whatever it takes to get what is not theirs. People can also be very ambitious in business that it clouds their judgments, e.g. if they cannot get what they aspire for, there are driven to do shady business to get their way which in turn dishonors God. Check your motives, don't let your ambitions in anyway cloud your judgment hence you dishonor God like Ahab. Do what you need to do in line with God's word and then learn to be content with what God gives you. One act of compromise could open doors for greater evil. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Timothy 6:10, “For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil\", Ecclesiastes 10:19, \"A feast is made for laughter, And wine makes merry; But money answers everything\"</strong>\r\n\r\nA message commonly preached especially on TV is the message on prosperity. Who doesn’t want to be blessed financially? Rarely do I share along these lines, it's not my priority message but I believe God blesses His people and uses these blessing to further His kingdom too.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf you were to receive a million bucks, you will have a list of things to do with it. A house may be first, then other things like investments, give to God to further His kingdom, feed the hungry and support the poor in Africa, Asia and even South America. Money can do a lot of things the bible tells us and we all know that to be true. We work for money, to pay our bills. We need money to live comfortably, you go to restaurant and money will be required of you. The world does not understand any language but the money language. Eat at a restaurant and try and offer faith to pay for your meals and see if it works. A man of faith needs money. I do not live by luck but by faith, luck would mean playing lotto hoping to hit a jackpot, gambling hoping to win. We serve a God of too much; we can have faith in Him to provide what we need.\r\n\r\nDoes God support prosperity, wealth, and money? <strong>Deuteronomy 8:18, \"And you shall remember the LORD your God, for it is He who gives you power to get wealth</strong>\". Though this was a promise to the Israelites if they met required conditions, the principle still applies to us but not the equivalent of a covenant and not a guarantee. Wealth here does not only talk about money but He does support it. He gives the power, the ability, skills, and ideas on how to gain it and then to complete it, He helps such people enjoy what He has provided them with. <strong>Ecclesiastes 2:24, “Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God\"</strong>. I would say, <strong>\"Prosperity without God is trading on a dangerous path</strong>\". There are people today who are rich but are not enjoying what they have, it’s not bringing them peace or even joy, it has broken some families to mention a few. If every good and every perfect gift comes from above, the same author who provides prosperity is the same that will have to navigate it<strong>. Ecclesiastes 5:18-19, vs. \"18...It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor in which he toiled under the sun all the days of his life which God gives him, for it his heritage</strong>. <b>1</b><strong>9, \"As for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and given him power to eat of it, to receive his heritage and rejoice in his labor, this is the gift of God</strong>”. By just looking at the few verses, I don’t see any shortcut anywhere, it requires hard work.\r\n\r\nProsperity could begin by having an idea, ability, talents and knowledge. <strong>Ecclesiastes 7:12, “For wisdom is a defense as money is a defense but the excellence of the knowledge is, wisdom gives life to those who have it</strong>”. Having wealth, prosperity, money whichever way you look at it requires wisdom to back it up for one to have life. The scripture we just looked at says, <strong>wisdom gives life to them that have money</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe same bible that supports wealth and riches also warns seriously of what it can do to a person, <strong>Matthew 19:24, \"And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God</strong>”. It’s very clear that riches have made man forget God. No wonder Solomon, a man who God had given riches speaks these words to us in,<strong> Proverbs 30:8-9, vs. \"8...Give me neither poverty nor riches…vs. 9, “Lest I be full and deny You and say, “Who is the Lord?” or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God</strong>”. Solomon had riches because God had blessed Him but at the same time he allowed things in his life such as the women he married and those who were his concubines to turn his heart from God. <strong>1Timothy 6:10, “For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil</strong>”. For those who thought that money is evil, it’s not so, it’s the love of it. I would also say that lack of money is also the root of all kinds of evil according to <b>Proverbs 30:8.</b>\r\n\r\nEven in hard work, ambitions can cloud your judgment. Contentment with God takes you far. The world craves for happiness, believers ought to crave for righteousness. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Kings 5:20, vs. “20 Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, \"My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.\" (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nLet’s see how Gehazi’s untamed passion destroyed his life. The first mistake he made, he desired what his master let go and ran after Namaan to get something for himself. Two, he lied on his master the Prophet<strong>, vs. 22, “And he said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Indeed, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the mountains of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.” </strong>To use someone’s name to get things or get a head is deadly, it tarnishes your reputation and integrity, also opens doors to destroy other peoples’ lives. Who wants to work with a big liar?\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nNaaman gives him as much as he asks for, he takes and hides them. No shame on his part after all he has everything he wanted, what he was passionate about and what he opened himself to get. Three, upon asked where he had been by his master the prophet, he chose to lie to him too <strong>vs. \"25 … Elisha said to him, “Where did you go, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant did not go anywhere.” </strong>He was trying by all means to cover his tracks not remembering that he was dealing with a prophet who God had used to see what was happening in a king’s camp, who saw things beyond the natural. Elisha says, <strong>vs. “26…Did not my heart go with you when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you?\". </strong>What if he came clean, we don’t know if Elisha may have chosen to forgive him. The bible says in <strong>Proverbs 28:13, “He who covers his sins will not prosper, But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy”.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. \"26… Is it time to receive money and to receive clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants?\". </strong>“Is it time” shows me that there was time to receive, time to be blessed, this was not the time and the way to get it. The desires of his heart brought about Elisha’s curse upon him, <b>vs. \"2</b><strong>7 Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your descendants forever.” And he went out from his presence leprous, as white as snow”. </strong>Instead of getting gifts Naaman brought with him, he received the sickness Naaman got healed of. I wonder if he wished at this point Naaman never came. This is why we always need to remember <strong>Genesis 4:7, “…sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it”. </strong>The enemy knows what we respond to well.\r\n\r\nThe love of money is the root of all evil, was at the bottom of Gehazi's sin. He thought to impose upon the prophet, but soon found that the Spirit of prophecy could not be deceived, and that it was in vain to lie to the Holy Ghost. What you crave for is what you will be opened to pursue. While the world craves for happiness and pursues it, we as believers ought to pursue righteousness. Paul in his life had things he pursued which were assets to him but when Christ met him, all his assets he characterized as liabilities. There was nothing as fulfilling as living for Christ., <strong>Philippians 3:7-8, vs. \"7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ</strong>”. The more he pursued Christ, the more he was content. One act of untamed passions destroyed Gehazi, his health, his family, his reputation, tainted his character, his ministry, his destiny. Let us beware of hypocrisy and covetousness, and dread the curse of spiritual leprosy remaining on our souls. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Kings 5:20, vs. “20 Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, \"My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.\" (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the things that drowned the economy was greed, an excessive desire to acquire or possess more than what one needs or deserves, especially with respect to material wealth (possession) and there are believers who got caught up in the same things.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nElisha was one time a very faithful servant of Elijah. After Elijah was taken to heaven, Elisha became the next prophet and he too had a servant by the name of Gehazi. Gehazi was instrumental in Elisha’s ministry. We see him play an important role in identifying how the Shunammite woman in <b>2kings 4 </b>could be blessed with a child for her generosity. Who knows whether Gehazi was also being prepped to take Elisha’s position when he was gone. Prophets would receive gifts for their ministry and their servants I believe were also part of the gifts as they served. In this episode, Naaman, a commander in the army of Assyria comes to Elisha to be healed of his leprosy. <strong>Vs. 5, “…So Naaman started out, carrying as gifts 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold, and ten sets of clothing” (NLT). </strong>This man came fully loaded, with the best and greatest gift a prophet could have ever received. He is sent to the river Jordan to deep himself seven times; he fights it and then reluctantly agrees to it. Long story short, he comes back rejoicing having been healed of leprosy. He then says, <b>vs. 15</b> “…<strong>Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.” </strong>And Elisha would not receive the gift though it was customary for Prophets to receive such gifts. In our day how many including preachers would have sent this man back with his gift? I choose to believe the reason for not accepting the gift was to show that the miracles of God are free and cannot be bought, as a result he was humbled and changed. For the first time he was worshiping the true God. <strong>Vs. 17, “Then Naaman said, “All right, but please allow me to load two of my mules with earth from this place, and I will take it back home with me. From now on I will never again offer burnt offerings or sacrifices to any other god except the Lord”.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 20, “Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, \"My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.\" (NIV) </strong>Gehazi sees a lost opportunity to receive gifts he may have been eyeing. He may have worked hard to help Naaman because there was a reward in the end of it. Instead of rejoicing with Naaman and standing by his master who chose to let go, he goes after Naaman behind Elisha’s back. Passions and greed rise up reminding us of the time Cain became angry with his brother Abel over their sacrifices to the Lord. Abel’s was received, Cain’s was rejected and the Lord said to Cain, <strong>Genesis 4:7, “If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it.\"</strong> The sin of greed was crouching at Gehazi’s door but instead of mastering it, he yielded to it. This opened doors to what we will look at. Untamed passions takes a person off the Lord's will, sets them up for disaster. It's sin waiting to devour and must be mastered. We are all tempted with greed on small or large scales. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Samuel 8:7, “And the Lord said to Samuel, \"Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the story of the prodigal son, we see a son insisting on having his inheritance now. Though the father did not approve of it, he permitted because of the hardness of his son’s heart and we know the end result.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the Israelites, God did not approve of them having a king because He knew how an earthly king would be to them. He loved them, cared for them and wanted to protect them. He explained the nature of an earthly king and what he would do to them.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>1Samuel 8:10-18, “10 Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king. 11 He said, “This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots. 12 Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. 13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. 14 He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants. 15 He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants. 16 Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use. 17 He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves. 18 When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the LORD will not answer you in that day.” </strong>\r\n\r\nThis should have changed their minds. Amazingly even with the warning, they still refused. <strong>vs. 19, \"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, \"No, but we will have a king over us, vs. 20, \"that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles\"</strong>. We have been warned some relationships will ruin our lives, they are a hindrance to serving the Lord, will put us in compromising situations, will lead us to wrong places, at times we still insist that we want them. Certain jobs and positions will make us stop praying, depending on God, going to church, stunt our growth, yet we insist that we want them. According to the word of God, we have been shown what will happen if we step out of <strong>HIS WILL </strong>and because of the hardness of our hearts we still want to do it any way.\r\n\r\nSaul was made king and everything the Israelites were warned of was manifested in Saul’s leadership. On the other hand, Samson who was told not to be involved or even marry any woman from Philistine, he insisted and was permitted to marry and we know the end result.\r\n\r\nI love counsel especially that of my earthly father. Through his Christ like life, experience and wisdom, every big decision I ran by him to get his wisdom and blessing, and every time he has given me a perspective of the situation I had not seen. With that I have been able to make some better judgments, permitted and approved. <strong>God gives us good leaders like Samuel to help us see things clearly when our judgment are clouded by our ambitions.</strong> Through wise counsel I have learned many times that what I want may have not been necessarily be what I need. We need to safely surround ourselves with godly Father figures, leaders who can counsel us especially on big decisions. I believe we can save ourselves a lot of heartaches if we listen to their counsel for the bible says, <strong>Proverbs 11:14, “Where there is no counsel, the people fall; But in the multitude of counselors there is safety\". </strong>If you get counsel and you insist on going the opposite, the counselor may not stop you, the road you are heading on may at some point will. Let’s listen to wise counsel that we make good judgments permitted and approved that brings glory to God. To have your way is to pronounce a death sentence on yourself. Blessings, Ev"

              "<strong>1Samuel 8:7, “And the Lord said to Samuel, \"Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them”</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are times we forget that everything works in seasons even with the children of God. By this I mean everyone’s seasons is different. Your season may not be mine and vice versa. I cannot have God work your season into my life for I will be operating in my will and not His and so is the other way round.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<b>1Samuel 8:1-21</b> gives us a clear picture of the children of Israel trying to operate in other nations' seasons. Trying to take other nations desires and beliefs to fit in their own world. They failed to remember they were unique people chosen by God to operate differently. They had Samuel the prophet and God on their side, however when Samuel was old and dying and his sons were not walking in the ways of the Lord to lead them, they asked for a king. Imagine a nation always led by God (King) were determined to have an earthly king opposite of what God intended for them just because they wanted to be like other nations. Here is what they said <strong>1Samuel 8:5-7, vs. \"5... Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.” 6 But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” So Samuel prayed to the Lord. 7 And the Lord said to Samuel, “Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them\".</strong>\r\n\r\nIs this not like us at times when we constantly come to God to ask Him for something we know is against His will as Charles Crabtree preached and yet we insist? It's very true that we can get caught up into things other people are into and have and try to enforce it in our lives just to be like them. I see this many times in relationships where people are afraid to be left out and not fit in the club, they therefore insist on getting boyfriend or girlfriend and even go as far as marrying the unsaved not to be left out. Insisting on making friends with people you have no business being with, insist on being involved in certain businesses, deals, jobs etc. you know for sure you were never led to, but because you wanted to be like someone or everyone else, you went ahead and asked for it anyway. I believe the Israelites did not ask for a king once, they must have asked and asked and asked until the Lord said,<strong> \"Alright you can have your king\".</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is what I have learnt<strong>, God may permit (let) you to go your way and do your thing and let you get what you want if you insist, the only thing to remember, He will not approve of it. In other words, God may allow you to go your way but not bless your plan</strong>. Just because He permitted it is not an indication that He approves of it. It is because of the hardness of people's hearts He may permit. <b>Matthew 19</b> talks about how the Pharisees came to Jesus asking Him if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife. Jesus takes the time to explain why a man should not put away his wife and they continued to argue saying in <strong>vs. 7, … Moses gave a command to give a certificate of divorce”. </strong>Listen to what Jesus told them, <strong>vs. 8, \"He said unto them, \"Moses because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so\". </strong>Moses did not command, Moses permitted, but again, something may be permitted but approved.\r\n\r\nThis brings about this question, is there something you keep pounding the Lord for hoping He will change His mind over what you’ve asked of Him over and over again? The word, leaders, parents, friends may have pointed out that it’s not the will of God for your life? Remember, you may get what you want but it may not be what you need. What you insist on having may take you the long road of pain and heartache you would have avoided if you heeded to the voice of a loving Father. blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 8:1-3, “1 When He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. 2 And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” 3 Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed”</strong>\r\n\r\nThere is a battle going on that is creating havoc in people's lives. Many are puzzled by this thing I will call a giant in the room. It has put fear in people. Those who could be trusted to kill it and get rid of it are sometimes left defeated and helpless to do something about it. Some appear to have succeeded in getting rid of it, only for it to come back, sometimes more aggressive. <!--more-->They have tried to contain it, slow it down, cut it out, change the tactics in dealing with it but still. This giant in the room is none other than Cancer. A few months ago, I lost an aunt to it and my wife also lost an aunt to it. The most prayer requests that come my way are cancer related. If I was to ask you, you will say you know at least one person battling this giant. As this is a result of Adam’s sin, all human are plagued with diseases starting with sin. How do we respond and deal with this elephant in the room that has terrorized people?.\r\n\r\nIn the bible days, leprosy would be equivalent to cancer in my judgment. Not how it was perceived and dealt with but how it left people with little or no hope. There was no cure for it unless a miracle happened. Miracle for this kind of disease was very rare, example of Moses' sister Miriam, Naaman the Syrian and several people Jesus healed.\r\n\r\nOne of them is of this man who we are not told of his name but his condition. After preaching the sermon on the mount, this man meets him at the bottom of the mountain. People with such diseases were not allowed around people. In fact this disease was associated with sin, therefore those who had it were to be isolated. Some lived on the mountains, tombs constantly chanting unclean. The only time they would be allowed back is when they miraculously became healed, and only the priest could inspect and pronounce them clean.\r\n\r\nThis man broke everything that was required of him as a leper just to meet Jesus. When he met him, he worshiped him, saying<strong>, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” </strong>With such humility and such confidence in the One with the ability to make people clean, he came. Mark that he did not use the word “if you CAN”. The “CAN” was settled in his heart. He echoed the prayer of <strong>Jeremiah 32:17,\"‘Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">There is nothing too hard for You</span></strong>”. Whether \"He wills\" was his dilemma. With such great faith in Christ’s ability, Jesus first touched him and spoke the words he was anxious to hear, He said, “<strong>I am willing; be cleansed.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed”. </strong>No one touched the lepers, but Jesus did and healed him “<strong>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He Himself took our infirmities And bore our sicknesses.”, Matthew 8:17</strong>\r\n\r\nRegardless of how great this giant is among others and has caused havoc in our families, the question if God can touch and heal has been settled. What many are battling is if He is willing. I believe that if it’s going to bring Him more glory, to advance His kingdom, He will for there is nothing too difficult for Him. This man’s healing was a big picture of Christ who has the ability to deal with the leprosy of sin plaguing us. Only He the highest priest can cure and pronounce us clean regardless of whether He uses doctors, supernatural healings or not heal.<strong> “Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us”, 1John 5:14</strong>. He will get all the credit for how great He is. We have a part to play like this man, pray and pray and trust God to bring through those battling it. We help them make it to the mountain where they meet the One who identifies with our infirmities. The outcome is in His hands.\r\n\r\nMay the Lord strengthen our faith to believe that He can and is willing if it’s a means by which He will make His name great<strong>. 2Corinthians 12:9-10 “9 And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong”, </strong>the giant in the room is but a shadow of greater things to come, it was defeated at Calvary. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Exodus 20:12, “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the </strong><strong>land which the LORD your God is giving you\".</strong>\r\n\r\nI find it fascinating how God outlined the 10 commandments, He started with commandments in relation to Him, then right after that, He gives one that relates to parent(s) and then the rest that relates to others. Right where it’s placed gives me an indication how vital it is right after Him first. On top of the commandment that relates to parent(s), He adds an element of a promise and a threat (will explain the threat part). Take a close look at the 5th commandment in<strong> Exodus 20:12, “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you\".</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe have a generation rebellious towards parent(s) to which extends right into rebellion towards authorities and against the law. Matthew Henry puts it this way, \"<em>a generation that is such as abusive to their parent(s), give them bad language and wish them ill, call them bad names and actually injure them. There is a generation of such; young men of that dark character commonly heard together, and irritate one another against their parent(s)</em>\". This has kicked out the 5th commandment or has reserved it to only honoring fathers and mothers when they deserve or have earned it which is contrary to the commandment.<strong> Honor means to prize highly, to show respect to exalt. No parent will ever be good enough to deserve an honor</strong>. God has put the commandment to bypass what they don't deserve or have earned to what He has commanded. I believe God has put it there primarily for children to honor the position rather than the person first and here is why, <b>I believe that the moment a child honors the position of a parent, there will be no problem honoring the parent in the position.</b> It does not matter how good or bad a parent has been or is, they still should receive the honor because God says so, period.\r\n\r\nPart of the commandment completes with this line, \"…<strong>that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you\",</strong> this is the promise; the threat I mentioned earlier is the opposite of the promise. If children will not honor, obey, respect their parent(s), their days will not be long on the face of the earth. Children will be honoring God by honoring their parent(s). Parent(s) take pride in being honored by their children. If children regardless of the age would understand the tremendous sacrifices the parent(s) have made for them to be where they are today, they would have great respect and admiration for their parent(s). The cost of raising a child is not cheap, parent(s) have put aside some of their great dreams to give their children the best life they can afford, loving them, caring for them even when children feel the parent(s) never understand or are standing on their way of happiness. I have learnt that parent(s) know their children very well. They know their strengths and their weakness. They know what to allow and what to restrain. For the older kids (for we will always be children in the eyes of our parent(s) regardless of our age), their wisdom and advise can play big part in our lives. I believe God blesses children who honor their parent(s) through respect, taking advice, their counsel, helping them in whichever way to make their lives comfortable as they get older\r\n\r\nListen to Jesus addressing this commandment, <strong>Matthew 15:3, “And why do you, by your traditions, violate the direct commandments of God? 4 For instance, God says, ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and ‘Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death.’ 5 But you say it is all right for people to say to their parent(s), ‘Sorry, I can’t help you. For I have vowed to give to God what I would have given to you.’ 6 In this way, you say they don’t need to honor their parent(s). And so you cancel the word of God for the sake of your own tradition”. (NLT</strong>). The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were so concerned about traditions they made law off to the extent they could not take time to teach God’s law to their children one being honoring their parent(s).\r\n\r\nI believe the whole of children’s duty to their parent(s) is included in honoring them, which is the spring and foundation of all the rest. Our Savior here supposes it to mean the duty of children’s maintaining their parent(s), and ministering to their needs, if there be occasion, and being every way serviceable to their comfort. No person can say they honor God they have not seen if they cannot honor the parent they can see.\r\n\r\nWould you say you have truly honored your parent(s)?, Have you as a parent set up an example for your children by showing your honor to your parent(s)?, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Exodus 17:1-16, \"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Exodus 17:8, \"Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim\", </strong>many nations were afraid of Israel because God was with the Israelites. The bible says that every land they passed through, they won the battle for God was with them. With God with you, you can win battles you couldn't win by yourself. No wonder in one of the chapters Moses tells God, \"<strong>If Your presence is not going with us, do not move us from this place</strong>\", and in <strong>Isaiah 26:4 </strong>we are told<strong>, \"</strong> <strong>Trust in the LORD forever,For in YAH, the LORD, is everlasting strength\"</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Exodus 17:9, \"And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: tomorrow and I will stand on top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand\". </strong>It's good to have a leader who is hearing from God and who knows what to do when situations arises. Here we see Moses delegating responsibilities as a leader to Joshua who will be driving force on the offensive side and Moses will go up the hill to be on the defensive side. In our lives we have our Joshua the word of God as our offensive weapon in the battle ground,<strong> Hebrews <a>4:12</a>, \"The word of the Lord is living and powerful, sharper than double edged sword...\". </strong>On the other hand Moses is the faith (defensive) weapon standing up on the hill believing God for a breakthrough. Moses goes up the hill with Aaron and Hur, the people who later ministered to him as he was up the hill.\r\n\r\n<strong>Exodus <a>17:11</a>, \"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed\".</strong> As long as Moses faith stood still, Israel was winning but the moment his hands went down, Israel was losing. Moses hands got tired at one point, <strong>Exodus <a>17:12</a>, \"But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up His hands, the one on one side, and the other on the other side, and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun\". </strong>In as much as Moses could raise his hands, there came a time when his hands got tired and he felt like bringing them down. The moment that his hands started coming down, Israel was losing but thanks be to God for Aaron and Hur who I could say were the type of grace and strength to help him keep his hands up for Israel to win, <strong>2Corinnthians 12:9, \"My grace is sufficient for you, my strength is made perfect in weakness</strong>\". Aaron and Hur were there at the right time to minister to Moses. We can keep our hands up with the help of God's grace and God's strength. We can have our offensive troops on the fore front and we can have faith on the defensive side and with God's grace and strength, we can keep the faith lifted up that we may win our battles. The Lord gave the Israelites victory for there was a man lifting up his hands all the time.\r\n\r\nAre you tired of lifting your hand? call on grace and strength from above to help you make it, the Lord says, \"My grace is sufficient for thee, My strength is made perfect in weakness!!

              "<strong>Exodus 17:1-16, \"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</strong>\r\n\r\nWe constantly battle our way to greater levels with God. Walking with Christ is not easy for there is a price to be paid. You've heard me say that salvation is free but living for Christ and being anointed will cost you. Jesus tells us to die to self, pick up our cross and follow Him. The cross is not that easy to carry, and the journey is not easy but knowing that He is there to guide and lead us gives us the confidence to believe that we will make it.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe children of Israel were led out of the land of Egypt to be brought to the land of Canaan, a land known to be flowing with milk and honey. They are not flown into the land, but they are led through the wilderness that they may be brought to the land. The wilderness becomes a training ground for them for this is where their faith is tried, this is where they are faced with challenges and now they have to decide who to look to for help, this is also the place where they constantly remind their leaders of where they came from. As many complained through this journey, there are those who feared the Lord and were willing to trust Him through the journey. In <a>Exodus 17:1, </a>the word says that the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin and pitched in Rephidim. The Israelites were nomadic people always on the move. They would walk and when they got tired, they would pitch a tent and rest for a while. I'm amazed that as many complained and always compared their situation to that of Egypt, none left to go back to Egypt and I believe the reason could be they would never make it far back without God. Remember that they had walked many years without their clothes getting old and their shoes were not wearing out. They had been blessed all through, they did not see it because they did not put it into consideration that they were favored. It's very easy to dismiss the truth about how God has blessed you and it could be because you were waiting for a certain blessing that hasn't materialize yet but if you look again in your life, you will come to realize that God has done so much that you cannot tell it all.\r\n\r\nSomeone wrote a song and said, \"Count your blessings one by one\", \"He has done so much for me that I cannot tell it all\". Go places, watch other countries on TV where people are going without and you will understand that you and I have been cared for, blessed beyond what we could imagine or think. When the Israelites needed food, God provided; when they cried for water, God provided; when they faced an enemy, God fought for them. God went before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire. They had God in everything they needed but they still complained. Sounds like something you deal with? blessings Ev\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

              "<strong>Matthew 11:28-30, “28 Come to Me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”</strong>\r\n\r\nAs we looked at previously, Christ desires that His creation comes to Him. Here He further defines those who should come to Him, because in fact not all do come to Christ and there is surely a reason for that. He states, <strong>\"Come to Me, all who labor and are heavy laden...\"</strong> <!--more-->Who are those He was speaking of that are laboring and heavy laden? Is it those with abundance of worldly problems? Is it those who are tired in this life? Perhaps it is those who have such burdens upon them that they literally feel weighed down by such. I have heard all of these and more as a reason why Christ calls us to come. However, if this is truly the case, then one would surmise that the Donald Trumps and Bill Gates of the world would not need to come. There are those in this life that are not experiencing worldly labor, and many who don't feel heavy laden. To these, Jesus said it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. The Reformation Study Bible shares, \"<em>How difficult it will be for those who have wealth. The difficulty is not because riches in themselves are evil and disqualify those who possess them, but because the rich are tempted to depend upon their riches and may be unable to admit their need of God</em>\".\r\n\r\nThose who labor and are heavy laden are those that see their spiritual bankruptcy illuminated to them by the Lord. These people have labored to keep the Law of God and are heavy laden under its weighty demands. This is why Christ calls such persons to Himself and then says, \"<strong>Take my yoke upon you and learn of me..</strong>.\" He doesn't take them back to the Law they already know their guilty of, and also in addition, and perhaps compounds the problem is that the oral traditions of the scribes and Pharisees went far beyond the demands of God and became a heavy burden on the people.\r\n\r\n<em>\"When the law was understood as a way of salvation, it became a “yoke of slavery” (<b>Galatians 5:1).</b> By contrast, the yoke of Jesus, while demanding, is “easy” because it is from One who is “gentle and lowly in heart” and can provide true rest for the soul (The Reformation Study Bible).\"</em> Coming to Christ is therefore refreshing, because one can then rest in the only One who has ever fully, and completely kept the Law along with all of its demands. The realization that Christ has fulfilled the Law, and paid the price for sin makes for a light burden, because Christ becomes, and is the burden bearer. This is what happened to the woman at the well (<b>John 4</b>), the woman caught in adultery <b>(John 8)</b>, the publican (<b>Luke 18)</b>, Nicodemus (<b>John 3</b>), and the disciples of Christ. He is the only road and door to the Father <b>(John 14:21), </b>and the Father has extended His kindness toward us <strong>\"...in that while we were yet sinners [Lawbreakers] Christ died for us.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Application</strong>: <strong>Acts 3:19-20, “20 <em>Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out, 20 that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\n\r\nPhil,\r\n\r\nSoulfishing Ministries Evangelist&lt;&gt;"

              "<strong>1 Peter 2:4-7, vs. 7 \"As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious,...The stone that the builders rejected...\" </strong>\n\nHow does a moth end up getting burned by a flame. If you ever heard the expression, \"like a moth to a flame,\" you will know that the moth is drawn to the flame, but \"<em>The phrase is a simple allusion to the well-known attraction that moths have to bright lights. The word moth was used in the 17th century to mean someone who was apt to be tempted by something that would lead to their downfal</em>l\". Some are, \"<em>Irresistibly and dangerously attracted to something or someone</em>.\" (The phrase finder). God's children are drawn to Him (while we were yet sinners (<strong>Romans 5:8),</strong> He did the irresistible drawing of us to Himself.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nJesus spoke the Words in <strong>John 6:44, \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"</strong> Left to myself I would have stayed as an enemy of the Lord, but thanks be to God that He has drawn me, and not only me but all of His children. His children collectively are also His Bride. The Father has drawn the Bride to the Groom. The bride initially has nothing to offer the Groom. Christ was and is perfect, and we are not, we were more likened to the prostitute in the book of Hosea. Yet while we were in our sin, Christ died for us (Roman 5:8) and then drew us to Himself.\n\nR.C. Sproul shares, <em>“Coming” to Christ includes initial repentance and faith, but the Greek tense implies a continual drawing near as well.\" </em>The verdict is not only a day that you came to Christ drawn by the Father, but furthermore do you keep coming and drawing near. James says it this way, \"<strong>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you</strong>\". John MacArthur states, \"<em>Pursue an intimate love relationship with God (cf. <strong>Philippians 3:10</strong>). The concept of drawing near to God was associated originally with the Levitical priests <strong>(Exodus. 19:22; Leviticus. 10:3; Ezekiel. 44:13</strong>), but eventually came to describe anyone’s approach to God <strong>(Psalm 73:28; Is. 29:13; Hebrews 4:16; 7:19; 10:22)\"</strong></em>\n\nPeter continues describing Him (Christ) as a living stone rejected by men. The estimation of the identity of Christ was one of a rejected man by those that were in power, and authority in Christ's Day. He was certainly a living stone, but utterly despised by those that should have sought to embrace Him. Oh, how so many missed the reality of who Christ was, and many still do. To the Father, Christ was chosen and precious. Men viewed the Son of God through their sinful eyes, while the Father viewed His Son as both chosen and precious.\n\nMen rejected, God chose; men despised Christ as a cursed Jew (<strong>Galatians 3),</strong> but the Father saw Him always as precious, the of precious of all. The Father spoke from Heaven the words, \"<strong>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased</strong>\". The Father honored His Son in the sight of all who saw Him. There has never been a time when the Father was not pleased with the Son, even when the Son was on the cross, the sacrifice pleased the Father to turn His wrath from coming upon humanity. The Father is revealed in the glory of the Son, because of the Trinity, as they are One. We must come to the One that the builders rejected, because unless the Lord builds the house they labor in vain that build. Did it ever dawn upon you that Christ choose twelve disciples to be a light to the world, because the twelve tribes of Israel failed to do so. Now of course through the tribe of Judah Jesus came, but what of the tribes being the light? Jesus’ Twelve would shine for Him because they came to Him, He called them to be fishers of men, and they kept coming to Him until the days of their martyrdom.\n\nApplication: Do you and I look upon Christ as a stone to be rejected, or as precious in the sight of God? John Piper often asks, <em>“Is Christ the greatest treasure in your life</em>.?\".\n\nPlease also listen to this short and powerful illustration by Paul Washer on Come to Christ\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.asp?SID=327101648234\">http://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.asp?SID=327101648234</a>\n\nUntil the nets are filled...\n\nBlessings,\n\nPhil,\n\nSoulfishing Ministries Evangelist&lt;&gt;"

              "<strong>Genesis 2:18-25, vs. 18, “And the LORD God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him”</strong>\n\nJay Adams in his book “Marriage, Divorce and Remarriage” states that, “<em>God designed marriage as a foundational element of all human society. Before there was a child, a church, a school, a business, institutions, God formally instituted marriage declaring<strong>, vs. 24 “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh”, </strong>this was also talked about by Christ in<strong> Matthew 19:5 and Paul in Ephesians 5:31. </strong>It’s a let go and cleaves to</em>.”\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe word says, leaving Father and mother, house of growth. See here how great the virtue of a divine ordinance is; the bonds of it are stronger even than those of nature. To whom can we be more firmly bound than the fathers that begat us and the mothers that bore us? Yet the son must quit them, to be joined to his wife, and the daughter forgets them, to cleave to her husband and the two become one.\n\nI believe marriage is a foundation for many things and must by all means have a strong foundation if it’s to stand through the test of time. I also believe that it’s a union God designed to make His name great when He joins two people opposite each other and <strong>live His own life through them</strong>. Only God can bring about, “unity in diversity” for His own glory<strong>. It’s also an avenue by which we learn more of what God’s love is when you have to love someone who does not meet all your needs, or fails you many times but you still love and forgive them.</strong>\n\nCarl Wheat in his ABC’s (Acronym) of forever marriage stands for <strong>A</strong>bsolute Love, <strong>B</strong>elonging Love, and <strong>C</strong>ommitment Love to which when these three ingredients are integrated together, they equal a <strong>Forever Relationship</strong>. It’s God’s will in every marriage that the couples love each other with an absorbing spiritual, emotional and physical attraction that continues to grow throughout their life time together. After all she was made out of the man to tell us that she is part of him, the bones of his bones and the flesh of his flesh. To add to the strong bond, of all the love for God, family, friends etc., only in marriage is there physical consummation of love shared between a husband and a wife which shows a special bond orchestrated by God for the right people at the right time.\n\nTo combat homosexual marriages, I think it’s wise we start with the whole reason God instituted marriage first before addressing their sin of perversion. This is why I believe this approach is better, when we know God instituted marriage to be a true reflection of Him as the groom and the church as the bride, and in marriage the relationship is made clear. Then when we talk to homosexuals, we show how their idea of marriage is distorted from why God created marriage and the purpose of its existence. The primary reason for marriage is not how happy man can be but how God relates to his creation (humans) He has redeemed.\n\nGod created Adam, He formed Eve out of Adam, “<em>Thus Adam appears as a creature formed after the image of God--showing his knowledge by giving names to the animals, his righteousness by his approval of the marriage relation, and his holiness by his principles and feelings, and finding gratification in the service and enjoyment of God</em>” Jamieson, Faussett, and Brown commentary. So marriage requires a greater duty of us toward our spouses, than otherwise we are bound to show to our parents. Marriage is God’s divine plan. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Genesis 2:18-25, vs. 18, “And the LORD God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him”</strong>\n\nIn the last devo, I paid more attention to the fact that women (wives) are fearfully and wonderfully made and they are His daughters to be cared and natured, today I would like to share on biblical headship in addressing husbands (men).\n\nWe have the making of the woman, to be a help-meet for Adam. This was done upon the sixth day, as was also the placing of Adam in the garden. After an account of the seventh day's rest; there is a general statement in Genesis 1:27, that God made man male and female, Observe that Adam was formed first, then Eve (1 Tim. 2:13). And she was made of the man, and for the man (1 Co. 11:8, 9), all which are urged as reasons for humility, modesty, silence, and submissiveness, of that sex in general, and particularly the subjection and reverence which wives owe to their own husbands.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<strong>Vs. 22,”Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. 23 And Adam said: “This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.”</strong> She was made from the man, brought to the man, described by the man and named by the man. Once again, this does not show that men are better than women but this talks about the gender role, biblical headship in the marriage. Matthew Henry puts it this way, “<em>Yet man being made last of the creatures, as the best and most excellent of all, Eve's being made after Adam, and out of him, puts an honor upon that sex, as the glory of the man, 1 Co. 11:7. <strong>If man is the head, she is the crown, a crown to her husband, the crown of the visible creation</strong>. <strong>The man was dust refined, but the woman was dust double-refined, one remove further from the earth</strong>” </em>Adam was taught to recognize himself in his wife, as in a mirror; and Eve, in her turn, to submit herself willingly to her husband, as being taken out of him\n\nThis is for the wife to realize that God has placed her in a position of submission to her husband. Learning her role in the marriage covenant and leaving peacefully with her husband. Of course there are times that a husband may not deserve to be submitted to. The bible does not call for submission due to deserving but submission due to the position God has placed him. Honoring the position then honoring the man in that position. I know that there are women who are married to unbelievers, this ought not to change the submission part. God honors that marriage too and the principles of the marriage remain in effect. Here is a command to both wives and husbands, Wives are commanded to submit and husbands commanded to love. You notice that wives are not commanded to love, it’s natural for them, it’s a God given ability for them, on the other hand husbands are commanded to love. We also see that wives are commanded to submit which is not easy in our day because of the drive for gender equality in all aspects yet God commands her to submit, <strong>Colossians 3:17-18, “18 Wives, submit to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter toward them”.</strong>\n\n<strong>Ephesians 5:22, “22 Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body. 24 Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. 25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, 26 that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word”</strong>\n\nWives are you submitted to your husbands? Are you belittling him, defying his authority as the head? His is your head and you are his crown. God has designed those roles for a reason. I believe marriages can grow and blossom when husbands and wives learn these two words, “LOVE and RESPECT”. Love, command for husbands; Respect, command for wives. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Genesis 2:18-25, vs. 18, “And the LORD God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Lord sees the need then acts on it according to His sovereign will. How precious that God knows what we need better than we do. He has orchestrated His plan as if to say,<i> “I will make him a helper comparable (suitable to him)”</i>.\r\n\r\nThe words emphasize man’s need for a companion, a helper and an equal. <strong>Vs. 21-22, “22 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. 22 Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man\"</strong>. Just because a woman was made out of a man does not make her less equal deserving to be treated differently. She is special.<!--more--> Also as this was God’s doing, He would not need interruption from man, He therefore put the man to a deep sleep showing the first major operation done by God to bring about what He had in mind. Note that the Lord pulled one of his ribs from his side, which signifies the equality men and women have. He did not pull materials from the legs which may have meant she was beneath him or from the head to be above him. God created her; she is fearfully and wonderfully made (<b>Psalm 139:14</b>). She is God’s wonderfully designed Rose He tends to and care for.\r\n\r\nMan was incomplete without someone to complement him in fulfilling the task of filling, multiplying and taking dominion over the earth. This shows Adam’s inadequacy and not Eve’s deficiency. In as much as it’s hard to be believe this to some of us, a woman was made by God to meet man’s deficiency. It’s like God seeing Adam and saying, “<i>That boy won’t make it, I will make him someone”</i>\r\n\r\nThis is why men and women are very different yet when God joins them together, they become one flesh, <strong>and there is unity in diversity because God intertwines the diversities to fit into one</strong>. This is the other reason we ought to celebrate the diversities in each one be it strength or weaknesses. They both work together for good if channeled properly.\r\n\r\nJohn Calvin says, <em>“God assigns the woman as a help to the man, he not only prescribes to wives the rule of their vocation to instruct them in their duty, but he also pronounces that marriage will really prove to men the best support of life. We may therefore conclude that the order of nature implies that the woman should be the helper of the man”</em>\r\n\r\nTo the husbands, are you mistreating your wife, abusing her verbally, treating her like dirt because she is different? ( I’ve seen this even in churches, men worshipping God but at home they are mistreating their wives). The woman you are mistreating is God’s divine creation, His daughter. Imagine if you were a father of a little girl and someone was mistreating your daughter, would you be quiet? A sensible father would get angry and would do everything in his power to get justice and protect his little girl. The Lord will do the same for His daughters (wives). God made and brought her to you just like He did with Adam, He brought Eve to him to entrust him with His daughter. She is special in His sight, is she in yours? blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Genesis 2:18-25, vs. 18, “And the LORD God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him”</strong>\r\n\r\nMoses in the book of Genesis gives us a clear picture of God designing marriage and defining it in such a profound way making it so clear. Adam did not even know he needed someone. He had no idea what marriage was all about. Almighty God the creator of all steps in and sees that Adam’s condition needed a helper comparable or suitable for him. Reading the first chapter and a few verses in chapter 2 leading to vs. 18, you hear the Lord concluding in every stage of what He had created to be “<strong>good”.</strong> But in vs. 18, there is a little shift when He says, “<strong>It’s NOT good…”, God did not say it's sin to be alone, He said it's not good. </strong>I would look at it from another angle as if the Lord was saying, “<i>I would not conclude my work of creating man to be good until I’ve made another being out of what I’ve created suitable for him to be one and complete”</i><!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf it’s God who invented marriage, how is it that today marriages have been soiled, minimized, despised, being redefined, treated casually, viewed for convince etc.? People have wedding bliss only for it to crumble under the weight of other things a few years down the road. I’ve talked to a few people and even received emails from people saying, “<i>please pray, my marriage is under attack and on the rocks</i>”. If God designed marriage and joins people through ministers in holy matrimony, can He not be trusted to keep it till the end? And with what is happening, there are people who are trying to avoid marriage by all means. I was talking to a girl a while back at my sister in law’s wedding in her 20’s who despises marriage and does not want to get marriage. I talked to her for a few minutes then told her I knew the reason she did not want to get married because she is selfish, to which she agreed. Some because of what they have seen happen to their parents, their friends have left a bad taste of this thing called marriage. John Calvin says, “<em>Many think that celibacy conduces to their advantage, and therefore, abstain from marriage, lest they should be miserable. Not only have heathen writers defined that to be a happy life which is passed without a wife. To these wicked suggestions of Satan let the faithful learn to oppose this declaration of God, by which he ordains the conjugal life for man, not to his destruction, but to his salvation</em>”\r\n\r\nThe God who made Adam knew him and what was good for Him. Man being alone is not for his comfort; for man is a sociable creature. It is a pleasure to him to exchange knowledge and affection with those of his own kind, to inform and to be informed, to love and to be beloved. What God here says of the first man Solomon says of all men (<b>Ecclesiastes 4:9,</b> etc.), that two are better than one, and woe to him that is alone.\r\n\r\nIf you have a bad taste about marriage today or struggling in yours, let me begin this four part series with a few words of encouragement. Marriage is good, <strong>God Instituted, designed, defined and blessed it</strong>. It’s one of the means and the greatest means in my judgement to make His name great. I believe He created it more specifically to make us holy conforming us to the image of Christ. It’s not easy at times but God’s glory will be seen in each marriage be it good or bad. God honors marriage, it’s a true reflection of Christ the groom and the church His bride.\r\n\r\nMay God give us a eyes to start viewing marriage the way He saw that it’s not good for man to be alone, looked at it to see that it’s not a mistake, it’s divine.

              "<strong>Job 2:10, \"But he said to her, \"You speak as one of the foolish women speaks...In all this Job did not sin with his lips\"</strong>\r\n\r\n\"I woman X take you Job to be my lawfully wedded husband. To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part\". I do not think the vows are taken seriously in our time like in the past. These days people say one thing but mean something else. And here I want to understand what Job's wife was getting into when she married Job.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFirst let's explore some things about Job, God says in <strong>Job 1:8, \"Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none life him on earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?</strong>\" So Job was righteous man. He was a very rich man, very generous in giving because God has blessed him. Now we cannot tell if this woman married Job when he was already wealthy. We do not know the reasons why she married him, but we do know for sure that there were qualities in a man that she desired and Job had them. They were blessed with 10 children, seven boys and three girls. Job was a family man, always caring for his family, providing for them and more so, always praying and offering sacrifices to God on their behalf, just in case there was sin in their lives. What a family until the accuser of the brethren accuses Job of serving God because of what he has. A question always asked, <strong>\"Why do bad things happen to good people (of course only God is good)?\", </strong>I'm still trying to get an answer to that question myself however this is one thing I believe, <strong>John 15:3, \"...every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear MORE fruit</strong>\". When bad things are happening at times it is not that someone sinned, it could be that they are being pruned to bear more fruit. The process of pruning is cutting out stuff. To the normal eyes, it's getting rid of things we consider valuable and fruit bearing, but the person who is pruning knows better.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when everything you thought was going to work out or remain is taken away? Job lost all his possessions, his children leaving with his companion, his wife. I ask myself, why did God leave the wife when everything was taken away from him? Could it be that God wanted to leave him someone who will be there for him and with him? To encourage him and give him hope. <strong>Anyone can stand with someone when everything is going on well, but people really need someone when all hell is breaking loose</strong>. See at first everything was taken away, then his skin was affected. This woman held on when her children were gone, she held on when all the possessions were gone. Her husband finally gets boils in his body and though she has not been attacked physically, emotionally spiritually, socially, mentally she is drained. Too much to handle. Mark this, <strong>pressure can drive someone to say or do things they would normally not say or do</strong>. Check when you are under pressure what comes out of your mouth and the things you do. People who come around will say, \"you are not yourself\". I can't blame her for being in this state. Remember the vows, for richer or poorer, in health and in sickness, easier said than done. One song artist said, \"<strong>If you catch hell don't hold, if you are going through hell don't stop</strong>\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Job 2:9, \"Then his wife said to him, \"Do you still hold fast to your integrity? curse God and die</strong>!\" We can tell this is not like her. Let us analyze why she would have said it, perhaps she saw her husband in such pain and was sympathetic to him and did not want him to go through this pain anymore. May be if this man died, she would be free from the law to marry someone else. Sad enough, there have been men and women who desired their spouses dead and had reasons such as to collect insurance, claim the house and vice versa etc. We do not know what really drove this woman to speak these things, maybe she was just under pressure and needed to release some steam.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job 2:10, \"But he said to her, \"You speak as one of the foolish women speaks...In all this Job did not sin with his lips</strong>\". I am blown by Job's response to her, he said, \"<strong>you speak AS (LIKE) one of the foolish women</strong>\". <strong>Job honored his wife, loved her, cared for her and when he really needed her, she was there</strong>. Therefore when she said curse God and die, he responded, you speak as or like a foolish woman. He did not call her foolish. <strong>One of the reasons he stayed without sin is because of how he honored God and treated his wife</strong>. The bible says, \"...<strong>In all this Job did not sin with his lips</strong>\". <strong>This was a special woman believe it or not, she did stumble but read the whole book of Job, she did not leave him</strong>. She stuck by him through trials, pain, suffering, sickness you name it. What was the secret of their marriage? When astronauts are heading to space, they work as a team. If they fail, they fail together, the work together to resolve what the problem is to have a successful mission and safe landing. They do not call it a quit when one of the engines goes dead, they will try and revive it, use different methods to stabilize the space ship. They stuck by each other therefore God knew what He was doing when he let her remain by his side when he took everything including their children away. Their greater ending was greater than their beginning because in spite of how things started, God used the situation to prune Job even more causing him to bear more fruit. <strong>Husbands, thank God for your wives, they are special people on your side. Wives be grateful, you are part of the big picture</strong>. Everything will come and go, but you will have each other because Father knows child, Father knows best. Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>Matthew 17:5, “…This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”</strong>\r\n\r\nParents love to brag about their children especially when they are doing well. I have seen bumper stickers say “proud parent of …”. I know of no parent who would brag about their stubborn, rebellious, ungrateful, un loving, unforgiving child. They love them for sure, they just do not have something in their lives to brag about. Parents take pride in their children when they honor them by how they live their lives.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nImagine our Heavenly Father bragging about His Son and not just His Son but His beloved Son. As Jesus was getting baptized, the Holy Spirit descended on Him in form of a dove and God spoke, “<strong>This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”,</strong> <strong>Matthew 3:17. </strong>Again before Jesus is taken away to be crucified, a voice comes from heaven to three of His disciples Peter, James and John saying <strong>, “…This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</strong>”, <strong>Matthew 17:5</strong>. The Son pleased the Father by representing Him here on earth and doing what the Father sent Him to do. You do not hear Him talk about Adam the same way. That is why Adam was God’s son, Jesus was (is) His only begotten Beloved Son. He brought Glory and Honor to the Father. He did that which pleased the Father in deed, thought and word.\r\n\r\nLet us take a few lessons from a blessed father partly because of his son. If you remember Joseph in the book of <b>Genesis</b>, he became a slave after being sold by his brothers into Egypt. After many years, he became the ruler of all Egypt (like a prime minister), he encounters with his brothers who sold him, he forgives them, he then asks of his father’s wellbeing. They tell him everything about his father’s doing. The father gets the news and comes to join him. Here are my points in relation to Jacob and his son Joseph.\r\n\r\n1. Christian fathers’ spirits are revived and stay revived when they know their children are spiritually alive<strong> (saved), Proverbs 23:24, “The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice…”</strong> Read how Joseph’s living made an impact in Jacob’s life <strong>, Genesis 45:27-28, “27 But when they told him all the words which Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">the spirit of Jacob their father revived. 28 Then Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive…</span>”</strong> It was hard for my parents to see their son (me) not saved while the rest of my family were, but when I became a Christian, I could tell their spirit revived, their son who was once dead in sin, was now alive in Christ.\r\n\r\n2. Fathers take pride in knowing their children are blessed by God in every aspect of their lives (spiritually, economically, health, socially, emotionally etc.). Hard work, diligence, striving to maintain a good name blesses the Father.\r\n\r\n3. Fathers delight in knowing their children will be a blessing to each other and to him. In other words, a father never desires division in the family. It is a blessing for a father to see his children work out things he has taught them. Jacob did not tell Joseph to forgive his brothers, Joseph saw everything through the eyes of God, forgave them and blessed them<strong>. Genesis 46:11-12, “11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to their families”</strong>\r\n\r\n4. Fathers take pride when respected by those who have encountered with their children<strong>. Genesis 47:7-10, “7 Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 8 Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old are you?” 9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.” 10 So Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh”.</strong> I believe that through the life of Joseph, Pharaoh the king had tremendous respect for Jacob though he had just met him, and Jacob blessed the king. Pharaoh would have loved a portion of the blessings Joseph had due to his excellent spirit. We know where he drew it from.\r\n\r\nJesus brought honor to His father, so was Joseph and so should we today. I want my father to take pride in my salvation, delight in God's favor and blessing upon my life, be blessed through God's blessing in my life, blessed by the unity among his children and respect from those I have encountered with because I represented him well. What is your prayer?, blessings, Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 115:1-3, “1 Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, But to Your name give glory, Because of Your mercy, Because of Your truth. 2 Why should the Gentiles say, “So where is their God?” 3 But our God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases</strong>”\n\nLiving for God does not always make things smooth. You are not always going to be on top of the mountain. And if you find yourself in the valley, praying will not necessarily mean God will take you out of the valley. This is not an indication of His lack of care or teaching you a lesson. This and all things ought to be about God making much of Himself in the life of believers wherever they may find themselves.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nOne common error I constantly see with our walk is trying to make a deal with God. \"I do this so that you can do that for me\". And many of teachings are based on how to get stuff by working something right (mostly faith). If you are not getting it, it is because you are not working it right. I ask myself many times, “<strong>why do we try so hard to work for the things the Lord already paid for on the cross?</strong>” We ran back to the summary of the law (love God, love people) and present it to the Lord by saying something like this, “I have done this and that, hopefully you are pleased, now I am a candidate for blessing, bless me”. “<em>Love God, love people is what the gospel produces not what it commands. It’s not addition to the gospel</em>”, Voddie Baucham. It is not the means by which God responds to prayers.\n\nAll the good we do, is done by the power of His grace; and all the good we have, is the gift of His mere mercy, and He must have all the praise because He authored and completed it. You cannot live the gospel and gain merits for blessings and you cannot live without it and make it. It is not a formula for provisions. You and I do not pray to get God closer to our will, we pray to get closer to His will. The harbor does not move closer to the boat, it is the boat that moves closer to the harbor.\n\nIn the former psalm, the past wonders which God had wrought were recounted to His honor. In this Psalm, the psalmist is entreating the Lord to glorify Himself again, he says, <strong>vs. “1 Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, But to Your name give glory, Because of Your mercy, Because of Your truth”. </strong>The heathen presuming upon the absence of material blessings at a given time led them to ask, \"<strong>Where is now their God?\"</strong> It grieved the heart of the godly that God was not honored the way He should, and they beseeched the Lord at least to vindicate His own name. David in <strong>Psalm 23:4, </strong>talks of the Lord leading him in His path of righteousness for <strong>His name sake</strong>. Joshua also used the like argument when he said, <strong>\"...Then what will You do for Your great name?”, Joshua 7:9</strong>. So was Moses when God was ready to wipe out the Israelites for the complaining and murmuring, Moses said, <strong>Exodus 32:12, “Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, ‘He brought them out to harm them, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from Your fierce wrath, and relent from this harm to Your people”</strong>\n\nThese men had one thing in common,<strong> “the glory of God”. </strong>And the desire of their heart was not to make a deal with God and gain something from Him but God to make much of Himself through their lives even if it meant blessing them or not. Their drive to serve and glorify God was based on “HE IS WORTHY”. That is why they came, that is why they were concerned for His name. They were concerned for His honor and that is why they prayed for victories in their own lives that the heathens’ mouths would be silenced.\n\nAbout a year ago after long time of praying and waiting, our later diagnosis showed that for my wife and I to have children naturally was not possible. Through the means of medicine and the aid of insurance we started a process. The IVF done pointed to good promises, at one point we were declared pregnant only for it to be terminated after a short time taking us back to ground zero. Recently as we were checking with our insurance as to what to do next, our fears were confirmed when we were told we had maxed our coverage for pregnancy, therefore we are on our own. The first thing that ran through my mind, “but Lord we have been praying, waiting, trusting. What will those who see us pray think when they see or think our prayers are not answered”. I was concerned for what our prayers should do rather than be concerned with God’s great name for His glory. It also sounded like I was trying to make a deal with God. I should seek God for who HE is, <strong>“Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, But to Your name give glory” </strong>because<strong> vs. 3, “…our God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases”, </strong>for His own glory. We are in the valley, however our drive is, “just because of who You are will we praise You”. We pray because He is worthy of it. We seek for this miracle that He may glorify Himself through it. If He does not bless us, He will still gain glory in our valley.\n\nIn such manner, let us pray when no other plea is available because of our sense of sin; for the Lord is always jealous of His Honor, and will work for His name's sake and no other motive will move Him. Blessings, Ev"

              "<strong>Genesis 40:8,” And they said to him, “We each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter of it.” So Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please.” ...Genesis 41:16, “So Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”</strong>\n\nJoseph’s story is one of the most fascinating stories in the bible. Moses spends 13 chapters in telling this magnificent story. Today we look at a man who had interpretations of dreams for others but himself. If you are like me, then you will recall those days you needed answers, direction, comfort, encouragement. Instead of being the one on the receiving end, the Lord sent someone your way and what you shared with them was a confirmation of what God was going to do in their lives, however you were left puzzled about your situation without answers.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThis was the story of Joseph who had a dream as recorded in <strong>Genesis 37</strong>. He had gone through life not understanding it and most likely not realizing it due to his life situations. After many episodes, he ends up in prison, and there joined him two servants of the king, a butler and a baker. In prison, they both had dreams and were bothered by it as they believed there was something significant about the dreams. Joseph inquired after seeing them sad, <strong>vs</strong>. <strong>8,” And they said to him, “We each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter of it.” So Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please.” </strong>Note something, Joseph who had not understood or realized his dream had faith that God was faithful. His confidence was in the God of the timing. He said God can and He will, in this giving God all the glory. Making God’s name great in a land that served idols. You read further, one was restored and the other hanged as Joseph had interpreted. Then in chapter 41, it was Pharaoh’s turn to have his dream interpreted and again Joseph accredits the ability to God and then interprets.\n\nWhen he had previously dreamed himself, he remained, for a while, in suspense and doubt respecting the divine revelation; but now he is a certain interpreter providing life answers to others but not his, but God knows. Imagine a guy hired to build homes for people all his life. Good at what he does, he built beautiful homes, he worked hard and diligently but never had one for himself. As time went by, he became very frustrated with his situation and was ready to quit. The one who hired him did not know of his intentions but had something in mind for his next project. After sharing with him of the new house to be built, he was told the project was bigger than what he had done before. He showed him the land, the plan and provided him with all the materials he needed. Since he was frustrated with his situation, he purposed in his heart to do a poor job building it, after all it was for someone else. His employer expected him to do a magnificent job as he had always done. He finally completed the house and returned to his employer to report the job completed. Knowing his work ethic, his employer did not even go to inspect his work, he trusted that he would do a good job. It was at this point that he revealed the purpose for the last project. He said, “because of great years of work, the new house you just built is my gift to you. I had planned it long before, I had seen your years of toiling. I wanted to surprise you with it after you completed it. That is why I gave you a bigger land, good plan and with good materials. Without seeing, I believe you did a superb job”. This man upon hearing these words, stood there stunned because the poor house he built thinking was for someone else, his employer had saved the best for last and he just blew it. And now he was stuck with the poorly done house.\n\nJoseph appears to have been building a house for the baker, the butler and Pharaoh, but God was preparing him, he was building his own house. Notice also, he built them well in spite of him not having one (dream interpreted and fulfilled). <strong>1 Corinthians 4:2, “Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.”, Galatians 6:9, “And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart”. 2 Thessalonians 3:13, “But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary in doing good”. </strong>God may send someone your way for ministry, to provide answers while you need the same, be faithful till the end.

              "<strong>John 12:32-33, “32 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to Myself.” 33 This He said, signifying by what death He would die”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6109\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nJesus thrice speaks of His death as a lifting up, a euphemism for being crucified. The lifting up meant being glorified, He says as recorded in <strong>John 12:23, “…“The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified”.</strong> The cross was the means by which the Son of Man be glorified by men when He draws them to Himself. That is why we preach Christ crucified.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Christ, bringing the world to God by the doctrine of His cross, broke the power of sin, and cast out Satan as a deceiver. The soul that was at a distance from Christ, is brought to love Him and trust Him. There is power in the death of Christ to draw souls to Him. That by the cross, we have victory and in that victory is Christ lifted up.\r\n\r\nAfter His death, burial, resurrection and ascension, Jesus left His disciples and those who will believe in Him to continue to lift Him up. <strong>Acts 3</strong> is one example, as Peter and John were going to the temple to pray, vs. 2 says, a certain man lame was carried by the gate of the temple daily to ask for alms. On this day, <strong>Vs. 3-7, “3 who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms. 4 And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, “Look at us.” 5 So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them” Then Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.” 7 And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength”. </strong>Wow, what a great testimony, Peter presented what they had, Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He proclaimed healing and right then by his hand lifted him up. While it appears that this man was the one lifted up, it was Christ in this miracle lifted up, because right after the miracle, this man was not rejoicing over Peter and John, He was rejoicing over God, <strong>vs. 8-9, </strong>Says<strong>, “8 So he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them—walking, leaping, and praising God. 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Acts 3:12-16, “12 So when Peter saw it, he responded to the people: “Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? 13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let Him go. 14 But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, 15 and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. 16 And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all”</strong>. Peter and John had a mission, that of lifting Christ up and Christ did the rest by drawing not only this man but also those who by this means heard the gospel.\r\n\r\nThere have been times I have found myself troubled that in my prayer time, I did not lift all the needs I planned to pray for. Then there are those times, people say to me, “<i>thank you for praying for me, I had a breakthrough” </i>While they say such, in the back of my mind I am thinking,<i> “I do not recall praying for that need”.</i> And while sometimes I beat myself that I did not, I come to learn the truth that as I spend more time lifting up Jesus, His cross, in my prayer time, He draws those in need to Himself. He draws the unsaved, the broken marriages, the sick, etc. because He is more important than all these.\r\n\r\nAs Paul Washer said, <em>“The priority of prayer in Jesus life, the great majority of His words dealt with one thing, a passion for God to be glorified throughout the world</em>.” Prayer is about passion, zeal, drive, hunger, burden to lift Him up, make His name great and advancing His kingdom and not ours. In <strong>Matthew 6:25-34</strong> Jesus talks of worry concerning our needs and how He knows them before we even ask. This was not suggesting that we should not ask because He knows, but rather we ask what we need the most and that is to lift Him up by seeking His kingdom first and His righteousness. That as we lift Him up in our prayers, He will draw you and your needs to Himself for His glory. Who is most lifted up in your prayers, you or Christ? Choose this day who you will lift up.

                  "I have often been in a similar situation over prayer - people say thank you for prayers that I can't even particularly remember praying. When I have gone to God over it, He has assured me that what He wants me to do is stand in His presence. I find that when I do what He has asked me to do, which is just to be with Him, reading His word, meditating on it, and worshiping Him in the quietness of my heart, then when it does come to prayer for issues, I don't need to spend ages praying. A short arrow prayer is enough. The issue is dealt with. I can also be confident that He will bring before me what I need to pray for.\r\n\r\nThere are of course areas of life and ministry that I pray for regularly, outside of this context, but in terms of the one off prayers I think mostly I pray short prayers and move on. The challenge for me is to live within the bounds that the Lord has set for me rather than to try and fulfill other people's expectations.\r\n\r\nGod Bless, and thanks for your thoughts.\r\nDerek"

              "<strong>Matthew 20:27-28, “ 27 And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn our time, to be called a servant/slave is considered by many as insult, sounds like slavery. A servant is a person who serves others, an individual who performs duties about the person or home of a master or personal employer. Servants have always been expected to fulfill their duties and many servants either meet the expectations or fall below. From my experience, I rarely hear of servants going beyond the required duty striving for excellence.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI think that it is hard to desire to become a servant, to stoop low and serve than to be served. I believe this is the reason we need to be praying to the Lord to MAKE US SERVANTS. On our own we would rather wait to be served. To walk with the Lord is to die to self and be willing to be made a servant. Jesus said as recorded in <strong>Matthew 20:27-28, “27 And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.” </strong>This should be the highest honor to be called a servant (slave) of God, to serve as He served. He led by example and what blesses my heart is what He did shortly before He was betrayed. He knew His disciples would be scattered, one would betray Him, the other would deny Him. He would be left alone to face accusations, yet knowing Himself and His disciples well, He stands and does the unthinkable, <strong>John 13:2-5 </strong>says, \"<strong>2 And supper being ended, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s <em>son,</em> to betray Him, 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God, 4 rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. 5 After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe <em>them</em> with the towel with which He was girded</strong>\".\r\n\r\nIs it not easy to serve people who are nice to you, who esteem you, who value you, who respond to you etc? Here we see the Master who had been given all things into His hands, deserved to be served and honored turn around, lay aside His royal garment of glory, take a towel and wash the dirtiest, smelly, crooked feet. If we must wash, it would be easy to pick the part of the body that would be easy and cleaner to wash, let’s say hands or hair. What a level of service the Son of God would give. This was going beyond what we would call duty to excellence. He could have served them by performing miracles the way He had done, teach them, lead them. What He did showed the highest service a man can give another man for the glory of God in the sense that as disciples of Christ, we are to follow the Master's example.\r\n\r\nIf you go back to the bible, you find that God's appointed prophets, kings, and judges were not called by their titles, He called them \"MY SERVANTS (SLAVES)\", My servant David, My servant Moses, My servant Elijah. Why do we find it hard to be indentified as servants today? We would want everyone to call us by our titles yet God does not call us by our titles, He calls us servants. Look at some of these men God called servants; they laid down their lives for their Master. They worked themselves to death, were poured out like drink offering. They did more than required. They strived for excellence. Men like Paul, James, Simon Peter, Jude and others did not just refer to themselves as servants, they called themselves BOND SERVANTS (SLAVES) dead to self and alive in Christ. A bond servant according to dictionary means a person bound to serve in bondage and without wages. In our time we would rather serve when we know there is something in the end for us. Those who want to be great in God’s kingdom must learn to be bond servants of all.\r\n\r\nDo you consider yourself a servant of the Lord or better, a bondservant of the Lord? When was the last time you went out of your way and washed someone's feet? And by that I mean meeting someone's need, going out of your way, doing something you would not normally do? To the world they would wonder what's wrong with you but to you it will be the highest service you can give to your brother to the glory of God. <strong>Psalm 116:16, \"O LORD, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have loosed my bonds” </strong>Blessings Ev."

              "<strong>Genesis 39:16-20, “16 So she kept his garment with her until his master came home. 17 Then she spoke to him with words like these, saying, \"The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to mock me; 18 so it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.\" 19 So it was, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, \"Your servant did to me after this manner,\" that his anger was aroused. 20 Then Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison”</strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the most frightening things in my opinion is the damage a tongue can do. James speaks extensively about the tongue, how deadly it is left unattended. Have you ever wondered why God gave us one mouth to speak and two ears to listen instead of the other way round? Yet we find that a lot of people are quick to speak and slow to listen; They jump to conclusions without facts.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJoseph here finds himself in Potiphar's house, he is serving well even his master can sense something different about him. Of all the servants he had, Joseph was unique; he sensed the Lord was with him. And whatever Joseph did in Potiphar’s house, God blessed it. Then here comes Potiphar's wife who eyes this young man, wanting something from him, his innocence, and his purity before the Lord. And when she could not get what she wanted, Joseph vowed to be pure before God, she takes something from him to accuse him of something bigger, attempted rape. Now that is a serious accusation.\r\n\r\nWhen you don't get what you want, how do you deal with it? When I was a teenager, I liked this girl and wanted to go out with her. She seemed to hang out with this other guy more. Instead of accepting the reality of things, I began to slander their names, making other people believe what I said about them I knew to be untrue. What a damage I made I regret till today. That is something that happens even today, it's easy to slander, lie about someone, tarnish their names because they have something you want but you can't have. Instead of accepting things the way they are, you turn to frustrate them, lie about them, find people to convince to side with you against such a person. That is what Potiphar's wife did, because she could not accept the fact that she could not have what she wanted, she purposed in her heart to destroy Joseph by lying about his intentions. She knew that if she could not destroy his purity, her tongue would be sufficient to destroy his reputation. After all, who were they going to believe?\r\n\r\nThere are certain people if someone told you that they did this and that, you would probably not believe them because you know the character of that person. That may not mean they could never do what they are accused of, their nature, their lifestyle would suggest otherwise. Then there are those whom if you are told of what they did, you would be prompt to say something like this, \"I would not be surprised if they did such and such a thing\". Well in Joseph's case, he is accused of attempted rape, his master is not even stopping to say or even think , \"that doesn't sound like Joseph\" so as to find facts and truths to turn upon. The other servants seem to be quiet and it doesn't seem he's been given a chance to defend himself. The wife was the bigger influence on the verdict. God who had blessed him and been with him seemed silent when he needed him the most yet knows the whole truth. Who will stand with Joseph? His name is tarnished, he has lost his job, he is going to jail, he is further away from his dream because of false accusation and it's all because of the tongue that would not accept that she could not have what she wanted and therefore turned to destroy another life. The bible says in <strong>Proverbs 12:22, \"Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, But those who deal truthfully are His delight\".</strong>\r\n\r\nAre you being driven right now to destroy another person's life through lies because you are unable to get what you want and if you can't get, then you feel it's not fair for the other person to have it, be blessed, or prosper while you are miserable? Are you getting people to rally behind you to accept what you say about someone without sharing the true facts or having them do the same?<strong> James 1:26, \"If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one's religion is useless</strong>.\" Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 119:37, \"Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things, and revive me in Your way\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image8.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6434 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image8.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nDavid in <b>Psalm 119</b> craved revival that over and over again he mentions it, and the verse that captured my heart was, vs. 37 which says <strong>\"Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things, and revive me in Your way\". </strong>The scripture we shared from <b>Isaiah 40 </b>cannot come handy until we are ready and that means turning our eyes from looking at worthless things.\r\n\r\nToday we look at a man who prayed for revival in his land. <b>Ezra 9 </b>tells of Ezra, one of the three key leaders who left Babylon for the reconstruction of Jerusalem. The three leaders were Zerubbabel (first to come to Jerusalem) followed by Nehemiah and then Ezra. <strong>Zerubbabel reconstructed the temple, Nehemiah built the walls, and Ezra restored teaching and worship</strong>. <!--more-->When Ezra came, he first looked at the condition of the people and he discovered that the priests and the Levites had not separated themselves from the people of that land. They had taken wives for themselves so that the holy seed was mixed with people of those lands (from the beginning the Lord did not want them to marry from outside their people, that is why Abraham had to send his servant to get a wife for his son from his people). They trespassed and did many things that were not right in the eyes of God. Upon hearing all this, Ezra tore his garments and the people who kept the words of God assembled with him.<strong> Ezra 9:5-6, \"5 At the evening sacrifice I arose from my fasting and having torn my garment and my robe, I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the Lord my God</strong>,<strong> 6, And I said, \"O my God, I am too a shamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God; for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads and our guilt has grown up to heavens\". </strong>\r\n\r\nHis first move and call for revival was repentance for his people. He acknowledged the sins in the land therefore he tore his garments, fasted and began to repent. His cry was <strong>\"Turn my (our) eyes from looking at worthless things\"</strong>. He continues in vs. 7 talking about what they did that brought them shame, led them to captivity, famine, highlighting many calamities that befell them because of their iniquity. Shouldn't that be our cry and repentance toward God for having minimized prayers in our churches, taken prayers out of schools, pulling down the things of God from public places, approved immorality, agreed and funded abortion, compromised the word of God and manipulated it to fit our lifestyle, drugs, robbery, rape, murder and many things that are not in line with God's word? Here is a man crying to God on behalf of his nation, what about us? are we also crying to God on behalf of our nation?\r\n\r\n<strong>Ezra 9:8, \"And now for a little while grace has been shown from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a measure of revival in our bondage\".</strong> His repentance for his people and his cry for repentance from his people led him to cry for revival for his people, \"…<strong>and revive me in Your way</strong>\", My continuous prayer and burden is that God would bring backsliders to repentance and revive them in His way. Do you have a prayer and burden for something?<strong> Vs. 9, \"For we were slaves. Yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage; but He extended mercy to us in the sight of kings of Persia, to revive us, to repair the house of our God, to rebuild the ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem\"</strong>. We too were once slaves never forsaken in our mess. He showed us mercy, revived us, repaired us, rebuilt us and gave us identity and now we can cry to God on behalf of others to receive what we have received. <strong>Hebrews 4:16, \"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need\"</strong>\r\n\r\nPraise God because revival is there for those who are ready, and those who are revived can be an Ezra to repent on behalf of others and pray to God for revival. I believe the true signs of revival is when we have a burden again to pray having been convicted of our current state and to the point we also hear the lost cry out, “<b>what must we do to be saved?”</b> it has to begin with us Christians who are willing to roll up our sleeves and go to work. Be revived, stay revived, pray for revival. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 119:37, \"Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things, and revive me in Your way\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image9.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6436 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image9.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThere are three words (Replace, Restore, Revive) that work together with each of them having their own strengths. REPLACE is to put back into former position or place, it is also to provide a substitute. RESTORE is to bring back into existence or use, also to bring back to an original condition. REVIVE which is my key word is to bring back to life or conscious. It is to return to validity, effectiveness or operative condition.\r\n\r\nThe three words have functions that sound alike, they talk about bringing back which is a sign that something is dormant, dead, ineffective, corrupted, or broken. You can restore something but still not make a difference. You can replace something and still not do much, but when you revive something, you bring it back to life, to its validity, effectiveness and operational condition.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nNine times in <b>Psalm 119</b> the word “revive” has been recorded. This an indication that at times we go through dormant stages in our Christian walk that leaves us ineffective, dead and without being valid. The cure for this dilemma is not replace or restore but revive, bring back to life. <strong>Psalm 119:25, \"...Revive me according to your word; Psalm 80:18, \"...revive us and we will call upon Your name\"; Psalm 119:40, \"...Revive me in Your righteousness\"; Psalm 119:88, \"Revive me according to Your loving kindness\"; Psalm 119:149, \"...revive me according to your justice\"; Psalm 119:156, \"...revive me according to Your judgments\"; Psalm 143:11, \"Revive me, O Lord, for Your name's sake\"; Isaiah 57:15, \"...revive the heart of the contrite ones\"; Habakkuk 3:2, \"revive Your work in the midst of the years</strong>\"\r\n\r\nWhat causes us to need revival in the first place? <strong>Isaiah 40:27, \"... The Creator of the ends of the earth, neither faints nor is weary\", </strong>Of course God does not change and what affects humans has no effect on Him. For us, we will go through different cycles, times of being up, and times of being down, times of encouragements and times of discouragements, why? <strong>Isaiah 40:30, \"Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall\". </strong>It is clear that each of us will have those seasons, but how do we get revived?, <strong>Isaiah 40:31, \"But those that WAIT on the Lord shall renew (revive) their strength\". \"</strong>Wait\" as I have always mentioned does not mean sit and do nothing, “<strong>wait” </strong>is a word used in restaurants to mean serve. Wait on God means serve the Lord, find something that you can do for the Lord because this is how revival begins to come. Look at how the bible puts it <strong>\"Shall renew their strength\"</strong> as opposed to<strong> \"their strength will be renewed\"</strong>. What this shows me is that in the process of waking up and beginning to do something in your life to bring a revival, that process will renew (revive) your strength. Here are the results of revival<strong>, Isaiah 40:31, \"...They shall mount up with wings like eagles (not doves)\". </strong>Doves would fly away very fast while eagles sow above everything. If you are dealing with struggles, learn by God's grace to sow above it without trying to run away from it. \"<strong>They shall run and not be weary</strong>\" this is not trying to run a way but running towards the mark set before us. This is not a weary race but a race of hope. \"<strong>They shall walk and not faint</strong>\", this is where I would plug in faith. Faint not, have faith in God, faith keeps hope alive.\r\n\r\nSome people may think revival is all about hearing a fiery preaching, getting slain, basking in the presence of God, and all that is good but I am more revived being in the Father’s business. Inquiring of what’s in the heart of the Father and stepping out by faith with His help to serve Him. Where are you today in your spiritual walk?, what are you doing about it? Get into a revival mode. blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\"></h6>"

              "<strong>Isaiah 52:7, \"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who proclaims peace, who brings glad tidings of good things, who proclaims salvation, who says to Zion, \"Your God reigns\".</strong>\r\n\r\nIn response to the gospel, the word \"<strong>feet</strong>\" does seem to associate with it. <strong>Romans 10:15, \"How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace</strong>\", <strong>Ephesians 6:15, \"and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace</strong>\". It talks about the shield of faith, the breastplate of righteousness, the helmet of salvation, the sword of the spirit. The word “feet” is not there just to fill in, it has a significant meaning. Feet help you relocate, it makes you move, it makes you go. When Jesus said, \"<strong>Go ye into the world and preach the gospel</strong>\". <!--more-->The beginning word “GO” requires “FEET” that would mean on your prayers, put feet to it and go. I do not see anywhere in the scripture saying “<strong>how lovely are the feet of those who sit</strong>\". You would imagine that those who sit have lovely feet because they are clean but the bible talks about those who go as the ones with lovely feet. Their feet may be full of dust, dragging, weary from going, but they are still going because it's the message that they have that makes their feet lovely. Whenever I go out witnessing, I always have enough excuses as to why I should not go. However when I go, I come back rejoicing. Going up the mountain is tough and so is going after sinners but coming from the mountain is easy and relaxing and so is after witnessing, you come back rejoicing and relaxed.\r\n\r\nThink of it this way, at a police station, they have a party and all people have been invited including those who have broken the laws, they have a DJ, good food, gifts etc., tell me, how many would still show up at the party? very few. So is with the church, we are hoping that sinners will find their way to the church, we promise good music, spiritual food, a place of peace but still very few come. Why? because a guilty person will find it hard and intimidating showing up at a police station. We have to go out and apprehend them.<strong> Romans 10:14&amp;15, \"How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe on Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? vs. 15, \"And shall they preach unless they are sent?. </strong>Vs. 15 has been fulfilled when Jesus said, \"go ye\", we are the preachers who will preach to them repentance and faith, the only two keys to salvation.\r\n\r\nHere is what makes the feet of him that goes lovely,<strong> Psalm 119:105, \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path\". </strong>Jesus Christ is the divine light, His words we preach is the lamp to our feet that causes us to have lovely feet and He lights our path towards sinners. “The lamp unto the feet” is for those who are moving<strong>. Could it be the reason Jesus washed the feet of the disciples so as to prepare them for the gospel?</strong> Then He said we ought to wash other people's feet (sinners). The feet of those who have encountered with the Lord should bring good news (gospel), proclaiming peace, bring good things and proclaiming salvation. Jesus talked about a parable of a man leaving the 99 sheep found and going to look for that one which was missing, how about you. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Ephesians 6:10-18, \"11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe looked at how the enemy always gives us the wrong impressions on who to fight. We therefore need to learn how we prepare with the tools and the right clothing.\r\n\r\nI face the enemy every single second of the minute of the hour of the days of the months of the year. Sometimes he might just leave me for a season but he is bound to come back. I need to be ready at all times and so should you.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nPaul in concluding his letter to the church at Ephesus had some wisdom to share with them. He knew of the things that they were facing and would continue to face. He begins to conclude his letter by saying, \"<strong>Finally my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might\".</strong> This is the introduction to the fight, be strong not in oneself but in the Lord, the overcomer. <strong>James 4:7, \"Submit yourselves therefore to God, resist the devil and he will flee\"</strong>, You cannot resist the devil without first submitting to God. Its in submitting to God that He gives you the strength and grace to resist and that's how Paul in Ephesians puts it <strong>\"...Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles (tricks) of the devil</strong>.<strong> For we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against the spiritual wickedness high places\"</strong> <strong>Ephesians 6:10-12</strong>. We are not fighting some small enemies, we are fighting big ones and so twice we hear Paul mentioning the act of putting on the whole armor of God. Putting the armor of God is like putting on the combat attire ready for anything that might come as we do not know how big or small they will come.\r\n\r\nKnowing all that we know about what we are going to be facing, we enter into our closets and prepare. . <strong>Vs 14, \"Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth\"</strong>, the devil is the father of lies, you better put on truth, gird yourself with God's word at all times. \"<strong>Having put on the breastplate of righteousness\"</strong>, it's a round the chest where the breastplate is placed and as you can see that this is the area where the heart is. God deals with the heart first, therefore when the heart is right with God, the entire being will be changed. \"<strong>Having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;\"</strong> In <strong>Isaiah 52:7, \"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of Him who brings good news\". </strong>The good news does bring peace in ones life, you also overcome when you lead others to find eternal life. <strong>Vs.16, \"Above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one</strong>\", It's easy to be wounded if you do not have a shield and here we are told that our shield is the most important thing that we should always have as that will keep us from falling. <strong>Hebrews 11:16, \"Without faith, it is impossible to please Him\"</strong>, <strong>vs 17, \"Don't forget to put on the helmet of salvation\", </strong>I've seen this even with major dangerous sports, they always put on the helmet to protect them from any brain injury if anything ever happens to them. Every believer also has to put on the helmet of salvation as that will protect us in the days when we fall. <strong>vs 17, \" and the word of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</strong> \". This is important too as this is your only offensive weapon because the rest are defensive weapons. We have to know the word and this could mean memorizing the word and knowing where it is and so that when the enemy begins to fight, we are well equipped.<strong> Hebrews 4:12, \"The word of the Lord is living and powerful, sharper than any double edged sword...\"</strong>. Remember the enemy knows the word too and so he will come to us the same way he came to Jesus in the wilderness and say \"<strong>It's written\", </strong>We also need to stand with the written word. Paul concludes by telling the Ephesians to <strong>pray always will all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.</strong> We need to watch and be ready at all times for, Prayer assists in testing, prepping your tools. <strong>1Peter 5:8, \"Be sober, be vigilant cause your adversary the devil like a roaring lion walketh about seeking souls that he may devour\".</strong> Take note of how the bible puts it \"Like a roaring lion\", he is not the lion, Jesus is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah. We are all soldiers in the army of God, we will fight till the end, choose this day and always to put on your defensive weapons and pick up your offensive weapons to fight back. No retreat no surrender. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Corinthians 10:3-5, \"3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is vital for Christians to know who they are in Christ and their position in the Kingdom. It is also good to know exactly where you fit in as a player in the game. In major sports there are different positions and every player knows their position in the field. I am not good at sports so I cannot tell what positions are there but one thing I know is that there are defense and offense in different sports. The Kingdom of God also has defense and offense structure. Before salvation, <strong>\"...we were enemies of God through wicked works\" Colossians 1:21</strong> for we played or served the devil. At salvation, we made peace with God <strong>Romans 5:1</strong>. We are now on the Lord's side.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf then we be in Christ, we are recruited in the heavenlies Army. We are soldiers in the Kingdom and God is the commander in chief of the armed forces. He is the Mighty Warrior; He is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Whenever one is in the army, there is an enemy that he or she has to face because there is no way you can be in war ground and be liked on both sides. One side would hate you and you have to be aware of the fact that you have to be ready at all times if ever called upon. Every believer is at war whether they want to accept it or not. We fight daily because we are constantly under attack. It is good to fight but you need to know who your enemy is.\r\n\r\nMany Christians fight the wrong enemy when <strong>2Corinthians 10:3, says \"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh...\". </strong>The moment you read and understand this verse, is when you will cease to fight your spouse, your children, your neighbor, your workmates, etc., this is not a physical battle. People have always been used as a means to accomplish the devils' dirty tricks. We have had friends who have hurt us, jobs that frustrated us, family members that have discouraged us, situations that have brought pain and frustrations to us, you name it. All these things have one thing in common, the enemy is behind them. You will also realize that something the Lord could be using to build our faith and teach us endurance, the enemy will try to hijack the moment to abort.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 4&amp;5, \"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God and bringing every thought into captivity under the obedience of Christ</strong>\". Every soldier recruited is given weapons to fight, you cannot be in the army and have nothing otherwise you will be killed even before you go far. God has given us weapons both offensive and defensive. <b>2Corinthians 10:3-5</b> come in handy when we talk about what we've been equipped with.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say, we constantly have an enemy and the enemy is not that person or that situation you are thinking of. If you are not facing any challenges and everything is always going on well with you, no tough times to face sometimes, check again and see on whose side are you leaning on. Begin to fight your enemies on your knees. <strong>Matthew 11:12, \"And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of God suffers violence and the violent take it by force\"</strong> , blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Ecclesiastes 11:1-8, \"1 Cast your bread upon the waters, For you will find in after many days\"</strong>\n\nInvestment is the act of laying out money or capital in an enterprise with the expectation of profit. I know little about investments and with the little understanding; I will use the concept of investment to share the word of God. Companies invest in other companies and so do people also invest in companies. I am yet to meet someone who is investing without any expectation of a profit. Not only is the investment done on just any company, but you look at the ones which will give you a better return, for you cannot expect to invest the same amount and get the same in return. Whatever you invest is also used to do business and so is what you save. There are earnings, profits, interest that you expect in the long run.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWhenever people invest, there are a lot of risks that go with it and therefore some people tend to spread their investments around so that incase one enterprise begins to loose, they still have other investments somewhere to balance or even out what was invested in this enterprise. Christians ought to be people who invest not only on stocks and bonds but investing in people, relationships, community, church, work. If you invest little, expect little in return; invest much, expect much in return. You invest in one person, he or she will invest in another and it goes on and on. Many don't want to invest in other people because they feel that investing in them will rob them of what they have. There are some bosses who will not invest in their employees because in the long run their positions may be threatened by someone they invested in. Paul invested in Timothy so was Elijah who invested in Elisha and if you look at these people who did invest, they got a greater return on the investments they made.\n\nEcclesiastes aka the book of the preacher 11:1 says, \"<strong>Cast your bread upon the waters, For you will find in after many days</strong>\". This to indicate the principle of investing that which is precious to you upon the waters. <strong>I was wondering the significance of water here and I have come to realize that water takes any form in whichever place it is poured</strong>. You pour it in a cup, it will take the cylindrical shape, you have it the river, and it will take that form. Water does not have any color but it's very essential to human survival and many things need water to become something. They say the world is covered with more water than land. Cast thy bread upon the waters, you do not know how far it will go, who will benefit from it, and when you will receive something in return but the bible is clear when it ways, \"<strong>You will find it after many days</strong>\", this will require expectation, patience, watching till you have received it again but I would rather continue investing even more. It may not come back through the same means but it will come back. <strong>Ecclesiastes 11:3, \"If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree falls... in the place where the tree falls, there is shall lie</strong>\". If we all wait to see the signs to do anything, we will not go anywhere, If we also wait to be sure of what we will receive back before we can move, certain opportunities will pass us by. <strong>Ecclesiastes, 11:4, \"He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap</strong>\". I am not a risk taker, at times I want to be sure that if I do this and that, I should be fine or I want to wait for a sign or want to be sure that I am fully prepared and ready to move. I have come to learn that there are certain things that <strong>you get ready as you are doing them</strong>. God will not first invest in me to be a leader to use me in leadership, it's in the process of being a leader that He invests in me more to accomplish the work He has called me to do. Don't waste time hoping that you will fully be ready before you can get into a ministry, or thinking that you have to be perfect before you step into a relationship, marriage, have children for those who are married, more will be invested in you as you are casting your bread upon the waters. <strong>INVESTMENTS ARE FOR THE RISK TAKERS NOT FOR THE SURE INDIVIDUALS.</strong>\n\nInvest quality time with your spouse, invest love, invest complements in your friends, invest hope, invest confidence, invest teachings, and invest values and morals. Take different people and invest in them, take advantage of what is being offered to you and do as many investments as you can. Your return on investment could mean someone else also investing in you. People don't wait till they have too much to invest, they take the little they have and they invest it anyway. Be wise and invest on your future home, invest in the children you haven't seen yet, live like this was it and also live like there is tomorrow. There is a great return on the investments if you invest wisely, purposefully, spread it around for you will find it after many days. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Proverbs 31:25, \"Strength and honor are her clothing;\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThings work well when they are in order. Where there is no order, expect chaos (disorder). Evolution talks about a big bang, however a bang does not create order. A bomb can create a bang but it will not create order and so is a gun. Music not played in the right chords will not produce order or harmony. If you were to build a house without laying materials in proper order, expect a disaster. Study closely the creation and see order from day one to day six. God did not create man on day one, I will let you figure why. Emphasis has to be put also in the right order. Some people think we are BODY, SOUL and SPIRIT, the word of God emphasizes, SPIRIT, SOUL and BODY. Body becomes last because it is temporal. Where you put much emphasis matters a lot. Hopefully we understand the need for order in all things.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Proverbs 31:30, \"Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised\". Fearing God is the definition of our existence, it’s the foundation by which the rest of the characteristics that makes a person begins</strong>. Charm, beauty, dignity, character can all be traced back to this firm foundation. Anytime this introduction is wrong, it has a tendency to affect every other thing on the way. It is from this introduction that we all learn our rightful positions and the order of things. <strong>This is the vertical relationship, the mirror by which you reflect in someone's life what you have learned from the Master of our destiny</strong>. A man who understands that Jesus Christ sacrificed His life's blood for the church will likewise love his wife sacrificially and passionately. He will honor, respect, protect, love and cherish her as much as he does his own body. He will not harm her or demean her in anyway. <strong>It is in the atmosphere of love and security that a godly wife willingly submits herself to the protective arms of her husband</strong>. Can you see the order? Christ first loved the church, the church in response to that love submitted to Him. <strong>Missing one step means missing the whole process. </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Proverbs 31:25, \"Strength and honor are her clothing; \". </strong>It is vital to know what makes you who you are. You ask yourself, is it your looks or character that people value? For the woman talked about here in Proverbs, her greatest clothing are not her charm and beauty but strength and honor. I am in no way saying that beauty is left out, all I am saying it is put in its rightful place and all that is more cultivated on is her character. She is praised for her strength and honor, <strong>strength because God is her strength and the joy of the Lord is her strength, and honor, because her husband honors her</strong>. Her sense of worth depends on her strength from God (vertical relationship) and her honor from her husband (Horizontal relationship). Husbands ought to HONOR their wives. Honor is high respect or esteemed, as that shown for a special merit, it is also recognition. Material gifts may play part but I believe the greatest gift is \"honor\" because it lasts. This is what brings her confidence, feeling of appreciation, loved unconditionally, feeling valued, feeling secure etc. These becomes her clothing, what she is proud of. When she is strengthened, she has greater avenues to blossom and maintain a moral position firmly. Some cultures do not promote honoring women but the bible puts women in a higher place. With the husbands honoring their wives, they can be the means by which God could take their wives far<strong>. At times you need someone to strengthen your faith during those times you do not have faith to go far, to believe in your God given potentials to go further than you thought.</strong> When you stand on the shoulder of the one who loves and believes in you, you can see further than what you could see by yourself.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the order of things and applying them in their rightful places can open doors for greater things. Let us learn how to unlock great blessings by setting things right. Husbands love and honor your wives. Remember, order creates harmony. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 138:2, \"I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your loving kindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your word above all Your name.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI am drawn to hymns primarily for their packed theology. Read the lyrics of many of our songs today and compare to the lyrics of some of the old hymns, you find a huge difference. The hymns are so rich in God's Word transcending feelings, they are grounded in truth. For the last few years I have had the privilege of tapping into teachings by some long gone preachers and I find again that their preaching and teachings are far different from many of the preaching and teaching we hear today. Their messages just like in the hymns were packed with theology. Oh I praise God for the age of technology (internet) giving us the ability to find materials lost over the years.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nOne thing these men of God did was point us back to the Word of God and taught it as it is whether it made them popular or not. Their mission was to please God, make God's name great by preaching the whole counsel of God. They fought to keep the doctrine pure. Men like <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Charles Spurgeon\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spurgeon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Charles Spurgeon</a>, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Martin Luther\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Martin Luther</a>, John <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"John Bunyan\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bunyan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Bunyan, John</a> Newton (wrote Amazing Grace), <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"John Wycliffe\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">John Wycliffe</a>, William and Catherine Booth, Charles Finney, DL Moody, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Leonard Ravenhill\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Ravenhill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Leonard Ravenhill</a>, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Paris Reidhead\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Reidhead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Paris Reidhead</a> and many men God has used through the ages. What I love about listening and reading their materials was their quest to keep the doctrine pure by defending it by all means. For instance, Martin Luther wrote: \"<em>The great difference between doctrine and life is obvious, even as is the difference between heaven and earth. Life may be unclean, sinful, and inconsistent; <strong>but doctrine must be pure, holy, sound, and unchanging</strong>. Life may show omissions and come short of what doctrine calls for. But from doctrine (says Christ, Matt. 5:18 ) not a tittle or letter may be omitted, however much life may fail to meet the requirements of doctrine. This is so because doctrine is God's Word and God's truth alone, whereas life is partly our own doing. On this account doctrine must remain entirely pure. <strong>God will have patience with man's moral failings and imperfections and forgive them. But He cannot, will not, and shall not tolerate a man's altering or abolishing doctrine itself. For doctrine involves His exalted, divine Majesty itself</strong>. In the sphere of doctrine, therefore, forgiveness and patience are out of order.</em>” Amen.\r\n\r\nWith false teachers and their doctrines on the rise, this is the time to completely yield to the Holy Scripture, pray for understanding, the ability to discern and be under pastors and teachers who teach true biblical doctrine. <strong>2Timothy 3:16, \"ALL Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</strong>\". I run into people who say the bible cannot be fully trusted because it was written by men to which I respond it's written by God through men as pens cannot write by themselves. If written by men, it would be filled with errors but it is written by God therefore, its content is pure. The scripture addresses a lot of things and one of the things that I am addressing today is Doctrine (teachings) of God's word. Wrong understanding of the scripture opens us to error and false teachings that are easy to swallow and digest. Wrong understanding of the deity of Christ is enough to doom us to hell because without the right understanding of the true Jesus of the bible who is able to save, the wrong Jesus we think of will not save us for he does not exist.\r\n\r\n<strong>1Timothy 6:20-21, \"20 O Timothy! Guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane and idle babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge- 21 by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith</strong>\". This word \"your trust\" translates to one Greek word, which means, \"deposit.\" The deposit Timothy was to guard is the truth, the divine revelation that God committed to his care. Every Christian, especially if he is in ministry, has that sacred trust to guard the revelation of God <b>(1Corinthians 4:1; 1Thessalonians 2:3, 4) </b>from what is falsely called knowledge. <b>False doctrine is anything claiming to be the truth that is in fact a lie</b>. False teachers typically claim to have the superior knowledge (as in Gnosticism). They claim to know the transcendent secrets, but actually are ignorant and infantile in their understanding.\r\n\r\nDavid in <b>Psalm 138</b> chooses to worship the Lord on two counts, <strong>His loving kindness</strong> and <strong>His truth</strong>. Then he says something that has struck me many times “<b>...F</b><strong>or You have magnified Your word above all Your name</strong>.\" How is it that the Lord has magnified His Word above His name?, here is my understanding of this verse, the Lord has magnified (made it more important) His Holy Word to supersede everyone's thinking of who He is, His attributes and the like. We cannot truly worship God we do not know otherwise we end up with a god we are comfortable with, a god not revealed in the Scriptures. The Lord God Almighty delights in His Word because it gives full counsel of who He is and His nature, this is the reason doctrine is vital. God has magnified His word above His name because the word gives weight, substance, value, quality to His name. Paul was concerned for his son Timothy so he advised him to guard what was taught to him. Even as I share daily, I want to magnify God's Word and keep it pure. I do not want to misrepresent His Word and you have a responsibility to check out the scriptures to be sure that what I am sharing is in line with His Word. We have to be students of the word, hungry for truth even when it is not popular.

              "<strong>John 2:1-10, \"vs. 10 ...but you have saved the best till now.\" (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 8, \"And He said to them, \"Draw some out now, and take it to the master of the feast.\" And they took it\"</strong>. Point to make, <strong>faith goes with humility</strong>. <strong>You can only bow when you are humbled</strong>. Humility is the act of submission or courtesy, submitting to what the Lord has said over what I might think. The servants had faith to pour water however do you not think they would look stupid giving water to the MC? Could not Jesus tell them to taste it first then give? This could have been a test to see if they would still have faith till the end. It is like first having faith for your miracle then having faith for someone's miracle.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 9, \"When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine... the master called the bridegroom. vs. \"10 And he said to him, \"Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine”,(NKJV) </strong>What makes this statement interesting, the MC said, “EVERY MAN” sets the good wine at the beginning\", the difference was, <strong>Jesus was NOT every man</strong>. <strong>His ways are not our ways and His thoughts are not our thoughts</strong>. He does not operate like men. <strong>His is unique doing things uniquely because He is infinite God Man</strong>. Are we not glad He is not like us? we fail, we misjudge, we go astray but He is solid, concrete. <strong>He is the same yesterday, today and forevermore, He changes not. \"... He does things when you least expect them. \"You have saved the best till now!\"(NIV</strong>). <strong>The best that came last was a new thing</strong>, praise God. Adam was God's created son, Jesus was God’s ONLY begotten Son, the BEST did not come first. The first might not be enough and might have flaws but watch, the best was yet to come <strong>The best comes as a total package because the AUTHOR is part of the package!!! Psalm 103.</strong>\r\n\r\nI cannot settle and rejoice over the present, yes I thank God for them but I am looking ahead for the best that is to come. <strong>Romans 8:18, \"For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us\". I am not comfortable where I am for the God of the best is not comfortable with me being where I am</strong>. He did not bring me this far to leave me in the middle, for <strong>Philippians 1:6, \"being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ\". </strong>If God would not stop until He brought the Israelites to the best land He promised them, how much more should we have faith that He will not stop until He has done the best for His own glory. Pour out all you have, trust Him and expect the best to come. <strong>Matt 19:30, \"But many that are first, shall be last; and the last shall be first\", Hebrews 10:9, \"Behold I have come to do thy will oh God, He takes away the first, that He may establish the second</strong>\". The MC thought the bride and the groom saved the best for last, the truth of the matter, Jesus provided the best last. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>John 2:1-10, \"vs. 10...but you have saved the best till now.\" (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen I am a guest in someone's house or at a party, it is natural for me to wait to be seated, served, directed simply because I am a guest. If I was not told or asked to come and serve, I will come dressed to be served. I would imagine this was the case with Jesus. <strong>John 2:3, “And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “They have no wine”.</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHis mother knew He did not come to this world to be served but serve.  Instead of turning to the owners of the wedding to tell them about the wine running out, she turns to her Son. It is important who you turn to when you are in need. Often we forget that <strong>\"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble</strong>\", <strong>Psalm 46:1</strong>. I thank God for Jesus being in the house, we did not invite Him to our affairs so we could get miracles from Him, it is while we were serving Him and others that a need arose and He was the only One who was able to fulfill the need. This is the reason why we do not commune with Him only when we are in trouble but always.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 5, \"His mother said to the servants, \"Whatever He says to you, do it\". </strong>Why was she speaking the way she did? <strong>Perhaps by now she understood that God does new things out of the ordinary</strong>. <strong>She knew that if a miracle was going to happen, her Son would do a supernatural thing out of the natural situation</strong>. Simple instruction needed simple faith in obedience however stupid and foolish it may have sounded. <strong>Vs. 7, \"Jesus said to them, \"Fill the water pots with water\". And they filled them to the brim</strong>\". Does not this sound foolish in your ears like mine? <strong>You may be looking outside for God to move, God could be moving inside</strong>. <strong>The miracle could be from within and not without</strong>. He may use ordinary, despised, neglected, rejected, hated, condemned things. Believe me, the best many times come out of the despised. Look at David despised but God had a calling in his life. Instead of pulling from outside, God pulled from the inside. So was Joseph, Samuel etc. When He was ready to deliver the Israelites, He pulled an ordinary man Moses and made him new. In this case He could have performed a miracle and money would have showed to buy more wine instead He used the natural.\r\n\r\nWater, plain water, no taste, no smell, no color just ordinary water they poured into the pots and filled them to the brim. When you are set for a blessing and simple instructions come, it is easy to try and test it by little dose to see if it works right?, <strong>the one who does things by faith takes the opportunity to maximize the moment</strong>. <strong>When God sets you for a blessing, do not settle for a dosage blessing, set yourself for abundant blessing</strong>. These men were asked to fill the pots, what did they do, not only did they fill them, they filled them to the brim. Many miss God's blessings because they sit to analyze the method and strategy the Lord is going to use. To pour water into the pots had significance, this is a principle to shows how much faith the servants had. <strong>Either you have full faith or little faith, the choice is yours</strong>. They had a chance to pour little water when Jesus said fill them, but they went ahead and filled them to the top. What a faith!!!!. <strong>1Peter 5:7, \"Casting ALL your care upon Him for He cares for you</strong>\". I would take water here to symbolize our cares (needs). Pour not some but ALL into the pot before you, that is faith (trusting someone with your needs). <strong>How much you POUR shows how much you TRUST</strong>!!!, we need FAITH FULL for the best is yet to come.

              "<strong>John 2:1-10, \"vs. 10...but you have saved the best till now.\" (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nPlanning is very vital in everyone's life. If you are going to run your life, family, business, you need a plan, a budget based on what you have and earn. You can only spend within your means unless you want to be in debt. We ought to be good stewards of what is bestowed upon us. A day will come when we will give an account of everything we did with what God gave us. God gives us not to misuse. If He needs you to be rich materially, He is God He can do it. But the word comes back to \"need\" and not \"want\". <strong>Everything God does, He does it for a reason that man may give Him praise</strong>. You may not praise Him the way I do but you will praise Him somehow.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHaving mentioned about planning, how often do you find what you planned was not actually working as you thought and calculated? I will be sharing along these lines. The bible says that there was a wedding in Cana Galilee. The bride and the groom had invited guests of all classes and all ages. Jesus happened to be one of the guests invited. The wedding couple had everything planned out. With the amount of people they expected, they had enough food and drinks as they thought until in the middle of the ceremony they ran out of wine. What do you do when all you thought was covered is now less or ran out? We have bills as our guests in the house. These are guests that do not give but take away. They are visiting not for long as they are there on a mission, to be paid. Thought what you had would cover it only to discover you miscalculated.\r\n\r\nThe guests cannot be sent home, there is no indication that they can receive new wine from somewhere else, we are not even sure there is money to buy more wine leave alone the timing in between. How about you studied, you had skills and ideas to get you somewhere in life then you realize they are not enough. <i>“Lord what do I do when all that could ever work was not enough to cover what I needed covered?\"</i> Ever asked yourself that question? <strong>Thank God for the good you had, however know that the best is yet to come</strong>. If you rejoiced over the good, just know that the good will run out leaving you with nothing to do. <strong>As long as you still have things under your control, you are not ready for the best yet. With God, the good may have to run dry that He may bring the best.</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe the reason for leaving the good to dry first before bringing the best is to make you understand He is the <strong>God of new things</strong>. <strong>Isaiah 42:9, \"Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I declare\", Isaiah 43:19, \"Behold, I will do a new thing</strong>\". The old thing cannot contaminate the new thing, there has to be a separation. If the new blends in with the old, you might not even tell the difference because you will not know. When we come to Christ, the old man dies and the new man arises. <strong>There is no way that the old man is improved</strong>, he has to be taken away from the picture, dead. God is doing something, it is not a new thing to Him, it’s a new thing to us. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Samuel 2:17, \"Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for men abhorred the offering of the Lord.18 BUT Samuel ministered before the Lord,<em> even as</em> a child, …”</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the scripture takes time to address the behavior of Eli’s sons in bits then changes to addresses the young life of Samuel, then again Eli’s sons before it comes back to Samuel.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nSamuel was like a child Eli never had, a child who feared the Lord, received his teachings, a child he did not struggle to raise because God’s hand was on him. What a different child to be proud of, different from Hophni and Pheneas because he was prayed in and prayed through. In serving together in the temple, Eli and Samuel had a relationship more of a father son relationship. A relationship I imagine Eli would have loved to have with his sons and a desire to serve the Lord together with his sons in the temple.\r\n\r\nThe Lord passed judgment over the house of Eli and Eli somehow accepted what was to come. Just in my wild thinking, what would have happened if he interceded for his sons even in the midst of their rebellion and God’s judgment upon them? Who knows if the Lord would have softened and changed the hearts of his sons? Eli may have given up on them, something parents should never do. In the midst of all rebellion, the prodigal son’s father lost his son to the world but never once did he give up on waiting for him to come back home, constantly watching and waiting patiently. You never know what God can do with fervent, earnest, desperate prayers, for Him to change the hearts of your children. God is faithful to bring back and I am a living witness to this. If only Eli interceded for his sons, who knows how that would have changed their fate, after all Hannah’s closed womb by God was opened by prayers answered through Eli’s prophesy.\r\n\r\nI also believe that we as children to our parents today will also influence to some degree how our children will be to us as parents. Parents want to pass the baton to their children and their children to pass it to their children’s children. I want to be all I can be to my parents today as this is also a seed planted for my children to come. And may this flow down from one generation to another. In the bible you hear, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, what a legacy. What my parents started, I want to continue and pass it down to my children. The bible says in <strong>Proverbs 17:6, “Children’s children are the crown of old men, And the glory of children is their father”.</strong> In Eli’s case, his sons were not in a position to preserve their father’s legacy of serving the Lord for over 40 years for God was going to destroy them and no one was there to intercede.\r\n\r\nDo not write off your children yet, God has not written them off yet. You still have something within reach you can use to change the course of their destiny, prayers. My parents prayed me through when I did not know the Lord and did not look like I was going to. They patiently waited for their prodigal son to come home. I thank God they did not write me off like Eli who wrote off his sons and would not intercede for them. They did the best to raise me in the fear and the knowledge of God and left the rest for God. God's hands were on Samuel all his life, thank God He has His hands on us as children and His hands on our children. You can stand by the gates of hell and redirect the traffic with prayers if you know your children are a target. God is not done with them. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1 Samuel 2:17-18, \"17 Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for men abhorred the offering of the Lord. 18 BUT Samuel ministered before the Lord, even as a child, …”</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe parents have one of the most difficult challenges in raising children. The moment a child is born, the Christian parents raise their children the best they know how in light of God’s word. Still they do not know how their children will turn out to be as they grow older. I think parenting is exciting at the same time very scary. In as much as parents hope and pray that their children turn out right, there is a wonder and fear inside. I am not a parent yet but I am beginning to think and wonder, how will my children turn out to be when God blesses us with them? No one encounters with the end results, only the process.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nEli served God as a judge for 40 years. He had a successful ministry but a broken home. He had two sons Hophni and Pheneas. Both sons were to be priests but they were worthless, corrupt men who promoted prostitution, abhorred the offering of the Lord and refused to heed to their father’s teachings, rebuke and advice. What a disappointed father Eli was that in spite of being successful in ministry, he had failed as a father and God held him accountable for it. He lacked the firmness to control his sons. Two sons had gone bad and their father had no son to be proud of. The bible says, <strong>vs. “17 Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord</strong>”. I do not think Eli ever imagined his sons turning out this way but they did<strong>. Vs. 18, “ BUT Samuel ministered before the Lord, even as a child, …</strong>”. In spite of Eli’s sons gone wrong, there was but a young child Samuel who ministered before the Lord. In the midst of looking around and seeing children going against God and are being disobedient to their parents and to authority, I am reminded of “BUT” word. It tells us God is still raising children in the midst of bad things happening around. Children like Samuel who will grow in the fear and the knowledge of God because they were prayed in and prayed through. God’s hand is upon their lives because their parents prayed for them and commended them to God’s hands. They did the best and left the rest in God’s able hand. Parents cannot change the hearts of their children, God can.\r\n\r\nLet us make a few steps back and understand how Samuel came into the picture. Samuel was born in an answer to a tearful prayer of his mother Hannah. Let this be a reminder to you that it is not too late or too early to pray for your child (children), I am a firm believer of it. I do not have children but I have begun praying for them and praying them through. Praying that one day God will give and begin to use them at their young age like Samuel. Eli prophesied the birth of Samuel and when he was young, he came to minister with Eli to the Lord in the temple. Samuel’s mother prayed him in and prayed him through. Her desire was for the Lord to bless and use the blessing. That God’s hand would be upon her God given gift. She was offering back to the Lord what came from Him, a son. This is a prayer all Christian parents should offer to God.\r\n\r\nGod told Jeremiah, <strong>Jeremiah 1:5, “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations.”</strong> There are four “I”s in direct link to God to show how God’s hand was in the process from the time He thought of Jeremiah, to forming him, to sanctifying him, to calling him. Only God who gave them knows their beginning to their end, therefore He can be trusted with what He gives and that is by praying them in and praying them through saying, \"Lord I commend them to you\". blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/commend-all-to-god-part-2of2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Commend All To God, Part 2of2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Matthew 13:24-30, \"24 Jesus told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away\" </strong>\r\n\r\nI can trace back to the book of Genesis to see how the enemy always steals from God's people, and how he also plants stuff. If something is stolen, it may be easy to identify what is missing, however when something is planted, it takes time to grow and by the time you get to see the symptoms, the damage would have already been done.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLet us look at the weeds the enemy planted in the lives of God's children <strong>Genesis 3:8, \"Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, \"Has God indeed said, \"You shall not eat of every tree of the garden'?\" </strong>While man did not know what to plant in his life, God planted good seeds and everything was fine until Adam was absent (asleep) that the enemy sneaked in to plant weeds. I wonder why the serpent waited till Eve was alone. Anyway I see an indication of the husband being the protector, defender, fighter of the home. Standing for the truth and leading the family in the truth. And the first weeds I see in this verse, the enemy <strong>planted lies, confusion and doubt </strong>and immediately those weeds began to chock the truth they always lived by. Today many question the validity of God’s word especially about marriage (between a man and a woman, or about divorce, or how to raise children) many question \"did God really say that?\" or conclude that God did not mean it the way it appears. Look at how Joshua protected his family from allowing the enemy to plant weeds <strong>\"as for me (Joshua) and my house, we will serve the Lord\", Joshua 24:15. </strong>There were evil weeds the enemy was planting in the lives of the Israelites and Joshua gave the people a choice as to who to serve (gain good seeds), then he mentioned to them about his stand, to stay awake and watch in order to protect his family from allowing the enemy to plant weeds. <strong>The enemy is cunning and if he can not take away from you, be ready because he will try to find ways to plant something else, mostly doubt</strong>.\r\n\r\nIn our world today even Christians have too many weeds growing in their lives, this has stunted growths in many lives. One of the greatest weed is deception, being deceived by strange doctrines that appear as truth. <strong>It's not that enemy has taken the truth away from you, he has distorted the truth by planting something else that competed with the right seed </strong>and now you are wondering which of this is good seed and the weeds. A number nurture weeds they should get rid of and pay little or no attention to the good seeds. Adam and Eve were deceived and they could not tell what the truth was and what was a lie. That is the work of the enemy, <strong>if he can not steal it, he will plant something else</strong>.\r\n\r\nWhat do we do when we see the weeds in our garden? Something to help us, One day while working on the front yard of my parents’ house, there were too many unwanted weeds growing on their yard, we had tried uprooting them before, but they came back. The reason they came back was because when you uproot, the seeds still remain and that is what begins to grow again. So I went to the store and found a spray that could ONLY KILL THE WEEDS WITHOUT DESTROYING the flowers planted. Not only would it kill the present growing weeds, it would kill even their unborn seeds. I did not have to be out there the whole day trying to pull them because I would also be destroying the flowers too. All I needed to do was spray and let the spray do its work. We have the truth of the <b>WORD </b><strong>OF THE LAMB</strong> and spray on our gardens. Yes we have good seeds and weeds, and if we cannot identify the weeds, the truth will. If we are scared of damaging the good seeds while uprooting the weeds, the truth of the word will preserve the good seeds and destroy the weeds. If we fall asleep and the enemy plants weeds, do not think it is over, take the truth and spray it over your garden (family, job, position, ministry, while you drive), the weeds will die with their seeds too, and you will have another chance to grow stronger and blossom. To have weeds free garden, we are told in <strong>Revelation 12:11, “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony (truth of God’s word)</strong>”.

              "<strong>Exodus 2:21, \"Then Moses was content to live with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses\"</strong>\r\n\r\nTo run away from something may bring temporary relief. It may be for days, weeks, months and even years. You may even want to completely put it in the past only to discover that occasionally, it comes back to your memory and if you do not deal with it, it will haunt you for a long time. It is one of those things you just want to stay away from, a thing that you have relocated from because it is just too hard to handle. Every time you think of it, fear grips your heart and you know that it could be the point from which God will raise you in a mighty way.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nMoses found himself in a situation where he had to run away and not deal with his current circumstance. If you remember, he had killed an Egyptian. Upon being discovered, he ran for his life. Living in the land of Median brought him relief. He was not a prince anymore but at least safe, married, living well, cared for, and he was also a shepherd. All looked good and peaceful at the same time wondering about the meaning of life and why life is so hard.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his new found life, the Lord calls him, <strong>Exodus 3:10, \"Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt</strong>.\" What would happen if you were told that your progress depended on confronting what you ran away from? What you ran away from scared you to death and now God is telling you to go back and face it? The bible says, Moses was \"content\", sounds nice however God wanted to raise Him up to be more than a shepherd and the first thing was to bring him back to face his fears and anxiety. God had the Israelites in mind when He called Moses, I also believe this was going to be his training ground, a classroom, a place of learning. This time he was not going to take the class alone. He had been given a rod of a shepherd to perform miracles and He had God's presence to go with him, <strong>Exodus 3:12, \"So He said, \"I will certainly be with you\"</strong>. It was time to show Moses that God was bigger than what he ran away from. It was going to be much tougher yet out of it, Moses would be raised to be a leader and God would be glorified. Jacob had to come back to face Esau his brother whom he ran away from, this time God was with him. Jonah had to accomplish what he was running away from in humility.\r\n\r\nWith God I can heal, learn and face all that I have been running from. When I see and know that my time has come to feel the sun again because God lights my morning. When what was believed to be an ash is actually a flame as it is revealed by the breath of God blowing air to fan the flame. He will get the glory and you will be raised. You do not have to face it alone; He will be there with you through it all. What have you been running away from? “As long as His presence is going with me, I will face all that I have been trying to run away from\". Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>John 5:1-11, \"The impotent man answered Him, Sir, I have no man, when the troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming another steps down before me\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAllow me to take something in the natural to address a something supernatural. Pictures speak louder, clearer and harder to forget. No wonder Jesus used the natural to make a point so that His listeners would learn something and retain it. To put this message together, I thought of using a spinal cord.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe question that first comes into mind is what is a spinal cord, it's function and its importance? Spinal cord is part of the nervous system cordlike structures which are made up of nerve fibers. They are the nerves that carry most of the messages from the brain to the body and vice versa. We can tell that it's a communication system of the body which includes sensory, motor and autonomic functions. Whoever has spinal injury is always left paralyzed from the waist down or even from neck down. This would mean command is there but the communication is missing hence leading to loss of motion or feeling in the lower parts of the body especially on the legs. It looks and sounds small but very vital.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to tell what the man in the scriptures had, however we can speculate he had some disorder maybe that of spinal that left him impotent. He could think, reason, and know the season when the water was troubled but his condition would not allow him to move. There was a command but no communication, and that left him in his condition for many years. He gambled with his life hoping that one day he would make it into the pool when water was troubled, however for 38 years nothing happened and year after year he was in the same place.\r\n\r\nDo you like me sometime find yourself in places and situations for too long? Many times I want to move, I send commands to move but the communication to that part is missing. Paul says, \"<strong>The things I should do I don't do, but the things I shouldn't do are the ones I do</strong>\" (paraphrased). This is being impotent, wanting to be free from certain things of the world. You promise yourself that next time you will rise but the command is not sending the message to the legs to move and change locations, how frustrating. What happens when you have waited for too long and nothing is happening? Discouragement comes in and before long if nothing completely happens one gets numb to the situation.\r\n\r\nHowever long you have been in a situation like this, there is still hope. There is hope for the hopeless; there is no need to fear. When all hope is gone, Christ will be there. When you can't reach Him, He will find and reach you by the pool where you are waiting for the water to be troubled (miracle). The impotence can be made important because the Lord is not done with you yet. What has been carrying you will be the thing that you will carry when it's said and done. He can restore that spine and the communication will respond to the command again. That is why I thank God for prayers, for prayer is a means of restoration, bringing back to life that which stopped functioning effectively. When I pray, my faith is boosted to attempt the impossible, resist sin, make wise moves and be responsible. This causes me be an asset rather than a liability. Prayer is the communication that activates God's commands in a situation, <strong>Psalms 37:23, \"The steps (goes with legs) of a good man are ordered (commanded) by the Lord, and He delights in his way,\"</strong>. I can now see that when I have that communication, the commands from Him will reach my legs and cause me to move. Those who have no prayer life have spinal injury and need healing. It may look small and insignificant but check again. Without a prayer life, one becomes impotent sitting in place forever. You could do greater things when you have communication through prayer, <strong>Mark 11:24, \"...whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them\".</strong> The command (from God) is always there, all you and I need is that communication (prayer) restored that our impotent prayer life can be made important.

              "<strong>Luke 15:8-10, “…Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</strong>\r\n\r\nYou may be familiar with a story reported in January 2007 of a man by the name of Wesley Autrey. He saved Cameron Hollopeter, a 19-year-old film student who had suffered seizure and fallen onto the tracks from being struck by a New York City subway train.<!--more--> This is what he did, as Hollopeter lay on the tracks, Autrey saw the lights of an incoming train and was moved to do something about Hollopeter who was in grave danger. As one of the women held Autrey's daughters back away from the edge of the platform, Autrey dove onto the tracks. He thought he would be able to pull Hollopeter off the tracks right before the train got to them, but then realized there was not enough time to drag Hollopeter away from the tracks. Instead, he protected this young man by throwing himself over his body in a drainage trench between the tracks, where he held him down tight. The operator of the train applied the brakes, but two cars still passed over them, close enough to leave grease on his cap. This is how Hollopeter was saved that day.\r\n\r\nOut of this true story, who received praises and attention, was it the saved, Hollopeter or Mr. Autrey the saver? If you search the story, you will find that Mr. Autrey became a celebrity overnight. He was showered with praises, gifts, invited to talk shows, given an award, called a hero etc.\r\n\r\nIn <b>Luke 15</b>, Jesus is hanging out with the tax collectors and sinners. He was drawn to these kind of people because they were the lost yet humble people He came to seek and save. Jesus takes time to give three parables, The first two parables both picture God as taking the initiative in seeking sinners. The rabbis taught that God would receive sinners who sought His forgiveness earnestly enough, but here God is the One seeking the sinner. The first parable is about a shepherd leaving 99 found sheep and goes to look for the one that was lost and in danger. Like the story above, it’s not Hollopeter who saw himself in danger, he was overcome by seizure, it’s Mr. Autrey who saw him in danger leaving his two daughters to reach and save this young man.\r\n\r\nThe second parable is the parable of the lost coin. Where it’s told of a woman having ten silver coins loses one then lights the lamp, sweeps the house and carefully looks for it until she finds it. <strong>vs. 9 And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, ‘<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Rejoice with ME, for I have found</span> the piece which I lost!</strong>’\r\n\r\nLet’s pen the message off second parable,<b> vs. 10</b> says, <strong>“Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</strong> The question is, is the repented sinner the angels are rejoicing over? Let’s look at Vs. 9 of this same chapter which tells us different, it says, “Rejoice with <strong>ME</strong>, for <strong>I</strong> have found the piece which <strong>I</strong> lost”. I see the angels rejoicing over God who has yet saved another lost soul (sinner). You can imagine the angels celebrating over God that despite His nature, He has provided away to save sinners without compromising His nature. The angels are rejoicing because God was kind enough to reach and save another lost soul from a drainage trench of sin and from His track of wrath. God takes pleasure in saving lost souls. Of all the bible reading I have done, this is the only time I hear of great celebration in heaven which is a reminder to us of how important it is.\r\n\r\nWe rejoice over the birth of Christ on Christmas day, heaven rejoices over God every time He has births a new soul into His kingdom through repentance and faith. Can we give heaven a reason to rejoice over God by seeking to save that which is lost? We share the gospel, God saves, heaven rejoices and He receives all the glory. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Peter 3:7, \"Husbands, likewise, dwell with them (wives) with understanding, giving HONOR to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe as husbands are called to dwell with our wives with understanding to which I will add, understanding heart which is to say being sympathetic. At times men can be insensitive, arrogant and pushy not caring about the feelings of other people especially their wives.<!--more--> It's amazing how easy it is to be nice to everyone but the one you love and married to, the whole reason HONORING the wife becomes hard. Peter tells us to give HONOR to our wives, other bible versions say RESPECT. I feel that HONOR goes far beyond respect. We often see honor given to whoever honor is due and also given to those who have earned it. In our case, it's not about giving honor because they deserve it, but because the bible says so. I could use H.O.N.O.R as an acronym, H-elp, O-penness, N-urture, O-bservant, R-omance and R-espect.\r\n\r\n<strong>HELP</strong> - Husbands, our wives need our help be it with the housework, with the children, run errands. We are Honoring God and our wives when we step in to give a helping hand whichever way we can to make their work easy. Even Christ, the demonstration of a husband to the church also helps us in our day to day lives. Some husbands have a bad mentality that some jobs are left for wives therefore they will not step in to help even if the wife needs it. We are all created equal and yes there are some things expected of wives but that does not mean husbands are exempt from them. We can love by demonstrating.\r\n\r\n<strong>OPENNESS</strong> - It's hard for husbands to be open and real. Our wives feel they are part of our lives when we open up to them on what we are facing regularly. A wife can be frustrated when she knows that her husband is facing a challenge and is not willing to trust her with his feelings. I believe your wife can feel honored when she knows that her husband can confide in her and not feel his manhood is threatened by his vulnerability. This would also go with spending time with our wives. They want us to engage them in conversations, a feeling of closeness and belonging.\r\n\r\n<strong>NURTURE</strong> - A wife feels honored when she knows her husband is out to protect, support and encourage her. Bringing out the best in her without belittling her or treating her as dirt. See the verse says, \"<strong>giving HONOR to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, \", </strong>mark the word, \"WEAKER\", it doesn't say WEAK which would mean that though they are strong, husbands are much stronger than them and that strength is to be used to make them feel safe and comfortable and not superior. We can nurture with gentle words, thoughtful gifts, by helping them develop their inner beauty.\r\n\r\n<strong>OBSERVANT</strong> - Every wife will agree they feel honored when their husbands are observant, taking notice and complementing the good things they do, for example cooking, fixing their hair, dressing, taking keen interest in their day to day activities.\r\n\r\n<strong>ROMANTIC - </strong><b>In the light of love other gifts they may flower but love is the only power. </b>Marriage ought to be exciting and fun despite some other things that come up. Some feel that marriage is a trap, some have chosen singleness and called it freedom. Those who are happily married know it different, they have learnt that it is a commitment. They have learnt that God is glorified in their marriage when they are committed to it and they do whatever it takes to love and respect their spouses. We have to learn to love more, be affectionate, warm, tender, admiring and showing it by our treatment. Going out of our way to hug, cherish, speak words of love, send love notes, surprise dinner home cooked or outing. Our wives can feel honored.\r\n\r\nThere is more about honoring that we could get into but let me stop with this line again, <strong>In the light of love other gifts they may flower but love is the only power</strong>. We can see new gifts flower as we honor our wives in the way that pleases God. By the way, Husbands if you don't honor your wife, forget about your prayers being answered, the bible says so. We have a job to do!!

              "<strong>1Corinthians 2:1-2,\"1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. 2 For I determined not to know anything among you except JESUS CHRIST AND HIM CRUCIFIED\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6117\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image4.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"263\" height=\"191\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nI recently listened to a radio program which dealt with what is more important in sharing our faith. On the streets they asked a number of people what they would share, 80-90% said their testimony would be the main thing to share, in other words what God has done for them. <!--more-->It sounded like our testimony would be a stronger persuasion tool than His testimony, what He has done and accomplished on the cross. I have sat to listen to a few testimonies; a number had the spotlight on the person giving testimony rather than Christ.\r\n\r\nWe should have a place for testimony in our sharing however, if our testimony overshadows His testimony, then we are out of focus. If I were to use movies to make this point clear, I would say He is the main character; we are the supporting cast, not the other way round. We would not even appear on the credits in dealing with Him.\r\n\r\nPaul had a very unique way of writing. I find that he introduces himself and then gets out of the way for the main character Jesus to be enthroned. He takes the spotlight off himself and places it on Christ. He’s aim was not to show WHO he was but rather WHOSE he was, the One he belonged to, Christ. Paul had such a great conversion testimony; a wow testimony compared to many, yet he knew Christ's testimony was way bigger than His. He says, vs. “<b>1 </b><strong>And I, brethren, when I came to you, I did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God, 2 For I determined not to know anything among you except JESUS CHRIST AND HIM CRUCIFIED\", 2Corinthians 2:1&amp;2. </strong>He was bringing the testimony of God, Jesus Christ and not what He has done for us though that is important, but Christ and Him crucified. <b>Christ to be the CENTER of his message rather than Christ be the LABEL of his message.</b>\r\n\r\nOur testimony can fail and has many times; His never fails the more reason we ought to declare His testimony. God put the spotlight on His Son, <strong>Hebrews 1:1</strong>-<b>4, \"1 </b><strong>God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 2 has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; 3 who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4 having become so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they”</strong>. The Holy Spirit in <b>John 16 </b>came to highlight Christ by leading His followers into the truth as it is in Jesus.\r\n\r\nWhat is His testimony, <strong>John 3:13-15, “13 No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life</strong>.<strong> John 12:32, “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me”.</strong>\r\n\r\nLet us be careful that even when we give our testimonies that we don’t allow the spotlight of the testimony to be on us. His testimony is way bigger and greater than ours; His story is what will draw men to Himself. Let’s lift Him up in our sharing of the gospel by preaching Jesus Christ and Him crucified.

              "<strong>Matthew 5:13, \"You are salt of earth...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce in a while I appreciate a cup of hot tea late in the afternoon on a cold day after a long day’s work. One time I got off work and came home thinking of how I could use a cup of tea. Upon reaching home, I made some tea, I found a dish of sugar or what I thought was sugar. Being confident it was sugar, I scooped two spoons full into the tea, stirred it up and made the first sip, what a taste! That was not sugar but pure salt, I missed my precious tea but understood the power of salt.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nSalt is a colorless or white crystalline solid, chiefly sodium chloride, used extensively in ground or granulated form as food seasoning and preservative. <strong>It is an element that gives flavor. </strong>This is its primary function.\r\n\r\nThere is something about salt that we need to understand because it shows us what Jesus meant when He said, <strong>\"You are the salt of the earth\". </strong>I read somewhere that there are 14,000 uses of salt. Let's look at some uses of salt. A pinch of salt will make food tasty whereas in comparison, you will need a lot more than a pinch to make sugar taste in your tea. Salt is not made out of something like sugar, salt mostly is found around the lakes, oceans, or streams. Salt is used to melt ice, used as a preservative, used to treat wounds, creates thirst, and stops colors from fading on fabrics. Also salt causes water to boil faster, it can be used to peel boiling eggs faster, greasy pans can be cleaned using salt etc.\r\n\r\nIf the salt has a lot of uses, we can understand that when the Lord called us salt, He knew He had equipped believers in many ways to do His work, therefore every believer as salt has something to do. You can add flavor because you are salty. You can melt hard hearts; you can preserve by your salty words; you can treat wounds (spiritually wounded); you can create thirst for righteousness when you preach the gospel; you can stop precious people and things from fading away; you can clean using your words, and by all means you can be a salt that the Lord will use to restore someone. Remember that a pinch of salt can go a long way. You do not have to be an expert, scientist, doctor, or a professional to salt someone’s life, all you have to do is remember what Jesus has called you, SALT and you get your saltiness from Him.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mathew 5:13, \"... but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men</strong>\", I do not know how salt can lose its saltiness but it is possible the Lord tells us. You lose your saltiness when you disconnect yourself from the stream of water where salt is found. We are to be like a tree planted by the river bearing our fruit (salt) in our season. Who wants to use salt that has no flavor? And who will want to use salt that is not effective? When it is good for nothing, it is thrown away.\r\n\r\nCheck your personal life, do you consider yourself to be salt? If you are, are you salting the people around you in every way salt can be used? Are you stretched to the maximum in the sense that you are fully utilizing your saltiness to affect your surrounding? As salt is not reserved for some people, all believers should be connected to the living stream. Salt through prayers, encouragements, assisting, spending time with someone and more. Salt in the salt shaker is not effective, it is only effective when used for the purpose it was gathered. Are you in a salt shaker? Ask the Lord to use you for the reason He created you if He is not already.

              "<strong>Psalm 68:19, \"Blessed be the Lord our God who daily loads us with benefits\"</strong>\r\n\r\nOur God is awesome; He does things more than once in our lives, daily He does them. The bible says <strong>“His mercies are new every morning”</strong>. He does not give us yesterday's mercies. He knows what we need today and that's why He tells us not to worry about tomorrow in <strong>Matthew 6</strong>. If He can be trusted to take care of us today, He can be trusted to take care of us tomorrow. He is our source and our provider, all He desires is that we stay connected.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLet me use computers as an example in putting this message together. If you bought a computer, it will not function effectively until some apps/software programs are loaded in it. It’s not designed to work without apps/software programs. Each starting with Windows, to Microsoft office and other vital software come in handy when what you are doing will need such kind of software to do your work effectively. Without proper software, you cannot accomplish much even if you are skilled and knew your way around. For database, Access will be loaded; for Math and spreadsheets, Excel will come in handy; for letter writing and spell check, Word will be needed and so on and so forth. God does the same with us daily, He knows what kind of software we need for each day and He loads us with them to function effectively.\r\n\r\nNote how the verse above begins, “<strong>Blessed be the Lord our God”, </strong>which actually means that He is a blessed God who has every kind of software (blessings, good things) we could ever need for this day and always. <strong>Psalm 103:2, “Bless the Lord of my soul and forget not His benefits”. </strong>A number of Christians do not know that God has benefits He wants to bestow upon His children and so they don't believe asking God for them will work. They believe salvation is the end, <strong>Psalm 103</strong> tells us salvation comes with benefits package. When you apply for a job, you care to know if there are benefits that come with the job package. So even with us Christians, there are benefits that come with salvation; all we need to do is know what they are. We don’t get saved for benefits, it is while we are serving Him He loads us, lavish us with them. As you read <strong>Psalms 103:3</strong> and verses that follows, you see that forgiveness, healing, redemption from destruction, crowned with loving kindness, tender mercies, mouths satisfied with good things, renewal of our youths, execution of righteousness etc. are some of the benefits (software programs) God bestows upon us to function effectively.\r\n\r\nDon't you ever forget that the Lord daily loads us with benefits. If you need the software for peace today, He will load you with it. Software for grace, healing, comfort, encouragement, understanding, love, joy, favor, desires, money, whatever it is, He will load you with them as His child. Therefore reboot your computer and get in tune with Him. He will take out the corrupted files; delete temp files (baggages) that slow you down. He will check for viruses (fear, doubt, anger, frustrations etc.) that cripple you and hinder the software (good things from Him) from working effectively in your life. And let Him begin the process of loading you with His benefits. <strong>Psalm 46:10, \"Be still and know that I am God\", Psalm 23:1, \"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want\", Psalm 23:6, \"surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life\", Psalm 37:23, \"the good steps of a righteous man are ordered by the Lord. Load me Lord today and always\"</strong> Blessings Ev\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

              "<strong>Hebrews 10:14, \"For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI love attending weddings of family and friends. One thing about weddings is that everyone wants things perfect, to run smoothly, orderly, timely and in place. Rehearsals are done to address how things will run.\r\n\r\nThe bride's dress is one of the most expensive things about the wedding. The white pure dress which symbolizes purity is kept safe waiting to be put on the actual day. <strong>What consumes the mind of the bride is how she will look perfect before her groom</strong>. She does not so much care about what everyone else will say or think, all she cares about is how good she will look for the groom and how the groom will respond to her efforts.<!--more--> Because she cares about how she will look, she makes sure that she has everything she needs to bring herself to that perfection. If you are going to perfect yourself, by whose level will you do it? The one you want to please. If I was to measure myself with the life of certain people, I would look better because I will conclude that I am not as messed up as they are but when I create my own standard, that would mean living the way I feel is good for. If I am okay or comfortable with it, then its right for me, I would call that my own perfection. The bride is not out to create her own perfection, she is out to look perfect before the groom. That is her standard, that is the mark and that is the measure. She may fall short of it, but she would have done everything in her power, and even get advises from people who know what catches the eyes of the groom and go for it. <strong>Mathew 5:48, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your heavenly Father which is in heaven is perfect\".</strong> Jesus is the groom we want to please on that day, <strong>Revelation 19:7, “Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.” 8 And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints</strong>”. Will we be perfect? of course not, but that is the mark we all strive for?. By whose standards of perfection are you striving for, yours, someone else or the grooms? <strong>Hebrews 10:14, \"For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.\" </strong>Through His offering, we have received His gift of grace and mercy, He has perfected us and our desire is to now keep that perfection.\r\n\r\nPicture the groom in church, standing right by the altar waiting for his bride to be. Everyone seated chatting and having a good time, occasionally the groom chats with others but his mind is consumed by how beautiful his bride will look when she walks through the door. Suddenly they announce the arrival of the bride, everyone rises up, everyone is quiet and all eyes looking at the bride as she walks gracefully down the aisle towards the groom. She is not looking around at those who are there in as much as they matter, all she can see before her is her groom. What about the groom standing there majestically looking at the bride he has waited for and finally here she is.\r\n\r\nWe are the bride preparing ourselves to meet the groom on that day. Our motive and zeal is not to please the people who will show up at the wedding but the groom Himself. I can imagine on that day that as the bride walks in, all heaven becomes silent, all angels on their feet and all eyes locked on the bride who has been adorning herself here on earth and the groom saying, this is the bride I have waited for since the day I gave myself for her on the cross. I died for her because I loved her and she has kept herself pure because she loved Me too. What a glorious day that would be. What I'm I saying, the bride is not trying to live by her own standards, she is trying to live by the standards of the groom, just to please Him. <strong>Romans 10:3, \"For they being ignorant of God's righteousness (perfection), and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God vs. 4, \"FOR CHRIST IS THE END OF THE LAW FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES</strong>\". We will never be perfect, but I strive for His perfection not mine or someone else. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Joshua 13:1, \"Now Joshua was old, advanced in years. And the Lord said to him, \"You are old, advanced in years, and there remains very much land yet to be possessed\".</strong>\r\n\r\nIf I were to describe life and sum it up in one word, I would say life is \"<strong>INTERESTING</strong>\". <strong>What is life? It is the time when someone exists or functions</strong>. Life is full of series of emotions. It is full of surprises and complicated. Some people are fed up with it and see no reason to live anymore. Others have tried suicide and succeeded, others in their attempt failed.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHopelessness drives many to contemplate suicide and some are left severely depressed. You may have never thought of it but where you work, where you hang out, someone has thought of committing suicide or has tried but failed. Children aborted are lives cut short. Life is full of ups and downs, it is like roller coasters, at times it moves so fast down the hill, at times it climbs the hill slower; at times it puts you upside down, at times everything spins leaving you lost. You grow up full of dreams and desires but as you face real life, all those dreams and desires are put to test. Life is also a series of choices we make.\r\n\r\nAs long as God gives us breath, we have a life to live to the fullest for His glory. <strong>Life deals with time and time waits for no man</strong>. Yes, life will be up and down, quitting may present an option but God requires us to live to the fullest with Him on our side. He created each of us for a purpose and His plan is to fulfill that purpose in this life. Joshua lived a life full of battles; from the beginning, the Lord made a promise to him of His presence to Joshua. In <b>Joshua 12,</b> he fought many strong battles winning them because God was with him. Now he is old and stricken and God says”… <strong>there remains very much land yet to be possessed”</strong>. Even with all he did, there was still work to do.\r\n\r\nPeople like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Noah, and David, to mention a few lived their lives to the fullest. They had their battles to fight but they refused to terminate their lives before time. They understood they were created for a reason. When you and I know why we were created, we will live the way God had planned, and our cry and prayer, “Lord help us to live this life\". Looking back at what you survived in school, being mocked, coming from bad neighborhoods, disappointments, heartaches, brokenness, going without etc., these should serve as a reference that you are a survivor. If you survived them, do you not realize these too shall pass? <strong>I look back at my life and see what I have survived cannot be compared to what I am facing now</strong>. You may be outnumbered by what you have to face and deal with, but the same God who started your life knew enough pressure you could handle in this life therefore entrusted you with it knowing that it would not destroy you as long as He is in control. In the end looking back, I can see why the battle had to be fierce.\r\n\r\nAs long as the body has life even in the worse conditions, the doctors try their best to save it. The person could be bleeding to death and many could be losing hope however, they will still do everything in their power to stabilize that life because it has a purpose. A purpose to be accepted, loved, give the same to other people. It is your life surrounded by people affected by it.\r\n\r\nFor those who may remember a media coverage in 1987 of 18month old baby Jessica McClure in Texas who fell into an open well. She was alive in the well and there were experts who brought all their equipment to help save her life. For about 58 hours the work was on around the clock, the situation looked tougher and tougher as the little girl was trapped in that well. They had microphone lowered into the well to assist in hearing her, they utilized devises to communicate with her, encouraged her, sang her favorite songs, gave her hope while they struggled to find ways to rescue her. Volunteers who went down the well to dig, came back up exhausted, passing out in need of medical attention yet they could not give up for there was a life to be saved, a life that needed to live to the fullest. What a celebration when she was finally rescued. She is now 25 years old and married.\r\n\r\nThough life is tough, life is precious and with God on your side, you can look at it differently as an opportunity to live for God. Jesus said in <strong>John 10:10, “The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly</strong>\" I love the chorus of this hymn, “<strong>Because He lives, I can face tomorrow; Because He lives, all fears are gone; Because I know, that He owns the future, and LIFE IS WORTH A LIVING, just because He lives\"</strong>. Before He takes me home, I have a life to live. Blessings Evans."

              "<strong>2Timothy 4:9-10, “9 Be diligent to come to me quickly; 10 for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica—Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe all love the seal of approval from people who know us and respect what we do or what we’ve been called to do. Writers of books, those seeking elections, those who work on projects associate themselves with people who believe in them to endorse them and their products. They write forwards for their books, do commercials for them. They do not just pick anyone to endorse them, they pick people who are known, reputable, have credentials etc.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn this verse, we meet Demas. You may have heard his name or hearing it for the first time. Here we find Apostle Paul writing to his son in the faith final thoughts while hoping to see him shortly. In this writing, he brings Timothy up to date on the spiritual condition, activities and whereabouts of certain men and women who either helped or harmed his ministry.\r\n\r\nWe have to start by knowing who Demas was and how his life is applicable in our generation. Demas had been one of Paul’s close associates along with Luke and Epaphras. He had ministered alongside of Paul on many occasions but it appears that as time went by, something in him began to change. While Paul gave updates and seal of approval on everyone, he says nothing positive about Demas, here is what he says, <strong>2Timothy 4:9-10, “9 Be diligent to come to me quickly; 10 for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica”</strong>, Demas though little is known of him is a presentation of many in our today’s Christianity.\r\n\r\nA question that arises at this moment is, was Demas a believer or a false convert. He forsook and left Paul to embrace the present world. It is not said that Demas had ceased to be a Christian publicly renouncing the Lord; but it was not in his heart to bear the cross with the apostle. I think he loved comfort, he loved the easy going life, he could have also loved money. He loved what following Christ did for him as long as he did not have to suffer for Christ. He started well but then changed course. He began to be influenced, shaped, and drawn to the world. This is how Lot ended up in Sodom. He started by pitching his tent facing Sodom and before long he was living in Sodom.\r\n\r\nIf you hooked up with Paul, you had better buckle up for a bumpy ride for he faced things like persecution, shipwreck, imprisonment etc. Demas may have not counted the cost of genuine commitment of following Christ. Today we would call it easy believing, exactly what is being preached by many out here. Preaching that promises heaven on earth, preaching that does not talk about bearing the cross, putting the hand on the plow and not looking back. Preaching that says come to Christ without your life being changed. Churches that appeal to men rather than God by creating worldly atmosphere, using worldly gimmicks and techniques to draw people in. Turning away from the power of prayer and the power of God through the preaching of gospel to power of suggestions, and before long, Demases are created who may be out of Egypt but Egypt is not completely out of them.\r\n\r\nWe therefore must examine ourselves as to whether we are being drawn back to the world, maybe not by the people of the world but by those who name the name of Christ and are using His name to cause people to drift. Paul in <strong>2Corinthians 13:5-6, </strong> writes <strong>“6 Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you are disqualified. 6 But I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified”. </strong>He is not talking about what someone did at the point of salvation but what someone is doing now. What we are doing now will determine what happened on that day we became believers. If we repented then, we are still repenting today etc.\r\n\r\nIf we are to stay on course, we must consider our ways. We must examine ourselves to be sure we are not drifting back. <strong>Lamentations 3:40-41, “40 Let us search out and examine our ways, And turn back to the LORD; 41 Let us lift our hearts and hands To God in heaven”, Isaiah 8:19, “And when they say to you, “Seek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter,” should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living?”. </strong>We must be careful who we allow to speak into our lives especially preachers if we are to make it till the end, that is why there is safety under a good shepherd who feeds and protects God’s sheep. No one wants to come this far only to wreck their faith because of what they allowed in their lives. One preacher cried out to God saying, “<strong>Lord don’t let me wreck my ship (life) as I am getting closer to the harbor</strong>”.\r\n\r\nWhat became of Demas?, there is a great indication in <strong>Colossians 4:14</strong> that Demas was restored. Are you a Demas today who needs to be restored? Consider your ways, examine yourself and see if you be in the faith and turn back to God. Blessings, Ev"

              "<strong>Colossians 3:1-22, \"1 If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. 2 Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth</strong>”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/law-and-grace.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6018\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/law-and-grace.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Law-and-grace\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIf you listened to prosperity gospel preachers, you will notice that most of their preaching texts are off the old testament and very selected in the new testament, most of which are taken out of context to support their message. Most of the prosperity gospel is about temporal needs that attracts great crowds. Rarely would you hear them talk about heavenly living (holiness, righteousness, long suffering, humility, submission, picking up your cross and following Christ etc.) things which makes us more Christ like.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI tend to visualize how Paul’s lifestyle would be today if he was here with us and what he would teach, and I find it radically different because Paul was more concerned about God’s glory than pleasing men. He therefore preached the whole truth and how to live it. We read in Colossians the truth every believer should pursue. He begins by saying, “<strong>If then you were raised with Christ…” </strong>this is a clear indication that no one can become a Christian unless once dead and Christ made him alive through repentance and faith. Therefore, a believer has a new life with a new nature and new desires. The drives he had before being made alive in Christ are dead with the old man. He is dead to the world and alive in Christ, for in vs. 3, <strong>“For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God</strong>” and such a person has but one desire, “<i>Lord live your own life through me, and be thou glorified”</i>\r\n\r\nAnd because we have a new nature, Paul gives us two things I want to look at “SEEK” and “SET”. He admonishes us to <strong>“Seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God</strong>”. The things below are corrupt, perishable; they are temporal, while things above are eternal. “SEEK” is to pursue or discover by searching or asking questions. Christ sits at the right hand of God the Father making intercession for us. We should “<strong>seek His kingdom first and His righteousness…” Matthew 6:33</strong>. The seeking is all about advancing the kingdom of God. Seeking spiritual values (the fruit of the spirit). Paul declared that all the richness of truth necessary for salvation, sanctification, and glorification are found only in Jesus Christ, who Himself is God revealed. Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world same as us. And because we are citizens of heaven, another country, we seek to know the truth of where He belongs. The position of honor and majesty that Christ enjoys as the exalted Son of God, that exaltation makes Him the fountain of blessings for His people.\r\n\r\nThose who are seeking things above will discover that these flows from that relationship, the desire to please the one who sits on the throne. <strong>Vs. 12-17, \"12 Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; 13 bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do. 14 But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection. 15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. 16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. 17 And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him”</strong>\r\n\r\nYou and I can only live these because we are constantly drawing from the kingdom what we have no ability to produce in our own strength. What you seek and find, you are encouraged to, <strong>vs. 2, “ Set your mind on things above …</strong>,” it is like driving on a highway, you SEEK for a certain speed required by the law and then you SET your cruise control. Sometimes the car may increase speed downhill or loose speed uphill. Your job as the driver is to keep seeking and setting the speed. We seek to know the will of God, we set to live according to His will. If we find we are falling outside of it having been given guidelines, we ask the Lord for grace and strength to stay on track.\r\n\r\nWhat are you seeking today? What is your driving factor? Are you seeking those things, which are above where Christ is seated and what you have received you set your mind on it and live it? Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Mark 6:30-32, vs. \"30, Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. 31 And He said to them, “Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.” For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. 32 So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves”</strong>\r\n\r\nTo be used of God in my judgment is one of the most exciting things, however I believe the greatest of all is learning to slip away to a deserted place and spend time with Him in prayers. <strong>God's work must be done by God's Spirit which is not in active operation unless prayer power is activated</strong>. The point is, it is not if you are doing God's work that matters, but how you are doing God’s work, and by what means you are doing it.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe tragedy today, we have become too busy working for the Lord that we have neglected spending time with Him. We love the thought of being used of God than communing with Him in prayers. For this reason, I draw our attention to<strong> Mark 6</strong> because \"<em>The greatest thing anyone can do for God or man is pray</em>\", S.D. Gordon\r\n\r\nWe begin with <strong>vs.</strong> <strong>7, “And He called the twelve to Himself, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them power over unclean spirits</strong>”. Who would not want to receive such a call accompanied by power?, and <strong>vs.</strong> <strong>12-13, “12 So they went out and preached that people should repent. 13 And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them</strong>”. In response to the call, wonderful things happened and they were driven to do more for the kingdom and testify of it. What they failed to learn was that the power was prayer driven by Christ. Jesus never engaged in anything but first pray, for example, the appointing of the 12 disciples came about after He had prayed all night, <strong>Luke 6.</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you recall in <strong>Matthew 17:14-20</strong>, the disciples in the same enthusiasm tried to heal a boy but failed. Then here comes Jesus who does it on no time, <strong>Matthew 17:19-21,</strong> <strong>“19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?”,</strong><strong> 20, “So Jesus said to them, “Because of your unbelief; ... 21 However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting”. </strong>They themselves forgot the secret of slipping away to be in prayer before attempting to perform miracles. When Christ sent the disciples, He explicitly commissioned them to do these kind of miracles. Less than a year later, they failed where they had succeeded before. Christ explanation for the failure was that their faith was deficient. The deficiency did not consist of lack of confidence, the problem was failure to make God the object of their confidence rather than their own. This is where faith, power, God’s will etc. is activated. Here was Jesus’ pattern and order of doing ministry, <strong>Luke 5:16, “So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness and prayed”, </strong>and the effect<strong>, vs. 17, “Now it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them”</strong>. “<em>No learning can make up for the failure to pray. No earnestness, no diligence, no study, no gifts will supply its lack\",</em> E.M. Bounds\r\n\r\nThis is where our generation is today, needing the power but neglecting to labor for it in prayer. Jesus went up the mountain of transfiguration to pray, He took Peter, James and John with Him. The experience the disciples had was not because they were praying, they wanted to stay up there to build tents for Jesus, Moses and Elijah. While this sounds good and should be, “<em>Too many of us today prefer the supernatural display on the mountain of transfiguration to the agony of watching and praying in the garden of Gethsemane</em>”, David Wilkerson. Those who are praying may not be known, they may not be in the spotlight but they have power. Most appreciate trees for their beauty and their fruits, however people forget that the life of the tree is in their roots which are out of sight. The men quoted in this article are mostly appreciated for what they did, if we were to dig deep to discover the success of their ministry, you discover that it was not how gifted they were (are) that paved the way, but their prayer lives as the root digging deeper and deeper to display the quality of life and ministry we enjoy. blessings Ev\r\n\r\n*** I had the priviledge of being one of the writers for Pastor Gregg Johnson's Leadership Teaching Magazine in 2012, for more on prayer articles, please check out <a href=\"http://www.leadershipteachingmagazine.com/\">www.leadershipteachingmagazine.com</a>"

              "<strong>Mark 6:30-32, vs. \"30 Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. 31 And He said to them, “Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.” For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. 32 So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves”</strong>\r\n\r\nUpon returning, they began to give Jesus and those present account of their accomplishments.<strong> Mark 6:30, “Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught”.</strong> While ministers are accountable both for what they do and teach; without prayer, the Word would be like LIGHT without HEAT. <strong>1Corinthians 4:20, “For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power”. 1Thessalonians 1:5, “For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power”. <!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this excitement, they would continue to do what they were doing without putting to practice the means by which they had the power to preach and heal the sick. Jesus always withdrew to a private solitary place to pray. His teachings and miracles were a result of Him slipping away from the crowd. Such was our Lord's unexampled meekness that He preferred the silent deserts to the applause of multitudes. <strong>Vs. 31, “And He said to them, “Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while</strong>.” They needed rest in prayer and be in the Word<strong>. Isaiah 40:31, says “But those who wait on the LORD Shall renew their strength; …” </strong>This is not <strong>“Wait</strong>” like someone waiting for a bus, but rather “wait” as in relation to waiters waiting on customers in restaurants. We are called to rest and wait upon the Lord in readiness for His service. \"<em>Prayer is my chief work, and it is by means of it that I carry on the rest</em>.\" Thomas Hooker, Puritan\r\n\r\nA similar revival broke out as Philip preached,<strong> (Acts 8:4-8). </strong>While busy serving, God takes Philip away from doing His spectacular work to be alone with Him in the desert before sending him on a mission to reach one man. With the pressure for growth, how many leaders would say, “YES Lord” to the desert experience rather than excitement? Philip did, he slipped away to be alone with the Lord. <b>Acts 8:26,”Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Arise and go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is desert”. \"</b><i>Christ calls for intercession above and before exhilaration</i>”, David Wilkerson.\r\n\r\nChrist called His disciples apart, why? if they had anybody with them, they would have something to say and do, for their good; however what they desperately needed was to slip away. Take notice what<strong> Mark </strong>reports<strong>, vs. 31 “…For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat”, </strong>Remember Elijah becoming suicidal from death threats by Jezebel?, God brought him to a deserted place and ministered to him<strong>. 1King 19:5-7, \" …7 And the angel of the Lord came … touched him, and said, “Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.” 8 So he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God”.<em> “</em></strong><em>The word of God is the food by which prayer is nourished and made strong.\" </em>E. M. Bounds<strong>. </strong>This was the difference between Mary and Martha, Mary chose to sit at the feet of the Master to be taught, Martha chose to be busy serving<strong>. Luke 10:41-42, “41 And Jesus answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. 42 But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.” </strong>Anytime the Lord called someone’s name at least twice, He wanted their undivided attention. I am confident that most of our churches are filled with Martha’s who are serving and not waiting on the Lord to be instructed. \"<em>God uses prayer to educate His people and to produce holiness of character in them”</em> C.S. Spurgeon<strong>. </strong>Blessings Ev\r\n\r\n*** I had the priviledge of being one of the writers for Pastor Gregg Johnson's Leadership Teaching Magazine in 2012, for more on prayer articles, please check out <a href=\"http://www.leadershipteachingmagazine.com/\">www.leadershipteachingmagazine.com</a>"

              "<strong>Mark 6:30-32, vs. 30, “Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. 31 And He said to them, “Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.” For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. 32 So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Mark 6:32,</strong><em> “</em><strong>So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves”. </strong>The disciples listened to Jesus’ call. <strong>Luke 11:1, “Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.” </strong>A disciple of Jesus never asked Him to teach them how to preach, heal the sick, raise the dead. They asked Him to teach them to pray. His classes on prayer was always offsite. What about us? Misguided passion leaves us stubborn to do what we want rather than what He wants.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThis message is so important and should be heralded because“<em>Prayer is the greatest of all forces, it honors God and brings Him into active aid”, </em>E.M. Bounds<em>.</em> “<em>The priority of prayer in Jesus life, the great majority of His words dealt with one thing, a passion for God to be glorified throughout the world”, </em>Paul Washer<em>. </em>Prayer is about PASSION, zeal, drive, hunger, burden to make God’s NAME GREAT (GLORY OF GOD) and ADVANCE His KINGDOM and not ours<em>.</em> This is why He is saying, especially to ministers, come away and rest in Me in prayer. The disciples went out on the account of Jesus prayer power, Jesus was bringing them to a place where they would learn the secret prayer power for God is not most glorified in what we accomplish, “<em>God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him</em>”, John Pipper.\r\n\r\nAs we have established how instrumental prayer was for Christ, the zeal for His house as a house of prayer revealed holy justified anger because His house priorities were violated. \"<strong>And He said to them, \"It is written, \"My house shall be called a house of prayer\", Matthew 21:12-17</strong>. Our hearts ought to be a house of prayer; our churches ought to be established on the foundation of prayer. It is the foundation by which God’s work is to be completed. Jesus could have named it a house of worship, preaching or even fellowship, however, He called it a house of prayer because preaching, worship, fellowship and any activity in our churches hinges on prayer. Prayer is the nucleus that holds the pastors, leaders, homes, marriages, Christian life, the church, the country etc. Without prayer, we are doomed to fail however spectacular things are. “<em>There is no other activity in life so important as that of prayer. Every other activity depends upon prayer for its best efficiency</em>.”, M.E. Andross.\r\n\r\nHudson Taylor a missionary to china in 1800AD penned these words, <em>\"The prayer power has never been tried to its full capacity. If we want to see Divine power wrought in the place of weakness, failure, and disappointment, let us answer God's standing challenge, “<strong>Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know</strong></em><strong>”, Jeremiah 33:3</strong>.\r\n\r\n“<em>The one concern of the devil is to keep Christians from praying. He fears nothing from prayerless studies, prayerless work and prayerless religion. He laughs at our toil, mocks at our wisdom, but he trembles when we pray.”</em> Samuel Chadwick, we must therefore pray. Paul address to Timothy, <strong>“Therefore I exhort FIRST of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men…”, 1Timothy 2:1</strong>. The reason being, <strong>\"If the axe is dull, And one does not sharpen the edge, Then he must use more strength;...\", Ecclesiastes 10:10</strong>\r\n\r\nLet us be done with misguided passion that robs God of the glory He would gain from our lives and ministry because we have excluded Him due to lack of prayer. Let us go back to daily slipping away to a deserted place and make this our cry, <strong>1. Lord Teach Me To Pray; 2. Lord Give Me A Praying Spirit and; 3. Lord Give Me A Burden To Pray</strong>. <em>\"The true church lives and moves and has its being in prayer.\"</em> Leonard Ravenhill. What do you want to be known for? a man or woman of prayer I hope. <em>“I would rather teach one man to pray than ten men to preach</em>”, Charles Spurgeon.  Men and women of God are not strong when they are standing but when they are on bended knees praying.

              "<strong>Judges 16:19, “Then she lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe enemy has a mission to put believers to sleep and I believe he has been successful in so many levels. The lost are asleep in the dark (sin), believers are asleep in the light. Many believers in the church have been lulled to sleep while the enemy is cutting off their seven locks symbolizing strength, leaving believers with no strength to fight back. He knows he cannot knock you out by a blow, so he tries to find ways to put you to sleep. He knows in your sleep you will yield your strength to him, leaving you dormant and inactive.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf you know the story of Samson, God bestowed strength of many men in him. While some men had armies for battle, Samson was a one-man army. The good and bad things he did would define his destiny. His final down fall came about when he loved a woman by the name of Delilah, a Philistine, and the enemy he constantly battled. The Philistines learning of his affection for this woman said to her <strong>vs. 5, “…“Entice him, and find out where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and every one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.” </strong>While he loved her, she did not love him back. Likewise, there are people who are in the light beginning to love the world, be aware the world does not love you back. It has been paid to entice and destroy your life. It will not begin in a noticeable way, it will be subtle. Another way believer’s sleep on Delilah’s lap is by making them too busy with other things that take away their priorities, even with good things. Too many programs have crept in to make men asleep on Delilah’s lap in the church. Delilah began to toy with Samson’s mind and emotions, preying on things he was vulnerable to. If she discovered where his strength lied, she could put him to sleep and detach his strength from him. Samson played along with her for a while but we know the enemy does not give up easily unless you give up and give in.\r\n\r\nUpon sharing with her where his strength lied<strong>, vs. “19 …she lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him”.</strong> The tragedy of a believer is to lay his head on the lap of the Delilahs of this world and fall asleep. A person in a deep sleep does not know the time, what is happening, could be slain and not fight back. The enemy has shaved off your locks of Prayers, reading of the word, reaching the lost, strength to overcome sin, hunger for righteousness etc. You now have no strength. Samson did not even know that his strength was gone until he tried to go after the enemy as he had done always. Jesus told a parable <strong>Matthew 13:24-25 saying: “24 The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; 25 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way”</strong>. It is when men are asleep that the enemy takes full control, planting tares. Jesus told His disciples <strong>Mark 14:38, “Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. …”. </strong>Those who are awake cannot be easily destroyed unless they have fallen asleep. Jesus coming back from praying found His disciples fast asleep during the crucial hour of prayer in the garden of Gethsemane instead of watching and praying to evade becoming vulnerable to the enemy’s prey.\r\n\r\nYou and I need to check to see if we have fallen asleep or are falling asleep on Delilah’s lap. We need to check and see if Delilah has had our locks of strength shaved off. We cannot lose our effectiveness because we are enticed by the enemy. We need to stand strong, we need to wake up before it is too late. Those who have their locks shaved off, fight and grow your hair back, <strong>1Thessalonians 5:6, “Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober”, 1Peter 1:13, “Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober”, 1Peter 5:8, “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he</strong> <strong>may devour”.</strong> We need to be sober, we need to discern and know what the enemy is planning on doing, we need to watch and pray.

              "<strong>Psalm 122:1, \"I was glad when they said unto me, \"Let us go into the house of the Lord\".</strong>\r\n\r\nIn our time a good number of people take the work and the word of the Lord lightly. People who would rather do something else on the Lord’s day than be somewhere worshipping God. There are some who believe they can handle things themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is something about being in the house of God nothing can replace. The bible says, “do not forsake the assembly of brethren”. We are the temple of the living God and collectively we make the body (church) complete. The body has different parts and each parts do not function the same way. The hands cannot tell the legs I do not need you, neither can the eye tell the nose I do not need you. They all have different functions but they need each other to be complete.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe church is clinic where people come in to be ministered to. After you have been through the week, faced different challenges, you've been hurt or exhausted, you need a place of where you can be attended to, and what a joy to know that a place has been set for us. Church is also like a gas station where you pull in to have your oil checked, fueled to get you ready for another journey. David tells us that he was glad when they told him to join the rest in going to the house of the Lord. He understood how vital this was and could not trade it for anything else. Yes he was the king and he had every material thing he could ever need. A man after God's own heart craved to be in God’s house something extremely important to him. Jesus loved His house that when people turned it into a business center, He got upset and whipped them. The bible says that the zeal of His house consumed Him. This shows how it is important to Him and therefore it should be important to us. <strong>Psalm 84:10, \"A day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere, I would rather be a door keeper in the house of the Lord, than to dwell in the tents of the wickedness\"</strong>. Here is a man who appreciated the house of the Lord and could not take it lightly for the Lord had always met him.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 133:1, \"Behold how good and pleasant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity\"</strong>. What a place for brethren to dwell together especially in a church setup, and not just together but together in unity for there are certain things that the Lord will not do until we come together united for<strong> Matthew 18:19 says, \"Again I say to you that, \"if two of you shall agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done unto them by my Father in heaven, for where two or three are gathered in My name, I am there in the midst of them\"</strong>. We cannot worship, walk and work effectively with the Lord if we are not plugged somewhere together. We need a place of accountability, a place where we see and understand more than we already know, a place to pray to God, Jesus said my house shall be called a house of prayer, a place to develop gifting and callings, a place of refuge and comfort, a place of restoration and the list goes on.\r\n\r\nWe should <strong>be glad </strong>when it comes to time to go into the house of the Lord for there is something about going there gladly and not feel like being dragged. Someone said that do not wait for six men to carry you to church, you can do it yourself. <strong>It is not to be an occasional visit but continues practice</strong>. I pray effectively when I am in church for the presence of the Lord is already there. Somewhere in Isaiah it says, <strong>\"The train of thy rob fills the temple\", </strong>I never leave the same way I went in and I get more challenged, rebuked and inspired when I hear the word and see more people desire to grow more in the Lord.\r\n\r\nAre we all plugged in a bible believing, preaching, teaching church?, a church that believes in praising and worshipping God, a church that allows us to make connection with God through repentance and restoration, a church that prays? Are we regular attendants or occasional goers or do not go at all? Is it possible to have the same zeal David had to the extent of saying, <strong>\"I would rather be a door keeper in the house of the Lord\"</strong>? yes it is. You will never value the body (church) until you are in need of it. Get plugged in!!!, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 11:1, “Be ye followers of me, even as I also<em> am</em> of Christ”, KJV</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are anything like me, then you have someone or some people who inspire you especially in the spiritual arenas (our spiritual leaders). Joshua had a spiritual leader Moses, so was Elisha who had Elijah, Timothy had a Paul etc.\r\n\r\nIn his writing to the Corinthians, Paul opens with this line in <b>chapter 11:1, </b>“<strong>Be ye followers (imitators) of me, even as I also am of Christ”.</strong> Why did he not say “<strong>follow Christ as I follow Him</strong>”, because Paul knew to follow Christ meant laying it all on the line.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHe had learnt to pick up his cross and follow Christ daily. He had been a living example to many who might have not thought it possible to lay it all on the line and be like Christ. In <strong>Philippians 3:8</strong>, he says, “<strong>Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ”.</strong> By the standards of the world before his conversion, Paul had it all, meeting Christ on his way to Damascus to persecute Christians altered and changed his life forever. He had not walked with Christ physically like the other disciples but to imitate Christ, he was going to have a taste of what it meant to walk with Him.\r\n\r\nPaul’s life was not an easy road, having been stoned and left to die, survived shipwreck, had been beaten, jailed, rejected, yet in all this he was fulfilled because Christ did not have it easy in this world and still accomplished His mission. <strong>Paul being a bond servant of the Lord saw himself finishing his mission through Christ who he imitated and gave him strength</strong> (<b>Philippians 4:13).</b> Something about Christ propelled Paul to ride out what had made many men give up. Something about Christ fascinated him that he tells us of his desire in <b>P</b><strong>hilippians 3:10, \"that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death”.</strong> You would think that Paul desiring to imitate Christ was for him to be successful in this life, have a lot of money, have respect and be happy. It turns out that his desire was to operate in the power that resurrected Christ, <strong>1Corinthians 2:4, “And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power</strong>”, “...<strong>And the fellowship of his suffering</strong>”, Paul had a taste of what it meant to suffer for Christ.<strong>“...Being conformed to His death</strong>”. As Christ died for the purpose of redeeming sinners, so Paul had that same purpose in a lesser sense; he lived and would willingly die to reach sinners with the gospel. His life and death, though not redemptive, were for the same purpose as his Lord’s. In imitating Christ, Paul made himself of no reputation, he was a bondservant, humbled and was willing to suffer for Christ. I believe with all my heart that in his hard times, he would have not cried, “<strong>Jesus bring me OUT of this</strong>” his prayer would have been, “<strong>Jesus bring me THROUGH this</strong>”. <strong>To bring us out is to escape, to bring us through is to endure</strong>.\r\n\r\nBy saying, “<strong>be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ</strong>”, Paul is not suggesting to us that he counted himself something; he is teaching us what it means to follow Christ because he was a living proof. He was also glad that the Corinthians had received his teachings, however he wanted to make it clear that He was not the head, that he was not making it by his own strength or his own teachings. This is why he pointed them back to his reason for being who he was. He tells them in vs. 3,<strong>\"But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ,..”</strong>\r\n\r\nOur spiritual leaders ought to point us back to the head, Christ and their lives should be an imitation of Christ in every way. If that is not the case, then one should change course. Their lives ought to be an example to us that despite how tough it is to pick up the cross and follow Christ, if they are making it through Christ who strengthens them, we too can make it through Christ who strengthens us. If we have other people who look up to us as spiritual leaders then like Paul let us strive to imitate Christ in every aspect of our lives. Paul had a desire to imitate Christ and also NOT fail Christ by leading the followers of Jesus a stray. What about you?

              "<strong>Luke 18:9-12, “9 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable: 10 “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’\", (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nTo live a Christian life is never easy, there are ups and downs in this walk. I mentioned recently how we often measure the success of our walk by what we accomplish rather than what He has accomplished for us on the cross. We say something like this, “<i>dying on the cross for our sins was something we could never do, but living the life of a Christian is something we are most capable of doing”</i>. I come across many sermons preached on “How to” rather than what “He has”. A while back I was in a Christian book store, it’s shelves were filled with self-help books, filled with “how to's”. Examples, “<i>how to write your ticket with God”, “7 steps to being blessed”, “how to get God’s attention and favor</i>”. <strong>We say we are saved by grace and behave as though our salvation is kept and maintained by the law.</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->If you are kept by “how to”, you will be discouraged the days you do not pray, read the word, or reach others the way you should. If anything, you become an idolater because your joy comes and depends on your accomplishments. Jesus speaking, <strong>“To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, …”</strong> in<strong> Luke 18:9 </strong>told of a parable<strong>. </strong>While this was addressing those who looked down on others, I see another side of the coin in addressing those who measure their Christian walk by others as the standard. In other words saying something like this,<i> “I do not pray like so and so, maybe I need to try harder etc.</i>” In giving this parable, Jesus said, <strong>vs. “10 Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get\". </strong>His accomplishments, \"I fast twice in the week\"- So did all the strict Pharisees: every Monday and Thursday. \"I give tithes of all that I possess\" - Many of them gave one full tenth of their income in tithes, and another tenth in alms. This was the strictest sect among the Jews; they were men that prayed, and fasted much, and were great sticklers for the ceremonies of the law, and the traditions of the elders, and did all to be seen of men. This Pharisee trusted in himself that he was righteous. <b>Most of us may not do it to be seen of men, but we do it to be seen of God and use it as “how to” get blessings from the Lord.</b>\r\n\r\nThe Pharisee felt justified, he was no hypocrite for they were the most righteous people by man’s standards. To give a list of his accomplishment was to prep him as a candidate for greater things. The bible says, he prayed about himself, he prayed about his accomplishments, he was the center of his prayer using a tax collector as his measuring stick for his righteousness.\r\n\r\nIn this regards, there were people who tried their best to measure up to them, one could have been the tax collector who found that he fell short, he therefore prayed directly to God. It must have been mind boggling when Jesus dropped a bombshell in addressing those who wanted to be righteous as these people. Jesus response, <strong>Matthew 5:20, “For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven”. </strong>By this He meant, unless your righteousness surpasses the righteousness of the most righteous people, you will by no means enter the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nIf we could never attain the righteousness on our own, how do we expect to maintain it unless we fall back on the One who called us in the first place? Paul begins by telling us how we attained the righteousness<strong>, 2Corinthians 5:21, “For He (God the Father) made Him (Jesus Christ) who knew no sin to be sin for us (lost sinners), that we might become the righteousness of God (traded places) in Him (completed by Him and in Him), </strong>Emphasis in brackets are mine. Paul then tells us what is required of us to do now that we are made righteous and qualifies it with this statement, <strong>Philippians 2:12-13, “12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure”. I</strong><strong>t has to be by God for God in us and through us for His glory. </strong>You bear out what He has produced within.\r\n\r\nWe cannot work for what He has already accomplished, we can only bear fruits. He is the true Vine, we are the branches (<strong>John 15</strong>). The branches do not produce, they only bear what He has produced. Our job is to abide. Jesus said, <strong>Luke 12:32, “Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom’”</strong>. <strong>Acts 17:28, “for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring</strong>”.\r\n\r\n<strong>We are saved by hope, purified by it, blessed by it, kept by it, favored by it. All in Christ for His name sake because He paid for it all with His own precious blood on the cross when He said, “it is finished”. </strong>Blessings, Ev"

              "<strong>1Samuel 28:6-7, “6 And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets . 7, “Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.””</strong>\r\n\r\nSaul started his journey well, he was chosen by God to be king in Israel, and if you read his story, he had a tragic end. Anyone can start a marathon; those who finish it are the ones’ who matter. Anyone can begin the journey of faith; only those who make it to the end receive a crown of life. So it’s not how you start that defines you, it’s how you finish and by what means you finish at the finish line that counts.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nSaul having started well with God on his side, he would have had a glorious journey, inquiring and trusting in the Lord day by day, obeying His word that is contrary to his later life. Having deprived himself of every legitimate means of spiritual input as a result of his own disobedience and rebellion<strong>. 1Samuel 15:10-11, “10 Now the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying, 11 “I greatly regret that I have set up Saul as king, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not performed My commandments.” And it grieved Samuel, and he cried out to the LORD all night.”</strong> Samuel met him and told him, <strong>vs.</strong> <strong>“23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, And stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He also has rejected you from being king.”</strong>\r\n\r\nAt a later time, Samuel died, all his life Saul would not heed to Samuel’s counsel. At one time Saul had a battle before him; he therefore sought the will of God concerning the battle. This was to determine if they would subdue or be subdued, <strong>1Samuel 28:6, “And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets”</strong>. He went before to inquire of the Lord, and the Lord did not respond to him. The reason for not responding was due to his disobedience and lack of repentance. Instead of continuing to linger before the Lord in repentance from a broken heart, he quits seeking the Lord and goes back to dead things; witchcraft he got rid of when they anointed him king. <strong>Vs. 7, “Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.”</strong> Walking in foolishness again by seeking out the very resource (a medium) he had previously removed from the land.\r\n\r\nThis is what happens when you disconnect yourself from the Lord because of sin, lack of desire to seek Him and walk in His commandments. Instead of crying to God in repentance to be restored, you find that it’s easy to seek other things to bring about temporary relief and not deal with the root of the problem. You know the Lord will point out the truth and you cover it up by saying, “<i>I sought the Lord, He did not answer me</i>”. Saul was going back to what he had removed out of his life and kingdom.  Is this not what most of us do when faced with trials and tribulations? We go back to revisit the world we were rescued from. Instead of trusting the Lord to bless you financially, you are back to playing lotto hoping for a lucky win. Instead of praying to God for a breakthrough, you would rather depend on other means, lying, manipulations etc. to get your way out. Isaiah writes,<strong> “And when they say to you, “Seek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter,” should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living?\", </strong><strong>Isaiah 8:19,</strong> Seeking God is the medicine for our dilemma.\r\n\r\nSaul had many opportunities to make things right with God but he never did, the bible says, <strong>1Chronicles 10:13, “So Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he had committed against the LORD, because he did not keep the word of the LORD, and also because he consulted a medium for guidance”.</strong>\r\n\r\nMy prayer daily is, Lord forgive me of my sins I am aware of and the ones I'm not. I pray like David in <strong>Psalm 139:23-24, “23 Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me, and know my anxieties; 24 And see if there is any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting</strong>”. I don’t want unconfessed sins to hinder my prayers from reaching God. I can either be like Saul who knowing his sin chose not to repent and trust God, or be like David when confronted with his sin repented of it and God forgave him and gave him life. I can confess and be made whole so as to continue my fellowship with the Lord or be like Saul and fall back on dead things. What sin are you not willing to repent of, and would you rather go back to what you should have been delivered from? Get rid of dead things, fall in the arms of God. <strong>Psalm 18:2, \"The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; My God, my strength, in whom I will trust; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold\". </strong>The Lord is alive, why go back to dead things? Blessings, Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 81:10,\"I am the LORD your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt; Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it\".</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are those times when things are not going on well in your life; the first question I suspect runs through your mind, \"<i>What did I do wrong?\"</i> Those are the times you begin to trace back to what might have happened to have brought you to this condition. When you are sick and go to the doctor, what do they do? They run some tests on you and ask you about your family health history. The doctor is trying to see where what you have could have started from. And if one of your family members had/have it, the conclusion would be, most probably that is where you may have inherited it from.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe then come to Christ and think the same also happens. The good question to ask, when Christ saved you, what did He save you from if what you used to deal with has to follow you into the new life? <strong>2Corinthians 5:17 </strong>says<strong>, \"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new</strong>\"<strong>. </strong>You are not old creature improved, no; you are a new man, new creation<strong>. </strong>Also, you are not a creation made to look like new, no, you are a new creation.Therefore your past failures are not factors into your new life and cannot negate your future. <b>Majority</b><strong> are down because they do not believe God loves them in spite off</strong>. <strong>There is nothing you and I can do to make God love us more or less</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of condemnation about the past failures is stopping a number of believers from progressing. Paul reminds us in <strong>Romans 8:1, \"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit</strong>\". Those who are in Christ Jesus and do not walk in the pattern of the flesh are no condemned. The fact they struggle is clear indication the Spirit is at work in them to keep them identifying with their new nature. If you are in Christ, you ought not to feel condemned; He took care of all your guilt and shame upon Himself on the cross. I must say that this only applies to those who are in Christ. How about those who are not, <strong>John 3:18, \"He who believes in Him is not condemned;</strong> <strong>but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God”.</strong> This is not believing that Christ is Lord (head knowledge) but a lifestyle that demonstrates Christ as Lord of your life. If it was about belief, even the devils believe, yet they tremble (<b>James 2:10)</b>\r\n\r\nIf that is settled, then we have our Lord reminding us to do something He has already provided. <strong>Psalms 81:10</strong> is vital to our new life. <strong>\"I am the Lord YOUR God</strong>\", which shows that He knows us and has called us His. Then He reminds us of where He called us from, sin and bondage. Egypt in this case is the type of the world we were delivered from. His reminder of where He called us from is not to make us depressed, it’s to remind us of His goodness and faithfulness. <strong>Romans 2:4, \"Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?\" </strong>His goodness brought us this far and we thank Him for that; however He wants to do more. He says, “… <strong>Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it,” </strong>fill it with what? Joy, laughter, confidence, peace, prosperity, hope, holiness, purity. <strong>He will only fill you if you open your mouth, and He will fill you with what you have room for</strong>. Do not linger on what could have happened, expect what will happen. Your history is not a mystery to God. Choose this this day to open your mouth wide He has given you and let Him fill you with what you need. <strong>Matthew 5:6, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled”. </strong>This is the first hunger every believer needs, it ought to be priority, and the rest will fall in place if we make this priority. Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/the-best-is-yet-to-come-part-3of3-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Is Yet To Come, Part 3of3, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/the-best-is-yet-to-come-part-2of2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Is Yet To Come, Part 2of2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/the-best-is-yet-to-come-part-1of3-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Is Yet To Come, Part 1of3, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him For the help of His countenance”</strong>\n\nThere are days we feel like God is distant or He is present but not saying anything in our situations. To make it even more painful, we sometimes battle people who add more flame into the fire. They lie on you, they try to make your life difficult and you sit and wonder, how can a loving God allow such terrible things to happen to the ones He calls His own?"

              "<b>Job 42:5, \"I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, But now my eye sees You\"</b>\r\n\r\nAll his life, Job had learned to trust in the Lord, praying to Him, living for Him, leading his family in the things of God,<b> But in the storm Job saw God. </b>Having questioned God, God turns around and gives him 101 questions that leave him thinking and humbles him the most.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThrough God's questions to Job, Job had a new awareness of the wisdom of God's hidden plans, a new sense of awe of His greatness and shows him his limitations even in the midst of the storm. In the midst of the storm, He appeared unto Job. <b>At last Job understood God whom he had seen through the eyes of faith.</b> No one who has seen the Lord in the storm can remain the same; it either breaks you or makes you.\r\n\r\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego were thrown into the fire and in the midst of their storm, the Son of God revealed Himself in that fire and they felt comfortable in the fire though their situation did not change. It was amazing for them to see the Lord they had believed in, walked with, and lived for manifest Himself in their situation. So was Stephen just when he was about to be stoned, and Stephen <b>Acts 7:55-56, \"55…, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, 56 and said, “Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”</b> Oh how we would desire to see the Lord right in the midst of the challenges that we are in.\r\n\r\nYou too might question the Lord as to why things are happening the way they are. We need to remember God’s word in <strong>Isaiah 55:8-9, “8 For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,” says the LORD. 9 “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts</strong>”. At the beginning it may not make sense but as we trust and yield to Him, then we will move from just hearing about the Lord and what He has done to actually see Him before our very own eyes by faith. He is the fourth man revealed in the fire in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego’s story. <strong>It appears that there would have not been a better way for Job to see God but while in the midst of his fire storm</strong>. <strong>He had never so well grasped the greatness, majesty, sovereignty, and independence of God as he did at that moment.</strong>\r\n\r\nIf we cannot understand what is happening and why it is happening, I pray that we can believe that He knows where we are and where we are going. You may have been praying for change in a situation and it does not seem like it is happening, as a matter of fact it is getting worse. Let your prayer be, “<strong>may I see You the way Job, Stephen, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego did in what would be considered a painful hellish situation”</strong>. His presence alone in the midst of it changes us completely and is enough to carry us through the storm, His presence brings about Joy and peace in the midst of it. <strong>1John 3:2, “Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is”</strong>\r\n\r\nTherefore, as we are sanctified by faith, we must be sanctified by hope. That we may be saved by hope and be purified by it. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1John 5:4, \"For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe battle every believer faces is the world, the flesh and the devil. And the more you walk with the Lord the more the battle intensifies and the more you ought to crave to be an overcomer. If you are born of God, your walk with the Lord will continue to reveal things you are vulnerable to, things you may have never thought to be sin and conviction will bring you to your knees. Why?, because the more you walk with the Lord, the more His righteousness is revealed and the more you see yourself in your true state leaving you helpless in need of God's power to overcome. Who in their right mind wants to live a defeated life? I don't, I want to live a victorious life under the power of God present.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 1:17</strong>, tells us, \"<strong>For in it (the gospel) the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, \"The just shall live by faith</strong>.\" Right after verse 16 which talks about the gospel of Christ as the power of God unto salvation, Paul highlights what the power of God through the gospel does, in it is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith. The same power that saved us, is the same power that ought to keep us<strong>. 1John 5:4</strong>, say those who are saved, born of God should have the power to overcome the world, the flesh and the devil. To overcome, you got to have a battle before you and the power over it.\r\n\r\nThe saving faith is the first characteristic of an overcomer, born of God. The second is Love<strong>, 1John 5:2, “By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments\"</strong>, a person who is an overcomer, a victor, a conqueror, a winner is one who keeps God's commandments because the Spirit of God is at work in him. Not out of obligation or fear of punishment but out of love, it demonstrates what a changed life looks like. An overcomer is one who is craving for righteousness <strong>Matthew 5:6, \"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled\"</strong>, what you feed the most is what overcomes. You feed the spirit, fuel the spirit you overcome. Such a person understands that it's not by might, nor by power but by the Spirit of God. We could not do it while were in the world ourselves, how can we do it in Christ without His help?\r\n\r\n<strong>2Timothy 1:7, \"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind\"</strong>. When we love God we overcome fear because of His power within us. Fear is an enemy of faith that must be conquered. <strong>Romans 8:37</strong>, says \"<strong>Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us\"</strong>. We overcome (conquer) when we love our brothers and loving our brothers would mean not stealing from them, lust after them, murder with words, jealousy, stinginess, coveting, dishonoring etc., these are the things we battle daily while serving the Lord we must overcome to live a victorious life. How many even battle honoring their spouses or loving their children? I believe one true test of an overcomer is one who is faithful to his spouse in word, in conduct and in thoughts. It's amazing how we can be nice to people out there and be nasty at home to our loved ones. The ones at home are the ones the Lord uses to bring about things in us that need to be conquered. An overcomer lives a life pleasing to the Lord before his family and by your own strength it's impossible.\r\n\r\nWe ought to continue to have victory day by day while battling and overcoming what is set before us. What you don't battle and overcome will come back to haunt you, to quote Shaka Zulu from a movie, \"<strong>Never leave an enemy behind or it will rise again to fly at your throat</strong>\", the enemy must be defeated by all means and the power of God in us is what we need.\r\n\r\nI want to say no to lust, no to pride, no to jealousy, no to fear, no to doubt, by fueling the fire of righteousness that has power to overcome the power of sin, and it begins by faith that it can be done. My obedience is required, <strong>\"…And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith</strong>\". Are you living in victory? Crave for righteousness, pray like crazy, stand firm and overcome the enemy of our souls. It's not by might, nor by power but by His Spirit says the Lord.

              "<strong>Luke 1:22 – 23, “22 When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak. 23 When his time of service was completed, he returned home”</strong>\r\n\r\nHave you ever had your life interrupted by something? I can recall being in Bible college and I was sitting being bored in my Old Testament class, when I was summoned out of class by an administrator and told to call home because of an emergency. I called and found that I would be on a plane the next day to attend my grandfather’s funeral in Puerto Rico. I missed one week of classes because I was interrupted by something more important, unfortunately it was my papa’s death.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nA similar thing happened in the life of Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. He was doing his routine ministry duty, burning incense in the temple of the Lord, while people outside were praying. An interruption came when suddenly, the angel Gabriel showed up where he was at the altar in the midst of Zachariah’ ministry. Gabriel had not been invited, or expected not to mention it was both shocking and not even progressive. God did not give him a hint that things were going to be a little different on this day of ministry, and things would be changed from this day on for Zachariah. The angel said <strong>“Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.</strong>” Zachariah reacted with fear (of the unknown), his heart was troubled. He did not know what to make of this divine visitation. This was certainly an “out of the box” ministry experience for him, and his ministry was certainly being interrupted by God.\r\n\r\nGod had heard his prayer, and Gabriel was proclaiming the answer to that prayer, but it was met by Zachariah’s fear. The angel proclaimed that Zachariah would have a son. God was going to birth something new, and miraculous. John the Baptist would literally be the new ministry birthed, which would be great in God’s sight, not given to the influence of the world (wine), but under the influence of God (Holy Spirit). <strong>Ephesians 5:18 tells us, “Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.</strong>” John would be a Spirit controlled prophet. His ministry is described in <strong>Luke 1:17, “And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous-to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</strong>” He would preach repentance, bring restoration, minister in righteousness, and be a forerunner to make people ready for the coming of the Messiah. WOW!\r\n\r\nZachariah’s heart responded with disbelief and doubt because he and his wife were no spring chickens. Therefore as a consequence, the angel struck him dumb and he was unable to speak. <strong>“When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak. When his time of service was completed, he returned home</strong>.” Later on in <b>Luke 1</b> he receives his speech back, when he becomes obedient. <strong>Luke 1:62-64</strong> reads, <strong>“62 Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. 63 He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s astonishment he wrote, “His name is John.” 64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed and he began to speak, praising God.”</strong> His obedience resulted in restoration, and he responded in praise. What if he would have just believed and obeyed in the first place? I’m sure things would have went much smoother.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application</strong>: If God interrupted your ministry, would you obey or delay. God is looking for instant obedience, because delayed obedience is still disobedience. Remember, consequences came to Zachariah for disobedience. Be wise, trust and obey. Go with His flow! God is looking for people he can interrupt to do His will through, are you one of those people?

              "<strong>Matthew 4:18-20, “18 As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 19 “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.” 20 At once they left their nets and followed him”</strong>\r\n\r\nWho do you work for? Perhaps you work for a small business, a large corporation, the education system, or perhaps you are self employed. What position do you hold in your place of employment?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWork is something that seems to give many people a sense of purpose. However work can come and work can go, people get laid off, retire and even die. Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee and called out to two people who were working. He interrupted these two brother fisherman in the midst of casting their nets into the lake in the hopes of bringing in some revenue. Jesus interrupted these men with the now famous words, “Come, follow me,” and I will make you fishers of men.” Would being a fisher of men bring in enough income to feed their families? Would they even be good at doing a new work, this thing of ministry? They knew how to do their job, and I imagine were skilled at it, but would they be equally as skilled if they followed this carpenter, Jesus in the conditional promise to make them fishers of men if they would only follow Him?\r\n\r\nIn modern times, if Jesus interrupted our jobs to follow him in ministry, perhaps we would have had many of these same thoughts, and questions laboring in our minds. I believe because of the world we live in and how much society tries to impose its values upon us, we perhaps would also have questions such as, what about job security, how about my pension plan, my health benefits, and my seniority at the job.\r\n\r\nDespite all of this and because He knew the hearts of men, He was sure and confident in His ability to make these men into something that they were not. Jesus would transform these men because of His ability and not theirs. As a matter of fact this “making them” could not be done apart from the Master. But there was one thing that these men did need to do in order to begin this journey toward transformation. They had to let go of their jobs and follow Him! As simple as could be stated, they would need an attitude that they just “enlisted” to follow Jesus so that He could make them into the very people He said he would, “fishers of men.” Yes Jesus surely did interrupt these men as they were working, unashamedly, and unapologetically.\r\n\r\nTheir response was to be commended. The Scriptures say of these two brothers” At once they left their nets…,” that is to say their jobs, “and followed him”. We know that these men did not really know what they were getting themselves into, yet there was something about this Jesus that they were willing to trust and submit to. He only asked them to leave and follow. It was like a spiritual wedding if you will, as a man is called to leave his parents and cleave to his wife, so did Jesus call these men to leave their jobs and all that was familiar and to follow (cleave to) Him!\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: What would you do if Jesus called you to leave your job, to follow Him? Would you trust and obey, or think of all the many reasons that you should stay put right where you are because after all you can still serve God and keep your current lifestyle. Yes you certainly can, that is unless Christ calls you to abandon it, and abandon yourself to Him! Think about it!, Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>Matthew 4:21-22, “21 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, 22 and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe family was God’s creation and therefore originated in God. Families come in all shapes and sizes. In <strong>Genesis 12:3, “God spoke these words to Abram, ”I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you</strong>.”<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAnd because God is the author of the family, He is also the anchor of it as well. There are two ways to look at the term family. One, those to whom you are connected to biologically, and secondly, those to whom belong with you to the family of God through the spiritual bloodline of Jesus Christ, Gentiles being grafted in.\r\n\r\nJesus had gathered to Himself two disciples, Peter and Andrew, and now he sees two more fishermen James and John as they are with their father mending their nets. I do not know why Jesus called so many fishermen to Himself as disciples, as four out of twelve, or one third of them were in fact fishermen. These two brothers upon hearing the call of Jesus left their ship and their father and followed Him. I can imagine that this was a family fishing business. Upon leaving would dad have the capability of carrying this business on his own? If not how would that affect their income, home, and family life? Would this show to be a dishonoring of their father and mother? What would dad think of them leaving him, and their trade to follow a carpenter’s call? Despite all these possible questions Jesus still calls and they follow Him leaving both their ship (job) and their father (family) to become His disciple. <strong>Luke 14:26 reads, “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters-yes, even his own life-he cannot be my disciple.</strong>” Wow, talk about tough meat to swallow. When I asked a teen of mine from our previous church to study this passage and tell me the meaning of it he said it like this, “Jesus is to be at the top of your love list.” I like that explanation. Jesus is to be so purposefully placed at the top of your love list that everyone below Him can see unequivocally that He is focal point of your life, even to the point whereby some may become jealous of your relationship with Him. This surely affects a family when one, two, etc… of the family members heeds the call of God in their lives. I’ve heard it said that the military will not put two family members in the same platoon for the possibility of losing both at the same time in war. However, Jesus breaks that rule as He puts them both on His team. This is why God heart is for the whole family to be saved (see <strong>Acts 16:27-31</strong>). Paul and Silas spoke the words, <strong>“31 Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved-you and your household.” 32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.”</strong> God does want the family to serve Him. There exists a spiritual understanding that Jesus is Lord. This I believe is the blessing of Abraham as it is spiritually applied. However it doesn’t always work out like this.\r\n\r\nEven though God desires salvation for your whole earthly family, being part of His call as your Father is of greater importance to Him. Consider a converted Orthodox Jew who came to Christ, and the response of his family. His family had a “mock” funeral for him pronouncing him dead to the family because of his decision to follow Jesus, the Messiah that they don’t believe in, as he left the “faith” in their eyes. He was treated as an outcast never to be spoken to again, or invited to his family’s home. I met this man, and although it broke his heart to follow Christ in the fact that his family responded as such, it showed that Jesus was truly on the top of his love list. Jesus may interrupt your family, and it may be costly, bit if He is on top of your love list, it would be more costly not to follow Him!\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: What would you do if Jesus called you to follow Him and it meant “leaving” your family? Would you stay or would you go? Your response would show where He is on your love list. Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>Luke 1:26-38, vs. “31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS\", 32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. 33 And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nThink of this scenario, a young woman is engaged to be married, then out of nowhere she discovers she is going to have a baby, to make it more complicated, the baby is not her fiancé’s. That was Mary’s situation. Here we see a woman engaged as we are told, and was looking forward to getting married, planning her wedding, maybe planning on when to actually have kids down the road. <!--more-->The timing for her and her husband to be couldn't be perfect as they painted a picture of their future, then suddenly their lives are interrupted. I remember when I was 23, I had set my life, couldn’t wait to be married, everything was running according to plan when all of a sudden, my life was interrupted, halted and changed. It was hard to adjust to the new plan but the Lord interrupted the flow of things for a reason. When a life is interrupted, it calls for change and change can be hard when everything you planned comes to a halt.\r\n\r\nLook at how it started with Mary, vs. \"<strong>28 And having come in, the angel said to her, \"Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!\"</strong>. You and I would consider a favored life as a life blessed with our desires falling in place. Here we see Mary considered HIGHLY favored, the reason she was chosen. When you are in the will of God, if the Lord interrupts your life, it may not mean you are doing something wrong or being punished, it may mean He has something bigger planned for your life that will bring Him more glory. <strong>The interruption may be because He wants to impregnate you with His own destiny rather than yours</strong>. Your plans and mine are temporal, His are eternal. He may delay your plans, your response is to be obedient to His plans as Mary did. When the angel spoke to her about what was to come, instead of sharing her plans with the angel, she was willing to obey His plans. She did not share how her fiancée would take it, or how it will slow her plans or how her people and family would think of her, <strong>all she wanted was to honor God in her interrupted plans</strong>, <strong>vs.</strong> \"<strong>38 Then Mary said, \"Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.</strong>\" If it was of the Lord, the Lord would take care of the details and make things known clearly.\r\n\r\nYou may feel like your hopes and dreams have been interrupted. You had imagined by now you would be married, had your career on the move, done with school or had kids (whatever it might be). Everyone seems to be moving ahead but you. Have you considered that your life may have been interrupted by the Lord for a reason? That your desires may have been DELAYED but not DENIED? And your prayer, “Lord what do you have me do?”, Mary said, “<strong>Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.</strong>\" The Lord has interrupted my life many times and in that I have learnt to take Him at His word as I trusted His wisdom in my plans. I found the more I yielded to His will, the more my will was refined under His will to align to His. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 105:16-19, “16 Moreover He called for a famine in the land; He destroyed all the provision of bread. 17 He sent a man before them Joseph who was sold as a slave. 18 They hurt his feet with fetters, He was laid in irons. 19 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of the LORD tested him.\"</span></strong>\r\n\r\nAnything God ordains, He ordains it to work for His own purpose. This is why we should never cease to pray, “<strong>Lord, what is thy will in this or that</strong>?” We sometimes become selfish in our prayers that we only pray about things that are temporal rather than things that matters the most. Everything in our lives ought to serve to advance His kingdom rather than ours. Therefore to be in God’s will is to understand that all works for His purpose regardless of how things are turning.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn reading <b>Genesis 37</b>, we see Joseph dreams shattered when first his brother’s wanted to kill him but then changed their minds and threw him in a pit only to sell him later. God’s sovereign and providential hand was upon Joseph. He directed all plans whether good or bad. That everything about this young man was going to serve His purpose.\r\n\r\nHe sent a man before them (his family), even Joseph. He was the advance guard and pioneer for the whole clan. <strong>His brothers sold him, but God sent him</strong>. Where the hand of the wicked is visible, God's hand may be invisibly at work, overruling their malice. Consider him sold into Egypt, not without the determinate counsel of God, <strong>who preordained this to good</strong>; <strong>\"God did send me before you to preserve life, …\", Genesis 45:5. </strong>There was a great famine preordained by God, but God prepped 17 year old Joseph to preserve and deliverer His people as the Israelite seed. He only understood his mission when he met his brothers.\r\n\r\nGod blessed others because of him, gave him dreams and revelation for others but not for himself and his situation. Regardless of what he did not get, you see a trail of trust in his God in every situation, perhaps reflecting on the life of his great grandfather Abraham known as the father of faith <strong>Vs. 19. “Until the time that his word came to pass, …”</strong>. God has his times, and his children must wait \"until\" it is fulfilled. Joseph was tried as in a furnace, until the Lord's assaying work was fully accomplished. He believed the promise, but his faith was sorely exercised. <strong>A delayed blessing tests men, and proves their metal, whether their faith is of that precious kind which can endure the fire</strong>. “…<strong>The word of the LORD tested him. </strong><strong>The testing word that strengthens is also the delivering word that keeps</strong>. There is a trying word and a delivering word, and we must bear the one till the other comes to us. How meekly Joseph endured his afflictions, and with what fortitude he looked forward to the clearing of his slandered character we may readily imagine. It will be better still if under similar trials we are able to imitate him, and come forth from the furnace as thoroughly purified as he was, and as well prepared to bear the yet harder ordeal of honor and power. The word tested his character in readiness for his position. “<strong>Charisma can put anyone on top, its only character that will keep him on top</strong>”. Those who are tested by the fire of word often maintain character for faithfulness been found in them.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to go through something and know when and how you will come through it. It is another thing to hold on to what you know to be the truth because you know it is serving God’s purpose either in your life or others even when you do not know the outcome or what you will have to go through to keep you there. What are you trusting God for today? Is your prayer more of, <i>“God let everything that you ordain in my life either good or bad (in my eyes) work for your own purpose? Trusting not to sabotage Your process because I want things my way. Give me understanding to see the big picture which shows it’s not about me but You for Your glory</i>\" Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Luke 2:41-52 “And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried (stayed behind) behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and Mary knew it not.” (Luke 2:43 - Key Verse) Context (Check it out first)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Fulfilled The Days: They</strong> had all abided by the law, the tradition and fulfilled this aspect of its requirements, in light of Passover. The Passover is the Jewish remembrance of slavery in Egypt and how the death angel passed over Hebrew’s shelter with the blood on the door posts. Here they (Mary and Joseph) momentarily, one whole day, the One in whom would apply His blood to the doorposts of their hearts. Then the death angel upon visiting would be attracted to death, but rather repelled because he’d discover the gift of God is eternal life.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>The Child Jesus Tarried:</strong> Jesus stayed behind to talk to the teachers of that day. His parents were “on schedule” to return as tradition would normally have it, but Jesus “broke tradition” and saw that there was still unfinished business to be fulfilled. How fitting it was for Him to later say, “<strong>Didn’t you know, I must be about my Father’s business.” </strong>Yes, Passover was abided by, but God had further purposes while they were in town. Jesus often tarries while we want to get a move on. His time frame of eternity doesn’t have our time schedules of course, because we have places to go and things to do. Remember though Jesus at that time was “restrained” by time, the difference was that he kept eternity in mind. Do you know that if you are a true follower of Christ you are living eternally right now, and don’t have to wait for this “life everlasting” thing to kick in at time of death?. We may not have that new spiritual body yet that many are waiting for because their current one is in “need of various repairs,” but nevertheless you are living eternally right now if you are a Christian.\r\n\r\nAnd how often we rush, when Jesus wants us to tarry with Him. Didn’t Mary in the gospels choose wisely to sit at Christ’s feet, while Martha was running around serving Jesus like any good host would, but not at that time. There is a time for everything (Eccl. 3) but when Jesus says sit, rest, tarry, the time is spoken for by the Creator of time itself. But do you actually obey Him in that?\r\n\r\n<strong>Mary and Joseph knew it not:</strong> They were His parents, He was their Son, and they just got up and left their son. We don’t know whether Jesus’ other brothers and sisters had arrived in the family yet, to which Joseph would be their biological father. They waited a whole day (v. 46) assuming Jesus was with them when He was not. Their 12 year old Son was “God knows where” (no pun intended) and they were clueless, oblivious, and ignorant for that time.\r\n\r\nHave you ever began to move and realized Christ was not “with you?” Sinners do it daily, move and live without Christ. But, what about you? If you claim to be a Christian, take a self-check examination, and ask yourself; <strong>Is Jesus with me in my journeys, my plans, my ideas, my hopes, my dreams, my relationships, my ministry, my job, my family, etc…? Think about it, don’t move while Jesus wants you to tarry. Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>Luke 2:25-35, vs. \"28 he took Him up in his arms and blessed God...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThis short verse speaks to us of Simeon, whose brief story is told in verses 25-35. He was a just and devout man, waiting, the scriptures teach, for the consolation of Israel. He was waiting for the promised Messiah, having received the promise in himself that he would not see death until he saw the Lord’s Christ. His story is brief, but important, as he gives us a great example of an individual who sought for Christ, and received Christ. No one told Simeon who this child was; he saw Him and knew immediately, that this child was all he ever sought for, and all he ever desired. He was all his joy, the culmination of his life, all he had ever done paled in comparison to this one moment, when he saw Jesus.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nNow we see him taking Christ into his arms, which is to us a picture of one truly receiving Christ. He did not merely gaze at the child, but he opened himself, if you would, his heart was open, and more than just entering his arms, Christ entered his heart, Simeon was emptied of himself, he wanted only Jesus. Simeon personally experienced Christ in his life, as we are all called to, not once, but continually, and he desired Jesus more than all else, as we should, with a desire that grows and grows, if we have truly tasted of His goodness. This is what Peter speaks of in <strong>1Peter 2:2-3, </strong>the continual desire for God, if we have indeed tasted/experienced Him. His language here speaks of something that is savored and enjoyed, not for personnel gain, or for a mere moral improvement, but out of something much deeper created in the heart, a desire that when satisfied brings about a continual change into the likeness of what is desired, Jesus.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge of the Holy One, is the blessed privilege of all in Christ, and Jesus gave His precious life for this purpose. To be holy as He is holy, to know God in divine fellowship is our privilege, neglected by many. The shallowness of the inner experience of God in Christianity today is a travesty, keeping us on the outskirts of the temple, when God has called us to be priests, ministering to Him in the Holy of Holies, in the very Presence of God. It is the pure in heart that will see God(<strong>Matthew 5:8),</strong> those who strive after God, allowing Him to create in them the pure and holy heart that He will truly inhabit. Simeon sang that his eyes had seen God’s salvation, he knew the hope of Israel within his own heart, he saw and experienced the blessedness of God. He let go of all else, and took hold of the pearl of great price, as must we. Truly coming to Christ will cost you your life, but you will receive much more, and in the end, eternal fellowship with God, when He will take each true believer into His arms, into His presence forever and ever.\r\n\r\nThat Christ alone may be glorified, Brother Benjamen\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/dont-move-while-jesus-wants-you-to-tarry-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">Don't Move While Jesus Wants You To Tarry, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;"

              "<strong>Zechariah 8:4-5, “This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with cane in hand because of his age. The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.” This is what the LORD Almighty says: “It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?” declares the LORD Almighty.” </strong>\r\n\r\nWhen reading this verse what comes to mind? Perhaps for many may reminisce about your own childhood. As a child, I remember a neighbor sitting out on his deck often with his wife. I also recall playing on one particular dead end street where I formed many childhood friendships. It was great because there were only two houses on the street so traffic was not an issue.<!--more--> The sight of the aged sitting outside and children playing paints a vivid picture of tranquility and safety. Many seniors today are placed in nursing homes, and many children are not playing in the streets but are, as we say in New York City, “running the streets.” When will this picture become a reality? In the hit movie, The Lord of the Rings, the King returned to take his throne, and peace reigned in the land. When our King Jesus returns the picture painted by Zechariah will be an authentic one. When Christ returns, the prophet tells us.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Wisdom is visible:</strong> The aged will sit in the streets, each with cane in hand. <strong>Proverbs 16:31</strong> tells us, “<strong>Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained by a righteous life</strong>.” Many today are too busy to listen to the wisdom of the aged righteous. However at Christ’s return, I believe, there will be seniors sharing their wisdom to ears ready to listen. <strong>When the aged speak do you listen to their wisdom</strong>?\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Fun is visible</strong>: Children were depicted playing in the streets. Many of the streets nowadays are not as safe to play in. Kids are “running the streets,” getting into trouble, instead of playing As children many of us laugh, play, dream, and have fun, but as adults we seem to let those things fade into the background, and fall by the wayside by the voice of “responsibility” and work, to which many follow its tune. Work and responsibilities never seem to end, but it’s time to laugh again, dream again, and yes even to play again. The old saying goes, “<em>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy</em>.” <strong>Keep the fun flowing in your life</strong>. When Christ returns kids will once again be able to play again and perhaps we will all be able to “be a kid again” ourselves.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Enjoyment is visible</strong>: With the aged sitting in the streets and children playing in the streets, life has peace, prosperity, and security. The prophet <strong>Isaiah 65:20</strong> shares similarly in <strong>“Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years…”</strong> Praise the Lord, for this time that we have to look forward to of unhindered enjoyment with our Savior, and fellow believers. <strong>However there are plenty of things in our lives to enjoy now as we wait</strong>.\r\n\r\nA few years back during Christmas season my young nephew Antonio and I got to spend a few quality days together. We played together, laughed together, and even wrestled around in some Star Wars light saber battles. My five year old nephew “Tones” as we call him taught me a lot of things that I forget at times, and inspired this message. <strong>As we wait for our Savior, let us appropriate wisdom, fun, and enjoyment into our Christian lives, because in His presence is fullness of JOY! </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<a><strong>Acts 10:1-43, \"...send for Simon whose surname is Peter. ...He will tell you what you must do\"</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#333333;\">We are in the Christmas season. This is the time we remember the birth of Christ, the Messiah, the Savior of the world. He came to this world in form of flesh and blood, humbling Himself as a little baby, born to a young teenage virgin, fathered by a carpenter. One would imagine a king born in royalty family, however we have a King born in an ordinary home, living an ordinary life but with a great destiny. He was not bound to remain a child forever, His mission on this earth had to be accomplished as a grown up Man dying on the cross for sins of the world. I know there are people who are still imagining Jesus as a little baby in a manger, and some are hoping He comes back the same way.<!--more--></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#333333;\"><a><span style=\"color:#333333;\">In my text, we are told of Cornelius, a centurion, a devout man and one who feared God with all his household. He gave alms generously to people and prayed to God always. What would you conclude about a man with such a life style?, you would say he has everything he needs pertaining this life, however there was something missing crucial, the only thing needs to make I will address shortly. If you go to church, you give to charity, you pray every day, you love your family, supporting and providing for them, it is easy to conclude that you are set for life. That was the case with Cornelius until God gave him a vision. Every day we come across people mentioned in <strong>2Timothy 3:5, \"having a form of godliness but denying its power\"</strong>. There is nothing wrong with being godly, however there has to be something to support godliness. Jesus said in <strong>John 3:3, \"Verily, verily I say unto you, unless a man be born again, He cannot see the kingdom of God</strong>\". The word <strong>\"BORN AGAIN</strong>\" is the key that unlocks the kingdom of God. Cornelius had everything apart from the actual key that opens the gates of heaven, and God in His mercy did not want to leave him ignorant of this until the day of judgment only to be disqualified for not having the key. Would you say confidently you have the key? or would you say you think you have the key or have a key that might look like the right key? You have to have the right, the <strong>being Born again key.</strong></span></a></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#333333;\">Peter is sent for to come and share with Cornelius about salvation, meanwhile Peter in vs. 9 onwards is hungry and desired to eat. He goes up to rest and pray while the meals were being prepared. He falls asleep and gets a vision of his own. His vision, a sheet being lowered from heaven with all kinds of what they called unclean animals. God tells him to rise, kill and eat and he objects for they are unclean. in <strong>vs. 15, \"And a voice spoke to him again the second time, \"What God has cleansed you must not call common (unclean</strong>)\". This was no vision about food but about being respecter of people. Jesus died not for some race, color, ethnic group or some class, He died for all and desires all to be saved. If you are not saved, you are part of His big plan, and just as Peter was sent to bring the message to Cornelius, I have also been sent to bring the message of life. God's desire is that no man should perish but that all may have everlasting life. It is not about what we can do by own strength that counts, it is about what was already done to be received. If what Cornelius did could not buy him the key to the gates of heaven, what can you do to have one? money cannot buy it, fame won't do it, giving generously is good but that is not the key etc. Listen to part of the message Peter gives Cornelius and his household, <strong>vs. 43, \"To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever believes in Him will receive the remission of sins\". Peter preached to him repentance and faith.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#333333;\">How would you desire the key when you think all that you do is enough? the message is simple, you have to be born again. It's either black or white, no shades of gray in the middle; it's either dark or light nothing in between; it's either right or wrong the choice is yours but you have to be born again to have the key. Ask me how to and I will tell you. Think about your life. Let me leave you with something to think about in <strong>2 Corinthians 13:5, \"Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?--unless indeed you are disqualified\". Make sure you have the right key, Blessings Evans</strong></span>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\"><span style=\"color:#333333;\">Related articles</span></h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/13/its-all-been-paid-for-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">It's All Been Paid For, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Luke 2:14, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.” </strong>\r\n\r\nWhen I think of world peace, I think of the movie Groundhogs Day, where Bill Murray lives the same day over and over until he gets it right. If only that were possible for me! In trying to win a girls heart over they are having a toast, and I think that perhaps this is the sixth or seventh toast of that repeated day and finally he says let’s drink to world peace. Many people want world peace, and then above verse have been used to substantiate that sort of wishful thinking, especially around this Christmas season. Why is it wishful thinking?, because the Scripture reads that there is condition for this peace spoken of and that is that God’s favor is resting upon a person’s life.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nPeace is not the absence of war as some might think. It is not the serenity of sitting on a beautiful beach under the palm trees. It is not the absence of trouble in one’s life. Peace is not any of these things. The Scripture reads, “<strong>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost (Romans 14:17). Look at the particular order in which peace comes, after righteousness, and then follows joy.</strong>\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate what I mean as I believe that this is the ultimate picture of peace. In <strong>Matthew 8,</strong> Jesus leads his disciples into a boat, and then he goes and takes a nap. “<strong>24 Without warning, a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. 25 The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to drown!” vs. 26 He replied, “You of little faith, why are you so afraid?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm</strong>.\r\n\r\nWhen one follows Jesus, repents of their sins and submits their will to His, for the first time righteousness is in their character instead of worldliness. <strong>James 4</strong> reads, “<strong>Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.</strong>” Once someone repents of their sin, and knows that the victor of death, hell, and the grace lives in them, how can that person help but to experience the peace that God desires for their lives? This is because their will becomes aligned with God’s will. There is a sort of magnetic attraction that takes place that pleases the Lord. When one has the righteousness of Christ, and the peace is realized of spending eternity with Him, and no longer separated from Him, joy erupts! What is joy? Again let me share what joy is not. Joy is not getting a new “toy”, a raise at work, entering into a new relationship, etc…. No, these are things that bring us happiness. Happiness is circumstantial and contingent upon things. However, the circumstances change and the things wear down, break, and could be stolen. The Declaration of Independence tells us that we have the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but I believe that God tells us that He gives life (more abundantly) (<strong>John 10:10),</strong> liberty (because He is the perfect Law of liberty) (<strong>James 1:25</strong>) and the pursuit [and gain] of righteousness. Paul said, <strong>Philippians 3:9, “…and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ-the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith [in Christ].”</strong>\r\n\r\nApplication: Humanity can never have peace on earth, until righteousness begins in one’s own life and heart. Apart from the Lord, there is no peace. If you have no peace in your life, then today is your day to repent and align your will with God’s. Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Luke 2:1-3, “1 And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. 2 This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. 3 So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city”</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have you ever had the “joy” of moving? There was a season in my life where I had to move four times in four years. This was certainly not fun. I recall the day getting home from our honeymoon, that my wife and I were blessed to be introduced, through my in-laws, to see our last apartment. The only slight dilemma was that I had just moved all of my things, prior to our honeymoon, into another apartment. This would mean more moving, but it was certainly worth it. Although it was only temporary, Mary and Joseph had to move from Nazareth to Bethlehem. However in doing so one can see how God moves one or a group of people from one place to another to accomplish His will and Divine Plan.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The prophecy was foretold by the Prophet Micah, “<strong>But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting (5:2).”</strong> Obviously according to the prophecy, Christ had to be born in Bethlehem, but the only problem was that Mary and Joseph were living in Nazareth at the time. How was this prophecy to be fulfilled if Christ was in the wrong place? God would orchestrate the circumstances to assure that His Son would be born precisely in the place where the Prophet had prophesied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Luke wrote, “<strong>And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. 2 This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. 3 So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city. (Luke 2:1-3).”</strong> Perhaps you’ve read this around many times, especially recently with the Christmas season being upon us. However here are some awesome facts. In Matthew 1, the genealogy is paternal, going through Jesus’ earthly father, Joseph; and Joseph’s father, Jacob; back to David. In Luke 3, the genealogy is maternal, going through Jesus’ mother, Mary; and Mary’s father, Heli; back to David. Hence the census called by the ungodly and polytheistic Romans, caused Mary and Joseph to be forced to go to Bethlehem together, because both were from the line of King David, were Christ was to be born. The Roman IRS did not care that Mary was pregnant, and there was no other reason for Joseph to take his espoused Mary on a long journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem. God has an awesome way of orchestrating things to carry out His Divine Plan. If events at the dawn of the first century had progressed just ordinarily, Jesus would not have been born in Bethlehem. But God orchestrated the events of that time, and thus worked in amazing and powerful ways to make the Lord’s birth occur precisely at the right time and place, thus verifying His own prophetic Word. There are many times when perhaps like Joseph the movement that is taking place in our lives seems senseless, untimely, unpopular, and very emotional in our estimation. However Joseph and Mary followed the Lord, and walked His plan out even unknowingly. It must have been a difficult journey, but following God is not a road without bumps and unexpected turns.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, examine how God is moving you to accomplish his will in your life at this time. Perhaps He is moving you in such a way that is unpopular, senseless, and “untimely” in your eyes, but it is His Will.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">MacArthur, John:<em> God in the Manger : The Miraculous Birth of Christ</em>.

              "<strong>Joshua 1:9, \"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.” </strong>\r\n\r\nIn this life, we need company. We cannot make it alone, we know that. Just because we do not want to be alone does not mean we just need anyone to help us in one way or another, we may just need company, someone present even if they say or do nothing. If you look at a child who is terrified, a parent's presence is enough to calm him or her down. He or she may not look to the parent to take the fear away; the presence of a parent is enough to overcome their fear. They believe the parents are bigger than their imaginary monsters that appear real.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhat about us believers, at times we are not looking for answers, we are looking for someone to be there with us. Their presence is enough to make us face what we could be running away from. In Joshua's case, he always had Moses with him. That made him feel strong and courageous fighting in battles. Now that Moses was gone, the Lord encouraged him of His presence; He may have seen that He needed His presence now more than ever. And the Lord said to him, \"<strong>Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged\"</strong>, <strong>God was not giving Joshua anything, He was assuring him of His presence and the peace he needed would come about because of God's promised presence</strong>. Just like a child who gains peace and confidence, not because of what the parent (s) give him or her at the time of weakness and fear, but what comes about because of their presence. Three times in <strong>Joshua 1</strong>, God assured Joshua of His presence, <strong>Joshua 1:5,\"… as I was with Moses, so I will be with you</strong>, <strong>vs.</strong> <strong>9, \"for the LORD your God is with you\", vs. 17, \"…only the Lord your God be with you\". </strong>God's presence alone was enough to take away fear and give him courage to go forward. God was with Joseph in the absence of his father Jacob. Jacob did not even know what became of his son but God was with him in the pit, in Potiphar’s house, in jail and even on the throne. God was with Daniel in the lion's den; he was with Shadrach, Meshack and Abednego in the fire; he was with David when he was running away from Saul; he was with Jonah when he tried to flee from His presence; He said to Abraham, in <strong>Genesis 26:3, \"dwell in this land, and I will be with you and bless you.\"</strong> He told Jacob in <strong>Genesis 31:3, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your family, and I will be with you.</strong>” He told Gideon in <strong>Judges 6:16, “Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man\". What these people had in common is that they were all afraid and though their situations did not change, God assured them of His presence through it all.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>He is Emmanuel God with us in this Christmas season. He is Jehovah Shammah, the ever present God. He is present with our kids even when they are not with us. He is present in our spouses even in our absence. He is present in us in our jobs when we get overwhelmed. What a joy to know that He is ever present. He does not need to come, He is already here and how He would speak to us the way He spoke to Joshua, \"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”</strong> We do not need Him to come and solve, His presence is enough to solve. Therefore do not be discouraged or afraid, He is with you <strong>Isaiah 43:1-2, “1 But now, thus says the Lord, who created you, O Jacob, And He who formed you, O Israel: “Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; You are Mine. 2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; And through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, Nor shall the flame scorch you”</strong>, Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/my-eyes-sees-you-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">My Eyes Sees You, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/because-of-who-you-are-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Because Of Who You Are, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/facing-what-you-are-running-away-from-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Facing What You Are Running Away From, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/commend-all-to-god-part-2of2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Commend All To God, Part 2of2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/commend-all-to-god-part-1of2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Commend All To God, Part 1of2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/when-god-seems-silent-by-evans-olang-3/\" target=\"_blank\">When God Seems Silent, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>“Then the LORD said to Noah, “Come into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that you are righteous before Me in this generation…So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.” (Gen 7:1, 16).</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Divine Movement part one, we looked at how God moved Mary and Joseph from Nazareth to Bethlehem that the Scripture might be fulfilled,<strong> “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting (Micah 5:2).”</strong> God moved the earthly parents of Christ to carry out God’s Divine plan for Christ. I recently received a touching testimony from someone that shared that she believes at this time that God is divinely moving her to a new location which seems, untimely, senseless, and difficult.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Imagine what Noah must have felt like as perhaps the first person to experience God’s Divine movement. Noah is instructed to build an ark. Noah, had never seen an ark before, and although God gave him the blueprints for the project it also had never rained before. At this time in history there was a water canopy that covered the earth which God would tear open “the windows of heaven” as release upon the earth. God decides that He is going to flood the whole world, and that he would save Noah, his family, and a host of animals, all because of the righteousness of Noah. Who could say that God does not notice ones character? It was not Noah’s works of building the ark that saved Noah, but it was God’s grace that saved Noah as Noah’s character pleased God.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When I was reading this account in Genesis, I saw something that I had never seen before. At the end of the verse of<strong> Genesis 7:16</strong>, it reads,<strong> “…and the Lord shut him in.”</strong> It sounds to me that since their was no one that was going along with Noah before the flood took place, other than his family, there was no one that would have shut Noah into the ark. No one supported Noah in God’s Divine movement upon his life. I think it is safe to say that this shows us that there will be times when God will move you in a direction that many will not understand, or support you in because frankly they have not seen or heard of anyone doing what you feel that God is calling you to do. When you walk by faith in obedience to God’s call you may only have a few that go along with you, but like Noah, that is all you need. You may be disappointed of the many that do not see the truth, and perhaps even mock you for your move, but remember who shut Noah in, it was God. God sealed the door of what He was calling Noah to do. God has a way of sealing the move that He calls you to, even when others go the other way. I imagine that Noah’s move was unpopular with the locals, who were about to swallow the ocean unto their death, but perhaps that is way Jesus said, “<strong>many are called, but few are chosen.”</strong> Can you walk with the few that will go with you? I cringe at the many that will call out to the Lord on Judgment Day, “Lord, Lord,” only to hear, “<strong>Depart from Me, I never knew you, you worker of iniquity</strong>.” The famous song says, “Though none go with me, still I will follow, no turning back, no turning back.”</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is God moving you? Are you going willingly by faith even though the move may be unpopular with most? Remember, God will seal the door that He has called you to walk through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>"

              "<strong>Romans 1:17, \"For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, <em>“The just shall live by faith.”\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nThis morning I would like to share with you some thoughts about faith. In modern religious thought, faith has been largely defined as some sort of mystical feeling or emotion. But faith in its true, biblical sense, is the very attitude that the Christian comes to live by. It is the ground of belief, it is a conviction of the heart, a firm statement of truth from within, one that overtakes all other thought and tramples all doubt.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTrue faith birthed in the heart is as Paul states in <strong>2Timothy 1:12-”I know Whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able..”</strong> The key here lies in where this faith is directed. Paul was a man before his conversion who had faith, he had faith in the law, the outward principles and statutes that he believed made him righteous before God. He had faith in his works, he believed what he was doing was right, though it was not. He was convinced at that time, until he met Jesus. Upon that encounter, the previous faith he held crumbled. You see, in order for one to truly have put faith in Jesus Christ, they must cease to have faith in everything else. There must be a renunciation of the former things, and a reception, by faith, of the new.\r\n\r\nModern Christianity has abandoned and twisted the teaching of true regeneration and the new life found in Christ through the new birth, the very impartation of the righteousness of Christ that brings about the change observed in Paul's life. Fundamentalist teaching has relegated the new birth to the earthly realm, encouraging those who would become “almost” Christians to merely agree to some scripted lines they have selected, and through this they claim you are born again. So in essence, you have placed your faith into the words of a man, who assures you that you have been saved, much like Paul before he encountered Jesus, who trusted in the law, without the true work of the Holy Spirit within his heart.\r\n\r\nGod is calling all to true faith, a faith that is birthed in our hearts, a faith that brings about change, a faith that destroys the love of worldly things and creates within us new desires. It is a faith which purifies the heart from all pride, anger, worldly love, lust, and every evil thing. A faith which causes one to flee from all evil, even that which would have the appearance of sin. A faith that births love, a love for God above all else and a love for our neighbor as ourselves. A faith that draws us to willingly enter into the death of our Lord, for so he has commanded us. A faith that brings a desire to tell others of the wonderful redemption Christ has wrought for all mankind upon the cross of Calvary. It is a faith that causes us to say, “O Lord, in all the earth there is none but Thee.” It is a faith that is synonymous with obedience, for the one having this faith gladly obeys God's holy word, and they gladly read His word, to know His ways, they gladly pray, that they may gaze upon the face of their Beloved, being changed into His image from glory to glory. So this morning, have you this faith? Has the love of God been shed abroad in your heart? Have you renounced all else and placed your life fully in God? Will your “faith” stand?\r\n\r\nIn the love of Christ our Savior, Brother Benjamen"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Luke 2:11, \"For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord\"</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People have different meanings as to what Christmas is all about or what it means to them. To some it is a time for family get together, to some it is a time to exchange gifts, sing Christmas carols etc. But what is Christmas? Christmas is a Christian feast commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ. When researching, I found that the word \"Christmas\" which is nowhere found in the Bible is an old English word that means \"<strong>Christ's Mass</strong>\". This refers to the celebration of the Lord's Supper, i.e. the Mass. The earliest occurrence of the word on record is 1038 A.D. Christians at this time considered the Mass (Lord's Supper) to be the most important part of the celebration of Christ's birth, hence it came to be called Christmas (there could be more to it). During this time, we hear songs about Christmas being the most wonderful time of the year but the question is, is it about Christ?<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Christ, born of a virgin, entering the earth through natural birth canal to be the Savior of the world. The birth of Christ was not an accident, it was prophesied way back in the old times by prophets like Isaiah who prophesied His coming 700 years earlier. It was clear a King would be born, and when the time was right, God made it happen. To be true to the Spirit of Christmas, it has to be more than just gifts, carols, and good times, it is about remembering the birth of the one God promised recorded in<strong> John 3:16, \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life</strong>\". Christ was the greatest gift God could give to mankind, because of His love for mankind. In as much as we are the ones who need to give Him all the gifts, He has chosen to give us the best gift, and who could top that? The gifts we exchange come and go, they wear and tear, they break and get old but the gift we have, Christ Jesus, is the gift that never changes. He said in His word, \"<strong>He is the same yesterday, today and forever more He changes not</strong>\". It is amazing how Christmas has been changed by so many and Christ who is the reason for the season is not recognized in it and many times left out. Some have labeled it X-Mass, well I was taught in my math class that \"X\" is a representation of the unknown number. If I am labeling Christmas as X-Mass, I am saying that I am celebrating what I do not know and how sad that is. So I will celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ but not leave it there, I will also celebrate what He came to do for you and me.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There would be no Christmas if there was no mission that brought Christ to this earth over 2,000 years ago. For God to accomplish through His Son what He had purposed, He allowed Him to be born. Though a baby in a manger, the shepherds and the people who came to see Him bowed before Him recognizing His King and Lordship over all. Helpless in a manger, not knowing anything but still had power. Only Christ even in His infant stage was recognized as 100% God and 100% Man (God/Man).</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Luke 2:11, \"For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord\".</strong> I thank God for Jesus, without Him coming, there would be no us. I thank Him, He came to identify with us and redeem us. As I remember Christmas, I want to remember how He was born, His mission to this earth and how I fit in that mission. When I celebrate my birthday, I do not so much reflect on my early life, I concentrate on my present life and trust God for a new year for I am growing year by year. For this reason, you may celebrate Jesus’ birthday and look at Him as that little baby in a manger, but let this serve as a reminder to us all, He is coming back soon, but not as a baby in a manger. He is coming back as the King of kings and the Lord or lords, riding on a white horse and we all need to be ready to meet Him. I celebrate Christmas knowing that the One who was born is soon coming back and that He is the reason for this season. Have a blessed Merry Christmas, Love Ev.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/have-the-right-key-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Have The Right Key, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Psalm 144:3, \"LORD, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are very interesting beings if you think about it. We have issues, we go through changes, we lose directions many times, we deal with fear, we complain and more. I often wonder why the Almighty Perfect God would keep up with us. God promised to deliver the Israelites from Egypt and bring them to the promised land. As He led them there under the  leadership of Moses, they complained and murmured however God was very patient with them. I find it hard if you are like me to keep up with people who cannot get their acts together. After sometime, I expect things to change or get lost because I could dedicate that precious time to something else. I am glad the Lord does not deal with us the same way.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI tend to ask myself this question, <strong>Psalm 144:3, \"LORD, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?” </strong>It is already been established that there is no one good but God. God does not touch us on that basis. The very best we can bring before the Lord has flaws, <strong>Isaiah 64:6, \"But we are all like an unclean thing, And all our righteousness are like filthy rags; We all fade as a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, Have taken us away</strong>\". Note that it does not say \"our SINS are as filthy rags\", it says \"our righteousness are like filthy rags\". When God blesses you and not someone else, it is not because you are a little better or deserve it, it is all because of His grace and mercy. Man has issues but He still lifts him up. He may even curse God, but He still shows him mercy. It blows my mind more so when the Lord blesses me and I do not deserve it at all. At times right in my mess ups, He still steps in to deposit blessings into my account. <strong>I am amazed that His blessings are not based on who I am and what I can do but on who He is and what He can do. His blessings are not about me but about Him</strong>. He has chosen to pick me up when no one is around to pick me up. You will agree with me that if you are going through something, people can stand with you up to a certain point and if they see no change, they will call it quits. As for Him, <strong>He is a friend who sticks closer than a brother</strong>. All may be tired and leave but He sticks closer. “Lord, what is man, that You take knowledge of Him?”\r\n\r\nI am attached to a blessed Vine, what a blessing. Thank God for the Roman soldier who pierced Him on His side. He opened away for me to be grafted in to partake of His blessings through His covenant. I am blessed in the field; on the mountain; in my going out and in my coming in. I am blessed at home and I am blessed at my job. I am not blessed when I receive the blessing, I am blessed even on the verge of waiting for it, faithful is He that has promised. I have no reason to have this amount of blessing in my account, all I know is that He decided to bless me.<strong> Proverbs 10:22, \"The blessing of the LORD makes one rich, And He adds no sorrow with it\". </strong>No one who is blessed has sorrows because blessings are signs of abundance both spiritual and material blessings. I have joy blessings deposited in my account. I can encourage myself and others in the Lord because He has deposited encouragement blessings in my account. I count my blessings one by one. God was mindful of us, He gave us His Son, the greatest gift to satisfy the demands of the law we could not pay, <strong>2Corinthians 5:21, “For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him”</strong>. If no one takes knowledge of you in this Christmas time, remember the Lord does.

              "<strong>Mark 2:1-5, \"So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Son, your sins are forgiven.\" </strong>\n\nHave you ever been in a situation where you can see a possibility of something happening in your favor, but the circumstances seemed to create an obstacle? For example you would go outside, but it's raining. Five men found themselves in such a situation. Jesus was in town and was preaching, and multitudes no doubt flocked to him because they wanted to see him perform more miracles (like the healing of the leper). However, Jesus was preaching not working miracles inside the house. These men wanted to get their paralytic friend to Jesus.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe Expositors Bible Commentary states, \"This typical Palestinian peasant's house was a small, one-room structure with a flat roof. Access to the roof was by means of an outside stairway. The roof itselfwas usually made of wooden beams with thatch and compacted earth in order to shed the rain. Sometimes tiles were laid between the beams and the thatch and earth placed over them.\"\n\nThe phrase that grabbed my heart was \"<strong>When Jesus saw their faith...\"</strong> How can one see faith anymore than one can see the wind? these four men teach us how Jesus can see our faith.\n\n1. Some see opportunities where others see barriers, <strong>\"Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof</strong>”. “<strong>Obstacles are those things we see when we take our eyes off our goal</strong>.\" The goal here was to get the paralytic to Jesus. The front entrance was blocked so they went another way. They dug through the roof as an alternative means to meet their goal.\n\n2. There is power in Combined faith <strong>\"...they made an opening... Jesus saw their faith</strong>.\" Whose faith teams up with your faith? When you are praying for someone, and carrying their needs to Jesus, who partners with you?\n\n3. Faith can be visible. \"<strong>Jesus saw their faith...\"</strong> How can faith be seen? James reminds us \"...<strong>faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action (deeds), is dead... Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do</strong>.\" Faith without works is about as useless as a screen door on a submarine. When the four men dug up the compacted thatch and earth (no doubt dirt showered down on those inside the house below) the dirt probably fell upon Jesus. Jesus looked up and saw the digging (action) to substantiate their faith (trying to get their friend to Jesus).\n\nSee the opportunities through the eyes of faith. Combine your faith with others. Show Jesus your faith is real and that your actions will appropriate your faith in Him, the object of faith.\n\nUntil the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil ;&lt;;"

              "<strong>John 9:1-41, Vs. 33, \"...If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nJesus was in a town where He met another blind man. Every account of miracle Jesus performed always pointed to a bigger picture with spiritual lesson behind the miracles. A number had questioned the reasons behind this man’s blindness as if to show that sin was the cause. They questioned if it was his or his parents sins the reason he was born blind. The Lord’s response, <strong>“it’s not because of any of their sins but that the work of the Lord might be revealed</strong>”. Many are condemning themselves right now because of what they believe they did, the reason they are dealing with difficult times. Part of it could be true, but do you know that <strong>Jesus does not bless us on the merit of what we have done, He does it on the basis of what who He is, what He can do and has done. </strong>That is the story of this blind man.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe then see how Jesus spat on the ground, made clay and anointed the blind man's eyes and then asked him to go and wash at the pool of Siloam. Is this not amazing that the Lord can use what is despised to get the job done? <strong>That whatever is despised, if it is in His hands, He can do extra ordinary things out of the ordinary</strong>. We also take a notice that He does not ask any one for permission to do it, not even consult with His disciples. When God begins to bless you, He will not seek any man’s input or approval, He will do it because He has chosen to.\r\n\r\nThe man was sent down probably by himself to go and wash his eyes. Another amazing thing, when the Lord begins to do something in your life, <strong>He will ask you to do the impossible because He has already made impossible possible</strong>. Remember this man is blind and to make matters worse, he has heavy clay in his eyes and yet he is told to find his way to the pool. God will guide His children in right direction to the right place without them even knowing how to get there and without them interfering with His plans.\r\n\r\nSo the man went and did he is instructed and he came back seeing. The experience humbled him to do what we would call silly. God uses the smallest things to confound the biggest things that many may know that He can do anything at any time by any means. The man who had just received his sight came back rejoicing and I would think that everyone would be happy for him, that was not the case. <strong>I have discovered that when God begins to bless and raise you, you will discover that you do not have a problem with God but you have a problem with people because people have a problem with you being blessed</strong>. As long as this man was blind, everyone was okay with his condition but the moment he gained his sight, his blessings became an issue. This man could not stop testifying of what the Lord had done in his life. The more he testified, the more they were against him. When God begins to raise you, you have to rise up even if you are by yourself. <strong>Your destiny is not determined by someone else' actions</strong>, it is for you and I to forget those things behind us and press on forward. Your hope and my hope should be built on NOTHING LESS THAN JESUS. <strong>Do not forfeit your blessings just because someone does not like it</strong>. Give God all the glory, praise Him, testify, let people know what the Lord has done and is doing in the midst of all the criticism.\r\n\r\nWhen they continued to question the man about his healing and even suggested that the One who have healed him was a sinner and a nobody, the once upon a time blind man’s faith could not be shaken. His testimony, <strong>\"...If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing...\". Can you stand your ground through it all and refuse to change your story, the truth everyone is fighting?, stand up for Jesus, blessings Ev</strong>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/i-will-be-with-you-says-the-lord-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">I Will Be With You Says The Lord, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/open-your-mouth-wide-and-i-will-fill-it-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Your Mouth Wide, And I Will Fill It, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/he-takes-knowledge-of-me-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">He Takes Knowledge Of Me, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;"

              "<strong>Isaiah 8:14, \"Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. Each one has a good reason why they call it the most wonderful time of the year.\r\n\r\nA prophesy about a Son to be born happened a few thousand years ago when God gave the prophesy to King Ahaz after he could not ask for a sign. And the prophesy was very clear about who will be born, how He will be conceived and even the name He was to be given,<strong> Immanuel which means God with us</strong>. Jesus was coming to this earth taking the form of flesh. To redeem, He had to relate to us in human form without loosing His deity. He was 100% God and 100% Man, the infinite God Man. And when God brought Him into the world of sin, He made sure that no man contributed to His coming for man has the tendency of trying to take the glory. God made sure Jesus was born of a virgin something we Christians do not take lightly. He came to be the Savior of the world and be Lord of all.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Isaiah 9:6, \"For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, And the government will be, upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace\".</strong> Can you imagine a child being born already given these titles? Watch this, after the prophesy in the book of Isaiah (700 years before His birth), Jesus is born and Matthew records the fulfillment of that prophesy,<strong> Matthew 1:22&amp;23, \"So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: Behold, the virgin shall be with a child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,\" which is translated, \"God with us\"</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe amzing thing is that when Jesus was born, <strong>He was born already crowned the King of the Jews (Matthew 2:2</strong>), the wise men guided by the star come to worship the <strong>King of Jews also known as the King of kings. </strong>Not only did they come to worship, they also brought gifts with them. Can you see that Christmas is not about us but about the King of kings? yes we exchange gifts and yes sometimes we do not want to call it Christmas but happy holidays. Jesus Christ is the reason for Christmas and we come to worship Him just as the wise men who said let us go and meet the King of the Jews, bringing Him gifts. We can bring Him gifts of praise, worship, adoration and the like, it is all about Him. <strong>Oh come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord</strong>.\r\n\r\nAs we celebrate Christmas, let us remember that Jesus was born to be the Savior and the King of the world, and that He is coming back again soon and this time He is not coming as baby in a manger but as the King of kings and the Lord of lords, <strong>Isaiah 9:7, \"Of the increase of His government and peace, and there will be no end, Upon the throne of David and over His Kingdom, To order it and establish it with judgment and justice from that time forward, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this\". </strong>Hallelujah, praise the Lord, Jesus is coming back as a Mighty Man of war. As we celebrate His birthday and we look at Him in a manger, the tuth is, He is no longer the helpless infant in a manger, He is the King who sits on the throne. Merry Blessed Christmas, Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/20/the-reason-for-the-season-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Reason For The Season, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/it-is-about-the-cross-by-evans-olang-2/\" target=\"_blank\">It Is About The Cross, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/have-the-right-key-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Have The Right Key, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Psalm 119:105, \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is good to<strong> know the word, and more so to know the God of the word,</strong> He is the word Himself. The Gospel of <strong>John 1 </strong>takes us back to the origin to understand how the word of God is Jesus<strong>. John 1:1-5, “1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it”</strong>. John tells us that Jesus existed from the beginning, not as a created being but God, contrary to what some sects believe.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThis word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path. We read the word with understanding with the help of the Holy Spirit. Jesus said,<strong> John 14:6, \"I am the way, the truth and the life, no man comes to the Father but by me</strong>\", already Jesus has stated clearly that He is the way and knowing that He is the word Himself, He is the One who will guide us through the paths of life by His truth.\r\n\r\nRemember how God came through for the Israelites when they faced hard times on their journey to the promise land, God went before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire. We know how fire provides light and also fire consumes anything in its path. It is by this I believe God meant that He will not just shine their way but also clear their path. This I believe is the reason for a lamp unto their feet and a light unto their path.\r\n\r\nThe more we know the word meaning the God of the word, the more we can be stirred up in the right direction.<strong> Psalm 37:23, \"The good steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord, He delights in his ways and whichever way he turns, he will prosper\"</strong>. I do struggle to get the word inside of me, meditating on it and even memorizing it, however I know that the more I do what I struggle with, the more I can see my way clearly because getting hold of the word means getting hold of the One who knows the way. People who do not know and are unsure of the way tend to go in circles, wasting precious time. They get lost again and again, finding themselves in wrong places. They are not progressing and growing because they are stuck in the same place. When we are confident of who is leading the way, though we may go through the valleys of the shadow of death, we will not fear evil for He knows the way and we are following Him.\r\n\r\nHow much of the word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path? Are we reading the word without fail, let me go a step forward, are we STUDYING the word or are we waiting for Sunday morning for the word to be preached? Are we memorizing the word and applying to our lives? Are we checking the words we hear from preaching, teachings and devotions to prove if they are preached, written and/or are applied correctly? Even in my weakness I desire to know the word and the God of the word.<strong> Psalm 86:11 \"Teach me your ways oh Lord and I will walk in your truth, unite my heart to fear our name\", Psalm 25:4&amp;5, \"show me your ways O Lord, teach me your paths. Lead me in your truth and teach me, For you are the God of my salvation; on You I wait all the day, Psalm 119:89, \"Forever O Lord thy word is settled in heaven.</strong> Find the word, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Acts 4:1-22,\"13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that they had been with Jesus\"</strong>\r\n\r\nOf all Jesus' disciples, there is no one I find whose character is well described as that of Peter. His strengths and weakness are well highlighted, and many of us identify with him. What makes his life also interesting, in the midst of all his weakness and failures, the Person who should have had a reason to exclude him from the pack, actually made him be in the inner circle. Christ never gave up on him.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLater we see now Peter standing to defend Christ, talk highly of Him and leaves a staggering statement before those of reputation who thought of salvation in another way, Peter says vs. <strong>“12 Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\"</strong> Peter here stands so boldly, Christ in him and speaking such a profound truth still echoed today that Christ is the only way. Do we boldly stand and proclaim that truth when we speak with others or do we deny Christ by keeping quiet, or proclaiming Christ is one of the ways to God? In our postmodern world, majority define what their salvation should be, and those who hold the truth, hold it as relative and not absolute. Oh how I desire for God to raise such a remnant who has seen the cross as the pillar of Christianity and stand like Peter and proclaim the truth of salvation in Christ alone that He suffered, died, was buried and resurrected on the third day for our salvation. One plus God is majority; Christ in you will give you boldness to proclaim who He is. We are His ambassadors in this world. That is the reason we are still here, to proclaim His truth. I read about Christians being persecuted in other nations such as India, Iraq, Sudan, Pakistan, etc., what amazes me in hearing their stories is that their prayer is not primarily for persecution to stop, but that they be faithful to preach Christ, be His witness in their land.\r\n\r\nIf you go back to <strong>Luke 21</strong>, Jesus had prepared His disciples for perilous times. When the time came, it did not feel strange to them for they knew they had to suffer for Christ. Jesus talked to them about the signs of end times <strong>Luke 21:7-19</strong>, people would come in His name, wars, commotions, famine, pestilence etc. He then says as recorded in <strong>Luke 21:12-13, “12 But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and rulers for My name's sake. 13 But it will turn out for you as an occasion for testimony</strong>.\" Is this not exactly what we see in <strong>Acts 4,</strong> Christ being faithful to bring to pass what He had promised in the midst of persecution? He says \"<strong>It will turn out for you as an occasion for testimony</strong>\", we see Peter testifying of what he had seen and heard.\r\n\r\n<strong>Acts 4:13-14, “Vs 13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that they had been with Jesus. 14 And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.\"</strong> Peter and John identified with Christ, now having stood for Christ, those of reputation and the crowd identified them with Christ, not only identified them with Him, but they also concluded they had been with Christ.\r\n\r\nI am identified with Christ and more so for others to also identify me with Christ as I speak boldly of His name. People saw something different about them, though uneducated, untrained, they were amazed at the boldness and the words they spoke with wisdom echoing again <strong>Luke 21:14-15, “14 Therefore settle it in your hearts not to meditate beforehand on what you will answer; 15 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict or resist</strong>\"\r\n\r\nGod is amazing, He can use anything and anyone. It is not about ABILITY, it is about AVAILABLITY because you have been identified with Him. We do not do His work because we CAN, we do His Work because He CAN through us as His vessels. <strong>2Corinthians 4:7, \"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us</strong>\". Are you identified with Him? Do others identify you with Him? Are you available for His service? Examine yourself and see where you are.

              "<strong>Acts 4:1-22, \"13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that they had been with Jesus”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the book of Acts we see a huge difference in the lives of the disciples compared to their time with Christ, crucifixion period in particular. It was Peter in <strong>Matthew 26:69 and 71</strong> who denied Christ when a servant girl and another girl identified him with the condemned despised Christ. Peter who would not stand the pressure denied Him. In Acts we see a different Peter, the Peter who had seen the cross had a different perspective of Christ. This is the Christ he also tried to stop from going to the cross. Peter had now learnt what it meant to pick up his cross and follow Christ, and be identified with Him. Anyone who carried the cross knew it was a one way ticket. The cross you carried you would be crucified and die upon it.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIt was Paul who said, in <strong>1Corinthians 2:1-2, “And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. 2 For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.” </strong>This was the central pillar for both Paul and Peter and the rest of the disciples.\r\n\r\nGoing back to <strong>Acts 4</strong>, we have here the trial of Peter and John before the judges of the ecclesiastical court, for preaching Jesus Christ, and working a miracle in His name.<strong> vs. 5, “And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes, 6 as well as Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem”. </strong>These were not considered ordinary men in that land; they were men of reputation, men who held high offices, judges of the court. They were considered men for eminent power, for wisdom, and for learning.\r\n\r\nPeter (once upon a time coward) full of the Holy Ghost stood before these men and having been asked this question, <strong>Vs. 7.., “By what power or by what name have you done this?”, he did</strong> not deny Christ but identified himself with Him, in fact He took the opportunity to preach the gospel. He said <strong>vs. 8, “Rulers of the people and elders of Israel: 9 If we this day are judged for a good deed done to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well, 10 let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole. 11 This is the ‘stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone. 12 Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe cross makes a difference in the life of a believer when he identifies himself with Christ crucified. If the gospel of Christ had not been of God, it could not have made its way, for it had both the learning and power of the world against it, both the colleges of the scribes and the courts of the elders. God chose this way for He is most magnified when the despised cross (gospel) is preached by the ordinary people, the stones the builders rejected. This is why anyone can do the work of God because the power of God is present in them. God chose ordinary men, filled them with His presence, and lived His own life through them proclaiming the gospel of His kingdom. Peter was satisfied with the old rugged Cross and in that Christ was most glorified. Here they identified themselves with Christ.

              "<strong>Acts 4:1-22, \"13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that they had been with Jesus”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Israelites looked forward to the coming of the Messiah, the King of kings. They expected Him to come, overthrow and seat on the throne. Well He came through a teenage girl by virgin birth. He grew up an ordinary life, He was a carpenter, He had no place to lay His head, He rode on a donkey (kings rode on horses and chariots), He spent time with the despised, and <strong>Isaiah 53:1-3</strong> tells us,” <strong>1 Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? 2 For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant, And as a root out of dry ground. He has no form or comeliness; And when we see Him, There is no beauty that we should desire Him. 3 He is despised and rejected by men, A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him”<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\n<a><em>“JESUS, THE CHRIST</em></a><em>, born of a virgin nearly 2,000 years ago, was raised in obscurity. He came from the bosom of the Father to the bosom of a woman. He put on humanity that we might put on divinity. He became Son of Man that we might become sons of God.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>He possessed neither wealth nor high social standing. <a>His relatives were inconspicuous, and He had neither training nor formal education</a>. In infancy He startled a king; in childhood He puzzled doctors; in manhood He ruled the course of nature, walked upon the billows as if pavements, and hushed the sea to sleep.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>He healed the multitudes without medicine and made no charge for His service. He never wrote a book, and yet many times more books have been written about Him than about anyone else who has ever lived. His discourses and teaching have been translated into over 1,000 languages, and have a circulation many times greater than that of any other writing in existence.</em>\r\n\r\n<a><em>He</em></a><em> never wrote a song, and yet He has furnished the theme for more songs than all the songwriters combined. He never founded a college, but all the schools put together cannot boast of having as many students. He never marshaled an army, nor drafted a soldier, nor fired a gun; and yet no leader ever had more volunteers who have, under His orders, made more rebels stack arms and surrender without a shot fired. He never practiced psychiatry, and yet He has healed more broken hearts than all the doctors far and near.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Once each week the wheels of commerce cease their turning and multitudes went their way to worshipping assemblies to pay homage and respect to Him. The names of the past proud statesmen of Greece and Rome have come and gone. The names of the past scientists, philosophers, and theologians have come and gone, but the name of this man abounds more and more. Though time has spread almost 2,000 years between the people of this generation, and the scene of His crucifixion, He still lives. Herod could not destroy Him, and the grave could not hold Him</em>.\r\n\r\n<em>He stands forth upon the highest pinnacle of heavenly glory, proclaimed by God, acknowledged by angels, adored by saints, and feared by devils, as the living, personal Christ, our Lord and Savior”,</em> author unknown\r\n\r\nThis same Jesus appointed disciples who were people of no class as men would describe them. He appointed fishermen, tax collector and some we are not told of their occupations. If they were great in their day, it would have been recorded.

              "<strong>2Corinthians 5:20, \"Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ’s behalf, be reconciled to God</strong>\"\r\n\r\nAmbassadors are ministers of the highest rank, with full authority to represent their country. If you are born again, you need to realize that you are an ambassador for Christ. You are a minister with a highest rank raised to represent his country, the Kingdom of heaven with the gospel. We are not of this world, we are ambassadors in this world. Those who are saved are citizens of heaven temporarily on assignment here on earth (country). No ambassador comes in his own authority and does what he wants, he displays a lifestyle depicting what his country is like.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>I find it discouraging sometimes when believers who should act like ambassadors are acting more like secret agents</strong>. For whatever reason, they find it hard to be identified with their own country at work, in the community etc. Sounding more like living a double life. On Sunday morning everyone knows him to be an ambassador by the way he conducts himself and then the rest of the week, he is the only one who knows he is a believer. The word of God says in <strong>Matthew 5:16, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven\".</strong> God has called you to be a diplomat where you are, first to be a light and second with God given opportunities to bring His message to those in need.<strong> It is not the title that defines a person, it is the duty behind the title that displays truly who they are.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat qualifies a person to be an ambassador, vs. 17-18 tells us that \"<strong>17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new\". </strong>That is the start but realize it does not stop there, next step, <strong>vs. 18\" Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation”</strong>, A minister is not given the title to feel good about himself, he is given a title to fulfill the roles of that title. We are made ministers, ambassadors for the ministry of reconciliation. This speaks to the reality that God wills to be reconciled with sinners. God has called believers to shine while proclaiming the gospel of reconciliation to others. Through service such as waiting on tables, God wants Christians to accept the privilege of serving unbelievers while proclaiming a desire to be reconciled. Ambassadors have authority and the back up from the country they represent.\r\n\r\nPaul said that if we are really Christians, then we are \"<strong>ambassadors of Christ</strong>\", we are God's sole representatives in this foreign land called \"the world.\" With that analogy in mind, consider what a president would think of an ambassador to a foreign country, say Russia, who is told to deliver an extremely urgent message that will involve the peace of the whole world. And that ambassador (even with the best intentions) chooses not to be identified with his country in a foreign land and gives only a small part of the message, in such a way that it makes a very different impression than what the president wanted to make. How should the president think of that ambassador and reward him when he finds out the damage done?\r\n\r\nAn ambassador is not afraid to show whose he is and what country he represents, if anything, he delights in the fact that God would entrust him with such a high rank position he does not deserve or qualify for. To be everything He wants us to be before He takes us home to be with Him when the time comes. You and I are ambassadors for Christ, let us act like it everywhere we are.

              "<strong>2Kings 7:3-20, “6 For the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses—the noise of a great army; so they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us!” 7 Therefore they arose and fled at twilight, and left the camp intact—their tents, their horses, and their donkeys—and they fled for their lives”</strong>\r\n\r\nI love this story; I have shared from it many times. It reminds us of how amazing God is and how He can turn things around and use the least likely, the despised, and the rejected for His glory. <!--more-->The walls of Jericho came tumbling down without a bulldozer or physical battle in place because God reversed things. God gave Gideon victory with only 300 men in <strong>Judges 7, </strong>this was right after sending over 30 thousand men back home. Samson in <strong>Judges 15 </strong>found a fresh jawbone of a donkey and slew 1,000 men. How clear it is when the bible says, <strong>1Corinthians 1:26-28, “26 For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called. 27 But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; 28 and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, 29 that no flesh should glory in His presence”.</strong> God is not a respecter of man, He is concerned about His name and how to make His name great among us.\r\n\r\nHow often do we look at things and conclude there is nothing good or constructive expected of them. We think of sophisticated as better; e.g. an electronic device, it is easy to think the expensive one is better than the cheaper one. We can even conclude that the expensive one will last and yes there is some truth to it but not always. The despised can be great to use and even last longer. We see this with the four lepers whom the Lord choses to remind us that it is “<strong>not by might or power, but by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts</strong>”, <strong>Zechariah 4:6.</strong>\r\n\r\nNow these four lepers were weak, sick, hungry and few in numbers. If we were to get a little understanding of the Syrians, they were feared by the Israelites. The Syrians knew that the only way Israel could be a threat to them was if <strong> “… they hired against the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians”</strong>. There had to be two kings hired before they could be a threat to them but God knows how best to fight His battles. These four men chose to go to the Syrian camp to surrender hoping in that act, they would be spared, made slaves and given food however as they began to walk there in difficulty, vs. 6. “…<strong>the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses—the noise of a great army; so they said to one another”, </strong><strong style=\"background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0);\">“Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us!” </strong><span style=\"background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0);\">Wit</span>hout changing them, God caused the Syrians to hear a sound of an army, God caused them to believe a lie. God caused them to be terrified of their own imaginations, striking terror upon the spirits of the besiegers. There was not a sword drawn against them. God chose to use four weak men to bring terror to a mighty army. They had their ways of wanting to do things, God chose His way.\r\n\r\n<strong>“…Therefore they arose and fled at twilight, and left the camp intact—their tents, their horses, and their donkeys—and they fled for their lives”, </strong>God can when he pleases, dispirit the boldest, and make the stoutest heart to tremble. They that will not fear God, he can make them fear at the shaking of a leaf. <a>Thus God needs no great preparation to destroy the wicked. Though they are many, he can scatter them with a small noise, or shaking of a leaf.</a>\r\n\r\nAre you feeling inadequate, weak, fearful etc? then you have the qualifications of what God can use to do great work for His name sake. All you need is to avail yourself and let the Lord chose how to fight His battles for you and through you while you yield to His plans. If God could use these four sick, hungry, weak men, God can use you. Are you available?

              "<strong>Genesis 3:21, \"The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them\"</strong>\r\n\r\nGod in all His wisdom created us beings with free will. He created us beings with the ability to make choices. Adam and Eve had been given that ability in the garden of Eden when God planted it with all trees and had all the fruits they needed. <strong>Genesis 2:9, \"And out of the ground the LORD God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil</strong>\". The bible is full of dichotomies, life or death, sheep or goat, right or wrong, true or falls etc. and each of them have explanations as to what happens if you choose any of them. God gave the Israelites two choices and explained the outcome of each choice, <strong>Deuteronomy 30:19, \"I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live;\".</strong> God in His sovereignty has allowed us to choose but not blindly. With this, every choice we make, we make it with understanding.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn the case of Adam and Eve, God explained and left them to make a choice and we know the choice they made. Of all the trees they could eat from, their curiosity could not prevent them from picking from that one tree. We are no different when it comes to sin, the forbidden fruit always looks good, attractive and pleasant. You know it will lead to death but you want to give it a try anyway. You know the consequences yet you are not concerned at that particular time. The problem with the forbidden fruit, it is a trap the enemy uses, it leads to death, it strips you and leaves you naked. That is what happened to Adam and Eve after they ate of the forbidden fruit. And from there on, man has stripped himself from the covering of the Lord, left naked and ashamed. Adam and Eve tried to cover their nakedness, man tries the same even today to cover their nakedness with the leaves of self-righteousness, good works, trying to clean his life but the thing is, the leaves dry up and falls and still leaves man naked. In as much as God had always been there for them, when they fell, they tried to do things their way. There was shifting blames because it is always someone else fault.\r\n\r\nBut God even in the midst of their failure, offered the first sacrifice by killing an animal so as clothe them. Our Father in heaven saw our nakedness which resulted from the forbidden fruit we eat of sin and <strong>He sent His only begotten Son to die on the cross that we may be clothed in righteousness</strong>. He was crucified naked, taking all our guilt and shame that we may be clothed in righteousness. Only Christ could cover us from the shame of sin we had brought upon ourselves. In as much as we tried to cover it ourselves, it was and never would it be good enough to have covered us from guilt and shame. He covered us for a life time into eternity. As long as one is naked, he or she is a target to sin and that is why Paul encouraged us in Romans <strong>13:14, \"But PUT ON the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.\" It is a choice one has to make. Genesis 3:21, \"The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them\". </strong>You can see that it is the Lord God who killed an animal and out of it made the garments for them. And it is the Lord God who has made us garments through the sacrifice of His Son Jesus. I now have this deep rooted joy because my sin (nakedness) is covered, I am clothed in righteousness. What about you? Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe foundation of our salvation is crucial in the sense that, it defines it and sets in place everything that will be built on that foundation. If your understanding is that Christ died on the cross to make you happy, then all you will seek is ways to be happy and build your life on happiness. The message of the Gospel, Christ did not come to make us happy, He came to make us righteous, right with God. Everything else is filtered through the eyes of the gospel. <strong>2Corinthians 5:21, \"For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him\", </strong>not righteousness for a season but for a life time<strong>. </strong>The book of Proverbs tells us what does not profit in the day of wrath, <strong>Proverbs 11:4, \"Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness delivers from death\". </strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 10:3, “for they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness”. </strong>A person becomes ignorant of God’s righteousness when he does not truly know God. The world has their own perception of who God is. They have gone as far as creating a god in their own making to suit themselves. People have created their own plan of salvation, establishing their own righteousness. The question to ask, is it the true one? I hear people say, “<i>my god would never do that</i>\", to which I agree with them, their personal god will never because he is not the God of heaven revealed in the bible. Knowing the God of heaven is knowing His TRUE NATURE which is revealed to us in summary of the ten commandments (law). <strong>He reveals Himself in the spirituality of His law</strong>. <strong>That is where His righteousness and perfect purity of character are revealed for men to learn it there</strong>. The ten commandments are not laws imposed on mankind to learn and follow, I believe it’s primary work is to reveal to us who God is which then reveals who we truly are. It exposes our so called righteousness and creates a thirst for His righteousness. Those who are not soundly saved are ignorant of God’s righteousness and with that, they have created a god to suit themselves, a god they are comfortable with to which if you probed more, you will discover they are their own gods. They may not admit it but that is true, they are the captain of their own destiny. <strong>Proverbs 16:2, “All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the heart”.</strong> I see this a lot when I talk with the unsaved<strong>.</strong>\r\n\r\nAgain, men are ignorant of God’s righteousness when they do not understand His method of making sinners righteous. For someone to be made righteous, they must be living in sin. Sin is the opposite of righteousness. What is sin? <strong>1John 3:4, “Sin is transgression of the law”.</strong> In other words it is an offense against religious or moral law. If we have this definition, then we can say that without the law, there can be no sin. What does the law have to do with I am sharing? Because men are ignorant of the righteousness of God when they do not know and understand the laws of God which reveals what sin is. The bible says, <strong>Romans 3:20, “By the law is the knowledge of sin</strong>”. Paul says to us in <strong>Romans 7:7, “…I would have not known sin except through the law”</strong>. Paul tells us that he did not know what sin was until the law of God told him. <strong>So the law tells us what sin is because it reveals who God is</strong>. If I was to use SIN as an acronym, I would say <strong>S</strong>avior <strong>I</strong>s <strong>N</strong>eeded.\r\n\r\nHow can a person truly repent and be saved when they do not really know what sin is and more so what their sin is? How can they submit to the righteousness of God if they are ignorant of it? This is the reason that even for those who are saved ought to preach to themselves the gospel daily to keep the hunger and thirst for righteousness alive. This calls for crucifying the flesh that craves for happiness that we may live a righteous life, a life pure before God. <strong>Romans 14:17, \"for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit\"</strong>\r\n\r\nOften times we hear the messages of God’s love and mercy. They are powerful messages we all embrace, without them we have nothing at all. At times we hear God’s justice yet we do not see God’s justice simply because we have never understood it, who it applies to and when it ought to be applied. Some feel that God is love and therefore cannot serve justice because that will make Him unjust. The bible says, <strong>Psalm 89:14</strong>, <strong>“Righteousness and Justice are the foundations of His throne</strong>”. He is the God of faithfulness, without injustice, good and upright He is. Lawlessness would not require justice and there can be no government without the laws governing their country. <strong>The law is the primary reason we have justice</strong>. If there is no law, what shall justice be based on?\r\n\r\nWe as believers need to crave to be as righteous as He is and bring others in the light of His righteousness. I do not hear much of justice, righteousness, holiness, purity being preached on Christian TV but they are the foundation of His throne and the foundation of our Christianity. God has set a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness, that makes me hunger and thirst more for righteousness <strong>Acts 17:3, \"because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.” Matthew 6:33, “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness\", </strong>Are you hungry and thirsty for His righteousness? Then you and I have to submit to His in prayer, in dying to self, in crucifying the flesh, in submission otherwise we are doomed, then we help others understand the righteousness they need to be saved, Blessings Ev<strong>. </strong>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/romans-chapter-1-study-part-1of12-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Romans Chapter 1 Study, Part 1of12, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/romans-chapter-1-study-part-5of12-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Romans Chapter 1 Study, Part 5of12, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Romans 1:16-17, \"16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. 17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith;…\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of “<b>Power of the gospel</b>” message. Two things I see on vs. 16&amp;17 that are vital, 1). In vs. 16, the gospel is the power of God to salvation, and 2.). in vs. 17 the power of the Gospel reveals the righteousness of God from faith to faith. The first one is for <strong>justification</strong>, the second is for <strong>sanctification</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nSanctification involves more than a mere moral reformation of character, brought about by the power of the truth. It is the work of the Holy Spirit bringing the whole nature more and more under the influences of the new gracious principles implanted in the soul in regeneration<strong>. In other words, sanctification is the carrying on to perfection the work begun in regeneration, and it extends to the whole man</strong>. Perfect sanctification will never be attained in this life for we are still at war in the flesh and we still live in a fallen world.\r\n\r\nPaul the apostle had a miraculous conversion that changed his life completely, the more he walked with God, the more the righteousness of God through the power of the gospel revealed the true condition of his heart. Paul talks extensively about it in<strong> Romans 7</strong>, what was in his heart, his struggle with sin, the desire to do good and not do it, and the urge to do the wrong things. In <strong>Romans 7:18</strong> he throws in the towel by saying, <strong>\" For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find\". </strong>Like Paul, the more I walk with the Lord, the more deceitfulness of my heart are revealed through the righteousness of God, and I see myself in truth. Think about it for a second, when you became born again, your walk with the Lord, did He not begin to show you things in your heart you never imagined to be sins? To some, you may have thought they were too small to be noticed or considered sins; things like little anger, thought life, wandering eyes, hatred, not honoring God like you should, what comes out of your mouth, using His name loosely and in vain, how you treat others (your wife, husband, children etc.)? I mean the list goes on. If you used to lie and not think of it as a big deal, now His righteousness paints a whole new picture. Here is analogy that brings this to light, <i>\"if I lied to a little child, it may not be a big deal; if I lied to my wife, trouble awaits me; if I lied to my boss, I could lose my job; and if I lied to the government; I could go to prison\",</i> see the weight of the lie depends on who you do it to. This is what the righteousness of God does, shows us how so Holy God is and how His holiness exposes our ungodliness.\r\n\r\nThink of it this way, you’ve just dusted the table clean then decided to pull back the curtains to let in the early morning light. To your surprise you see on the table DUST and in air, DUST. The thought that runs through your mind, <i>\"how can this be when you just cleaned the table?</i>\", then you ask yourself this question, did the light create the dust? NO, it simply exposed the dust. That is what the righteousness of God does in our lives too, it draws the curtains of the light of Holy of holies and exposes things in our hearts we never thought were there <strong>and then the Grace of God becomes so AMAZING</strong> that in spite of who we are, He still saved us anyway. It is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith that reveals the condition of our hearts and shows us that there is nothing good in our flesh except Christ in us and through the power of the Holy Spirit helps us to deal with them for our sanctification.

              "<strong>Romans 1:16, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; …\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6119\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image5.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"111\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nI heard a joke on a radio program where the announcer said, “<strong>there is a recall on the sinners prayers</strong>”. Last time I checked, a “recall” was not a good thing. From the announcer,  “the sinner’s prayer” not in the bible has not properly done the job it was meant to do by its inventors (not God). To recall something is an indication that what was released to be used is broken and is not functioning the way it was meant to function by its makers. It has been abused and misused to lead many people to have a false sense of assurance of salvation just because they said the sinner’s prayer. <!--more-->If you look at the lives of such, it is hard to see a change, fruits that accompany salvation (do not want the word, fellowship, pray. They are doing pretty much the same things they should have been saved from etc. then you wonder, did the power of God through the gospel plow their hearts leaving them helpless and defenseless at the cross that God would save them? It is very easy to get a decision for Christ, I can lead so many to make that decision, however, for true conversion, to see people soundly saved, we need to remember “<strong>salvation is of the Lord”. </strong>\r\n\r\nIn the text above, Paul says, “<strong>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation\"</strong>. Paul gives the reason why he is not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. It is the power of God, the great and admirable mystery which has been hidden with God from before the foundation of the world. The gospel, through the agency of the Holy Spirit of God, does what no amount of mere human reasoning or argumentation can do. The gospel compels men to face the reality of their own sin and guilt, the inevitability of divine judgment, and the need for a perfect substitute to make atonement for sin if man is to survive at all. The gospel is the dynamite which blasts away self-righteousness, self-complacency, self-delusion, and sinful self-reliance. Nothing else can do, for nothing else is in itself the <strong>power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes. </strong>So it is not the sinner’s prayer that saves, it is the power of God through the gospel that saves because <strong>Jonah 2:9, “…salvation is of the Lord</strong>”. <strong>John 6:44, \"No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him\" </strong>And the power of God only draws and saves a heart that has been plowed and prepared by His law, <strong>Galatians 3:24, “Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith”, </strong>why?<strong> For “the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul”, Psalms 19:7,</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen I understand that salvation is of the Lord, my job is not to convert people, my job is to be true and faithful witness (preach sin, judgment, righteousness, repentacem faith in God's love demonstrated on the cross). The Lord does the drawing and the saving the reason we should not be ashamed of the gospel of Christ.\r\n\r\nLet me use this analogy, “<strong>God may ask you to push a rock, that does not mean He expects you to move it”</strong>, You and I do the pushing (witnessing to the lost), He does the moving (drawing and saving). When the rock moves, He gets all the credit. That is His power to get the job done. When I witness and someone receives the gospel or rejects it, it is still a win win deal, God is at work. A seed has been planted and at that point my prayer is that God would use the words He placed in my heart to share with the lost and grant them repentance that would lead to salvation. God's Word will not return void. Paul was not ashamed because he knew the power of the gospel was in God and so should we. Lord help us to be bold and faithfully preach the truth, blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/26/his-righteousness-is-your-foundation-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">His Righteousness Is Your Foundation, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/26/clothed-in-righteousness-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Clothed In Righteousness, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/feet-to-bring-the-good-news-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Feet To Bring The Good News, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Isaiah 37:1-14, \"14 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6114\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image3.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nWe live in a time where if anything is going to happen, it will not happen by chance but because there are people praying. When you look at the marriages on the rocks, families in chaos, schools in trouble, the government having challenges, kidnappings left and right, murders, suicides, accidents, you name it is on the rise, how will we stand? There is a constant fear of what might happen even before it happens. Fear of tomorrow cripples majority.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nKing Hezekiah was faced with a situation that threatened him too, the threat was made by Sennacherib, king of Assyria. Now Assyria was known to be a powerful kingdom and they had subdued many nations even breaking their gods. Coming to King Hezekiah, they knew that Judah was protected by God but they tried to bring fear by saying God will not save them from Assyria's attacks. They said <strong>Isaiah 37:10, \"Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, \"Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria\". </strong>This is no different from what the devil whispers in our ears every day. The devil will accuse you of making mistakes with no avenues of a second chances or victories. He could be right that you blew it, but who told the devil our victories are based on what we did? They are based on the One who laid aside His majesty, giving up everything, suffering at the hands of those He had created, taking all the guilt and shame when He died and rose again. Today He has called us His own and He is seated at the right hand of God the Father making intercession for us. He says, \"When you pray, pray in my name\" because He knows how it feels to be lied on. You cannot cry over what could have been and how it could have been, you cannot also continue to plead with the enemy to leave you alone, you need to stand and tell him of who you are in Christ. If he reminds you of your past, remind him of his future. Hezekiah had been told that there was no way God would come to his rescue.  Instead of calling his servants to help him weep, he went to the house of God to pray. You understand what you are going through better than anyone else. You have a better way of expressing and presenting your case as you pray earnestly, constantly, effectively better han anyone else on your behalf.\r\n\r\n<strong>He received bad news but did not take it as the final word</strong>. Whatever the enemy whispers in our ears is not final, God has a final say in every situation. As long as He has not spoken against it, we should continue to bring it to Him. He received the letter, read it and thought, <strong>\"I have to take this to the Lord in prayer</strong>\", <strong>Isaiah 37:14</strong>, \"<strong>and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD\". </strong>Stop covering up what you are going through or trying to fix it in your own strength. Like Hezekiah, take it to the Lord and spread it out as it is in prayer. Remember this hymn <strong>\"What a friend we have in Jesus</strong>? Here are the lyrics\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">What a friend we have in Jesus, All our sins and griefs to bear!</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">What a privilage to carry <strong>Ev'rything to God in prayer!</strong></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Oh, what peace we often forfeit, Oh what needless pain we bear,</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">All because we do not carry,<strong> Ev'rything to God in prayer</strong>!</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\"></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">We should never be discouraged, <strong>Take it to the Lord in prayer</strong>:</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Can we find a friend so faithful Who will all our sorrows share?</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Jesus Knows our every weakness, <strong>Take it to the Lord in prayer</strong>.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\"></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Are we weak and heavy laden, Cumbered with a load of care?</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Precious Saviour, still our refuge; <strong>Take it to the Lord in prayer:</strong></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? <strong>Take it to the Lord in prayer</strong>;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">In His arms He'll take and shield thee; Thou wilt find a solace there.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nJust as Hezekiah refused to take the enemy's word as final, we too can do the same today. You know what your needs are, take it to the Lord in prayer and spread it like it is. Be blessed Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/my-eyes-sees-you-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">My Eyes Sees You, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/lord-teach-us-to-pray-4of7-give-us-this-day-our-daily-bread-part-2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Lord Teach Us to Pray 6of10: Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread, Part 2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/we-give-ourselves-to-prayer-part-4of4-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">We Give Ourselves To Prayer, Part 4of4, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/commend-all-to-god-part-1of2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Commend All To God, Part 1of2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/impotent-made-important-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Impotent Made Important, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Numbers 12:1-16, \"3 Now the man Moses was very humble (meek), more humble than all men who were on the face of the earth\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe game of life is always two sides, the opposing side and the proposing side. Not everyone will agree to one thing equally, there will be some who will oppose it. At times what is allowed to win is what the majority have voted for regardless of whether it is good or bad, true or false. The vastly voted for will be used to silence what it is voted against. When you know what is right, who will stand with you when they have voted against you?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nMiriam and Aaron are Moses’ blood sister and brother. Aaron was appointed by God to be Moses' spokesman and later a priest. Miriam on the other hand was instrumental in keeping Moses safe when a decree was passed that all newly born male children would be killed, she protected her little brother. God did excellent things through the life of Moses.\r\n\r\nWe then see a shift at some point, <strong>Numbers 12:1, \"Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman he had married</strong>\". What constitutes to what is good in your life, must it be approved by people for it to be good? The bible does not say they spoke with Moses or spoke about Moses or spoke for Moses, the bible says they spoke against Moses. They opposed his marriage to someone they did not like, from a tribe they did not approve of. I am puzzled because if God did not want him to marry the Ethiopian woman, God would have rebuked Moses for his actions. At times people want to conform you into what they want you to be and when you do not, they will speak against you. <strong>They do not care much about what is good for you, they care about what is good for them for you</strong>. Everything Moses had done with God’s help worked for them and the Israelites, but now here is someone God brings into his life and these two were against it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 2, \"So they said (Miriam and Aaron), \"Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us also? and the Lord heard it</strong>\". What would you say about this verse? I will point out that according to them, Moses had not done the will of God. Another point, they considered themselves equal to Moses because God had spoken to them too. They became arrogant as they bragged about how the Lord had also spoken to them before. Moses was chosen by God when he did not even see himself as a leader and then given a task bigger than himself. He knew that if he was going to do a good job, God had to be on his side, he therefore humbled himself.\r\n\r\nPoint to make, <strong>Those who are meek do not fight back in life. They learn the secret of surrender and yielding to God as God fights for them</strong>. Note that Moses did not try to defend himself, try to explain even how God might have spoken to him about his marriage. He did not even reason with them because the God who had brought him this far was the only One who could defend him. <strong>Psalm 118:6, \"The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do to me?\". </strong>Those who know their God will not fight things in the flesh, they will surrender it to God.<strong> Numbers 12:3, \"Now the man Moses was very humble (meek), more humble than all men who were on the face of the earth</strong>\". With this line, someone would think that Moses must have been a weak person to allow people to walk all over him, but that is not what it says. The bible says that Moses was meek (humble) which is means HIS STRENGTH WAS UNDER CONTROL. His meekness allowed God to deal with him differently. God spoke to the prophets by visions and dreams but with Moses <strong>vs. 7-8, \"7 Not so with My servant Moses; He is faithful in all My house, 8. \"I speak to him face to face, even plainly, and not in the dark sayings; And he sees the form of the Lord\"</strong>. The manner of relationship God had with Moses was because of his meekness and faithfulness, and God spoke to him face to face. Yahweh’s revelation to Moses was unique. It was direct (plainly) and immediate (face to face); the prophets’ revelations were mediated forms. <strong>The clear lesson is that even prophets cannot presume to claim that their message is equal to that of the scriptures</strong>.<strong>Prophesies do not have the equal authority the bible has. Some prophesies have failed, God’s word has never failed</strong>.\r\n\r\nGod was angry with Miriam and Aaron because of what they said against God's servant Moses. He brought the three of them before Him and He defended Moses that day. Be careful not to speak things against those who God has called. They may speak truth you may not want to hear. You might feel more qualified to do the job better than them but God who appointed them knew what He was doing. God has chosen them for a reason to accomplish things you and I could never accomplish. You do not know what they have to go through to be where they are. Not everyone is on their side but they are chosen. The meek ones are doing God’s work but not for personal gain. Some are under pressure because one day they will give an account to their leadership.

                  "[...] God Defends His Chosen, Evans Olang (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com) Moses was chosen by God when he did not even see himself as a leader and then given a task bigger than himself. He knew that if he was going to do a good job, God had to be on his side, he therefore humbled himself. Point to make, Those who are meek do not fight back in life. They learn the secret of surrender and yielding to God as God fights for them. Note that Moses did not try to defend himself, try to explain even how God might have spoken to him about his marriage. He did not even reason with them because the God who had brought him this far was the only One who could defend him. [...]"

                  "[&#8230;] God Defends His Chosen, Evans Olang (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com) Moses was chosen by God when he did not even see himself as a leader and then given a task bigger than himself. He knew that if he was going to do a good job, God had to be on his side, he therefore humbled himself. Point to make, Those who are meek do not fight back in life. They learn the secret of surrender and yielding to God as God fights for them. Note that Moses did not try to defend himself, try to explain even how God might have spoken to him about his marriage. He did not even reason with them because the God who had brought him this far was the only One who could defend him. [&#8230;]"

              "<strong>Numbers 12:1-16, \"13 So Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, \"Please heal her, O God, I pray\"</strong>\r\n\r\nJust to add from “God Defends His Chosen” message, Yahweh's revelation to Moses was unique. It was direct (plainly) and immediate (face to face); the prophets' revelations were mediated forms. <strong>The clear lesson is that even prophets cannot presume to claim that their message is equal to that of the scriptures</strong>. <strong>Prophesies do not have the equal authority the bible has. Some prophesies have failed, God's word has never failed</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Numbers 12:9, \"So the anger of the Lord was aroused against them, and He departed, vs. 10. \"...suddenly Miriam became leprous, as white as snow\". </strong>In the Old Testament, brazen sin was often punished by God through leprosy. We can conclude that because of what they did, she was cursed. Another incident where I see God defending His servant after he was despised is in <strong>2Samuel 6:14, \"Then David danced before the Lord with all his might...., vs. 16, \"Now as the ark of the Lord came into the City of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked through a window and saw king David leaping and whirling before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart\".</strong> Michal was David's wife who despised David worshipping the Lord when he brought the Ark of the Lord. The Lord was not happy with her and her punishment? in <strong>vs. 23, \"Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death\", </strong>the Lord shut her womb<strong>. </strong>It is clear to me that the Lord cares about people who serve Him in spirit and in truth and in that,<strong> Isaiah 54:17, \"No weapon formed against you (them) shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment, You shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, And their righteousness is from Me\", Says the Lord\".</strong> If you speak or despise someone else who is busy doing the work of God, it will not work. If you are doing what the Lord requires of you, anything that someone else speaks against you or despises you for will not work, for the Lord will defend his own because their righteousness is from Him.\r\n\r\n<strong>Numbers 12:11, \"So Aaron said to Moses, \"Oh, my lord! please do not lay this sin on us, in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned</strong>\". Aaron and Miriam understood their need to ask for forgiveness over their rebellion. Tough to reconcile with someone you have wronged or has wronged yo, but that is where the healing is. <strong>James 5:16, \"Confess your faults one to another, pray for one another that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much</strong>\". Instead of crying to God to do something, they went to the one who they spoke against to reconcile with him that the healing could take place. <strong>Numbers 12:13, \"So Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, \"Please heal her, O God, I pray</strong>\", same Moses spoken against is the same Moses who interceded for his sister's healing. See the humble have mercy and compassion simply because they have received it at one time. They do not hold any grudges against people who wrong them. They are like Stephen who said, <strong>\"Father forgive them, do not hold this against them</strong>\" as he was being stoned to death. Jesus said, \"<strong>Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing</strong>\". Can you and I reach to that place where we cry, \"Father forgive them for doing it whether they meant to or not?\". <strong>The key is to release them, drop the charges and forgive</strong>. Forgive is to let go what you are holding onto. Moses prayer to God was for his sister to be healed and God honored the cry of His servant. Surprisingly enough, there are family members who have been separated for years due to un-forgiveness, not talking to each other, no crossing each other's paths but this is what Jesus said, <strong>Matthew 6:14-15 \"14 For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15,\"But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses</strong>\". Roots of bitterness and un-forgiveness will cause you to continue to have leprosy without being healed. Miriam had to confess and her brother had to cry out to God for her healing. Thank God for men like Moses who forgives and let's go of what he should have been holding on to.

              "<strong>Numbers 20:1-13, “12 Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not believe Me, to hallow Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe challenge we have as believers especially leaders is constantly walking in humility obeying God. The struggles comes when people are pushing you out of God’s will because they want you please them whatever the cost, or sometimes you are punishing God’s people because of their struggles.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, as always, the Israelites complained of lack of water. Moses had been patient with them, always pleading with God for them<strong>. Vs. 6,</strong> <strong>“So Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and they fell on their faces. And the glory of the Lord appeared to them.\" </strong>He and Aaron went before the Lord to intercede for the Israelites as always and vs. <strong>7-9, “7 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 8 “Take the rod; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will yield its water; thus you shall bring water for them out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their animals.” 9 So Moses took the rod from before the Lord as He commanded him”.</strong> God graciously heard their cry and promised to provide with simple instructions, “<strong>speak to the rock</strong>…” and more than that “…<strong>before their eyes</strong>”. This is significant as we will see shortly.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 10, “And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock; and he said to them, “Hear now, you rebels! Must we bring water for you out of this rock?” </strong>Even in the midst of complaints of the Israelites, God always did great things, not because the Israelites were awesome but because God was awesome. Just as He did to demonstrate His power and glory unto Pharaoh, He was destined to do the same with the Israelites through Moses. But <strong>Moses was so disgusted with people that he forgot that the miracle was not about him or the people but about God</strong>. His talk to the people left out the most important person in the miracle, God. When God is left out of the picture only flesh will rise.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 11, “Then Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their animals drank”. </strong>I think this is the tragedy of our day, especially ministers doing things and though they sometimes work, they are still disobedient to God. Just because something works does not mean that is how God intended it for it to work. God will still do things for His own name sake but you will be out of His will . Moses had clear instructions, he failed to execute it, blowing his chances of making it to the promised land even though he had come this far with the Israelites. Paul was doing God’s work and he wanted to make sure he was not living in disobedience especially in preaching the gospel, he says <strong>1Corinthians 9:27, </strong>“<strong>But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified”, </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 12, “Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not believe Me, to hallow Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.”</strong> They did not doubt the power of God, but of His will to meet this need. Maybe they did not want the Israelites to be blessed. “<strong>To Hallow Me</strong>” was to give glory of His power in doing this miracle, and of His truth in punctually fulfilling His promise, and of His goodness in doing it. “...<strong>In the eyes of Israel”</strong> – in spite of the Israelites rebellion, God always left a monument of His work in their midst for His glory.\r\n\r\nThe sin of Moses and Aaron was that they did not hallow God in the miracle. The action robbed God of the glory He could have gained in this opportunity that presented itself. How about you, are you about pleasing people or God?, Are you about answering your own prayer than trusting God to direct you?, Are you distancing yourself from what God wants to do through you in the midst of the rebellion that you wished nothing good would happen to them?, if you are dealing with any of this, then God is robbed of the glory He deserves in your life.

              "<strong>John 6:1-70, \"26 Jesus answered them and said, \"Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled\"</strong>\r\n\r\nSparing people's feelings drives many people not to speak truth in love. Men in general do not take rejection kindly. We try so hard protect our images at times at the expense of not speaking truth. It is easy to speak truth in someone's life when good things are happening, but how about the bad? leaders are careful of speaking the truth because they do not want to lose their congregation. To speak the truth has caused some to dilute the word, coat it or ignore it completely. Speaking the truth has broken some friendships. Despite of it all, we still need to speak the truth in love. \"Speak what I want to hear and I will draw close\" sums up most of our messages today. I am so craving for the truth that if there is something I have been clinging on as the truth and is not, I am ready to abandon it and follow truth. God anoints truth and the truth shall set us free if we are willing to listen to it.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJesus in our text had just fed more than five thousand with less. His question was, “what do you have?” People often complain that they do not have anything to give while in the Lord’s eyes, He has already provided something that He will use to get the job done, but this is a message for another time. Jesus takes a young boy's lunch to feed everyone. He took less did much with it because He was anointed. The interesting thing about feeding of more than five thousand, He gave thanks instead of asking for multiplication. These five small loaves and two small fish did not multiply or even increase in size and numbers. They were the same, the only difference they were not running out as they distributed. He taught them, healed them, accommodated them, led them, comforted them and even fed them. If you had someone who did all these for you in this world, you would want to follow that person right? I would.\r\n\r\nHere is the thing that got me, in as much as Jesus was doing all these, <strong>He wanted His followers to understand that He was more than material provider</strong>.<strong> Luke 19:10, \"For the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost</strong>\". His primary responsibility in this world was to glorify God the Father by seeking to save the lost, the rest became benefits. So we have people who have been fed and sent away. The next day they came again looking for Jesus. They do not find Him where He was the previous day, they sail quite a distance to find Him<strong>, John 6:25, \"And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, \"Rabbi, when did You come here?\" </strong>Spoiled people who found a Person to follow and have their needs met. At one point even Jesus knew they would try and force Him to be their king simply because of what they could gain by following Him. Sadly enough, there are people who seek the Lord or ask other people to seek the Lord on their behalf not over who He is but what they can get from Him. It's like saying, \"I don't really want to serve Him, I just want Him to provide for my needs\". \"As long as my needs are met, I will be on my way and when I run out, I will seek Him again\".\r\n\r\n<strong>John 6:26, \"Jesus answered them and said, \"Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled</strong>\". Jesus pointed the truth they needed to hear, the reason for following Him. He had a big congregation, speaking this truth of course would impact His congregation and many if not all would possibly leave Him. The point I need to highlight and make it clear, <strong>JESUS WAS NOT ABOUT FAME BUT TRUTH.</strong> <strong>John 1:17, “For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ</strong>”. He begins to teach them about the spiritual bread and we know majority were offended for the sake of the word and because they did not get what they came for. <strong>John 6:66, \"From that time many of <em>His disciples</em> went back and walked with Him no more\". </strong>They had an opportunity to be cleansed from wrong motives but they chose to walk away because the truth was too hard to swallow. What is the truth about God’s kingdom, <strong>Romans 14:17, “For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit</strong>”. Truth is like salt applied to a wound, it is painful but it heals if it remains.\r\n\r\nWhy are you following Christ or why are you seeking Him? is it because of what you can gain from Him? What is truth to you? is it easy for you to hear it and desire a change or would the truth put you off? Would you care about the fame at the expense of not telling the truth? We have a choice. <strong>The word of truth Jesus spoke stole away his fame in that city but we know He was not about the fame but the truth</strong>. It is all about Him<strong>. John 14:6, \"I am ...the truth...\". </strong>Lord I want to serve You for who you are and I want to walk in Your truth<strong>, Psalm 25: 4-5, “4 Show me Your ways, O LORD; Teach me Your paths. 5 Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation; On You I wait all the day”. </strong>Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/the-testimony-of-god-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Testimony Of God, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/identified-with-despised-christ-part-1of3-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Identified With Despised Christ, Part 1of3, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/25/ambassadors-for-christ-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Ambassadors For Christ, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Isaiah 48:17, \"Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, The Holy One of Israel: \"I am the LORD your God, Who teaches you to profit, Who leads you by the way you should go.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile Jesus was here on earth, He was also referred to as Rabbi (Teacher). As we know the work of a teacher is to impart knowledge and skills to his students to prepare them to become whatever they need to be once the teacher is gone. Teachers give their students the necessary tools for their day to day life and preparation of what is to come. If taught, the teacher can only give guidance and answer questions and not live lives for his students.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Isaiah 48:17</strong> first tells us who is speaking (the Lord), to whom He is speaking to (the redeemed), who He is and His message. It is very important to know who is speaking otherwise we become exposed to errors and mistakes. Often times you hear, \"<i>The Lord told me\"</i>, the real question, did you really hear the Lord speak or was that your imagination?, there is safety in hearing the voice of God through His Word. He never disappoints.\r\n\r\nHe is our redeemer, thank God we cannot redeem ourselves neither can He teach us how to. This is His job, glory be to Him. He reminds us that He is the Holy One of Israel and our God. The next line says, “...<strong>Who teaches you to profit,” ... </strong>Redeeming part is His job, \"to profit\" He teaches us how to. Mark that it does not say \"WHO MAKES YOU\" but \"TEACHES YOU\". God may provide a job for you but He expects you to work in that Job because there is profit in working hard, <strong>Proverbs 14:23, says \"In all labor there is a profit</strong>\". God blesses more when what He has entrusted you with is put to work. <strong>Ecclesiastes 2:24, \"Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God\". </strong>Laziness cripples, and Paul who was a hard worker says, \"<strong>whoever does not work should not eat</strong>\". <strong>Do not do a poor job just because you don't like being where you are</strong>, <strong>there is a profit in being faithful</strong>. <strong>Profit is an advantageous gain on an investment. </strong>You invest your time, resources, skills, ideas, and you will be channeling yourself for blessings from the Lord. Right where you are, ask God to teach you how to multiply, to be the best in what you do, leading you in the way you should go. Are you profiting in your job, in your family, in your church or are you just putting time? <strong>Where you want to get to has everything to do with how you handle where you are now</strong>.\r\n\r\nInstead of David praying \"GIVE ME\", you hear him pray mostly \"TEACH ME\". Giving is not as profitable as teaching. Giving may be for a season, teaching remains with you. <strong>Psalm 25:4, \"Show me Your ways, O LORD; Teach me Your paths\", Psalm 119:66, \"Teach me good judgment and knowledge\", Psalm 119:68, \"Teach me Your statutes\", Psalm 143:10, \"Teach me to do Your will\". David understood that being taught would be more beneficial to him; he would take the teaching and put it to work to bring profit and gain, leading the glory back to the Teacher who imparted those teachings in him. </strong>Jesus had to teach His disciples to carry on with the work He had started. He called them (redeemed them), provided for them for some time, shielded them from dangers for a while and taught them to profit in every area. And we know what they did in advancing the kingdom of God by His Spirit.\r\n\r\nAre you expecting God to give you what He has provided means for already? Hoping for money to fall from heaven, companion coming from nowhere, being approached with a position etc.? Ask Him to teach you what to do with what He has provided, then ask Him for grace and strength to do it and give Him all the glory for what He has done as the Teacher.

              "<strong>2Timothy 4:2, \"Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching</strong>\"\r\n\r\nPaul reached churches through his preaching and his writings, when it came to Timothy, he had special place for him. He took time to invest truth in him as he journeyed with the Lord. In <b>2Timothy 4</b>, sounded like Paul’s journey on earth was coming to an end, and he takes time to impart in Timothy to what I would call the last words. People are intrigued by other people’s last words before they pass. I have read last words of some famous people and they left me thinking.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf I was to sum up Paul’s last words to Timothy I would say he told him to “<strong>Preach the word in season and out of season</strong>”, in other words, preach Christ as He is at all times without addition or subtraction from the word. He knew Timothy would face trying times which could be means to push him to dilute the word or manipulate it for the sake of people. Paul encouraged him to “<strong>preach the word</strong>” popular or not. His duty was to please the Lord and not people. Paul Washer says, “<em>We should have seeker friendly churches”</em> but that is “<em>church seeking for God</em>”. Majority in our generation equate success with whether something works. If you are successful in it, and can draw crowd, eloquent etc then a pass is given. If that is the case, then as Paris Reidhead said, men like Jeremiah and Noah would be considered failures. Jeremiah preached many years and I do not recall him having any converts, Noah preached the same, he had only his family as converts. In the eyes of many, they may have failed but not according to God, He was pleased because they preached His word.\r\n\r\nI am concerned for what many preachers teach on today. Many years ago I went to a church where they drunk anointing oil. I was still new in Christ and too naive to figure out it was not scriptural. Thereafter in still learning I was listening to men’s teachings that sounded very scriptural until some men of God pointed me to the word to see the truth. Not long after, I began to test the spirits, listen carefully to some teachings and not too quick to receive any word just because it was preached or taught in Jesus name. This why we need to discern, not every one who uses the name of the Lord is of the Lord. I am now very careful not to listen to every kind of preacher just because they may be preacher celebrity and can pull great crowds. All I want to know, are they preaching the word as it is. <strong>1Thessalonians 5:21, “Test all things; hold fast what is good”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2Timothy 4:3, “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers;”</strong> We live in those times where people do not want to hear sound doctrine (teachings). They go about looking for preachers who will preach what they want to hear. They run from one conference to another, move from one church to another. They love preaching about life enhancement and hate any preaching on sin, law, righteousness, holiness, judgment, self denial, faithful endurance and hell. I believe that there should be a balance including preaching on prosperity, healing, deliverance, callings, reaching the lost. With my constant meeting with the unsaved, I understand why people do not care for the sound doctrine. Infact the line I hear a lot is, <i>“I am comfortable with my own sets of beliefs”.</i> People throw out what is good (the truth) because it does not make them comfortable, they would rather live a lie than be exposed. If you are comfortable in your own sets of beliefs, you will either try to find someone who can support what you believe or get grounded in what you believe. It begins with salvation, the late Keith Green puts it beautifully,<em> “It’s better for someone to be afraid that they are NOT saved and TRULY be saved, than someone to THINK they are saved and they AREN’T. it’s better to have a salvation you are doubting than to have NO salvation that you are SURE of\". </em>See Paul is saying that it will be according to their own desires and having people who will preach what they purpose to hear. I will not be surprised if in some churches the preacher will only preach on what the people who give more money hint to them what they should preach on.\r\n\r\nThe time is now that we need to be careful of what we hear, what we take in, what we apply. We do not want to live in error, we do not want to go by false prophesies. We do not want to be deceived and we do not want to live a lie. Paul said, “<strong>Preach the word”, not</strong> to others only but to yourself. I would rather have the total package that deals with everything from the word of God whether it be easy or hard TO RECEIVE. If there be something not right in my life, I want to preach to myself, be convicted of it and change. Paul gave Tim the total package <strong>2Timothy 4:2, “Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching (doctrine</strong>)”. Blessings Ev, His servant"

              "<strong>Ephesians 4:32, “And be kind to one another, …”</strong>\r\n\r\nKindness is rare in our world today. It is rare where we work, on the roads with motorists, at times with parents and kids, husbands and wives. Less or no kindness in the department stores. There are a few people I am scared of dealing with, they are not kind at all. Have you been somewhere seeking help only to be rude to? or your presence was not noticed at all, you received a lousy service? I have. How about on the phone? Giving the best service hoping that in return you get one right there or some other time it does not happen? I tend to hear this line a lot, “What’s the point of being kind when you don’t get it in return”. Can’t even smile at anyone because of what they did to you. Kindness does not look at who is right or wrong, it looks for opportunities to make a difference in a person’s life.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Kindness is having feelings befitting our common nature</strong>. It is also showing tenderness or goodness, being considerate and helpful. Why do we have a world where people will want to help you only when you have serious needs but on a day to day basis, that’s hard? You can give money to charity but cannot help your colleague who needs help to accomplish one thing for the day in your department. Seeking small help but put on hold for hours because it was not very necessary to help you at that time. It does disturb me to be in a position not to face certain people because you already know who they are and their character. Facing them means, either you will come back miserable or be given a look or a comment that makes you wonder why you had to be there to seek their help in the first place. <strong>Kindness is not about what you can gain out of a situation but an opportunity to lighten someone’s day</strong>. Someone might not need a help from you but a soft answer is an act of kindness. The bible says in Proverbs, that a soft answer turns away wrath. <strong>Ephesians 4:29, “Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for the necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers”. </strong>I do not see the need why one should be kind to someone in their presence only to speak evil of them behind their back. If you stepped in to help, help with a true heart, desiring to do it because you know it is the right thing to do. When you walk to a department store and you see something on the floor, picking it up and putting it on the shelf is an act of kindness. I know we can have this thought, \"why should I when someone is paid to pick it up, I am just a customer” We many times make things complicated for nothing. <strong>Proverbs 19:22, “What is desired in a man is kindness…</strong>”, what a way to summarize what people out there need. <strong>Proverbs 31:26</strong> talks about a virtues woman as a woman who on her tongue is the law of kindness.\r\n\r\nKindness also goes with appreciation. It is good to appreciate someone who has done good job. Giving honor where honor is due. It is a terrible thing to snatch things and leave. If someone does something for you even if it is their job description or deserve it, it is good to be kind and appreciate their good work, thank them. This is an encouragement that their work is not taken in vain. I have been learning more on the art of kindness and how it affects people. Some time ago I took time to send kind words to everyone in my department, highlighting each one’s strength, abilities and how those have impacted me as a worker. Those words really touched each of them, and made a difference. <strong>Kind words softens the heart and makes the heart merry</strong>. How often do you and I take time to appreciate someone, say kind words for having helped not just people who went out of their way but even people who did what they were suppose to do?\r\n\r\nWhatever we do, we do it unto the Lord, <strong>2Peter 1:7, “to godliness brotherly kindness, and brotherly kindness love”</strong>. It is a good thing to be kind to all manner of people everywhere. It may not be a big deal to you but the person who receives it values and cherishes it. That is what Paul is telling us, <strong>Ephesians 4:32, “And be kind to one another, tender hearted, …”</strong>. Note that he is not giving guidelines as to which type of people in what type of circumstances. Any time you are dealing with any type of person, exercise your act of kindness. It could be a smile, act of service, soft answer, good directions, stepping out of your way to give a hand etc. You never know what kind of impact you could be making in someone’s life. They may be having a terrible day and you could change their day by your act of kindness. I know of people who cannot even greet you, go out of your way and greet them. Do it unto others before they do it unto you, make compliments without complicating things, send notes to them or their bosses to appreciate their good work. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 28:6, “He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nPicture this, you are at a restaurant and the bill has just been handed to you. As you open your wallet or purse, you notice that it is empty. This would not be good. Empty hopes, empty promises, empty dreams, empty homes, and dare I say some seem to relate to those with empty minds. When one thinks of empty things, there is usually negativity attached to it. Emptiness usually speaks of something finished, over, void, etc.... The first time the term empty was used in the Scriptures it referred to the earth being <strong>\"formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters</strong>.\" Emptiness was present, but so was the Spirit of God!.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLet's fast forward to the time of Jesus, where emptiness was the greatest word that could have filled the air<strong>. \"The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay</strong>.\" Upon seeing where Jesus' body had been placed by Joseph of Arimathea, they saw emptiness. The angel said it, but Jesus would confirm His words concerning the empty tomb. <strong>\"So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them.\" Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThis empty tomb is what all of Christianity hinges upon, an empty tomb! Paul said, <strong>\"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith (1Corinthians. 15:14).</strong>\" All of Christianity hinges on this one time, occurrence, namely the empty tomb, hence the resurrection. If Jesus didn't rise from the dead then all of Christianity is dead, and deserves to be buried in a tomb never to be thought of again! We should not believe because someone told us to, because we have to believe in something, or even out of tradition. We should believe or disbelieve based on truth. After all who wants to believe a lie? However if the empty tomb is still speaking today of the truth of Christ's resurrection, we should embrace it, and worship Him and the risen Lord and Savior, because he defeated death, hell, and the grave, paying the penalty for the law that we broke. Is the empty tomb the biggest hoax in history or the great truth of all time? It is one or the other, and all must decide which side they are on, because in reality one’s life depends upon the empty tomb. <strong>If Jesus didn't rise then God is a liar and we are all still in our sins, and our preaching and faith is in vain. If the dead are not raised, \"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\"\r\n</strong>\r\nThe empty tomb speaks of fulfilled promises of prophecy, restored dreams, transcendent truth, peaceful patience, and future hope. Yes my whole life hinges on Christ's resurrection, I don't want to be religious, but rather right (a follower of absolute truth). Can you say with full that your faith is hinged upon emptiness, the truth of the empty tomb. If so then pass your faith on, for neither your faith nor your labor is in vain. Until the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil ;&lt;;"

              "<strong>Matthew 17:27, “….go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you.”</strong>\n\nI hate being in debt, and I believe everyone does too. I do not like owing anyone, <strong>Romans 13:8</strong>, says, “<strong>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another:</strong>” To me this is a clear indication that even God hates to see His children in debt. That is why he had to do something about our sin debt, the reason we pray <strong>Matthew 6:12, “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors”(NIV)</strong>. <!--more-->\nWho in their right mind would want to owe someone else? And yet we find that we are debtors to other people. The most common debt of our day is financial debt. We owe the credit card companies, car payments, appliances, accumulated electrical and gas bills etc. I believe with all my heart that debt can be a disease that needs to be cured before it destroys a Christian. Some bring this disease upon themselves by being careless and misusing the resources God has provided to them and to some, life circumstances force them there.\n\nIn <strong>Matthew 17</strong>, it happened that Peter and Jesus owed the temple taxes. The bible says the wealth of the wicked is stored for God’s children right? How come Jesus knowing about this still was liable for taxes? Does not the bible say, “<strong>the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness of it?</strong>”, This is for our learning. Yes we are the children of God and God provides for us but He will not let us ignore our responsibility to others (government, companies, those we owe).\n\nJesus turns to Peter and says, “<strong>“….go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you</strong>.” Here is what got me, instead of Jesus calling money into existence and Peter taking to use to pay taxes, He gives him an instruction that is mind blowing. Backing up to <strong>Mathew 15</strong>, Jesus fed 4,000 with seven loaves of bread and few little fish. Why could He not perform a miracle right there to clear up this debt? Why is it that we have Christians in debt who do not want to do anything about it? They are sitting and doing nothing hoping that God will perform a miracle right before their eyes and their debts will disappear. I know God can and we know of some people who have experienced it but we cannot limit God to one method of helping us deal with our problems. Is it not clear that if we owe, we should find a way to pay it back? And our prayer is Lord provide away, we want to owe man nothing. Jesus provides and Peter had a job to do and here is what he had to do, GO, CAST, TAKE, OPEN, FIND, GIVE. God can provide away for you to minimize or clear up your debt, not by calling money into existence but by leading you places to fish. He can provide by creating more work that would require overtime if they pay overtime. You may be required to take a part time job because that is what he has set a side as a way to provide for you. You have to go an extra mile with His help. Peter had to do the same, yes Jesus provided yet in a way Peter’s other abilities were required. Now Jesus did not ask Peter to do an impossible task, He already took care of the need. He asked him to do what He knew He could give him strength to perform. What are you doing to pay your debts? Are you praying, Lord provide away then going an extra mile to fulfill what He has provided or are you doing nothing, less or just enough hoping it will go away? If you pray Lord provide away, don’t be surprised to hear GO, CAST, TAKE, OPEN, FIND, GIVE. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 8:31, “What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest struggles in our days is to have someone you can trust. Experiences has caused people to be skeptic when it deals with trust issue. Trust is very fragile. Someone said, \"<i>it is easy to mend broken love than broken trust.\"</i><!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Joshua 5:13, “And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, “Are You for us or for our adversaries?”</strong> It is very important to know who is on your side and who is not. The reason is simple, he who is on your side believes in you and the ability you have. He knows who you and how best to assist you do the right thing. In this text, Joshua is about to go to battle, he sees a Man (the Lord appeared as a man) ready for battle. What a comfort to know that the person whom you thought was against you is not but for you. It is away to say I have come because You need me.\r\n\r\nTwo things to bring to our attention that sound a like, have almost identical words but have different meanings because of the words arrangements, \"GOD BE FOR US\" and \"GOD BEFORE US\". <strong>Romans 8:31, “What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</strong> I rub into people who behave as though the Lord was against them. It is disturbing to me because I understand that whoever is against you aims to destroy you by all means. I believe that the reason why some people think this way is because they called on God for something but He never came through for them or God allowed them to go through something. To them that was a sign of God being against them. Suppose we asked our earthly father to do something and he did not, does that mean he is against us? he is for us, meaning he is on our side looking out for our well being.\r\n\r\nThe bible says, “<strong>If God be for us”</strong> which is interesting because I was hoping that it would say “When God is for us”. Had the bible used “WHEN” that would imply that God is not ready yet \"to be for us\". It would suggest He is in the process of being ready. For sure we know God is always ready. The word “IF” drops the ball in our court because we are the ones who should be ready for \"God to be for us\". Joshua understood this concept because there was a Man (God) who came ready ready to be on someone’s side and that was Joshua’s. So it was Joshua who needed to be ready for Him to be for them. We have God on our side friends always but we have to be ready for Him to be for us.\r\n\r\nNow we tackle \"GOD BEFORE US\". This is the challenging one because it calls for us taking a back seat. “God be for us” just means He is on our side but God before us means that not only is He on our side, He is also in control leading (Lord). <strong>Joshua 5:14, “So He said, “No, but as a Commander of the army of the Lord I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshipped, and said to Him, “What does my Lord say to His servant?” </strong>It is easy to have “God for us” but the most important thing is to have “God before us”. The Man who appeared came in as Commander and we know commanders take leads and give orders. With this understanding, not only did Joshua let Him to be for them, he also stepped aside for Him to go before them. He knew that the man was for them and not against them for He says I have come. Can you trust Him enough to be for you and go before you? <strong>Proverbs 3:5, “Trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not on thy own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths</strong>”, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Joshua 5:13-15, “13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, “ Are You for us or for our adversaries?” 14 So He said, “No, but as Commander of the army of the LORD I have now come.”And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and said to Him, “What does my Lord say to His servant?” 15 Then the Commander of the LORD’s army said to Joshua, “Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.” And Joshua did so.”</strong>\n\nOn the night of Israel’s attack on Jericho, Joshua personally surveyed the area surrounding the city, inspecting the fortress walls. As the military leader of Israel, Joshua was strategizing by examining up the situation set before him. The words “he looked up” convey that Joshua was surprised. “A man” is what Joshua thought he was seeing, but subsequent events reveal that it was no ordinary man. <!--more-->\nThe man’s “drawn sword” was symbolic of God’s participation in the coming battle. When he saw the man standing there ready for combat it provoked Joshua to inquire whether he was friend or foe. Joshua needed to find out whose side this man was on, could he be trusted; would he help or hinder Joshua’s military operation? These were important questions that he needed answers for.\n\nThe stranger’s response put everything in proper perspective. God is the sovereign leader. It is never a question whether God is on our side but whether we are on God’s side. This is a perspective to take into each of our situation. Do not try to fit God in your will, but pray “Thy will be done” and in doing so “My will be gone.” The stranger came as “captain of the host of the LORD “; Joshua therefore was to be subservient to him.\n\nThough he does not reappear in the story of the conquest, the stranger was a heavenly being who fought behind the scenes in the spiritual realm. His presence showed a sign that the Lord was the real military leader of the Conquest. Many identify this person as the angel of the Lord, while others cannot distinguish him from the Lord himself (as in <strong>Exodus 3:2-4:17; Judges 6:11-23</strong>) this captain of the host was the leader of the army (host) of heaven. He didn’t say that he was a captain, but THE CAPTAIN! I don’t know about you but that sounds to me like the words of my Jesus. Why do I say this?, because the name of Jesus is significant, as the Grecized (Greek) form of “Joshua” is “Jesus.” Joshua was perhaps in charge, militarily of the army of Israel, but the Captain of the host was leader of the entire angelic host. Stay with me now. This reminds me of what Jesus said in <strong>Matthew 25:53</strong> in the context of Jesus talking about power when Peter cut off the ear of the soldier. Jesus then makes the statement “<strong>Do you not think that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? \"</strong>A full Roman legion was six thousand men, and Jesus perhaps was conveying that he could call to His assistance. Perhaps one legion for Jesus and one for each of the eleven disciples if He so chose to. But Jesus was fighting a spiritual battle not a physical one. This was more than the eyes of faith seeing help as in <strong>2Kings 6:17 </strong>but the knowledge that help was available, yet He refused to use it, unlike perhaps most of us would have done, because He was laying His life down for final victory (<strong>John 10:18)</strong>.\n\nThough “Joshua fell facedown,” we cannot be sure that he realized he was in the presence of a supernatural being. In that culture, a persons would prostrate themselves before anyone in authority. Moreover, when Joshua said “Lord,” he used the Hebrew word ‘Adoni which was used to address human beings. He did not use the divine name “Yahweh,” which is translated “LORD” in English, written with small capitals. This encounter was not to impart commands but to inspire Joshua with humility and reverence and to instill in him the confidence that God was with him and He was really in control of the battle. So many times we try to be the captain of the battle, and yet we cannot just sit on our hands, but the real captain is Jesus, The Captain of the hosts.\n\nApplication: Do you seek to be in the presence of the Captain, or are you trying to fight life’s battles with your own physical power. Remember spiritual battles cannot be won by physical means. Blessings Pastor Phil"

It does not mean you are not content, it means you are opened to everything the Lord would have to do in your life for His glory. So you trust God to do spectacular things as you are in the expectation mode. We all have things we are expecting from the Lord and we are placing it all in God’s able hands to see us through as we move to greater dimensions. I don't know about you but I am expecting God to teach me to thrive.<!--more--></p><p>When God called Jeremiah, He had something great stored for him of course with God in mind. Jeremiah did not even know it but God did. God designed him for a job He had set aside till the right time. The first encouragement God gives him we read in <strong>Jeremiah 1:5, “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations</strong>.” <strong>Do you know that God did not have an idea of what to do with your life after He made you? He made you because He had an idea of what to do with your life.</strong> Four things for our processing, <strong>1. God knew us, 2. God formed us, 3. God sanctified us, 4. God ordained us</strong>. <strong>Mark the order because the order is important</strong>. In every step you see God (knowing, forming, sanctifying, ordaining). Everything and every step changes but God does not change. <strong>The only way Jeremiah would thrive was to go through the changes in the hands of God who changes not</strong>. God knows us better than we know ourselves. What we feel we are unable to accomplish because of who are and think of ourselves does not change His plans for our destiny. You may say like Jeremiah, “<strong>I cannot speak because I am but a child (weak, immature</strong>)”. Hear what the Lord is saying in vs. <strong>“7 do not say, \"I'm only a child\"(NIV), </strong>in other words, do not speak about what you think of yourself though true, speak of what I have told you about yourself. If we are going to thrive, we have to set aside what we think and feel about ourselves to operate on what God has told us about us in His WORD. If we can grasp this concept, then we are ready for the next move of God<strong>. Vs. “9 Then the LORD reached out His hand and touched my mouth and said to me, \"Now, I have put my words in your mouth”. </strong>God took him from what he thought of himself to how He knew him, formed him, sanctified him and ordained him to be what He had called him to be. He then empowered him by placing His words in him by touching his mouth. The next move, vs. <strong>“10 See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant, (NIV). </strong>Who can be appointed if they have nothing in them to accompany that appointment? God has empowered us through His word, then appointed us for a task that requires that empowerment. To thrive we will have to uproot, tear, destroy and overthrow everything that tries to set itself high against the knowledge God has placed in us about us. Anything that tries to go above what God has told us about us has to go for they are a hindrance to our building and planting. He has given us the power to uproot, tear, destroy, overthrow, build and plant. We can thrive because He is teaching us how to.</p><p>Let this coming year 2013 be a year that we all thrive to greater levels as we say, \"<strong>Lord hold us close and teach us so that we can thrive\". </strong>We want to make steady progress, we want to prosper, we want to flourish, and we want to grow stronger because all these are what thriving means however, we do it with God as the center of it all.

              "<strong>Isaiah 6:1-8, vs. \"8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: “Whom shall I send, And who will go or Us?”Then I said, “Here am I! Send me.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn preparation for calling Isaiah to be the prophet, he would proclaim the coming judgment. God gave him a vision of His majestic holiness so overwhelming that it devastated him and made him realize his own sinfulness.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs, \"4 And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke. 5 So I said: “Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips …”</strong> It is interesting to read that Isaiah did not have a warm fussy feelings about a loving gentle God even though God is loving and gentle. He saw the posts of the door shaken by the voice that terrified him, but nothing terrified him, I believe, like his sin made clear by the holiness of God. Think of it this way, you are dusting your table in the morning, it appears very clean after you dust it, then you open the windows for the early morning sunlight to come in. To your horror, you see dust on the table you just cleaned, and you see dust in the air. Would you say the light created dust? Of course not, the light merely exposed what the natural eyes could not see. Isaiah’s experience is similar as if the Lord pulled the curtain of the holy of holies and allowed him to see the sin (dust) in his life.\r\n\r\nHave we seen our deep sins to cry “<strong>Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips”?</strong> The question we need to ask ourselves is, is sin a disease or a crime? Most of us consider sin as a disease, God considers it a crime. Would you call yourself wretched (meaning a person of great hardship, deprivation, and hopelessness)? Many believers believe they are sinners but have never had the curtains of the holy of holies pulled back to show them their deepest darkness so that they can see how wretched they are. We sing it in the hymn Amazing grace  “…<strong> that saved a Wretch like me</strong>“, easy to sing what we don’t mean/understand. These are the things that wake us up to our condition and especially to the condition of the ungodly. If we found ourselves hopeless having seen our sins with no way of escape until God saved us, how can we assume and be comfortable that the lost will find away out unless we become the witness of what we have seen and experienced? Woe is me, I am a man of unclean lips says Isaiah and vs. 5, “…<strong>And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, The LORD of hosts\". </strong>Here is a man who was shown his condition, instead of looking at others first, he decides to start with himself and right there and then he begins to think of the fate of those who like him. Having seen the King, the Lord of hosts and did not die shows how the goodness of God preserved him.\r\n\r\nAt this point he is not only concerned for himself, he is also concerned for the people around him.<strong> 2Corinthians 5:11, “Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men;”. </strong>Isaiah’s vision made him painfully aware of his sin and broke him, in this way God would prepare him for<strong> his cleansing</strong> and<strong> his commission.</strong> If we are convinced by our own thoughts that God is all loving and will accept everyone, there would be no drive to change and be used. When we learn the terror of the Lord from our own experience with the Lord, it will ignite something in us to hunger for cleansing and have a deep desire and passion to warn those who are lost and bring them to the saving knowledge and grace of Jesus Christ. I am undone, because I, Evans I am a man of unclean lips, may the Lord continue to awaken me and others. To finish blessings Ev"

              "<strong></strong><strong>Isaiah 6:1-8, vs. \"8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: “Whom shall I send, And who will go for Us?”Then I said, “Here am I! Send me.”</strong>\r\n\r\nWho is the man of unclean lips, it is one who has given the Lord the lip service but the heart is far away. We Sang songs with our lips but did not honor the Lord with our actions making our lips unworthy. If the angels who I would consider more holy than man could gaze upon the Lord and cover their faces because of His holiness, how much more should we fear God and reverence in His presence? None of us comes even close. At least those who are saved are better off yet we still fall short of God’s glory. What about the lost souls? To quote<strong> Matthew Henry, ” Those who are to teach others the knowledge of God ought to be well acquainted with Him themselves</strong>”<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI am a sinner; particularly, I have offended in word; and who is there that has not? We are unworthy and unfit to take God’s name into our lips. With what a pure lip did the angels praise God! “But,” says the prophet, “<strong>I cannot praise him so, for I am a man of unclean lips.’ </strong>The impurity of our lips ought to be the grief of our souls, for by our words we shall be justified or condemned. It is by the lips man curses God, uses His name as a curse word. Here is a man slain by the holiness of God, to have this experience, his thought could have been, “why didn’t the holiness of God slay me when He saw the sin in my life?” I ask myself this question many times.\r\n\r\n<strong>Holiness is not what God does but who He is</strong>. God’s holiness is not tainted or corrupted. His character will not let Him turn blind eye to sin and let people go free. Because of His goodness, He will serve justice. He has done everything to rescue man from His wrath and by repentance towards Himself and faith in His Son, He will save.<strong> “God’s holiness demands that all sin be punished, but God’s love provides the plan and way of redemption for sinful man”, Billy Graham.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. \"6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from the altar. 7 And he touched my mouth with it, and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, And your sin purged.” </strong>The live coal directly to Isaiah’s mouth was a symbolic act of forgiveness.<strong> This action suggests that no painless cure exists for sin</strong>. Nevertheless, forgiveness came from God, not from the burning coal. Only God can forgive sin.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. \"8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: “Whom shall I send, And who will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here<em> am</em> I! Send me.”</strong> How could he keep this experience to himself? I believe that even before the Lord asked who would go for them (Us), Isaiah was ready.<strong> HE SAW THE LORD, THEN HE SAW HIMSELF, THEN SAW THE NEED AND ANSWERED TO THE CALL.</strong>\r\n\r\nHow can we therefore tell people HOW to be saved before we tell them WHY they need to be saved? For them to see the Lord, we have to take them through the moral law. <strong>God reveals Himself in the spirituality of His law</strong>.<strong> That is where His righteousness and perfect purity of character are revealed for men to learn it there</strong>. When they cry out “I am undone\", then we give them grace. Why tell a sinner “God loves them and has a wonderful plan for their lives” when in actuality God is angry with sinners daily? Are we not supposed to be witnesses? Meaning we share what we have seen, heard and experienced? Why try to change the message unless we have not experienced it ourselves or ignorant of it.\r\n\r\nThose who have such an experience will have a new appreciation for grace. We sing Amazing grace and so are the lost and many times it appears to both sides as just another hymn with nice melody. How about we revisit the lyrics and bring us back to what it meant to be in sin and appreciate the words more and then turn and show sinners who God is. When they see who God is in His laws, they will see themselves in themselves undone and in need of a Savior and when they have been converted, they too will answer to the call. Let us to cry out to God for passion and compassion then respond to His call. If you are lukewarm, may an Isaiah’s experience awaken you. I challenge you to pray then get up, get out and this month witness to at least ONE lost soul as a start if you are not already sharing. Let us redeem the time for the days are evil.<strong> “Here am I! Send me.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Meditate on the words: <strong>Amazing Grace (How sweet the sound), That sav’d a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see. ‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, And grace my fears reliev’d; How precious did that grace appear, The hour I first believ’d.</strong> Blessings Ev</em>"

              "<strong>1Kings 18:21-43, “41 Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.” 42 So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, 43 and said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” And seven times he said, “Go again.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/memo.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6032\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/memo.png?w=300\" alt=\"memo\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nOne disappointing thing I experienced in school was writing an essay only to be told I missed the whole point. All the work done, hours spent in writing only to miss the whole point. If you were to be asked to write a report or an essay about the year we just concluded, would you miss the whole point in reflecting about your life and what you encountered? When I missed the point, the only way to escape it was to do it again and get it right. If you missed the whole point of last year in your life and its challenges, you may have to repeat the class in the new year, I hope you do not.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nElijah in <strong>1Kings</strong> proclaims a drought for three years. This began a series of miracles to demonstrate to the people who the true God is. There was Yahweh the Almighty God and Baal additional false gods the Israelites were worshipping. Israelites had mixed worship of both, moving away from serving the only God to serving other gods alongside Almighty God. They did not deny God; they denied serving Him whole-heartedly. During the drought, Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal in the presence of all the Israelites <strong>1Kings 18:21, “And Elijah came to all the people, and said, “How long will you falter between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him”. </strong>\r\n\r\nThe past year was a year of drought for a number too and I believe it came about to remind people who God is and turn to Him. I believe most people still missed the whole point by their speech and actions. I do not recall many people drawing to God or even calling on God. This drought had been a reminder that things people hold onto firmly like finances can tank in hours, days, weeks or even months. It had been a reminder, and while it was a drought that affected us mostly physically; I would say it was also an avenue by which God would use to bring about a spiritual hunger for Him.\r\n\r\nIf you were to write an essay about last year for yourself, what would you say? In my case I would say it was a very enriching year for me spiritually in regards to praying effectively, being in the word, teaching. Yes, it was a very difficult year for us with sicknesses, some family setbacks and deaths in the family, but I did not miss the dynamics brought about by the drought. It has been a pruning process and the pruning can be hard and painful but the results are amazing.\r\n\r\nIt is in the drought that God demonstrated to the Israelites that He was the only true God to be worshipped and trusted. It is in the drought that God demonstrated to the people that faith of one man, standing firm righteously can make a change when their trust is the Lord. It is in the drought that God demonstrated that He could sustain; He sustained both Elijah and Zeraphath woman as recorded. It is in the drought that they saw God. Reflect on how God worked in your life in the drought and project the new year by faith. To continue. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Kings 18:21-43, “41 Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.” 42 So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, 43 and said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” And seven times he said, “Go again.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/law-and-grace3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6030\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/law-and-grace3.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Law-and-grace\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIn talking about drought in the last year, who would not want the rain of God’s blessings in this new year? Ahab and the people expected that Elijah would, in this solemn assembly, bless the land, and pray for rain; but he had something else to do first. The people must be brought to repent and reform, and then they may look for the removal of the judgment, but not until then.\r\n\r\nI am always amazed how majority of televangelist tell us to claim and receive blessings, but rarely do we hear about restoring and reforming things lost and bent out of shape. Building what it will take to maintain blessings. <strong>No one pours precious stuff in leaking vessels, it will all leak out</strong>.<!--more--> You have to restore the vessel, repair it first. We need our character and integrity built to sustain and retain the blessings brought about by God. How often do we pray to God to build our character, integrity, give wisdom, teach us patience, desiring preparation to be good stewards? It is easy to ask for blessings with nothing to sustain them. Listen to what Elijah did in preparation to what God was going to do, <strong>1Kings 18:30, “Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.”… And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down</strong>”. Instead of Elijah doing something new, he repaired the old the Israelites had left broken to seek other things. You may have left the ways by which to be blessed and sought other ways. You may have run from one conference to another; trying to work your way through things yourself; waiting for someone to have a word from the Lord for you. We have to go back to the foundation, Prayer and the Word, they are the means by which we are restored (repaired)\r\n\r\nWhile others are looking for the new sensations, new fads, new experiences, new feelings, extra biblical manifestations, I believe God is bringing His people back to the basics; where the lost direction is restored. In repairing the altar of the Lord broken down, Paul encourages believers in <strong>Romans 12:1 </strong>by saying, “<strong>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service</strong>”. The repaired altar is for a sacrifice that is pleasing to the Lord. You may have been damaged by sin, damaged by drought; fear, doubt, depression etc., instead of seeking God for something new, why not seek the Lord to repair you again for His service. No one is beyond repair.\r\n\r\nMy prayer,<em> “God do not send your rain of blessings until you have repaired me first</em>”, I do not want blessings poured in a leaking vessel, it will not retain it. I desire of the Lord that my life will be presented to Him a living sacrifice for His service. A life consecrated for His work. More displaying His glory. Giving Him what is right rather than what is left. I would desire for you and myself this year more of spiritual blessings, it begins with repair. What are you trusting God for this year? Are you open to repair? Then it is time to report to the Lord’s workshop in <strong>Jeremiah 18</strong>. To continue. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Kings 18:21-43, “41 Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.” 42 So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, 43 and said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” And seven times he said, “Go again.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/law-and-grace2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6028\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/law-and-grace2.jpg\" alt=\"Law-and-grace\" width=\"284\" height=\"177\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIn reforming the Israelites by first rebuilding the broken altar, Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal and Asherah to prove to the entire crowd the true God. Fire fell on Elijah’s sacrifice upon seeking God. Note the order, before God showered them with blessings, Elijah offered an excellent sacrifice that pleased the Lord. We seek to please God first (<strong>Psalm 103:1, Matthew 6:33)</strong> while we trust God to shower us with blessings too. Let us give Him what He requires of us.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAbel and Cain offered sacrifices to God. God had respect for Abel’s sacrifice rejecting Cain’s. God did not leave them to figure out what He desired of them, He told them what was pleasing to Him. Here is how we know, <strong>Genesis 4:6-7, “6 Then the LORD said to Cain, \"Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? 7 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted?\"(NIV</strong>). Abel offered his sacrifice by faith so did Elijah and God had respect for both sacrifices. We need to learn more and more what the Lord requires and offer it by faith. How to please the Lord is revealed and instructed in His Word, it is then fueled and powered by faith in God.<strong> Romans 10:17, “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe see that upon demonstrating the true God to all, Elijah ordered the false prophets be destroyed at his command. This prepared the way for what the Lord was about to do. Back in the day, false prophets were killed if their prophesies did not come true. As Matthew Henry says, “<em>Israel being thus far reformed acknowledged the Lord to be God, and had consented to the execution of Baal’s prophets, that they might not seduce them anymore, though this was far short of a thorough reformation, yet it was so far accepted that God thereupon opened the windows of heaven, and poured out blessings</em>.”\r\n\r\nElijah sent Ahab to eat and drink, for joy that God had now accepted his works, and that rain was coming. It was time to rejoice for the Lord was about to release His blessings. And Elijah, by faith, heard the sound of abundance of rain. He retired himself to pray while waiting for the rain by faith. He cast himself down on his knees upon the earth, in token of humility, reverence, and importunity, and put his face between his knees. He ordered his servant to bring him notice as soon as he discerned a cloud arising. Six times his servant went to check and six times he brought no good news. Elijah continued to pray not losing faith because God had promised. \"<i>Though the answer of our fervent and believing supplications may not come quickly, yet we must continue instant in prayer and not faint nor desist; for at the end it shall speak and not lie.</i><b><i>\"</i></b>\r\n\r\nGod wills then waits for His people to respond in prayers. God had promised Elijah drought would end however Elijah had a job to do, pray the blessing through. Those who desire the abundance of rain will have faith, seek God fervently in prayer, and patiently wait until He has moved. Those who do this would have no room for discouragement, for they will understand they are in God’s perfect will, <strong>1Thessalonian 5:16-18, \"16 Rejoice always, 17 pray without ceasing, 18 in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you\", </strong>To finish, Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/the-sound-of-abundance-of-rain-part-1of4-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sound Of Abundance Of Rain, Part 1of4, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/the-best-is-yet-to-come-part-2of2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Is Yet To Come, Part 2of2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>1Kings 18:21-43, “41 Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.” 42 So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, 43 and said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” And seven times he said, “Go again.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/law-and-grace1.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6024 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/law-and-grace1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Law-and-grace\" width=\"300\" height=\"189\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIt is hard to understand God’s ways but He sure can be trusted. I do not think Elijah expected the blessing of the rain to delay, after all, he called on God earlier for fire and from heaven it immediately came. Waiting for the rain appeared to be taking long. He could not doubt God’s Word to make it happen. He had enough trust in God to take Him at His Word. <strong>Numbers 23:19, “God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?\", Romans 3:4, “…let God be true but every man a liar”. </strong>When you know God’s ways rather than His works, you can choose to trust when it does not make sense, when it is not clear or even when things seem delayed. God can be trusted.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLike Elijah, I hear the sound of abundance of rain in this year, the reason I am on my knees praying. I have no idea what kind of rain God will send my way or when, but I will continue to trust Him even when I do not understand. We see Elijah sending his servant to check on the promised rain 6 times. Who knows if his servant wondered, “<i>What is the use of checking on something that is not there”</i>. On the seventh time, Elijah gets a report of , \"<b>I see a</b><strong> cloud as small as a man’s hands in the rising from the sea</strong>”. Imagine for a second the man of God expecting abundance of rain to fall on the land, after several checking it yields a small cloud like man’s hands. He was not discouraged; he knew God had answered his prayers. It was small yet significant. The little is the confirmation he needed.\r\n\r\nGreat blessings often arise from small beginnings, and showers of plenty from a cloud of a span long. Let us therefore never despise the days of small things, but hope and wait for great things from it. Small beginnings are like seeds; they do not look much but have potential of producing much. It is with the little that we see and thank God for, we trust as it unfolds while we grow in it and through it.\r\n\r\nI am learning more and more that it is not when you have it all together that you move or when you see the big picture that you act. It is in the process of taking those small steps day by day that the Lord unfolds what He is doing and wants to do in your life. <strong>Ecclesiastes 11:4, “He who observes the wind will not sow, And he who regards the clouds will not reap</strong>”. You make those small steps by faith having fireproofed your faith through prayer and the word.\r\n\r\nWhile some are promising that it is going to be a great year (as they always do every year), I would say it could be a great year if we heed to God’s call. Let us go back to basics, prayer and the word; may God repair those who need repairing; May we remember God wills then waits. Elijah told Ahab to run home for it was going to rain and it did. Summary on the series is <strong>2Chronicles 7:14, “if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land”. </strong>God can be trusted; He never fails.

              "<strong>Matthew 9:20-22, \"And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile many look forward to the New Year, a number make resolutions for the New Year only to fail early due to human efforts. Instead of making resolutions, I prefer making declarations for the New Year. I commit these declarations to God knowing they are possible through Him. <!--more-->What amazes me about starting the New Year is the fact that we are all anticipating a victorious, glorious year. You hear it said or even preached that \"this New Year is going to be a greater than the previous year\", that's not always the case. Ask yourself, was the previous year more great than the year before that? If we were to evaluate each year and be honest with ourselves, some would say nothing or very little has changed. If anything, things may have become worse compared to the previous years. You then have great expectations for the New Year, only to discover dealing with the same issues you dealt with in the previous year. Very discouraging but not hopeless.\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with the story of the woman with the issue of blood. Her name is not given to us for it is not important to the revelation of the text, however the bible takes time to tell us of her condition of 12 years. Like some of us, perhaps each year she expected her condition to get better but each time it got worse. She was losing blood every year, she tried to do all she could to improve her condition, not even once in those years did it happen.<strong> Mark 5:26, </strong>says she<strong> \"... had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was not better, but rather grew worse\". </strong>I am not sure if she looked forward to a New Year, I would not if I was in her condition especially for many years and growing worse. She tried it all, spent it all, worked it all to get better in vain. It is not a surprise if I heard that somebody spent money on books, programs, counselors and the like to get things better in their marriage, raising children, finances, breaking out of a habit and more and still found that none of those worked. So what happens, should you fall back on what you dealt with the previous year and see the same happening in this new year? Every good thing she would have loved in her life could not take place because of her condition.\r\n\r\n<strong>Anyone with an issue of blood cannot get pregnant</strong>, they cannot hold what they should hold. You were considered unclean if you had an issue of blood. There could be no fellowship or relationship for that matter. If you have an issue, chances are, you cannot hold fellowship, relationships, the word of God, prayers, witnessing, enthusiasm for the things of God the way you want to because you are bleeding. Things that would get you pregnant with destiny are aborted before time leaving you frustrated year after year. You try to do your best only to find that you are not going anywhere, if anything your condition is getting worse. Can we carry the same issues again in this New Year? I do n't think so. I do not want to deal with the same issues I dealt with in last year in this New Year, this is a year with new beginnings. Last year is gone, we are committing the new year in the hands of God. The enemy of our soul knows where we are today, however I want us to service him with a notice, “<strong>do not look for us in the same place tomorrow, we have moved, God is radically changing the course of our destiny</strong>”. I leave us with this question, before we try and get pregnant with destiny (hopes and dreams of growth and blessings etc.), do we have issues of blood to deal with? To continue Blessings, Ev,\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/i-am-not-where-i-was-part-2of2-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">I Am Not Where I Was, Part 2of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/the-sound-of-abundance-of-rain-part-1of4-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sound Of Abundance Of Rain, Part 1of4, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/the-sound-of-abundance-of-rain-part-2of4-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sound Of Abundance Of Rain, Part 2of4, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/31/teach-us-to-thrive-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Teach Us To Thrive, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/the-sound-of-abundance-of-rain-part-4of4-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sound Of Abundance Of Rain, Part 4of4, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Matthew 9:20-22, \"And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment\" </strong>\r\n\r\nAs we looked at the woman with the issue of blood in Part 1, we could glean some principles from her story and apply it to our lives as we start a New Year.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Be a Jesus seeker: This woman in the midst of her situation became a Jesus seeker. She made it upon herself to find Jesus</strong>. <strong>Mathew 9:20, \"And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment\".</strong> She decided to make a quick move before the opportunity passed her by.<!--more--> It was either now or never. If you and I are going to make it this year, we must be like this woman who sought Jesus to be made whole. <strong>It is one thing to desire, it is another thing to do something about it</strong>. <strong>Deuteronomy 4:29, \"But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul\". </strong>Do not wait for people to seek the Lord for you, be initiative, wait on God. This woman had no time to seek special help from people for her condition, <strong>she knew who to call on, the reason she moved swiftly</strong>. You seek the Lord and you will find Him. She did not care to see Him or talk to Him all she cared was a taste of what He had, the healing virtue. May we crave for a glimpse of what He has as the beginning and continue for a greater measure of His presence.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Be your own best encourager:</strong>.<strong> vs. 21, \"For she said within herself, If I may but touch the hem of His garment, I shall be made whole</strong>\". If you have tried everything and failed, <strong>it takes a greater faith to attempt the impossible</strong>. Jesus had spoken to many, touched them and healed them, for this woman, her faith was just to touch what He is wearing, enough to make her whole. This faith did not just come about, she had to do something about it, and she became her best encourager. <strong>Faith is boosted when encouragement comes in</strong>. It is good to have people encourage you, however, it is better to build your own foundation of encouragement. \"I will make it despite what the enemy brings my way; I am determined not to remain in the same place forever. I may fall, stumble, or even cry but I will still make it because I know that He has something I do not have. If I can just but touch Him, I will never be the same again”.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Your yesterday cannot not shape your tomorrow:</strong> Her yesterday could not help her get where she was going. She had every reason to sit and cry over the past and how it could have turned out. At times, you have to dry your tears over those who frustrated you and/or things that stood on the way and realize the Lord is not done with you yet. He is doing a new thing. Paul encourages himself by saying in<strong> Philippians 3:13... but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead</strong>\". The fact you and I are still here shows there are things that are destined to be deposited in the womb of our spirits that cannot be negated by yesterdays' issues. Yes there are a lot that had passed her by and blessings that seemed seriously delayed by her condition yet in it she understood that <strong>\"Behold Christ makes all things new\". Your tomorrow can be vibrant if your past is buried from haunting you</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Have hope and faith to make it:</strong> Regardless of who she was, she still had hope and faith to make it<strong>. Anyone can believe God when things are going the right way or you can see how things will turn out. It takes a greater faith to believe God in the midst of hopelessness</strong>. Faith in God can move mighty mountains, as EM Bound said, “<strong>Faith gives birth to prayer, and grows stronger, strikes deeper, rises higher, in the struggles and wrestling of mighty petitioning</strong>”. That is what she had at the very hour of her hopelessness. She did not just believe and sit there, she put her faith to work by seeking to touch the hem of His garment.<strong> James 2:26, \"...for faith without works is dead also</strong>\"\r\n\r\nWe have an awesome opportunity to grow in the Lord this year. Refuse therefore to be where you were yesterday, move and let everyone know if you must, saying something like this, \"I am not where I was, do not look for me on my yesterday's issues and failures. <strong>I moved on, God has dealt with my issues and now can make me pregnant with His call and destiny. He is growing me in every aspect of my life</strong>\".

              "<strong>Daniel 10:12, \"Then he said to me, \"Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words.</strong>\r\n\r\nWe live in time where everything is needed in a hurry. Talk about fast food restaurants, you drop in and get what you want, how you want it and fast. If the process is delayed even a little, frustrations are noticed. We cannot work with God in the same manner, His times are not our times. God sees far beyond what you and I see in the natural and knows what is best. You have to keep on knocking, seeking, asking. It is God's way or no way as simple as that.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nGod's seasons are not at your beck. If the first stroke of the flint does not bring forth the fire, you must strike again. God will hear prayer, but He may not answer at the time which we in our minds have appointed; He will reveal Himself to our seeking hearts, but not just when and where we have settled in our own expectations. Hence the need of perseverance and importunity in supplication. <strong>Prayer is not to change God, prayer is to change us.</strong>\r\n\r\nDaniel set himself to pray and fast for three weeks when he saw a vision that needed interpretation. Here is a man who knew what he needed to do and set himself to do it. He knew it would cost him to get results but he still set himself anyway. Are you always waiting for someone to pray for you or have you learnt like Daniel to set yourself to pray? Pray without ceasing add fasting to strengthen your prayers and see what God will do. Fast as a reminder is not a way to say “Lord see what I am doing” but rather, “Lord you are better than all, I demonstrate it by fasting”. This is about passion. Daniel's prayer reached the first day and answered, however there was the prince of air blocking and delaying the messenger from bringing the answer to him. There was a delay but Daniel kept on seeking, knocking, asking while the heaven was in motion breaking through the barriers. When the bible says in <strong>1Thessalonians 5:17, \"Pray without ceasing</strong>\", that does not mean, <strong>\"pray without stopping</strong>\", it indicates, \"<strong>pray without giving up</strong>\".\r\n\r\nIn the days of flint and steel and brimstone matches we had to strike and strike again, dozens of times, before we could get a spark to live in the tinder; and we were thankful enough if we succeeded at last. At times we stopped but did not give up. Shall we not be as persevering and hopeful as to heavenly things? We have more certainty of success in this business than we had with our flint and steel, for we have God's promises at our back. “<i>Never let us despair. God's time for mercy will come; yea, it has come, if our time for believing has arrived. Ask in faith nothing wavering; but never cease from petitioning because the King delays to reply. Strike the steel again. Make the sparks fly and have your tinder ready; you will get a light before long”</i>, Charles Spurgeon. Daniel the man of God did, we too need to.

              "<strong>Zechariah 7:4-5, “4</strong> <strong>Then the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying, 5 Say to all the people of the land, and to the priests: ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months during those seventy years, did you really fast for Me—for Me?</strong>\r\n\r\nBy definition, fast means to abstain from food for a period of time. This is a discipline practiced by believers, not as an end in itself (severity), but as a sign of repentance in seeking God. In the Scriptures, people fasted when under chastening, under judgment, to seek God's will, for victory over the enemy, for deliverance, for purity before the Lord, as part of sorrow for sin. Fasting is connected in scripture with times of distress example, <strong>2Chronicles 20:3-4</strong>,<strong> \"And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. 4 So Judah gathered together to ask help from the LORD; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD\". </strong>While all these is true, I believe they are benefits to fasting. There is a greater reason we should fast as I will share.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->First of all, fasting is not hunger strike and cannot be used to manipulate God to get us what we want, its greatest reason in my judgment is for us to demonstrate to God how worthy He is, that He is more important than anything else. Fasting is a means toward spiritual focus by concentrating on God rather than on food and other personal needs. The bible says, “<strong>man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God”</strong>. <strong>Job 23:12, “I have not departed from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food”</strong>. <strong>This again is not a way to show how worthy man is but rather how worthy God is.</strong>\r\n\r\nFasting is never commanded, it is going an extra mile. It is giving the Lord what is right rather than what is left. We are commanded to \"<strong>pray without ceasing,\" \"praying always, with all prayer and supplication,\", \"watch and pray,\". </strong>Think of the time the Jews came to Jesus and asked, <strong>\"Your disciples don't fast! Why?</strong>\" Jesus had an interesting response, He said, \"<strong>When the bridegroom is with you, you don't fast\". </strong>In other words, this was not a time to fast, it was a time of joy. Jesus was telling us that fasting is a unique experience that is identified with times of grief, and sorrow, and pain, and isolation, and loneliness, and fear--<strong>those kinds of times that would not exist while we were walking around in the presence of Jesus Christ</strong>. For this reason, fasting is vital, it helps you build spiritual muscles. It teaches you spiritual discipline. Fasting lets you know what God is able to do; if He gives you grace to fast, He can also make ways. Fasting help us remember the spiritual resources of God that sustained you when you did not have much, and the remembrance should drive you and I to focus more on the Lord. Fasting can also help us remember and identify with those around us who are poor and hungry. All these points us back to God who is worthy of all the attention.\r\n\r\nJesus in teaching about fast in <strong>Matthew 6:16-18</strong>, said, <strong>“16 Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, 18 so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who <em>is </em>in the secret <em>place; </em>and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly</strong>”. Jesus made sure His hearers understood that fasting was <strong>not to be made a subject of display</strong> but a delight to God.\r\n\r\n<i>\"Since it is not a command, we can learn from others who fasted<strong>. </strong>Let me highlight at least 3.<strong> 1. A Regular Fast (Jesus Fast 40 days) - </strong>Traditionally, a regular fast means refraining from eating all food. Most people still drink water or juice during a regular fast. When Jesus fasted in the desert, the Bible says, \"<strong>After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry</strong>.\" This verse does not mention Jesus being thirsty. 2. <strong>A Partial Fast (Daniel Fast, 21 days)- </strong>This type of fast generally refers to omitting a specific meal from your diet or refraining from certain types of foods. <strong>Daniel 10:2-3 says, \"At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks. I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over</strong>.\" In <strong>Daniel 1:12, </strong>they chose to restrict their diet to vegetables and water:<strong>, </strong>they said,<strong> \"Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.\" 3. A Full Fast (Paul, Esther, David fast 3 days), </strong>these fasts are complete - no food and no drink. <strong>Acts 9:9 </strong>describes when Paul went on a full fast for three days following his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus: <strong>\"For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything</strong>.\" Esther also called for this type of fast in <strong>Esther 4:15-16: \"Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: 'Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish</strong>'\" \" It is recommended that this type of fast be done with extreme caution and not for extended periods of time</i>\"\r\n\r\nSo when we fast, we fast for God. We demonstrate how worthy He is over everything else including our necessities, food in particular. The rest are benefits to fasting, icing on the cake. May the Lord help us revisit why we fast and set our priorities straight with Him as the center.

              "<strong>Ephesians 1:15-16, “15 Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, 16 do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers”</strong>\r\n\r\nWhenever we talk about prayers, multitudes approach it differently. Most people pray for provisions, protection, and guidance over their lives and their loved ones. I’ve been taking a closer look at how Paul and the other disciples prayed and it amazes me how their prayer priorities are not so much common with us today when we pray. What you pray for the most reveals where you heart is. If blessings is what is more important to you, that is where you will concentrate your prayers.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nNow a man like Paul had a style of praying that I find very effective. His desire from looking at his kind of prayer suggest he had in mind <strong>Matthew 6:33, “But seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness…”. </strong>He tells us what the kingdom of God is not and what it is, <strong>Romans 14:17-18, “17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit 18, For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by man”. </strong>Having established what the kingdom of God is, he could seek God’s kingdom knowing what it entailed; <strong>righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit</strong>. Paul desired to know Christ more than anything else. He could pray for others along the same lines.\r\n\r\nPaul in his writings mentions the word pray or prayer 44 times, that is how vital it was to him. If Paul depended on prayers, what about us? “<em>There is no man who is bigger than his prayer life”</em>Leonard Ravenhill, but the question is, what do you pray for? Prayer is more than what we desire of God in terms of blessings. <strong>“</strong><em>Prayer has everything to do with molding the soul into the image of God, and has everything to do with enhancing and enlarging the measure of divine grace. It has everything to do with bringing the soul into complete communion with God. It has everything to do with enriching, broadening and maturing the soul’s experience with God</em>”, E. M Bound\r\n\r\nLooking at Paul’s prayers, you will see that he was not praying to prosper materially, or to be safe from his enemies, or to have a big ministry or any of those things. He encourages the Ephesians to constantly be in prayer and then he gives them his own prayer request, <strong>Ephesians 6:18, </strong>vs. 18 encouraging the Ephesians to pray always<strong> and vs. \"19 and for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel, vs. 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak”. </strong>Is this not similar to the prayers of Peter and John in <strong>Acts 4:29-30</strong> who prayed, “19 <strong>Now, Lord, look on their threats and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word, 30 by stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy servant Jesus”. </strong>They prayed for Spiritual blessings so as to stand for the Lord and fulfill His call in their lives\r\n\r\nListen to Paul’s prayer to the Ephesians in <strong>Ephesians 1:15-16, “Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, 16 do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers</strong>” what did he pray for?<em> 1. He asked God to give them the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him <strong>(vs. 17).</strong> 2. He asked God to open the eyes their understanding and be enlightened so that they would know what is the hope of His calling, the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints <strong>(vs. 18)</strong> 3. He prayed that they would know the exceeding greatness of His power towards those (us) who believed according to the working of His mighty power <strong>(vs. 19).</strong></em> These are some of the things Paul prayed for himself and others<strong>.</strong> <strong>Philippians 3:8-10, “8 …I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; 10 that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death”</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat do you treasure the most when you pray? Is that a driving force to cause you to pray for what you treasure? I desire more and more to make <strong>Ephesians 1</strong> the desire, passion, and zeal for my prayers as a means to know Christ and attain spiritual blessings. To seek His kingdom first and His righteousness, to be bold in reaching others, the rest will fall in place.

              "<strong>Numbers 13:1-33, \"30 Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, \"Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it\"</strong>\r\n\r\nTo the Only Wise God Our Savior who has led us to see another New Year. How do we view this New Year and walk in it? Allow me to share some encouraging principles as we move forward. I hope you find some truth to assist you in this journey that only God can bring us through.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI am occasionally asked what kind of resolutions I make for the New Year. I hate making resolutions, they tend to backfire; instead I prefer making statements. Resolutions often times goes by one's effort, statements in my world is putting it in someone's hands I have proven faithful to carry it through me. God's Resume looks good and outshines every ones. Tell me who has a good Resume and I will show you who has THE BEST Resume, He has done so much we cannot tell it all. Resolutions are good, they embark on determination but statements are better because they are the acts of declaring. I cannot make a statement on my own but I now can because of who God is.\r\n\r\n<strong>The number 1 principle: Spy this New Year, SPY THE LAND, see opportunities to grow and progress. Numbers 13:1-2, \"1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 2, \"Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel...\".</strong> Spy the possibilities of growing deeper and stronger in the Lord in comparison to last year. From day one to this very moment, God had promised the Israelites the land of Canaan. It was described as a land flowing with milk and honey, it had abundance of figs, dates, and nuts. It was a well-established land, but why did they have to spy it when they were already told what was there? Perhaps to prove to the Israelites that God meant what He said. Moses sent 12 spies , he said <strong>vs. 17-18, \"17 Go up this way into the south, and go up the mountains 18, and see what the land is like: whether the people who dwell it are strong or weak, few or many...”. </strong>Another possible reason for sending the spies into the land was to see if there were obstacles or not. Yes Moses tells them to check if the land is rich or poor, however Moses was already aware of the richness of the land. One thing was missing, God did not share with them of obstacles. This is where the 12 spies will bring the message of Canaan's richness and obstacles. <strong>Spying the land is not to discourage you from going forward but to prepare you how to get there.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Number 2 principle: GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE LAND YOU ARE SPYING. Numbers 13:26, \"Now they departed and came back to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness...they brought back a word ... and showed them the fruit.”</strong>. The 12 men brought back words and a taste of the fruitfulness of the land. <strong>Vs.</strong> <strong>27, \"They told him, ...\" we went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with milk and honey, and this is it's fruit</strong>\". Here comes the obstacle, <strong>vs. 28. \"Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong and the cities are fortified and very large</strong>\". Can you imagine people's first reaction when they heard about the abundance of the land? I believe they were very excited. What melted their hearts was hearing of the obstacles in the land, fortified cities and giants. <strong>The entire team of 12 people spoke of the richness of the land, 10 added the reality of the obstacles</strong>. Would you rather go by 2 people's reports or 10? Gathering info about the land is to assist us in deciding if we still embark on the mission or terminate it.\r\n\r\nI have shared on 2 principles, I will continue in the next message with additional principles. I want us to know that we can make it with God in this New Year. We can be the channel by which He will glorify Himself when He brings us through facing giants in our lands as He provides for us according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus (<strong>Philippians 4:20</strong>). Its greatness will depend on your confession on who you rely on. Whose report will you believe?

              "<strong>Numbers 13:1-33, \"30 Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, \"Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe bible says that as a man thinks in his heart so is he. <strong>Many times we speak what we see. What we see indeed can be a fact but believers are not called to live by facts but by faith</strong>. In our story, the fact is, there were giants in the land of Canaan, however the truth was<strong>, God had given them the land regardless of the facts. <!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nYes the Israelites looked like grasshoppers before the Canaanites; however they needed to look at who was with them. If the people of Canaan would have also seen them, they would have looked like grasshoppers before the children of Israel simply because God with them was way bigger than the giants. If you are going to face this year in your own strength and abilities, be ready for disappointments, there are great obstacles. But when you choose to face it with God on your side, then what is set before you will not be an issue for God is about God in your situation. This Year will present you with its giants but GOD. \"<strong>They that know their God shall do exploits</strong>\". You have to know who Your God is and His capabilities to make it in this year.\r\n\r\n<strong>Number 3. principle: GOD MUST BE GOD IN YOUR JOURNEY AND</strong> <strong>WE MUST HAVE FAITH IN HIM. Numbers 13:30, \"Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, \"Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it\". </strong>The name Caleb means a slave or a dog. Even with such name, he is a man of God, he has seen God in action many times and whatever they are about to face is not a march to God. His advice, \"<strong>Let us go at once and take possession</strong>\", no time to waste even as we have started the year. Conquerors make every move when they know the time has come. If you saw the giants in the land already, do not be discouraged because we are able to overcome them. This is not for those who are going by feelings but by faith. <strong>Faith negates the facts. The obstacles present cannot be compared to the possessions God has in store for us</strong>. Different reports came in but only 2 had the report the Lord had for His people. Things may be looking tough and complicated, and it may not look like we will make it, but God who is able has encouraged us to move in and make it. <strong>Ephesians 3:20, \"Now unto Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think, according to the power that works within us\". The power of Christ working within us is propelling us to attempt the impossible because He has made us more than conquerors</strong>. We can only conquer what God has already conquered. God will not tell you to do something without His help. If He said do it, know that its been done. Whose report shall you believe?\r\n\r\n<strong>Number 4. principle: THE FOCUSS ON VICTORY MUST BE FOR GOD’S GLORY. Numbers 14:1, \"So all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night... complained against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, \"if only we had died in the land of Egypt!\"</strong> It is very easy to forget all the miracles that have happened when you are faced with new obstacles. Looking back at where you came from can bring a temporary relief and desire. God has brought us this far not to take us back but to move us forward. We are climbing from glory to glory. We have gone too far to go back, too deep to turn around and go back. A strategy is needed to fight through and make it to the other side. <strong>What will make you change how you see things is by checking your thoughts, confessions and actions. </strong>Caleb's thought was<strong> \"victory\",</strong> his confession<strong>, \"we are able\", </strong>his action was<strong>, \"let's move in at once and take possession\"</strong>. He is associated with many complainers but his faith in God is not shaken by that.\r\n\r\nIn this whole story, the reason for their move and victory is not primarily because of the Israelites but about God. 10 spies were going to rob God of the glory He would gain through them simply because what they saw, and even discouraging others from doing the same. Caleb and Joshua on the other hand had God’s great name on the line the reason they would take God at His word. God said <strong>Exodus 7: 3, “And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt”. </strong>God is in the business of demonstrating He is God for His own glory.\r\n\r\nI pray that the spirit that was in Caleb be in us that what we see will not stop us from attaining what the Lord has for us. <strong>God’s name thrives in the midst of impossible situations, that is where He displays much of His glory. God is about making much of Himself through those who He has chosen, for God is for God.</strong> \"WE ARE ABLE FOR GOD IS ABLE\".

              "<strong>Hebrews 13:8, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever \"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe \"Faith Flavors We Favor\" in Today’s Christianity: How Good and Godly are they? By faith flavors we favor, I mean, for example, denominations, churches, doctrines, teachings, personalities, preachers etc. we favor preaching and practicing the opposite of the true Faith. <strong>Faith flavors we favor are a constant confusion for sinners to be won for Christ and for saints to be edified by them (nourished) in the Church of Jesus Christ. <!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nThe faith flavors are so many and ubiquitous these days that it’s no longer an easy task to decide what to believe and who to follow or which church or denomination to belong to or follow. Do we really need all the numerous and confusing faith flavors in order to know God? I mean the flavors, most of which are, made out of our own recipes? It seems like the original Christian message recipe has been changed to something more appealing to human appetite and sensation but certainly not godly. We have a lot of people and churches who, even though they confess Christ and are in ministry, have a form of godliness and they deny the power of God. Should true believers be part of such?\r\n\r\nWho changed the Gospel recipe anyway? Has it ever been necessary, advisable or permissible to change the original faith recipe which was formulated, established, practiced and proclaimed first, by Jesus Christ, the author and finisher of our faith and then by the Apostles and also by great men and women of the Faith who have stuck to the original Gospel message which is the only \"faith flavor\" found in the Bible? Isn’t the Bible God’s absolute, authentic, and infallible recipe for Salvation of all mankind from original sin and all sinfulness and evil in the world today? Why so much deviation?\r\n\r\nThe today’s \"<strong>faith flavors we favor\" </strong>seems desirable, delightful and delicious to many but, are they divine? What about purity: Are they pure? Are they safe? Are they humanly engineered or God ordained? Are the \"<strong>faith flavors we favor\"</strong> preachers and crusaders motivated by their own personal agenda or are they obeying the Lord’s commission to preach the only one acceptable and holy flavor of faith: faith in Christ Jesus, God the Father and the Holy Spirit as the only way to be reconciled to God in order to escape eternal damnation in hell and live eternally with God in Heaven?\r\n\r\nWhy is Christianity today so powerless, confusing and corrupt? Christianity cannot be powerful and pure if its message is impure. When the Gospel is corrupted by human theology, ideology, philosophy, mythology, belief, and worldliness etc., Christianity and the Church can no longer remain pure. Hence, Christianity ceases to be truly Christianity birthing Christ’s Church, because God is holy and pure and cannot be associated with evil, corruption and unrighteousness.\r\n\r\nChristianity should not come in many flavors and be preferred like flavored Ice Cream; true Christianity comes in one flavor and teaches that taking up individual Cross and following the Christ of the Cross who is also the founder and defender of the Christian faith is the only option for experiencing true Christianity. Such experience follows salvation by faith.<strong> For by grace are ye saved through faith, and not by your own righteousness earned by good works or by obedience to the Law. “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever (Hebrews 13:8) and Christianity which He founded is the same, too, yesterday, today and forever. Which flavor or whose flavor would you rather have? </strong>What flavor are you offering? Think about these things. Don’t’ be fooled, coned or manipulated into believing and following man-made church, religion, or philosophy. Follow Christ. God bless<strong>! By Boaz</strong>"

                  "Hi, thanks for your thoughts.  My impression is that these faith flavours originate through the insecurity of the preacher. The resolution comes through our security in Christ.  I was visiting Latvia recently and a young believer told me that each time he went to a different church he was told that this church was the only one with the right way to God.  He was quite confused.  It seems like the various church leaders were unable to comprehend that Jesus is bigger than their local church, or their theology. They are left making themselves the answer, and through insecurity setting themselves up as the ideal.  This is a dangerous place!  Thankfully our Lord and saviour really is the saviour of His church.  Though people suffer through such insecurity, hopefully there are those who are thrown back to the Scriptures to discover what is really true."

              "<strong>2Corinthians 12:9, “… My grace is sufficient for you……”</strong>\n\n<i>“Amazing grace, how sweet that sounds that saved a wretch like me, I once was lost but now I am found. Was blind but now I see</i>”. What so amazing about grace that John Newton the hymn writer had to write about it?. “What’s so amazing about grace?”\n\nThe good news of the New Testament is God’s acceptance of us by grace ALONE through faith. The word “GRACE” in Hebrew are hesed and hen which means undeserved LOVE and FAVOR . <strong>God is love, and grace is the out flowing of His love toward undeserving sinners</strong>. Grace is love in action. <strong>“For God so loved the world that He gave (action word)…” John 3:16. </strong>Our salvation is secured because of the favor of God.<strong> Ephesians 2:8-9, “ 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast”</strong>.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWhile many believe in salvation by works or grace plus works, the truth of the matter is, there is nothing that one can do or add to salvation. Think of it this way, if you passed out, what ability do you have to resuscitate yourself? Absolutely zero ability. Your revival is purely in the hands of Him that is reviving you and and you respond to the resuscitation. Of course the response is not your doing also but His doing and He gets all the credit. The bible says that a man cannot come to the Lord unless he is drawn of the Father, <strong>John 6:44.</strong> So we need to be reminded that we have been saved by the grace of God, grace fought for us in the courts of law when the judgment had been passed that we were guilty deserving death <strong>Romans 6:23.</strong> Were it not for grace and mercy, we would still be dead in sin.\n\nThe other aspect of grace is sustaining us in salvation. <strong>2Corinthians 12:9, “But He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, my strength is made perfect in weakness”.</strong> This is a message that came to Paul when He was going through something he did not understand. He had no proper words to describe it, he called it a thorn in the flesh. The bible says that he prayed three times that it would be removed, instead of God removing it, He gave him grace to endure. The amazing grace will cause you to endure hardship, making you comfortable (not happy) in the situation you are in. His grace is more than enough to keep you intact until He has rescued you. After knowing that His grace would keep him, he rejoiced in his infirmities as he understood that this too would pass. Grace keeps you on hold position.\n\n<strong>Hebrews 4:16, “Therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness that you obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need</strong>”. Already we have established a foundation of grace being a favor not something worked for or earned. Anytime we deal with grace, we understand our debts were paid by Jesus on the cross. The grace of God makes it a reality in our lives when we repent and trust. We can stand before God in our fig leaves, knowing we are accepted in the beloved. Listen to this, <strong>the grace of God does not compromise the holiness of God, it provides a way out</strong>. Now that we have been accepted in the beloved, we have been given keys to access the throne of grace when we need mercy and grace to help us in time of need. <strong>While positionaly we are perfect, experientially we are a working progress sanctified daily in this walk of grace growing in holiness</strong>. When you have grace, you will not disgrace yourself and the people around you.\n\nTo sum up, God in His kindness saved me a dirty wretched sinner by His grace through faith and without compromising His Holiness He provided a way out through His Son. That’s what makes grace so amazing. Would you care to share with us what makes grace amazing in your life?

              "<strong>John 12:4-6, “4 But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s <em>son,</em> who would betray Him, said, 5 “Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denari and given to the poor?” 6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the moneybox; and he used to take what was put in it”</strong>\r\n\r\nI never get tired of preaching the gospel or hearing it preached, why? <strong>The gospel is the power of God unto salvation, Romans 1:16</strong>. This is so powerful that it’s not a sinners prayer or belief or saying sorry that saves, it’s only the power of God that can free one from the slavery of sin. Yes these things I mentioned can bring us closer to be saved; the ultimate work is in the hands of the Lord who we yield to. <strong>Psalm 3:8</strong>, \"<strong>Salvation belongs to the LORD”.<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nIt pains me when I remember in my teenage life how I rebelled against God. A family friend tried to witness to me and right before his presence I mocked the gospel. My brother even begged me to just receive the Lord after seeing this poor guy struggle with me but still I refused. There were days when in trouble, I used the Lord as my means to an end. “I gave my life to Christ” for a season and for a reason until I got what I wanted then abandoned Him.\r\n\r\nI identified with Judas Iscariot and I will explain why. Judas was one of the disciples, hanged around Jesus, looked and sounded like the rest. Unlike the disciples, only Jesus truly knew him. He was entrusted with the moneybag to which he stole from. He did not care for Jesus because when a woman brought an expensive oil to anoint Jesus, Judas had a problem with it. <strong>John 12:4-6, “4 But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s <em>son,</em> who would betray Him, said, 5 “Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denari and given to the poor?” 6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it</strong>”. Just like Judas, I too hanged around the Lord, was partaker of the blessings, was stealing from Him, did not worship Him and I had a problem with those who worshipped Him and how they worshiped. I was a hypocrite going to church, identified with those who were truly saved knowing sure I was not a true worshiper. When I received what I wanted, I betrayed Him with my life style, blaspheming His name by how I lived.\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 26:14-15, “14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 15 and said, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?” And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.” </strong>Judas so hated Jesus that despite the fact that he loved money and would have sought ways to make more, he went to the chief priests and was willing to take anything even the least so as to betray Him. My life was like that of Judas’, I was willing to do anything to get rid of Jesus out my life, after all, I the blessings is all I was looking for. To the world Judas was ok but again Jesus knew better. To the world I was ok, but Jesus knew better. Like Judah, I sold Him out cheap. How this pains me when I think about it. And more and more I became a slave to sin. Ensnared without even guilt. Back then it was no big deal but when my eyes were opened to see how wretched I was and how my lifestyle would have made Judas look like a choir boy, “I said Lord, I am done with myself and in my sin of breaking his laws where rebellion and betrayal were present, I heard that He died for me by paying the highest price to save a wretch like me\" How that hymn “Amazing grace” makes grace sounds amazing. <strong>I have seen the cost to appreciate the sacrifice</strong>.\r\n\r\nLet me share a true story that brings this point home. I first heard it told by the late Paris Reidhead, “<em>During the years when slavery was legal in the United States, a gentleman happened upon a slave-bidding in a crowed street. The man paused to observe the activities. As he watched from the edge of the crowd, he saw one slave after another led to a platform, their arms and legs shackled with ropes as if they were animals. Displayed before the jeering crowd, they were auctioned off, one by one. Some onlookers would inspect the \"merchandise\", grabbing disrespectfully at the women, examining the muscular arms of the men. The gentleman studied the group of slaves waiting nearby. He paused when he saw a young girl standing at the back. Her eyes were filled with fear. She looked so frightened. He hesitated for a moment and then disappeared briefly. When he returned, the auctioneer was about to start the bidding for the young girl he had noticed beforehand.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>As the auctioneer opened the bidding, the gentleman shouted out a bid that was twice the amount of any other selling price offered that day. There was silence for an instance, and then the gavel fell as, \"sold to the gentleman\" was heard. The gentleman stepped forward, making his way through the crowd. He waited at the bottom of the steps as the young girl was led down to her new owner. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>The rope, which bound her, was handed to the man, who accepted it without saying anything. The young girl stared at the ground<strong>. Suddenly she looked up and spit in his face</strong>. Silently, he reached for a handkerchief and wiped the spittle from his face. He smiled gently at the young girl and said, \"Follow me\". She followed him reluctantly. As they reached the edge of the crowd, he continued to a nearby area where each deal was closed legally.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>When a slave was set free, legal documents, called manumission papers, were necessary. The gentleman paid the purchase price and signed the necessary documents. When the transaction was complete, he turned to the young girl and presented the documents to her. Startled, she looked at him with uncertainty. Her narrowed eyes asked, what are you doing? The gentlemen responded to her questioning look. He said, \"Here, take these papers<strong>. I bought you to make you free</strong>. As long as you have these papers in your possession, no man can ever make you a slave again.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The girl looked into his face. What was happening? There was silence. Slowly, she said, \"<strong>You bought me, to make me free?</strong>\" <strong>\"You bought me, to make me free?\"</strong> <strong>As she repeated this phrase over and over, the significance of what had just happened became more and more real to her. \"You bought me, to make me free?\" Was it possible that a stranger had just granted her freedom and never again could she be held in bondage and servitude to any man? As she began to grasp the significance of the documents, which she now held in her hand, she fell to her knees and wept at the gentleman's feet. Through her tears of joy and gratitude, she said, \"YOU BOUGHT ME, TO MAKE ME FREE.... I’LL SERVE YOU FOREVER!\"</strong></em>\r\n\r\nI am like the slave girl who spat on His face and Judas who stole and betrayed Him, and even in that, He bought me to free me. In 1993 at the age of 19, I repented and put my trust in Him alone for my eternal salvation and I vowed to serve Him forever. To give Him the obedience I refused to give Him. My question to you, are you a Judas like I was or have you passed from death to life? You could be saying you will do it one day and continue to use the Lord as your means to an end. Tomorrow is promised to no one. I wasted my teenage years living for the devil as his slave while I could have started living for God then, are you wasting time? Do you know you are running out time? Today is the day of salvation, <strong>He has done everything to save you</strong>, what is holding you from repenting and trusting? How else can I drive this point home that He bought you to free you? Oh the wonderful cross. MAY THE LAMB THAT WAS SLAIN RECEIVE THE REWARD OF HIS SUFFERING.

              "<strong>Isaiah 26:3&amp;4, “3 You will keep him in perfect peace, Whose mind is stayed on You…”</strong>\r\n\r\nI have never met anyone who did not crave for peace. The world teaches that peace comes when everything is going the right way, God’s peace can come when everything is going right or wrong.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nA few years ago I went through a traumatizing experience that left me gasping for peace. If I was of the world I would have done something stupid, however, the Lord gave me peace, something I had always talked about but never fully experienced. Let us look at different kinds of peace. There is <strong>PEACE WITH GOD</strong>, this is where when we were once living in sin, we were enemies of God and through His salvation, we made peace with Him. <strong>Romans 5:1,” Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,” James 4:4, “…Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God</strong>”. If you are not saved, you have no peace with God and you will not have other benefits that come with peace.\r\n\r\nThere is <strong>PEACE OF GOD</strong>, the peace that comes from above. This is not even worked from within. If you ever find yourself in a situation that is so bad and you can still be cool about it, that is not your own peace, it's the peace of God in action. Daniel had the peace of God in the lion’s den and so was David, Elijah and the rest who found themselves in difficult situations but still had the peace of God. <strong>Philippians 4:7, “And the peace of God that surpasses all human understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus”</strong>. This is a type of peace that cannot be defined by man, it can only be experienced. There is nothing on earth that can be used to define, describe or break it down in a way you and I can understand it. During the time I was going through my tough time, God gave me this peace, till today I cannot describe it in words.\r\n\r\nThe peace we are dealing with today is <strong>PEACE IN GOD.</strong> The other types of peace we have looked at are for a given period of time when they are really needed, but the peace in God is a continuous peace that every believer should crave. We are told that <strong>God will keep him in perfect peace anyone who has His mind stay on Him</strong>, why? because He does trust Him. By keeping your mind on Him may not mean coming out of your situation right away but having peace to go through it because you are in perfect peace. It is the type of peace that has no errors, we don’t need to try it and see if it works. We don’t need to order it for 30 days and if it does not work, we can send it back to the manufacturer. I have proven this to be true and so constantly I am living in perfect peace because my mind is on Him. I believe that the more your mind stays on Him, the more you meditate on His Word and the more you think of His goodness and perfections, the more you will be in His peace.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 4 “Trust in the Lord forever, For in Jehovah, the Lord, is everlasting strength”.</strong> Those who have peace in God have no problem trusting Him, not for a season but forever. Because in Him there is everlasting strength. I may not know what you are dealing with that has stolen away your peace and I’m not talking about peace with God, you passed that at the point of salvation. I am talking about the peace of God but stressing on the peace in God. Have you left your mind to wander, worry and get confused? Get your mind back on His word (Him). <strong>Mathew 11:28, “Come unto me all ye who labor and are of heavy laden and I will give you rest”</strong>. <strong>PEACE COMES ABOUT WHEN YOU BEGIN TO REST IN HIM </strong>and God is offering us rest today that we may be in that perfect peace.

              "<strong>John 3:30, “He MUST increase, but I MUST decrease</strong>”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image7.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6111\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image7.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRepresenting Christ is an exciting thing. As a song goes, “<em>We want to see Jesus lifted high a banner that flies across the land, that men might see that Jesus is the way to heaven”</em>. It is a beautiful thing to represent Christ. To be His ambassador in this world. Christ MUST be exalted which means, we must raise His rank, glorify, praise, worship and honor Him. That is the number one duty of man. It’s not about position, ministry or calling that is on top, Christ is.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI am fascinated by the life of John the Baptist, he was about 6 months older than Jesus (as a Man). He was sent to be the way maker for Jesus. John understood the concept of the older serving the younger. John baptized with water unto repentance, Jesus baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire. John did ministry way before Jesus began. Some even thought he was the promised Christ. He kept on correcting them that he was not the one. He was a just a voice crying out in the wilderness preparing the way for the Lord. John was an ambassador preparing people to meet Christ, the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. John was respected and people responded to his teachings, he kept on speaking of the One to come hence decreasing that the One who had not been revealed yet would increase.  We read in <strong>John 1:26-27, “26 I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know. 27 It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.</strong>” John had  everyone to elevate him but never once did he take the glory. He understood that everything that was happening in his life and his ministry was about Christ. Therefore everything that he did, he made sure that Christ out shined him. John lost two of his disciples to Jesus in <strong>John 1:37</strong> and his thought, Christ MUST increase. People were getting concerned because Jesus was getting more fame, John rejoiced in that. People followed Christ more than John, but listen to John's response <strong>John 3:29, “He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice.</strong> <strong>Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.\"</strong> John’s fulfillment came  knowing that he had exalted Christ. He understood his job perfectly.\r\n\r\nHow does this apply to us as believers, we must know it is not about us but Him. Our job is to exalt Christ everywhere we go. How we act and behave will show if Christ is increasing or decreasing in our lives. Will people see more Him or more of us? <strong>The Spirit must arise and the flesh be removed</strong>. Our attitude towards people, His blessings, our callings and ministries will indicate whether we are decreasing and He is increasing or the other way round. A number became concerned that John was loosing his position, his response <strong>John 3:30, \"He MUST increase</strong>” not He should increase or may increase but HE MUST. He made sure the “MUST” was in effect. John did not wait for Christ to overtake him by staying constant, he made sure he took more out of his life (decreased) for the sake of Christ. John could only bow because he was humbled, can we do the same saying \"<i>Lord is about You and not us, more of You and less of us, Whole of You and none of us, You MUST increase but I MUST decrease?\".</i>\r\n\r\nThe bible says in <strong>1Peter 5:6,”Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time”.  </strong>Did Christ exalt John in due season? Yes, <strong>Matthew 11:10-11, \"10 For this is he of whom it is written: “Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.” 11″Assuredly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist\". </strong>My desire is to humble myself and decrees that He may increase in my life, I MUST exalt Him whatever the cost.

              "<strong>Genesis 26:15-34, \"18 And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWells are dug down deep for water. No one in their right mind digs wells for fun. Human survival depends on water. Christ referred to Himself as the Living Water that quenches the thirst of men. The Samaritan woman in <strong>John 4</strong> came to the well to draw water and right at the well, she met Jesus who asked for water then later claimed to have water she needs to make her thirst no more. She desired this water. How about us?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTo desire water sounds so good but here is the problem, in the book of <strong>Genesis</strong>, Abraham had dug wells and at a later time, the philistines (enemies) came and filled them with earth (soil). They covered them up and water would not flow anymore. <strong>Genesis 26:15, \"Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with earth</strong>\". Do you realize that you have an enemy constantly trying to fill your wells with dirt? You lost your effectiveness because water is not flowing in your well, the enemy covered it up. You have become rigid, dry and gasping for breath. The desert scotching sun has left you weary to the point of giving up. You wonder what happened to the healing, restoration and deliverance promised by God to His children. And the most important thing, you have lost connection with God. The explanation is simple, \"your well is covered up\". You must thefore <strong>not expect new wells to be dug when there are wells to be uncovered</strong>. You have to go back to the old wells and dig them up. Running from place to place is not the answer, self-pity will not work, you have a job to do, rise up and go to work.\r\n\r\n<strong>Genesis 26:18, \"And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father\". </strong>Your survival depends on whether you have water running. Dig your wells again, you need that first love, that fire to serve Christ, the passion to witness, desire for greater things in response to His will. <strong>When you encounter with the living water, you will thirst no more. </strong>But no one will do it for you, this is between you and God. You have to take a stand and say, \"<strong>I will dig my wells again\". \"I can't go on living a defeated life because I allowed the enemy to fill my wells\"</strong>. The enemy knows that is where your life source is and that is why he filled them up in the first place.<strong> Isaiah 12:3, \"Therefore with joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation</strong>\". Don't you know that right where you are you have a well of salvation that has more to offer than just salvation? <strong>Psalm 103:2, \"Bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not HIS BENEFITS</strong>\". Wells of salvation has benefits, dig them again, undo what's been done. will finish in part 2.

              "<strong>Genesis 26:15-34, \"18 And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe began to look at undoing what the enemy has done, and that calls for going back to dig the wells covered. People pray for revival and I believe in revival but the definition most people give revival is not actually what it is. <strong>Revival is coming again into activity and prominence.</strong> <!--more-->Revival is about renewal, restoration, recovery, simply bringing back. This what Isaac needed to do, revive the wells to be effective, productive, living and flourishing. Are you reviving your wells? God could have told him to dig new wells but the word of God says, He is a God of restoration (reviving). Bringing back to life that which is dead, a good example God speaking of restoration in <strong>Joel 2:25, He says, \"So I will restore (revive) to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, The crawling locust, The consuming locust, And the chewing locust, My great army which I sent among you\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Genesis 26:25, \"So he built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD, and he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants dug a well</strong>\". God will not say something He has no answer for. To us it may sound foolish but to Him He knows what He is doing. If you are living by facts, you will not make it with God for long because many things that God does and asks us to do not make sense but they sure work. <i>You go and revive your wells Isaac and I will cause water to flow says the Lord</i>. At the place they revived the wells, is the place they built an altar and pitched their tents. Why, because where your life is is where you dwell.\r\n\r\nRevive your altars of worship before Him, revive your prayer life and let Him cause His Living Water to flow. His Water will quench the thirst you always have when nothing else satisfies. Thank God for His promises that never fails. Men may fail but God never fails, the bible says that “<strong>He is not a man that he should lie neither is He the son of man that He should repent, if He said it, surely it will come to pass</strong>” paraphrased. “Surely” means without fail, we may not know the timing but surely we know He will. If He created out of nothing, He will make His water run from the unexpected.\r\n\r\nBecause Isaac was obedient to go back and dig the wells, God caused the water to flow and the Philistines saw clearly and in vs. <strong>26-28 “26 Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phichol the commander of his army. 27 And Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?”</strong> <strong>28 But they said, “We have certainly seen that the LORD is with you”</strong>. They had been hostile to him before, however after seeing the Lord's doing, Isaac found favor with them and he also showed them kindness.\r\n\r\nWe still have much to do in our surrounding. To be effective, we have to have our wells with water. Why are you not affecting your department, is it because you have allowed an enemy to fill your wells of joy, peace, favor, confidence, hope with guilt, shame, pride, fear and habits? You have a reason now to undo what has been done because you need your well of salvation running again and then build an altar and pitch your tent around the wells you have dug.

              "<b>1Kings 17:1-7, \"6 The ravens brought him bread in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook, 7, \"And it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land\". </b>\r\n\r\nIt is often easy to talk about God’s provision, our common king size problem is the aspect of waiting. God’s strategy and time table is different from ours. We know this for sure from <strong>Isaiah 55:8&amp;9, \"for my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my way, for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways</strong>\". When you think that everything is out of control, He is in control, nothing escapes Him.<strong> Ecclesiastes 3:11, \"He has made everything beautiful in His time\".</strong> We need to understand that it's His time that counts and not ours.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nElijah the prophet in <strong>1Kings 17</strong> prophesied to king Ahab of the absence of rain Israel for a period of three years. If you look at <strong>1Kings 16:33,</strong> <strong>\"And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him\". </strong>Ahab was bad news, he angered God many times, he married a wicked woman by the name of Jezebel who turned his heart away from God. Despite all these, God’s heart was never too far from the Israelites. Though the wickedness of Ahab provoked God to shut the heavens from providing rain, everyone in the land of Israel had to be affected by the circumstance regardless of whether they were righteous or not. It's true even today people do things that cause others to suffer and yet they are innocent (I use that word loosely).\r\n\r\nI thank God for <strong>Romans 8:1, “there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus”, Psalm 91, “for in times of trouble God will hide us under His pavilion in the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me”, Philippians 4:19, “He will provide according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus”</strong>. Elijah’s prophecy was not going to exempt him from the drought for He also lived in Israel. However, He was faithful to take God at His word and God would meet his needs. <strong>1Kings 17:2&amp;3, \"Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, \"Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan. And it will be that you shall drink from the brooks, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there\"</strong>. Praise God for His plans and provisions, in as much as there was drought in the land, God preserved a brook for His chosen man, and on the other hand He had commanded ravens to feed him with bread and meat. I would pause here for a sec. I understand something about the brook for it must have been flowing from the river Jordan, but how do you explain the bread? Where was the bread and meat coming from? who was baking the bread? and how come the raven did not eat the bread? and most importantly, how did the raven know who Elijah was?\r\n\r\nWe will never fully grasp how God works but we sure love when He does the impossible. He is the God who takes less and does much with it. He is the God who does things that leaves us in awe of His greatness. How He does things reminds us His ways are not our ways. How we see things are not how He sees them. When we least expect Him to move that is the time He will move. When you think that there is nothing around He can use, that is the time He will surprise you by taking that little thing and making something great out of it. There could be something around you, at your job, an idea, a seed at home you never thought He could use, but don't be surprised to see the things you despised being used to move you.

              "<strong>1Kings 17:1-7, \"6 The ravens brought him bread in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook, 7, \"And it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land\". </strong>\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the drought, God provided for Elijah and I believe Elijah may have been content and comfortable with God’s provision, however after a while the brook dried up. <strong>While the means stopped, the provision by other means did not.<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nThere are jobs, positions, ministries that God allowed us to be in for a while. He fed us, ministered to us, provided for us and the like and we knew for sure that it was God's will to be in that place, but we need to understand that there are times when the brook dries up meaning that which you thought would always be there is gone. The zeal you had for that position dried up, the patience you had for that thing dried up. At this time it's very easy to say it may have not been God's will for you to be there but the truth of the matter is, it was His will but for a season. When you are getting comfortable, He will relocate you so as to depend on Him even more. Change causes us to see God in different dimensions and change also allows us not to limit God in any way. If God provided away for you in this, believe that He has already provided another way, He is the way maker.\r\n\r\nGuys, the brook can dry up, your spiritual brook can dry up, zeal to serve others can dry up, finances can dry up, and jobs and positions can also dry up. We believers are nomadic people always on the move climbing from glory to glory. Don't expect to find some of us in the previous brooks for when they dried up, it was time to trust God for the next move. Don't be trying to revive a brook that dried up, what God has closed can no man open and what God has opened can no man close. Ask the Lord what direction to take, He has a lot of ways of blessing His people.\r\n\r\nIf you are like me, I would have a few questions for God such as <em>“why allow a brook to dry up while the three year period of no rain is still on?”</em> read from vs. 8 and you will see that God was providing another way and this time Elijah is to meet a widow who will provide for him. Elijah may been thrilled for God’s new means to provide for him. Indeed God had provided a way but He did not tell him that the widow who was to provide for him had only little oil and little flour to which she was just going to make the last bread for her and her son and then wait to die. <strong>Greater levels, greater service to others, greater miracles to be expected and so are greater challenges</strong>. At the brook he wasn't serving and yet he had enough, at the widow's, he is expected to serve while there is less than enough but the good news is that he is sent to rescue someone else. Thank God that when He relocates you, He has someone or some people in mind He desires you to reach. As He blesses them, He will bless you too. <strong>Galatians 6:9, \"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not</strong>\"\r\n\r\nAt first it was about his needs being met, then about other people’s needs met through Him with his. When the brook has dried up, may the Lord send us to another place for there is still much to be done.

              "<strong>Matthew 2:2-3, \"When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen I read this verse what troubled me was what would cause Herod and all Jerusalem with him to be troubled? To answer that we have to look at a few aspects including who Herod was, how he came to rule, and how the Magi were connected to all of this all during the perfect timing of the birth of God's Son.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLet us start with the Magi. What the magi likely did not know was that Herod ruled not in greatness of kingship but with great paranoia and deadly tactics of power and destruction. He is described as a madman who put to death many of his own family members, including two of his sons out of fear of their disloyalty and rise to power. The IVP Bible Backgrounds New Testament states, \"<em>King Herod, who was aware of broad currents of thought in the Roman Empire and sponsored pagan temples among Gentile cities in his realm, might have been especially apt to consider the Magi’s mission significant</em>.\" Needless to say, when Herod learned of the magi’s journey to behold the birth of a new king, he was angry and threatened by the news. Matthew reports, “[<b><i><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Herod] was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him.” The people of Jerusalem were well acquainted with Herod’s murderous tactics when fear and paranoia reigned in his kingdom.</span></i></b>\r\n\r\nWhen Herod discovered that the magi had tricked him, leaving town without reporting where they found the child king, what did he do? He did not sit idle, no not at all. The character of Herod was one of rule by the iron fist, and he would certainly implore more deadly tactics of power and destruction because that is what he did. John MacArthur shares, \"<em>Now let me set the stage. Politically speaking, Rome was scared of the eastern Empire. Now if you'll just focus in your mind a little map of Europe and that was the Roman Empire, this massive chunk of Europe. And technically it swept to the east. But by virtue of distance cross the Mediterranean, across the blazing desert to get to the east, there was a certain isolation in the east which caused Rome a lot of anxiety. And they were always fearful that what then became known as the Parthean Empire, the eastern empire made up of the Medes and the Persians and the old Babylonian territory, that Parthean Empire was always kind of an anxiety for Rome. Rome, you know, had stretched its tentacles out as it were to rule the world but they never really felt very secure about the Parthean Empire. And they had become violent enemies, violent enemies. And they fought. In 55 B.C. they fought. In 40 B.C. they fought. And what's fascinating is, you know where they always fought? The great empire in the west, the great empire in the east came together and guess where they always fought? Right along the coast of the Mediterranean, Syria, Jordan, Palestine. Israel was a little no-man's land between the powers of the east and the powers of the west”.</em>\r\n\r\nFurthermore MacArthur states, \"<em>Herod got panicky. When suddenly these Persian king makers appeared in Jerusalem no doubt traveling in full force with all their oriental pomp and they use to wear conical hats with points on the top and big deals clear down to the bottom of their chin and they rode Persian steeds not camels. And when they came in they didn't come alone, the estimates of history are they came with Persian cavalry. When they came charging into the city of Jerusalem and Herod peeked out his little palace window he flipped</em>.\r\n\r\nThese are powerful men and to make it worse his army was out of the country on a mission. And the Bible says Herod was troubled. I guess he was. The word in the Greek is he was agitated like your washing machine, he was shaking. You see, Herod had a title. Do you know what Herod's title was? King of the Jews. He got it from Caesar Augustus. Caesar Augustus crowned him king of the Jews. And he realized the great dream of his life was to get that little buffer state under his power and here he was in the middle of two huge contending empires. And all of a sudden this massive coterie of Persians arrive in the city and he is panicked and they say we're coming to find the new king.\". Herod is thinking, \"I'm the King of the Jews, and all the people better know it, and know and respect me in that role. Any threat to my rule will be met with death as I did with others, no one is exempt from my wrathful, vengeful, hand of power.\" <em>It is important to note, that \"at the time Herod was close to death. And Caesar Augustus was really old and hanging by a thread. And since the retirement of Tiberius the Roman army didn't even have a commander-in-chief. And they knew that this would be the time to bring about an eastern war against the west. It was right. And so Herod was shaking</em> (MacArthur).\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under. At this decree, Matthew recalls what was said through the prophet Jeremiah long ago, now sadly fulfilled: “<strong><em>A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more”</em></strong> (<strong>Matthew 2:16-18).</strong> Herod’s violent reaction to the news of a newborn king casts a very sad shadow on a beautiful story. We remember with delight the magi outsmarting Herod by leaving for their country on another road. We remember with triumph that Mary, Joseph, and Jesus are able to escape to safety despite the murderous arm of a powerful ruler. But at what despairing cost? For the little town of Bethlehem, Herod’s command brought about excruciating sorrow. In fact, the inclusion of this frightful story at all is a grim and curious addition in an otherwise joyful telling of the beginnings of Christmas. It is no wonder we seldom reflect on it (Jill Carattini, RZIM).\r\n\r\nChrist was born during the slaughter of the innocence, but God protected His Son, but allowed a multitude of other children, from other parents to still die. If it is a much more serious offense to murder the US President than a homeless man in the eyes of the law, then how much more to murder the Son of God over those God merely created? Yes, God allowed the deaths of many children, but in His Master Plan, he guided His Son from the cradle to the cross where His own Son, \"...<strong><em>came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many</em></strong> (<strong>Mark 10:45),\"</strong> that we might be saved and redeemed by the blood of the real innocent, spotless Lamb of God, who came into the world to save sinners. He came to save His people from their sins and His is still saving them. God honored His Son with gifts from a foreign Magi, protected His Son by warning Mary and Joseph, and glorified His Son by seating Him back on His right hand. May we honor the Son, proclaim His name, and glorify the one that was born to die for my sin and yours!\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...\r\n\r\nPhil Sessa, Soulfishing Ministries Evangelist <strong>&lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://qdvf.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/the-magi-history-meaning-22/\" target=\"_blank\">The Magi: History &amp; Meaning (2/2)</a> (qdvf.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://shalommysticwind.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/epiphany-wise-men-come-to-worship-jesus-mt-2-1-12/\" target=\"_blank\">Epiphany: Wise Men Come to Worship Jesus (Mt 2: 1-12)</a> (shalommysticwind.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ptl2010.com/2012/12/16/gods-promise-jesus-christ-slaughter-of-children/\" target=\"_blank\">GOD'S PROMISE - JESUS CHRIST - Slaughter of children</a> (ptl2010.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://qdvf.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/the-magi-history-meaning-12/\" target=\"_blank\">The Magi: History &amp; Meaning (1/2)</a> (qdvf.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Psalms 23:4, \"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil: for though at with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me\"</strong>\r\n\r\nFear is a dreadful disease, which is why it is capable of killing its victims, in some cases, much faster than some of the dreadful diseases of our time such as cancer, AIDS and heart attack. It is a disease with no pathological cause but it is real and it preys on all of us. Most of our failures and maladies are caused by it.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFear is also paralyzing. It is limiting and debilitating. Fear is capable of defeating good intentions and purposes. If not conquered, fear conquers and controls. Fear is capable of intensifying and is equally explosive. Too much of it is dangerous. None of it is abnormal. Mild fear or intense fear, depending on the situation, is necessary for healthy living. Fear can motivate us to do something more than we ordinarily would do. Fear can also trigger a positive change. We, therefore, should experience some fear; healthy fear.\r\n\r\nHowever, chronic fear will definitely trigger failure in any area of your life.\r\n\r\nAs believers how can we avoid being ruled and controlled by fear? How can we overcome fear when we are suddenly under its grip? How can we fight fear? What weapons do we need for attacking and defeating fear? How can we respond to situations and circumstances that cause fear in our lives? Whom can we rely on to overcome frightful and deadly effects of fear? What can happen to us if we do not overcome fear? What is fear anyway?\r\n\r\nDavid, the author of <strong>Psalms 23,</strong> had more reasons to fear than most of us. On many occasions, Saul sought to kill him. At times, he spent time in caves and in deserted places running away from Saul. He also made mistakes whose consequences left him worried and fearful. How did he overcome his fears?\r\n\r\nHe learned to confess who God was to him; he learned to affirm God’s presence with him; he made a conscious decision not to fear any evil.\r\n\r\nIf you too want to overcome any fear in your life, know who God is to you personally. To David, he was, “my Shepherd\". Declare that His presence is with you at all times and in all situations. To David, that was key truth that gave him peace and reassured him that all was well with him. He said of God, “<strong>thou at with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me</strong>”. Today, confess loudly:\r\n\r\n<strong>“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil…” </strong>(Vs.4). Do that every time the spirit of fear creeps around. Resist and defeat the devil by the blood of the Lamb and by the Word of your testimony (confession) (<strong>Revelation 12:11</strong>). God bless you. Boaz\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/psalm-23-the-divine-shepherd-part-1of6-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Psalm 23: The Divine Shepherd, Part 1of6, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/power-to-overcome-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Power To Overcome, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>1Samuel 18:10-12, \"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand. And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice. And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nIt has been said \"<em>the pen is mightier than the sword.\"</em> However, few may know that Edward George Bulwer Lytton (1803-1873), an English novelist, wrote this for the first time in 1839. He wrote, \"<em>Beneath the rule of men entirely great, the pen is mightier than the sword</em><strong>.\"</strong> In the natural this doesn't make sense, but there are great spiritual truths to be learned in principal. In the days of David, King Saul's jealousy toward David grew to a place of attempted murder.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn the heat of battle I would much rather have a javelin than a harp. What can I do with a harp in battle? Perhaps with my musical ability I could play the harp in such a manner that my lack of talent would cause the enemy to cover their ears and retreat. A harp was a grounded instrument, a stable instrument, while a javelin is a weapon that one can carry around. This reminds me of that character of Saul and David. David was grounded in God, as the presence of God rested upon him. Saul was flighty and unstable; one never knew when Saul would \"loose it\" and snap. Saul lived by his emotions and his title as king. David lived by his godly character and His anointing to soon become the king. David was patient and obedient, while Saul was hurried and disobedient.\r\n\r\nNow David had a harp in his hand while Saul had a javelin in his. With the harp David pleased God, drove evil spirits away from Saul and thus served the king. With the javelin Saul purposed to pin David to death upon the wall. David was growing in popularity as the people said, <strong>\"Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands</strong>.\" Although Saul had the title as king, he feared David greatly because the Lord was with David and had departed from Saul. The Apostle Paul penned the words<strong>, \"...If God is for us, who can be against us?\" in Romans 8:31.</strong> God was for David because David was righteous. He had a right standing before God. As a spiritual boxing match, God was in David's corner, just as He was when David killed Goliath. David's behaved very wisely and Saul behaved very fearfully. I imagine that Saul was quick skilled with the Javelin, but when he threw it at David, David dodged the weapon. Although Saul tried to kill David, David NEVER tried to retaliate in any way against Saul. In this day and age many pride themselves on subverting authority when one feels they are in the right. David had the Spirit of God, and therefore was defended by God. David teaches us many things.\r\n\r\n<em>1. Use what God gives you, even if it is a simple harp;. 2. Be stable in God; 3. Behave in wisdom not in fear. (fear God not man); 4. Know that if God is for you, who can be against you. (</em><strong>Romans 8:31);</strong><em> 5. Learn to dodge what the enemy throws your way.; 6. Respect your authorities even when they are wrong (this is tough, but necessary for God's people); 7. Submit to authority don't subvert authority (don't throw javelins back!); 8. Submit to God and be guided by His spirit.</em>\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/13/falling-back-on-dead-things-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Falling Back On Dead Things, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Job 13:15, \"Though He slay me yet I will trust Him, I will maintain mine own ways before Him\". Job 23:10, \"He knows the way that I take, after He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold\". </strong>\r\n\r\nThere are things I tend to battle. I fear conflicts, adversities, rejection, failure. Are you anything like me in this? I don't like being in positions of not knowing what to do. I get frustrated when I miss seeing something someone else sees and points it out. If they happen frequently, I feel even more frustrated. If I did something the wrong way, it might be costly to make it right.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLet me cover “adversities” today as I believe adversities are good for us. Here are some words related to adversities, hardships, difficulty, danger, harsh conditions, hard times, misfortune. I'm not saying that adversities are nice, they are like medication good for our health if channeled correctly. One preacher said, \"<strong>Many have never allowed problems to work for them\", </strong><strong>it's working them, destroying them, working against them</strong>. <strong>Romans 8:28</strong> always come into perspective, it works in good times and bad times. If there was a way to avoid adversities, I would be the first one. Job says, \"<strong>Though He slay me yet I will trust Him, I will maintain mine own ways before Him\", Job 13:15.  </strong>Job did not request for adversities but he faced them and it made Him stronger, it taught him how to trust more, taught how to react, and taught him that God is God and without Him, he is nothing. Adversities taught him to trust and maintain his ways before God. He also says in <strong>Job 23:10, \"He knows the way that I take, after He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold\". </strong>What a bold statement in times of adversities, how many would have complained and cursed God?. Job understood that God knew the way His servants takes and that is the path of purity, faith, trust, humility, confidence in Him and what he is saying is if God can give him grace and strength to go through this test, he will come forth as gold. For gold to be purified and all the other elements taken off, it has to be taken through the fire, why? because gold can survive the fire when the other elements will not. The other elements don’t turn into gold, they get out of the way for gold to be seen.\r\n\r\nThere are four ways to respond to adversities, you can <strong>MAXIMIZE IT</strong>, <strong>MINIMIZE IT, ADVERTISE IT OR ANALYZE IT. Maximizing</strong> it is exaggerating and putting more into it than what is there. Being destroyed by something that hasn't even happened yet or something that has just started. For example, someone could have a headache, that could be too big in their eyes. The way they talk about it could make it extremely big and impossible to deal with. This is because they are putting more into it than what is already there. Maximizing it is trying to understand it with a lot of why did this happen to me? what did I do wrong? why me? <strong>Minimizing</strong> it is the attitude of not trying to make a big deal out of it. It looks terrible but it's not that bad as I thought or suppose. The problem with minimizing, it is trying to cover it up when you need to deal with it. <strong>Advertise</strong> it is very lethal, you want the whole world to know you are dealing with problems. The way you appear, the way you talk, the way you act is advertising to everyone many times for sympathy. <strong>Analyzing </strong>it is the best way to deal with it. This is extracting useful information from it and knowing that things don't just happen. There are things we get ourselves into that bring adversities and we need to learn from those mistakes to avoid repetition. There are things we have no control over and yet there are things that we could learn from. Job did not do anything wrong, the accuser of the brethren approached God and said Job's reason for serving God was because of what he had. Just to say something, <strong>God does not try anyone</strong>, <strong>He may allow but He is not the author of it</strong>. In this case, God allowed Satan to try Job but to a limit. The limit was to take everything that he had but not His life or his wife. God will allow but He will control the thermostat. He will not give us more than we can handle. Job took the time to analyze why he had to go through adversities and he gained useful information that sustained him. He learnt to never put trust in man, you can lose what you have but not God, you can truly know who your friends are, you can maximize the faith inside of you, you can be trusted with something that would kill others, you can learn to serve others better while you are where you are. Instead of us crying,<strong> \"Lord get me out of this\", </strong>our cry should be<strong>, \"Lord, what can we learn through this?\". </strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you and I know that adversities are good for us, we can be like David in <strong>1Samuel 30:6, \"...But David strengthened (encouraged) himself in the Lord his God\". </strong>David had faced many adversities in <strong>1Samuel 30</strong> and his soldiers were about to stone him yet he took the liberty to encourage and strengthen himself and his soldiers. In the midst of adversities, cry if you must but let it not wear you down, encourage yourself in the Lord. Avoid maximizing, or trying to minimize; stop advertising adversities and start analyzing because you will have the confidence to face it standing on <strong>Romans 8:28, \"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to His purpose\", </strong>Blessings, Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/gold-tried-by-fire-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Gold Tried By Fire, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/psalm-23-the-divine-shepherd-part-1of6-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Psalm 23: The Divine Shepherd, Part 1of6, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/i-will-be-with-you-says-the-lord-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">I Will Be With You Says The Lord, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/strike-again-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Strike Again, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/2211/\" target=\"_blank\">Lord Teach Us to Pray 1of10: Our Father...Hallowed Be Your Name, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/31/teach-us-to-thrive-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Teach Us To Thrive, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

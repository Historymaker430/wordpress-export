It could imply slavery to some, that does not sound nice or appear pretty. A servant is a person who serves others, an individual who performs duties about the person or home of a master or personal employer. Servants have always been expected to fulfill their duties and many servants either meet the expectations or fall below. Very rare do you hear of servants going beyond the required duty striving for excellence. I think that it&#39;s hard to desire to become a servant, to stoop low and serve than to be served. I believe this is the reason we need to be praying to the Lord to MAKE US SERVANTS. On our own we would rather wait to be served. To walk with the Lord is to die to self and be willing to be made a servant. Jesus said as recorded in Matthew 20:27&quot; And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&quot; This should be the highest honor to be called a servant (slave) of God, to serve as He served. He led by example and what blesses my heart is what He did shortly before He was betrayed. He knew His disciples would be scattered, one would betray Him, the other would deny Him. He would be left alone to face accusations, yet knowing Himself and His disciples well, He stands and does the unthinkable, John 13:2 says, &quot;And supper being ended, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&#39;s son, to betray Him, 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God, 4 rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. 5 After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&#39; feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded&quot;. Isn&#39;t it easy to serve the people who are nice to you, who esteem you, who value you, who respond to you etc? Here we see the Master who had been given all things into His hands, deserved to be served and honored turn around, lay aside His royal garment of glory, take a towel and wash the dirtiest, smelly, crooked feet. If we must wash, it would be easy to pick the part of the body that would be easy and cleaner to wash, let&#39;s say hands or hair. What a level of service the Son of God would give. This was going beyond what we would call duty to excellence. He could have served them by performing miracles like He had done, teach them, lead them. What He did showed the highest service a man can give another man for the glory of God in the sense that as disciples of Christ, we are to follow the Master&#39;s example. If you go back to the bible you will find that God&#39;s appointed prophets, kings, and judges were not called by their titles, He called them &quot;MY SERVANTS&quot;, My servant David, My servant Moses, My servant Elijah.\u00a0 Why do we find it hard to be indentified as servants today? We would want everyone to call us by our titles yet God does not call us by our titles, He calls us servants. Look at some of these men God called servants; they laid down their lives for their Master. Worked themselves to death, were poured out like a drink offering. Did not just do the required, they did more than required. They strived for excellence. Men like Paul, James, Simon Peter, Jude and others did not just refer to themselves as servants, they called themselves <br \/> BONDSERVANTS, dead to self and alive in Christ. A bondservant in the dictionary means a person bound to serve in bondage and without wages. Wow, wouldn&#39;t we rather serve when we know there is something in the end for us? Those who want to be great in God&#39;s kingdom must learn to be servants of all. Do you consider yourself a servant of the Lord or better, a bondservant of the Lord? When was the last time you went out of your way and washed someone&#39;s feet? And by that I mean meeting someone&#39;s need, going out of your way, doing something you would not normally do?. To the world they would wonder what&#39;s wrong with you but to you it will be the highest service you can give to your brother to the glory of God. Psalm 116:16, &quot;O LORD, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have loosed my bonds. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Matthew 20:27 And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&quot; In our time to be called a servant appears to be an insult [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1229","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-jP","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1229","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1229"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1229\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1229"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1229"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1229"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1228,"date":"2009-03-03T21:14:00","date_gmt":"2009-03-04T04:14:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/03\/03\/gifted-for-a-reason\/"},"modified":"2009-03-03T21:14:00","modified_gmt":"2009-03-04T04:14:00","slug":"gifted-for-a-reason","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/03\/03\/gifted-for-a-reason\/","title":{"rendered":"Gifted For A&nbsp;Reason"},"content":{"rendered":"<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Good morning,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Romans 11:29, &#8220;For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Car manufacturers fascinate me. Each of them have built different types of cars, some customized to suit the buyers. For instant, Mercedes Benz can have one of their built cars, look alike but different classes like C class and the S class series. You may find two cars look the same but their cost is different. One could have more upgrades than the other (sunroof, navigation system, more power etc) that make one more expensive than the other. Everyone has a reason for going for different type of cars depending on what they are looking for in a car and what they can afford. Cars can be upgraded and customized. Here is the reason for bringing this up, just because a car has been made does not mean there is no more room to either upgrade or customize it. For us humans we have God our maker who made us and still is willing to upgrade us with gifts and talents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Let&#8217;s explore what talents are. According to the dictionary, talents are marked innate ability, as for artistic accomplishments. It&#8217;s natural endowment. We are different in order to maintain our individuality. With the uniqueness of each of us, we have talents and abilities. I was watching something on TV not too long ago, and they brought these young kids of about 10 years and under. They all had different talents and abilities. One at the age of 4 could sing and dance Elvis songs; there was also a 4 year old girl who had such knowledge of the government and politics. Talents is what you have that very few people have. Talent in singing, writing poetry, dancing, public speaking. At my house I have brothers talented in drawing portraits, another in poetry and another in playing drums, different talents but fitting in one household. I believe God allows us to have talents to enjoy and trade with them to reach His people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Mathew 25:14, &#8220;For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them. vs. 15, &#8220;And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey&#8221;. We don&#8217;t know what they might have been given to do but it&#8217;s clear that what they were asked to do was according to their own abilities. The Master knew what they were capable of; he bestowed goods and talents to them. He expected them to do something with the talents to the maximum. Are you using your God given talents to the maximum? Each of them doubled their goods through their talents except the last man who buried his because he only had one. The rest were rewarded according to the way they used their talent, the last one was denied and even that which he had was taken away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">When we come back to talking about gifts, we understand that gifts are not things worked for but bestowed without any plan for compensation. Anytime you pay for a gift, it wouldn&#8217;t be considered as a gift anymore. The good God of mercy has taken the liberty to bestow gifts in us for a reason. The gifts are to be used to edify the body of Christ. All the gifts of the saints fall back to the Holy Spirit that empowers men to do what they would not do on their own. Once again, each of us have different gifts, Romans 12:6, &#8220;Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them&#8221;. The gifts we have also differs because of the measure of grace and faith and has to be put to work. Regardless of what we have, God requires us to use them. What are some of the spiritual gifts, prophesy, ministry, teaching, leadership, mercy, exhortation. All these gifts and many more originate from the same Spirit and are to be used to benefit the body. I have my own and I can also tap from someone who has the gift I don&#8217;t have. This is the part where we need each other for the gifts we have to benefit each other. 1Corinthians 12:7, &#8220;But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all&#8221;, Romans 12 and 1Corithians 12 talks about spiritual gifts and what they are for. Before men, gifts are for self while with God, gifts are to benefit the entire body of Christ. If God has given you a gift and talents you are not using in your local church, you are missing the opportunity to maximize that gift. The body has different parts, the hands, legs, eyes, ears to mention a few. All have different functions but depend on each other. It&#8217;s like saying the hands have the gift to handle, touch, build; meanwhile the legs have the gift to carry, move, and help escape danger. Different functions but depend on each other. The hands needs the legs, ears, eyes etc for it to be complete and so is the giftings we have that other people don&#8217;t and what they have that we don&#8217;t have. We need our gifts and their gifts and vice versa. Romans 11:29, &#8220;For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable&#8221;, interesting to know that His gifts are irreversible, in other words, they are final. I believe God will not take away what he has bestowed upon us, but if we are not using them, it will not be rewarding to us or people around us. We all have gifts and talents on board, let&#8217;s maximize them to build and further His kingdom. The more you use them, the more you allow room for gifts upgrade. The more you empty yourself with what you have, the more gifts will be bestowed upon you.

For example, am I in the right track? Am I doing all that I can to serve the Lord? Am I living for God and not one foot with him and the other in the world? Am I an example to the world that God wants me to be? Being challenged in areas of forgiveness, love, patience, kindness, etc and mostly for me forgiveness. Am I praising God even at times when I feel I cannot do it anymore because things are a mess a round me? Do I still trust in him even when I feel like am loosing battles? And so on and so forth.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:150%;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span>            <\/span>In addition, being challenged in areas of separating myself from the world. Nowadays I think Christianity has been underrated! According to <a href=\"http:\/\/freedictionary.com\/\">freedictionary.com<\/a> underrate means not being able to take account of the full abilities or potential of something (paraphrased). Christianity has been reduced to the same; I remember there was a time that Christianity meant more than just words. Nowadays everyone is a Christian and yet they live like the devil. So its been encouraging to read from Evans and Pastor Phil and different readers who have shared once in a while and I pray that this coming year will be a year of continued many blessings for this ministry in a big way, in your personal lives, and in the lives of devotion team members!<br \/>\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:150%;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\">God Bless you all,<br \/>\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:150%;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\">Judy Olang.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Praise be to the Lord!

In my early years, I lived with my parents in a small town until at around the age of 10 that I moved to the village to live with my grand mother as my dad was going away to the States for further studies. I lived with my dear grandma, a praying woman for 6years. I had a normal childhood, very skinny though. I was called all sorts of names (none of them made me feel bad); I was never good at school, had to repeat two classes, graduated with no great grades to go to high school and graduated from high school also with no great grades. I was what you would call an average student. I was the shyest boy you could think of, I have battled fear all my life still does. Having come from a Christian family, I was the last one to become born again (thanks to a praying mom and dad) in my late teenage years.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Having been born again, I don&#8217;t recall being discipled but God&#8217;s hand was on my life, I<span>  <\/span>began from<span>  <\/span>humble beginnings, stumbled on the way, witnessed to my friends<span>  <\/span>though I did not know much, so I witnessed in the way I knew how. 5 years later, God would plan to move me from the land I knew all my life to The States where he would have a call for<span>  <\/span>me. Imagine moving from a soil you are used to, with people around you to help you grow strong in the Lord to a land that was totally new to me with no one but my parents. Already there were people who had come to The States born again, backslide and gave a bad testimony. This made others believe that I would fall in the same trap, that is backslide. I remember praying to God and saying &#8220;Lord, you can prove everyone wrong, if you&#8217;ve saved me, you are able to keep me even in a land where things are new, new temptations, new devils. In 1997 God moved me to The States despite the fact that I fought it. Just before I came, He gave me a picture that made no sense but we know God knows what He is doing. He showed me that transplanting me from what I was used to, to a new ground will be hard for me.<span>  <\/span>It&#8217;s like you take a plant growing in a seed bed with others, looking good<span>  <\/span>healthy and sheltered,<span>  <\/span>then moving it to a new ground exposed to everything else. Chances are, the first few weeks and months it will look like its dying, the green leaves might turn brown and fall off but the roots will continue to dig deep with new changes. That is what happened to me, my first year was hell, temptations left and right, no friends, the girl I was dating hoping to marry broke up with me, thought I would be raised to be a singer or worship leader, that went down the drain, struggled to pray even for 10 minutes all my life, had no peace but God knew. I had my parents around who had been such a great encouragement but it felt like God was taking me through a wilderness experience, to refine me. The desire to be used of Him was there, the process is what I did not know..<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">In the midst of drying season, the Lord began to minister to my heart; the first thing He gave me was PEACE THAT SURPASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING. He began to teach me how to ENCOURAGE MYSELF IN HIM and ENCOURAGE OTHERS, and He began to teach me to PRAY effectively. This is 5 years after being saved far away from home. I moved from just sitting down doing nothing but knowing I am going to heaven to being pregnant and refusing to die with what God was depositing in me as I opened my heart to His leading. I was a nobody as you have read already. I saw a young man preach to the youths one day and I said to myself and to the Lord, &#8220;Lord if you can use him to preach, you can use me to preach&#8221;, it wasn&#8217;t out of jealousy, it was out of a heart that felt there was more God could do through a life yielded to Him for His own glory. See God loves to take the nobodies who are open to Him and use them as He<span>  <\/span>displays His glory that people may see His power and trust in Him. God began to teach me to preach to the youths, in churches but my main calling was to be a prayer warrior. Right when I thought what He called me to do was established to now be maintained, He opened a door for me to come and work for GE with no college education (I hope to complete soon praise God), landed in a good job but It was clear from day one that my coming to GE would not be to make money but do ministry. The first three years were a little quiet, nothing major. Got to do ministry one on one here and there. It would be clear of what the Lord had called me to do when a friend of mine who would always stop by my desk having seen me with a bible ask me a few questions in relation to the bible. Not long after she got saved and I was the first people she shared with her conversion. When France Neptune shared her testimony of her salvation with me, God stirred my heart to email her words of encouragements which was now turning into a discipleship opportunity for her and a few people I knew were Christians. . I did not have any big vision for anything, what started as little encouragement here and there turned into a ministry. <\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">I did not know how best to disciple, that is when the idea to send devotions was birthed. With my poor writing skills, wasn&#8217;t sure how that would work and how I would do it, I began slowly by slowly trusting the Lord who stirred my heart to help me through. What was to be like once a week snowballed to 5 days a week. With struggle to read the bible and no bible college experience, only God could raise me up to do the impossible. All the college trainings are great and hope to complete them and I praise God for the workings through them, it appears<span>  <\/span>God chose to work with me differently first and that has humbled me the most. The devotion ministry broke out reaching 7 people to reaching<span>  <\/span>hundreds<span>  <\/span>into the thousands all over the world with India being our biggest team, thanks to Jemima Elizabeth whom God used to open the door to India. Pastor Phil and my dad Boaz came on board and ministered with me as the Lord enabled them. We&#8217;ve reached people in the US, India, Africa, South America, Canada, Australia, UK etc. If it wasn&#8217;t for the devotion ministry, I would not be strong in the word today. Again, it&#8217;s not about ability, it&#8217;s about availability, God enabling those who trust Him. I chose to avail myself to God for His use that He would get more glory out of a life with nothing.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">I thought to myself, God, you have now done enough and you are done with me. Thinking He could now maintain all that He had done in my life, that is when I began to be challenged by Pastor Phil&#8217;s life and passion to reach the lost. I used to believe that because God had called me to be a prayer warrior, all he required of me was to pray for everyone including those who would go out without Him expecting me to be out there. Well it became clear that I pray for them and for myself then I put legs to my prayers and go out and reach the lost. Having battled fear all my life and now stepping out to reach the lost was tough but I trusted the Lord. I learnt how to witness effectively and praying to God to use me in this capacity. I started by putting a team together to go out on the streets weekly to pass out gospel tracts and witness. After about a year or so, everyone in the team had moved on and I did not have anyone to go out with so I shelved the street evangelism for a while, while reaching out to some people at work. Last year I prayed a simple prayer, I said, &#8220;Lord give me courage to fight this fear in me and give me boldness to step out on the streets and witness even if I have no one to go with&#8221;. God honored that prayer, He gave me boldness while still battling fear and I began going out by myself and then my friend AJ who has been my prayer partner for years would join me once in a while. Pastor Phil has been great in encouragement in this area.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">For about 8 years I patiently waited for the Lord to bless me with my companion, the flesh of my flesh and the bone of my bones. It was definitely tough to wait while seeing my close friends getting married<span>  <\/span>and moving forward. Even with that I waited patiently trusting the Lord and continuing to do His work faithfully while waiting on Him. God is faithful, in due time He blessed me with my beautiful godly woman. She was worth the wait. We are truly blessed of Him not because we have everything we desire but because we know in whom we have believed. As Pastor John Piper always says, &#8220;God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him&#8221;, hope I got the quote right . One of the things that has been a blessing to me is watch my wife grow more in the Lord over the last two years or so through tough time for us especially for her.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">When we met, we were completely at different levels in our spiritual lives. With her in school and facing different challenges, her spiritual life was deteriorating to the point that reading the bible and praying was a struggle for her. It was tough and discouraging at times and we would even bump heads because I felt like I had to push her to do something about her spiritual life. Anyway, I began to realize that the Lord had not just brought us together to build a relationship but to also help jump start her spiritual life. It took a lot of patience mostly just living by example and encouraging her little by little. Her growth in the Lord has been tremendous and I praise God for that. I know the Lord will continue to raise her to be the woman He wants her to be. (PATIENCE IS KEY IN A MARRIAGE), God uses it to refine us.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2008 the majority in our church elected this ordinary guy to serve on the board for three years, at work I have seen people come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ in the last few months or so. I have seen lives changed to God be the glory. Those who know me know that I am a very regular guy, not super spiritual, I love fun, down to earth and things like that but in all that, my strength lies in prayers. I am a firm believer that if the Lord could raise me, He can raise anyone. I could say believe in yourself and all could be great but that will be a lie, there is nothing good in our us except God. All a person can do is believe in God and trust Him to work through him or her for His glory. The scripture at the beginning of this devotion testifies of this about Paul who though many believed was a mighty man of God, confesses his weaknesses that drove him to depend on God. This is part of my testimony and I pray and hope that it will cause you to think differently. It&#8217;s not about ability, it&#8217;s about availability.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n <\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1 Corinthians 2: 1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. 2 For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. 3 I was with you in weakness, in fear, and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1226","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-jM","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1226","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1226"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1226\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1226"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1226"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1226"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1225,"date":"2009-03-02T20:57:00","date_gmt":"2009-03-03T03:57:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/03\/02\/testimonies-are-weapons-too\/"},"modified":"2009-03-02T20:57:00","modified_gmt":"2009-03-03T03:57:00","slug":"testimonies-are-weapons-too","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/03\/02\/testimonies-are-weapons-too\/","title":{"rendered":"Testimonies Are Weapons&nbsp;Too"},"content":{"rendered":"<p> <!--  \/* Font Definitions *\/  @font-face \t{font-family:&quot;Cambria Math&quot;;

by the word of their testimony&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A product has just come on the market. First it was invented, thereafter produced. The finished product was put into test before it could be rolled out into the market to be used. The commercial and infomercials often bring people who are said to have used a product to give a testimony of their findings when they used it. Isn&#8217;t it always easy to trust someone&#8217;s judgment and approvals based on their experience on something? When someone comes and tells you that they know the product well and you can trust it, chances are you will go for it based on their testimony.<span>  <\/span>It&#8217;s hard to want to be the first one to try something out if not sure of whether it will work or not. This is what testimonies are to us, a point of reference coming handy. I believe people relate more to testimonies than teaching and preaching. In John 10:38, &#8220;&#8230;even though you do not believe Me or have faith in Me, [at least] believe the works and have faith in what I do, &#8230; (amplified). The miracles Jesus did had such powerful testimonies people would not deny and those who desired miracles at least heard testimonies from all over and that built their faith to desire a miracle.<\/p>\n<p>The way I look at it and I may be wrong, the testimony times are becoming less and less in peoples lives even in the church. People are afraid to testify because they think someone else will think they are well off. Afraid people might think you are boasting. You don&#8217;t see your testimony making an impact in someone&#8217;s life so why testify. I know for sure that testimonies not only builds someone&#8217;s faith to believe God for what they are going through, but it builds your faith too trust God more as you face a new challenge. Remember the story of David and Goliath in 1Samuel 17, David comes to the field and finds that Goliath had put a threat in the lives of the Israelites. No one had the ability and capacity to face this giant. Not only are we told in the same chapter that he was a giant, the bible takes the time to describe who he was, a well trained soldier, dressed for battle and had strong battling tools, the bible shows us that the giant was no ordinary wimp. David shows up untrained, has no weapons and very young. After telling King Saul that he was ready to challenge the giant, they tried to discourage him because of his size, no war experience and did not come prepared after all he was in the field because he was asked to bring food to his brothers. What made them let him face the giant? It&#8217;s when he gave his testimony 1Samuel 17:34, &#8220;But David said to Saul, &#8220;Your servant has been keeping his father&#8217;s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, 35 I went after it struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. 36 Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. 37 The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Revelation 12:11, &#8220;And they overcame him &#8230; by the word of their testimony&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know whether you realize that testimonies are vital weapon to overcome. Here is something to think about, do you think it&#8217;s the stone from David&#8217;s sling that brought Goliath down? I doubt it; I believe the stone merely finished what David had started in his testimony. Imagine while David was testifying, Goliath was hearing David saying how he went after a lion and a bear and killed them. I believe David&#8217;s testimony weakened Goliaths knees because though Goliath was seeing a young man, his size had nothing to do with what he could do through God. David over came his Goliath by the word of his testimony. Do you realize that your testimony could accomplish what no teachings or preaching could accomplish? When was the last time you testified to someone of what God had done in your life? Did you ever testify to yourself when a challenge came your way to weaken the knees of your challenge? Did you ever know that a testimony was a weapon that should constantly be used?

Just   read your devotion titled <u>I Labored For Rachel.<\/u> Forwarded by my church   friend Prathima. First let me thank God and people like you who make a huge   difference in lives of others, through their insights and experiences with   the living God who is so real and personal that it just blows me off when I   think about his love and forgiveness which in true senses hands down I dont   deserver at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;color:black;\"><!--[if   !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;color:black;\">But bible says it is not I but HE who has chosen me   even before I was formed in my mothers womb. Your devotion has really blessed   me personally for difference reasons, of late Gods been dealing with me about   people who comes into our lives to fulfill his purpose and will and suddenly   its time for them to walk away for good. I been upset with God over the years   cause the girl with whom I was in relationship was not really sure to marry   me. But today when I look back why he did not allow me to marry her I fall on   my knees cause he knew exactly that we were not made for each other it was   good for both of us to part ways. Since then God been good and faithful to me   in thick and thin. I am becoming too personal with this mail.

The enemy may even discourage the people around such a person that in turn these people discourages the person whose trust is in the Lord. A man who trusts in the Lord goes into prayer and fasting because he is pregnant and knows his life depends on it. Hezekiah was a king with a prayerful life and he totally depended on God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign as king. It&#8217;s interesting that his story is both reported in the book of 2kings 18, 19 and Isaiah 36, 37. We are given his resume in, 2kings 18:4, &#8220;He removed the high places and broke the sacred pillars, cut down the wooden image and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it, and called it Nehushtan.5 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel, so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor who were before him. 6 For he held fast to the LORD; he did not depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the LORD had commanded Moses<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">It appeared that his destroying of the bronze serpent meant he had destroyed his trust in the Lord noted by the king of Assyria but he actually destroyed the idols which were standing in the way. The Rabshakeh, a man sent by the king of Assyria to mock and attack Hezekiah and his kingdom mistakenly thought Hezekiah&#8217;s reforms in removing idols from all over the land and reestablishing central worship in Jerusalem (18:4; 2 Chr. 31:1) had removed opportunities to worship the Lord, and thus cut back on honoring Judah&#8217;s God, thereby displeasing Him and forfeiting His help in war. Well Hezekiah trusted in the Lord God of Israel. The noblest quality of Hezekiah (in a dramatic contrast to his father, Ahaz) was that he relied on the Lord as his exclusive hope in every situation. What distinguished him from all other kings of Judah (after the division of the kingdom) was his firm trust in the Lord during a severe national crisis (18:17-19:34). Despite troublesome events, Hezekiah clung tightly to the Lord, faithfully following Him and obeying His commands (v. 6). As a result, the Lord was with him and gave him success (v. 7). What a leader whose strength to give birth came from praying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Even when the enemy tried to discourage him and his people, Hezekiah knew what to do. He knew he had to draw strength from the One he had walked with. 2Kings 19:  1 And so it was, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. 2 Then he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 3 And they said to him, &#8220;Thus says Hezekiah: &#8216;This day is a day of trouble, and rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth. 4 It may be that the LORD your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.&#8217;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">I believe we too are in the day of trouble, &#8220;children have come to birth&#8221; and I could use the same line to say, there are people who are on the verge of getting saved, delivered, healed, restored but there is no strength (power of prayer) to bring or push them forth. A pregnant woman delivering a baby does not sit and wait for the baby to come out, she is encouraged to push and push until the baby comes forth. Hezekiah and his people also had to request for strength to push. For the last few months I have seen many things on the verge of being birthed but the strength to push (prayer) is lacking. I began to pray like never before and I am seeing things coming forth pushed through prayers. I will share another testimony soon. I refuse to die still pregnant with visions and dreams simply because I have no strength of prayer to push them out.

I realize that the wrestling does not happen much with everyone around but when you are left alone in your quiet time. Many have sleepless nights due to wrestling with ideas, thoughts, opinions, decisions to make, or moves to make; weighing different options and trying to evaluate whether it is the right thing to do or not. The thing about wrestling, only one can win. Wrestling is basically a struggle where strength, moves and strategies are applied with an aim to win. Wrestling to know if something is of God or just your flesh. Are you wrestling with something even right now? In all I am facing, I would rather wrestle in prayers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">One man had an encounter with God when he was left alone. Alone in his own world, in thoughts. God spoke to him to move back to his home having been mistreated by Laban. If you remember the story correctly, the reason he was at Laban&#8217;s was to flee from his brother Esau whom he had cheated off of his inheritance. He had been at peace with Laban so far, married his two daughters, had children, and possessions. Going back was tough because he had to deal with his past; Esau. Someone he ran from a long time ago and situations he ran away from he was going to face, he would not like to confront but he had to. God was going to raise him to new heights and so He brings him to confront what he ran away from, to deal with it, push through and concur. At times, you will need to be left  alone to wrestle through. You might have had people surround you, wrestle for you and fight your battles and that is okay but if God is going to make you something bigger, He will bring you to a place alone with a lot of confrontations. Times of fear should be times of prayer: whatever causes fear should drive us to our knees, to our God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">&#8220;And a Man wrestled with him until the breaking of day&#8221;. God wrestled with Jacob that day, how often do you wrestle with God? He says something according to His word and you ask how it can be. He tries to show you, but you bring in what has happened and what could have happened and the wrestling continues. All night you are wrestling yet you are not prevailing. Here is what got me, vs. 25, &#8220;Now when He (God) saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hips&#8221;. Does this mean God failed to pin Jacob? I believe the divine adversary was also the electing saving Lord who strengthened Jacob with grace to wrestle on against Himself lest he be overcome and condemned. However tried or discouraged, we shall prevail; and prevailing with Him in prayer, we shall prevail against all enemies that strive with us (Matthew Henry). It&#8217;s like we both wrestled each other and none of us prevailed because My strength is in you. vs. 26, &#8220;And He said, &#8220;Let Me go, for the day breaks&#8221; But he said, &#8220;I will not let You go unless You bless me!&#8221;. Someone who has wrestled all night wakes up tired and exhausted and we see with Jacob who wrestles and now does not want to let go because his life depends on who he&#8217;s been wrestling with. He wants to be on the same page with Him and he says, &#8220;I will not let you go unless you bless me&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">I have wrestled in my thoughts, decisions, ideas, I should have wrestled in prayers instead and I will not let Him go unless He has blessed me, showed me the way, strengthened me, provided for me, taught me how to go about it. 1Peter 5:7, &#8220;Casting all your cares upon Him; for He cares for you&#8221;. Jacob knew God cared for him otherwise he would have died that day. Anyone who encountered with God like he did in the OT could not live, he was spared and because of that, he did cast his care for a blessing from God who cared for him. Where are you today? Are you wrestling in prayers? There are blessings stored for wrestlers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Blessings  <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Evans <\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 32:24-26, &#8220;25 Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob&#8217;s hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him. 26 And He said, &#8220;Let Me go, for the day breaks.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;I will not [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1220","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-jG","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1220","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1220"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1220\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1220"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1220"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1220"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1218,"date":"2009-02-24T20:53:00","date_gmt":"2009-02-25T03:53:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/02\/24\/falling-back-on-dead-things\/"},"modified":"2009-02-24T20:53:00","modified_gmt":"2009-02-25T03:53:00","slug":"falling-back-on-dead-things","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/02\/24\/falling-back-on-dead-things\/","title":{"rendered":"Falling Back On Dead&nbsp;Things"},"content":{"rendered":"<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Good morning,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">1Samuel 28, vs. &#8220;6 And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Saul started his journey well, having been chosen by God to be king in Israel and if you read his story, he had a tragic end. Anyone can start a marathon; those who finish it are the one&#8217;s who matter. Anyone can begin the journey of faith; only those who make it to the end receive a crown of life. So it&#8217;s not how you start that defines you, its how you finish and who does help you to the finish line that counts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Saul having started well with God on his side, he would have had a glorious journey. Inquiring and trusting in the Lord day by day, obeying His word that is contrary to his later life. Having deprived himself of every legitimate means of spiritual input as a result of his own disobedience and rebellion. 1 Samuel 15: 10 Now the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying, 11 &#8220;I greatly regret that I have set up Saul as king, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not performed My commandments.&#8221; And it grieved Samuel, and he cried out to the LORD all night.&#8221;, Samuel met him and told him, &#8220;23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, And stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He also has rejected you from being king.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Samuel was dead, Saul would not heed to Samuel&#8217;s counsel. He has a battle before him; he is seeking to know the will of God concerning what they are about to face. This was to determine whether they would be subdued or subdue, 1Samuel 28, vs. &#8220;6 And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets&#8221;. He went before to inquire of the Lord, the Lord did not respond to him. The reason for not responding was due to his disobedience and lack of repentance. Instead of continuing to linger before the Lord in repentance out of a broken heart, he does not seek the Lord and goes back to dead things; witchcraft. Walking in foolishness again by seeking out the very resource (a medium) he had previously removed from the land.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">This is what happens when you disconnect yourself from the Lord by sin, lack of desire to seek Him and walk in his commandments. Instead of crying out to the Lord in repentance so as to be restored, you find that it&#8217;s easy to seek other things to bring about temporary relief so as not to deal with the root matter of the problem. You know the Lord will point out the truth so to cover up, you say, &#8220;I sought the Lord, He did not answer me&#8221;. Saul was going back to what he had removed out of his life and kingdom and isn&#8217;t that what most of us do when faced with trials and tribulations? We go back to revisiting the world we were rescued from. Instead of trusting the Lord to bless you financially, you are back to playing lotto hoping for a lucky win. Instead of praying to God for a breakthrough, you would rather depend on other means, lying, manipulations and things like that to get your way out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">My prayer daily, Lord forgive me of my sins I am aware of, the ones I don&#8217;t know, I pray like David in Psalm 139:  23 Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me, and know my anxieties;<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"> 24 And see if there is any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting&#8221;. I don&#8217;t want unconfessed sins to hinder my prayers from reaching God. I can either be like Saul who knowing his sin chose not to repent and trust God or be like David who when confronted with his sin repented of it and God forgave him and gave him life. I can confess and be made whole so as to continue my fellowship with the Lord or be like Saul fall back on dead things. What sin are you not willing to repent of and you would rather go back to what you should have been delivered from? Get rid of dead things, fall in the arms of God. Psalm 18:2, &#8220;The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; My God, my strength, in whom I will trust; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold&#8221;. The Lord is alive, why go back to dead things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Thanks<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Ev<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Samuel 28, vs. &#8220;6 And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets&#8221; Saul started his journey well, having been chosen by God to be king in Israel and if you read his story, he had a tragic end.

It was a DVD about how some mega structures have been built. One of the mega structures that caught my attention was one about building a railroad and of course they had surveyed the area by which the rail would pass. There were different obstacles with one major one a mountain in front of them. Instead of going around it which was impossible, they chose to make a way through the mountain however hard it was going to be. Attempting the impossible with what they had. Being that it was a mountain before them, they had to bring in the right tools to make that happen. They used explosives because explosives used correctly, breakthrough hard rocks to create a path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">We too are building roads to our futures and we know there are obstacles everyday, be it small or big. We have mountains standing in the way, the question is, what do we do about them? Without prayers as your explosive devise, there is no way you will breakthrough. There is something about prayers that should not be taken lightly. Prayers pave a way for God to move. Prayer works because God works through prayers. There are things God wills and then waits for His children to call on Him. Prayer is the vehicle He will use to bring things about. It shows we trust Him with what we are facing; it&#8217;s bringing the right tools into your situation. When we pray, we are bringing God into our situations for we know we can do nothing without Him. He is like the explosive that breaks through obstacles and making way for us. Psalm 18:32, &#8220;It is God who arms me with strength, And makes my way perfect&#8221;, 2 Samuel 22:33 God is my strength and power, And He makes my way perfect&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Prayer affects three different Spheres of existence as E.M. Bounds puts it, &#8220;The Divine, the angelic and the human. It puts God to work, it puts the angels to work and it puts people to work.&#8221; Prayer put&#8217;s everyone to work. Prayer is simply faith resting in, acting with, leaning on and obeying God&#8221;. Those who know their God will value prayers as their life fully depends on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">In our tough economic times and other things happening, who would you rather put your trust in, God or the government, stocks and bond or faith in God. The bible says, Psalm 20:7, &#8220;Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God&#8221;, Psalm 118:8, &#8220;It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in man&#8221;.  How will you and I show the Lord we trust Him if we don&#8217;t call upon Him in our prayers to answer us?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">This quote continues to bless my heart because it&#8217;s the heart of prayers by great missionary Hudson Taylor, he said, &#8220;The prayer power has never been tried to its full capacity. If we want to see Divine power wrought in the place of weakness, failure, and disappointment, let us answer God&#8217;s standing challenge, Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know&#8221;. The Lord says, we bring Him into the picture by praying and He will do great and mighty things. Arise O God, demonstrate your power. With what is happening, we need God now more than ever; we need to pray like we have never done before. The more we pray, the more we show the Lord we are not depending on ourselves, we are depending on Him.

The same chapter vs. 15, says, &#8220;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16 You will know them by their fruits&#8221;. How can you then know false prophets without judging first? The One who said do not judge at the beginning is giving indication that it&#8217;s ok to judge. I think the &#8220;judge not&#8221; is in reference to someone&#8217;s salvation. There could be 101 clear signs suggesting someone is not saved, the ultimate judge of their souls is God. We can share the gospel and let them examine themselves to see if they are in the faith. The judging I am still addressing today is discernment, what is going into my system must be evaluated. I hate to be deceived, deception is lethal the reason we have to judge everything preached and said by the word of God. There is a lot of preaching and teachings out here especially coming from the West that must be received with a lot of discernment. As Pastor Gregg Johnson (my pastor) preached along those lines where in Africa the west is influencing their Christianity, there are four areas he preached on that I present to you too because they are very important. As believers, we must be very careful on what we feed to our spirit and mind because many of today&#8217;s preaching may appear sound but when you apply wisdom that brings about discernment through the word of God, you find that there are a lot of errors buried in SOME truths that must be exposed if you are to overcome deception in your life. You also find a lot of misinterpretation and manipulation that comes with it. Four areas where great discernment is needed are. 1. Discern CHARACTER over CHARISMA, 2. Discern DOCTRINE over DECEPTION, 3. Discern PROPHESY over PRESUMPTION, 4. Discern MIRACLES over MANIPULATION. What is discernment and why is this important? John MacArthur shares with us on this, &#8220;In its simplest definition, discernment is nothing more than the ability to decide between truth and error, right and wrong. Discernment is the process of making careful distinctions in our thinking about truth. In other words, the ability to think with discernment is synonymous with an ability to think biblically. First Thessalonians 5:21-22 teaches that it is the responsibility of every Christian to be discerning: &#8220;But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good; abstain from every form of evil.&#8221; The apostle John issues a similar warning when he says, &#8220;Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world&#8221; (1 John 4:1). According to the New Testament, discernment is not optional for the believer-it is required. The key to living an uncompromising life lies in one&#8217;s ability to exercise discernment in every area of his or her life. For example, failure to distinguish between truth and error leaves the Christian subject to all manner of false teaching. False teaching then leads to an unbiblical mindset, which results in unfruitful and disobedient living-a certain recipe for compromise. Unfortunately, discernment is an area where most Christians stumble. They exhibit little ability to measure the things they are taught against the infallible standard of God&#8217;s Word, and they unwittingly engage in all kinds of unbiblical decision-making and behavior. In short, they are not armed to take a decidedly biblical stand against the onslaught of unbiblical thinking and attitudes that face them throughout their day. Discernment intersects the Christian life at every point. And God&#8217;s Word provides us with the needed discernment about every issue of life. According to Peter, God &#8220;has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence&#8221; (2 Peter 1:3). You see, it is through the &#8220;true knowledge of Him,&#8221; that we have been given everything we need to live a Christian life in this fallen world. And how else do we have true knowledge of God but through the pages of His Word, the Bible? In fact, Peter goes on to say that such knowledge comes through God&#8217;s granting &#8220;to us His precious and magnificent promises&#8221; (2 Peter 1:4). Discernment-the ability to think biblically about all areas of life-is indispensable to an uncompromising life. It is incumbent upon the Christian to seize upon the discernment that God has provided for in His precious truth! Without it, Christians are at risk of being &#8220;tossed here and there by waves, and carried about by every wind of doctrine&#8221; (Ephesians 4:14).&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">If you value sound doctrine, then be like Bereans, Acts 17:10, &#8221; Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea.

Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear&#8221; (NIV) The builders have stumbled upon on a biblical principle called foundation, they know that foundation is everything. Every building must or should have a foundation. Foundation is the basis on which a thing stands, is founded, or is supported. In a building, foundation is a structure that transfers loads to the earth. Foundation is not on top, it&#8217;s at the bottom holding the weight of what is to be built on it. Strong and deeper foundation goes down past the weaker upper layer of soil to reach the concrete. How deep and strong a foundation is determines what it can withstand and what is to be built on it. The foundation is THE basis or groundwork of anything. A Christian life also begins with a foundation, the question is, which one. Have you ever wondered why you serve Christ? Why you came to Him? Why you go to church? Why you listen to such and such teachings and or preaching? As I talk with people, I usually go back to address their foundation because it  gives me an idea of what kind of foundation they have and what they may be building on it. It&#8217;s amazing to me of what I hear and see as the means of many church successes around. The measure of success appears to be the size of the congregation. To see the size of the congregation continue to increase is looked at as a sign of growth. Search for series used to grow churches today and find it different from what we see in the book of Acts, the same as what has been taught and preached in the past few centuries. As the world uses sex to sell, some churches are using topics such as sex series to build the church, draw the world in, borrowing materials from the world to reach the world. Is Jesus not enough? Is He not the firm foundation? shouldn&#8217;t the success of anything is to be measured by  His will?. Many churches are becoming more secular and Christians are falling into the trap without discernment. The church has become a self help place, books are about how you can be happy, how you can achieve your goals and potentials (nothing wrong with that if it&#8217;s put in its proper place), question again is, why serve Christ?. I have listened to some people being interviewed going to bible school to become ministers who did not even understand the plan of salvation (the message of the bible), that shows no foundation. And some confessed that it was a good field to make money, wrong foundation. There are churches beginning to have set ups for discussions like talk shows, redefining foundation. Is the church not supposed to set a standard for the world?<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Paul addresses the state of the church to come and here we are today plagued by it and some have fallen right into it without discerning. He says &#8220;For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine&#8221;  and the reason is simple, no strong foundation of faith to define a believer. Easy and expedient Christianity appealing to men rather than God. I believe the church should be it for believers and the lost can come in and see believers in their God given habitat, lives changed for His glory and desire their lives changed. I believe the church ought to be a powerhouse not an entertainment field.  A CHURCH PLEASING TO GOD BEGINS WITH THE BELIEVERS, WE ARE WHAT MAKES A CHURCH. Our foundation in Christ determines what kind of church we will have. Today because of how foundation is laid, to quote John MacArthur, &#8220;Professing Christians, nominal believers in the church follow their own desires and flock to preachers who offer them God&#8217;s blessings apart from His forgiveness, and His salvation apart from their repentance. They have an itch to be entertained by teachings that will produce pleasant sensations and leave them with good feelings about themselves. Their goal is that men preach &#8220;according to their own desires. Under those conditions, people will dictate what men preach, rather than God dictating it by His Word.&#8221;  Read what General William Booth the founder of Salvation Army said as he foresaw danger that was coming. He said, &#8220;The Chief danger of Christianity in 20th century will be&#8230;Religion without the Holy Ghost; Christianity without Christ; Forgiveness without repentance; Salvation without regeneration; Politics without God; And heaven without hell&#8221;. If any of these are missing on a Christian&#8217;s foundation, only time will tell. Wrong foundation cannot last for long, trying to patch it up and support it with other things will not make it stand. Everything has to be taken out of the way and proper foundation is laid, a foundation of truth on God&#8217;s word.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">2 timothy 2:15 &#8220;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 19 Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: &#8220;The Lord knows those who are His,&#8221; and, &#8220;Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.&#8221;. The faithful preacher must proclaim the Word when it is popular and convenient or not and when it seems suitable to do so or not. The dictates of popular culture, tradition, reputation, acceptance, or esteem in the community (or in the church) must never alter the true preacher&#8217;s commitment to proclaim God&#8217;s Word and the student of the word must be open to receive the whole counsel of proclaimed word of God but again it begins with foundation. Those who have a wrong foundation will fall on the danger of 2Tim 4:3. The chief danger of a Christian life is to have wrong foundation, on what foundation is your Christian life built upon? What kind of teachings are you craving for? Where are you plugged in?<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> <\/span>Thanks <\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Ev <b><\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2 Timothy 4:3, &#8220;For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine.

Read the lyrics of many of our songs today and compare to the lyrics of some of the old hymns, way, way different. The hymns are so rich in God&#8217;s word transcending feelings so as to be grounded in truth. For the last few years or so, I have had the privilege of tapping into teachings by some long gone people mightily used of God and I find again that their preaching and teachings are far different from many of the preaching and teaching we hear today. Their messages just like in the hymns are packed with theology. Oh I praise God for the age of technology (internet) giving us the ability to find materials lost over the years. . I have learnt so much in a short time because they point me back to the scripture right at my  fingertips. I have no excuse anymore for not learning and growing more and more in the word of God.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">One thing that these men of God did was point us back to the word of God and teaching it as it is whether it made them popular or not. Their mission was to please God. Men like Charles Spurgeon, Martin Luther, John Bunyan, John Newton (wrote Amazing Grace), John Wycliffe, William and Catherine Booth, Charles Finney, DL Moody, Leonard Ravenhill, Paris Reidhead and many men that God has used through the ages. What I love about listening and reading their materials is their quest to keep the doctrine pure and defending it by all means. For instance, Martin Luther wrote: The great difference between doctrine and life is obvious, even as is the difference between heaven and earth. Life may be unclean, sinful, and inconsistent; but doctrine must be pure, holy, sound, and unchanging. Life may show omissions and come short of what doctrine calls for. But from doctrine (says Christ, Matt. 5:18 &lt;<a href=\"http:\/\/bible.logos.com\/passage\/nkjv\/Matt.%205.18\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bible.logos.com\/passage\/nkjv\/Matt.%205.18<\/a>&gt; ) not a tittle or letter may be omitted, however much life may fail to meet the requirements of doctrine. This is so because doctrine is God&#8217;s Word and God&#8217;s truth alone, whereas life is partly our own doing. On this account doctrine must remain entirely pure. God will have patience with man&#8217;s moral failings and imperfections and forgive them. But He cannot, will not, and shall not tolerate a man&#8217;s altering or abolishing doctrine itself. For doctrine involves His exalted, divine Majesty itself. In the sphere of doctrine, therefore, forgiveness and patience are out of order.32.

I run into people who say the bible cannot be fully trusted because it was written by men and my response to them is that it&#8217;s written by God through men as a pen cannot write by itself. If written by man, it would be filled with errors but it&#8217;s written by God therefore, its content is pure. The scripture addresses a lot of things and one of the things that I am addressing this morning is the Doctrine (teachings) of God&#8217;s word. Wrong understanding of the scripture opens us to error and false teachings that are easy to swallow and digest. Wrong understanding of the deity of Christ is enough to doom us to hell because without the right understanding of the true Jesus of the bible who is able to save, the wrong Jesus we think of will not save us for he does not exist.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">1 Timothy 6:20 &#8220;O Timothy! Guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane and idle babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge- 21 by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith&#8221;. This word &#8220;your trust&#8221; translates to one Greek word, which means, &#8220;deposit.&#8221; The deposit Timothy was to guard is the truth, the divine revelation that God committed to his care. Every Christian, especially if he is in ministry, has that sacred trust to guard the revelation of God (1 Cor. 4:1; 1 Thess. 2:3, 4). what is falsely called knowledge. False doctrine-anything claiming to be the truth that is in fact a lie. False teachers typically claim to have the superior knowledge (as in Gnosticism). They claim to know the transcendent secrets, but actually are ignorant and infantile in their understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">David in Psalm 138 chooses to worship the Lord on two counts, His loving kindness and His truth. Then he says something that has struck me for days For You have magnified Your word above all Your name.&#8221; I began to meditate on this line and gleaned some truth as the Lord would speak to my heart through reading and meditation, and here is my understanding of the scripture, the Lord has magnified (made it more important) His holy word to supersede everyone&#8217;s thinking of who He is, His attributes and the like. We cannot truly worship a God we do not know otherwise we end up with a god we are comfortable with, the god not revealed in the Scriptures. The Lord God Almighty delights in His word because it gives full counsel of who He is and His nature, this is the reason doctrine is vital. Paul was concerned for his son Timothy so he advised him to guard what was taught to him. Even as I share daily, I want magnify God&#8217;s word and keep it pure. I do not want to misrepresent His word and you have a responsibility to check out the scriptures to be sure I am sharing from His word. We have to be student&#8217;s of the word hungry for truth even if it&#8217;s not popular, truth sets you free.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Ev<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 138:2, &#8220;I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your word above all Your name.&#8221; I am drawn to the hymns not so much for the sound but for the packed theology in them.

There is always a word that tends to erase every good thing someone has spoken. The word is &#8220;BUT&#8221;. As long as good things are spoken without the &#8220;BUT&#8221;, we tend to be ok with it but the moment it comes in the middle, then you become troubled by it. Your concentration on it erases all the good that has been said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">In the workforce, there are people who are hard workers, they do the best they can, and they are good at what they do. They give a 110% but no one ever notices no words of appreciation, no pat on the back in fact most people concentrate on their mistakes and what has not been done more than anything else. With this they feel their presence is not significant.  You have to understand that your presence is a present (gift) to your job. It may not be your dream job, you have to remember that God has called you there as a gift to that company, job, position, department to be faithful in it. Who knows, it could be a training ground to mature your character, leadership qualities, integrity, foundation, and be a blessing to others. God sent you there for a reason.  . Until you see it in a new way, instead of being in deep rest, you will be depressed. I remember a job I had before, I did not like it, wished I could move away from it. I knew God had placed me there for a reason. I chose to take the opportunity to serve and be the best at it, I did ministry there and it was a blessing. With time, the Lord moved. Your continuous complaints and whining will mess up every victory God had channeled your way. See, the world crowns success, God crowns faithfulness. Look at Joseph, his dream job was to be a ruler, people bowing before him including his family. As a young lad, that is the thought that consumed his mind. In our times maybe his dream would be a CEO. The thought of it and speaking about it almost cost him his life. He finally finds himself in a house of an officer serving as a servant (slave). Not his dream job but he is there, no one to talk well of him but he is there. He should be complaining and murmuring but he becomes faithful in his job. I believe that instead of asking &#8220;why&#8221;, He was thanking God for the opportunity to serve in any capacity. As I shared recently, you ought to be your best encourager. If they don&#8217;t say nice things about you, speak nice things to yourself. Applaud yourself for job well done. Look yourself in the mirror and say, &#8220;He loves me in spite of and He will use me to be a blessing in my job&#8221;. &#8220;It may not be where I want to be but if I can be faithful with the little, He will make me ruler over much&#8221;. You don&#8217;t have to be liked and applauded to be successful, you got to know who you are, where you are going and who is in control to be one. That is what Joseph knew. A slave with a dream to someday be great yet beginning that greatness by laying a foundation of faithfulness.&#8221;. A slave with a dream but yet looking at his current situation as a stepping stone. If God promised him the dream, there maybe temporary setbacks and that does not mean denial. The bible says, &#8220;Do not despise the days of humble beginnings&#8221; paraphrased. . Faithfulness with time, resources, in responsibilities. Going an extra mile beyond the required duty. Extra mile is what I will call excellence mile, the mile that distinguishes you from others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"> Genesis 39:5, &#8220;So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian&#8217;s house for Joseph&#8217;s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house and in the field&#8221;. Can you see your job being blessed because your presence is significant? I believe my department, my boss, my colleagues; my surrounding is blessed because of my presence. I know that I am making an impact, it may be small but it&#8217;s significant. Joseph&#8217;s boss was blessed because of Joseph. If you are faithful over little, God will make you ruler over much. If you don&#8217;t like what you do, I&#8217;m not saying be happy and relax, I&#8217;m saying be faithful in it as you trust God for greater things. I would stop for a moment and say, &#8220;what a privilege to be entrusted with a position like this&#8221;, Matthew 5:16, &#8220;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven&#8221;. Your presence is Significant, therefore trust God and be faithful.

It becomes lethal if untamed. It&#8217;s a very small thing but has such great power. This makes me wonder whether the Lord gave us two ears and one mouth so that we will be inclined to hear more and speak less. I know the power of the tongue because I&#8217;ve said things I wished I did not, they cut deep like a sharp knife. It&#8217;s like a gun, once fired; it&#8217;s gone and cannot be retrieved. I hear people say, &#8220;Take back what you just said&#8221; as a figure of speech. I also hear some say, &#8220;speak your mind&#8221;, very dangerous request. Proverbs 18:21, tells us &#8220;Death and life are in the power of the tongue,&#8230;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:11pt;text-align:justify;margin:0;\">\n<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:11pt;text-align:justify;margin:0;\">James (Jesus half brother) is the only one I find in the Bible that describes greatly the power of the tongue. James provided several analogies that show how the tongue, even though small, has the power to control one&#8217;s whole person and influence everything in his life. He says James 3:6&#8243; And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell&#8221;. The tongue is like a wild fire seeking to be unleashed. It&#8217;s never satisfied, it&#8217;s always looking for ways to be out of control. You may feel like I do sometimes to have the last word in a conversation showing exactly its drive. It&#8217;s by the tongue that we blame and it&#8217;s by the tongue that we justify ourselves even when we are wrong. What has been used the most to try and get people out of trouble? Lying lips, the bible says, &#8220;Lying lips are abomination to the Lord&#8221;. It&#8217;s by the tongue we speak error. We backbite and contaminate or ruin other&#8217;s lives by it. Sometimes say nice things but how we say them defiles even with good intentions. It&#8217;s by the tongue that we boast the more, Luke 18 tells us of a Pharisee boasting in his prayer despising a publican praying too.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:11pt;text-align:justify;margin:0;\">Can any one put their tongue under control? James says no man can tame the tongue. He says people have tamed wild animals but have failed to tame their tongue and the reason is simple, no one has the ability on their own to tame the tongue, only God, by His power, can do this. When we guard our ways as the Psalmist says, God&#8217;s power is present in us to overcome sinning with our tongue. To be conformed to the image of Christ and Him be formed in us (Galatians 4:18-20). The psalmist says, &#8220;I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle&#8221;, a muzzle is a device that is placed over the snout of an animal to keep it from biting or otherwise opening its mouth. The muzzle is put in the mouth of an animal the times it needs it the most and our prayer to the Lord is help us muzzle our mouths so as not to sin. God&#8217;s word is a muzzle. Psalm 119:11, &#8220;Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You&#8221;.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:11pt;text-align:justify;margin:0;\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:11pt;text-align:justify;margin:0;\">How do we do it, James 1:19 So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; 20 for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God&#8221; for this to happen, we need wisdom from above James 1:5, &#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him&#8221;. Proverbs 12:18, &#8220;There is one who speaks like the piercings of a sword, But the tongue of the wise promotes health&#8221;. If from yesterday&#8217;s message we learnt what words can do in our lives, how much more do we need wisdom to know when to be quite and when to speak encouraging words that build?

On our own we are unable the reason to pray always to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves in how we hear, respond, speak. Our tongue untamed by the Holy Spirit is deadly on its own. Paul encourages Timothy his son, 2Timothy 2:23 &#8220;But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. 24 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, 25 in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth&#8221;, All these are cultivated by the fear of God we should crave for.

We have been created with a sense of desire to be accepted and feel the sense of belonging. Who does not want someone to say nice things about them? I love compliments and I believe you do too; someone to say nice things to you and a firm you. There is power in spoken words. It&#8217;s interesting to note that you can receive 10 compliments and one bad word or criticism is enough to out weigh the 10 compliments. You shift all the energy on the bad said about you.<\/p>\n<p>Lets find out how Paul dealt with a situation that could have broken some folks. Paul and a few people had just survived a shipwreck by God&#8217;s grace. They landed on an Island called Malta and the natives of that Island showed them unusual kindness, in other words, they showed these strangers extraordinary kindness as they saw how cold they were. They decided to make fire for them to keep them warm. Everyone desires to be shown kindness wherever they go, a sign of acceptance. While keeping themselves warm, Paul went about collecting more sticks for the fire.<\/p>\n<p>As Paul was throwing sticks he had gathered into the fire, suddenly a snake jumped out of the fire due to heat and fastened itself around his wrist. He had just survived a shipwreck, and out of the fire a dangerous snake jumps out and coils around his wrist; someone could say Paul was having a bad day. You put more sticks into your fire, you will be surprised to see how many snakes jump out. Only the heat of the fire can reveal them. Be ready for they will jump out of the fire and attack you. As you go deeper and deeper with the Lord, expect snakes jumping out of the fire to coil around your wrist. People&#8217;s words will jump out and get hold of you, the question is, will you let their venom run through your system and kill you? The more I serve the Lord, the more I get attacked and the more I run into people who try to do things to make me want to curse, be discouraged, throw things and say that&#8217;s it, but I choose not to.<\/p>\n<p>Vs. 4, &#8220;So the natives saw the creatures hanging from his hand, they said to one another, &#8220;No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow him to live&#8221;. Remember these people showed them kindness, this new situation changes their mind about Paul, he is now considered a murderer. People can change their minds in seconds if you stumble no matter what good records you have had. One little mistake will override many if not all the good you have done. You cannot live by people&#8217;s acceptance to make it in life, just because some people do not accept you for you are does not change God&#8217;s mind about reaching out to you. I don&#8217;t hear anywhere where God runs around looking for votes from people about whether He should bless you or not, you are the one who needs to forget those things which are behind and press on for the things which are before if you want God to bless you.<\/p>\n<p>Paul already knew God was keeping him a live to serve Him. He had already survived the worse at that time compared to this challenge. Regardless of what they thought of him, he did not care, he shook off the snake  off his wrist and into the fire. &#8220;These signs shall follow them that believe, in my name thy shall cast out devils, they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not harm them, Mark 16:17&amp;18? He did not care about what they thought of him, He thought about who cared for him. Everyone was waiting for him to drop dead and so are some who have called Christians fanatics. One thing happened in your life and many people are waiting to see what will happen to you, but you got to shake it off into the fire. Shake off men&#8217;s opinions. Shake off confusion, frustration, bitterness, resentments, worry, doubts, and brokenness into the fire. These are things that try to coil themselves around your wrist when you are adding more sticks into your fire. Don&#8217;t sit and analyze the snake and see what&#8217;s going to happen, shake it off at once.<\/p>\n<p>The funny thing about the story is that, after the natives of the island waited for a while to see if Paul would fall and die, they saw that, Paul was ok and the snake&#8217;s bite had not effect on him,  so they changed their minds about him. Paul could have sat there and tried to defend himself about not being a murderer but his actions proved he was a man of God. You may never change the minds of people about what they think of you even if you explain, your actions will shut their mouths. What is it that is coiling around your wrist this morning, be of good cheer it&#8217;s a sign that your fire is burning.

I usually joke about two things I&#8217;m allergic to, sin and pain. There are no two things I can think of that have destroyed many men of God, like sexual sin and greed. This continues to plague men daily in a sexually charged world and a world of greed. In the age of Internet, TV, movies, magazines, beaches, dressings etc all around has created a challenge for many men and some women, something we call &#8220;every man&#8217;s battle&#8221;. I think that the level of temptations faced by David, Solomon, Samson others in the past cannot be compared to what we face today and yet the standard of God&#8217;s purity for man has not changed and never will. It&#8217;s easy to try and poke holes in God&#8217;s word to find something to justify the sin, we need to always remember, God&#8217;s word is truth and has no revised edition to fit our time. The word was set to address everything in any age. God&#8217;s still hold&#8217;s us to the highest standard revealed in the Holy Scriptures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Your true Christianity is not what you display before people; your true Christianity is who you are when no one is around. It&#8217;s where your walk is defined and this is a challenge to many men.  The lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world, are the two fatal rocks on which multitudes split; against these Job protests he was always careful to stand upon his guard. While Job was facing his trial moments, he reflected on his life and one thing that he mentions is that he made a covenant with his eyes not to look lustfully at a girl (woman). When God allowed Satan to take away everyone and everything from Job, one person God wouldn&#8217;t touch was his wife. I believe the reason being, the presence of his wife would remind him of the covenant he made to God and to her and that would help him be pure before God and stand through it all. Job made a covenant to be pure before God and honor his wife by keeping his eyes on her and her alone regardless.  Of course opportunities might have presented themselves to sway him but he kept on remembering his covenant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">How often does opportunities present themselves to you? You may not be looking for trouble but trouble finds you, what is your response? Does your conscious remind you of the covenant you made to your wife before God? To honor God by being faithful to her in thoughts, in words and in deeds? As my pastor would say, men of God must &#8220;Avoid the second look&#8221;, the first look my catch you off guard, the second look is a choice you make, a responsibility you are accountable for. How much commitment you show to your spouse shows how much you value purity.  The bible says, &#8220;2 Timothy 2:22, &#8220;Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&#8221;, it doesn&#8217;t say try and fight it or deal with it, you and I must run for our lives, while running from it, we will run towards righteousness, faith, love, peace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">I constantly pray that God would be more present in me and give me power to over the lust of flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life that my eyes may be fixed on Him and my wife alone. If I pull my eyes from her or if I work an appetite outside my marriage, I will be living in sin and the fear of God will be absent. Read what Job says in looking to God to search his heart in this area, vs.  9 &#8220;If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor&#8217;s door, 10 then may my wife grind another man&#8217;s grain, and may other men sleep with her&#8221;, What a scary statement but a statement that would hold him accountable to his actions if he did. The thought of someone else lusting after your wife while you lust after other people&#8217;s wives (married or not) should scare you to death. Those who are single who may be dating or looking around, be careful on how you treat those women. That could be someone&#8217;s wife if not yours (if you don&#8217;t get married to her). Those of you who look at stuff on the Internet, on magazines remember those are someone&#8217;s daughter and someone&#8217;s wife. There are men who say, &#8220;you can look at the menu and not order from it&#8221;, the Lord says something different, He said Matthew 5: 27 &#8220;You have heard that it was said to those of old, &#8216;You shall not commit adultery.&#8217; 28 But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart&#8221; in the OT, they would have looked at committing adultery as the actual act, we Christians under grace in the NT the standard is made clear, the thought is sinful.  Proverbs 6:32, &#8220;Whoever commits adultery (lust) with a woman lacks understanding; He who does so destroys his own soul&#8221; Matthew Henry, &#8220;Those that would keep their hearts pure must guard their eyes, which are both the outlets and inlets of uncleanness&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">To make a covenant is to make an agreement. Would you and I make a covenant daily not to look with lust (both married and single men and struggling women&#8221;? To flee lust? To love God and our wives with a pure heart is hard, we cannot do it by ourselves that is why we need to pray to God for grace and strength to overcome the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life, Philippians 4:13, &#8220;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me&#8221;.

If your understanding is that Christ died on the cross to make you happy, then all you will seek is ways to be happy and build your life on happiness. Christ did not come to make us happy, He came to make us righteous, right with God, everything else is filtered through it. 2 Corinthians 5:21, &#8220;For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him&#8221;, not righteousness for season but for a life time. What profits in the day of wrath (judgment)?

When he does not truly know God. The world has their own perception thought of God. They&#8217;ve gone to the extent of creating their own god to suit themselves. People have created their own plan of salvation, establishing their own righteousness. The question is, is it the true one. I hear people say, &#8220;my god would never do that?&#8221;, yes their personal god will never, he is not the God of heaven as revealed in the bible. Knowing the God of heaven is knowing His TRUE NATURE which is revealed to us through the ten commandments (law).  He reveals Himself in the spirituality of His law. That is where His righteousness and perfect purity of character are revealed for men to learn it there. To be honest, I don&#8217;t see the ten commandments as laws imposed on mankind to learn and follow, I believe it&#8217;s primary work is to reveal to us who God is and who we truly are. It exposes our so called righteousness and creates a thirst for His righteousness. Those who are not soundly saved are ignorant of God&#8217;s righteousness and with that, they have created a god to suit themselves, a god they are comfortable with to which if you probed more, you will discover they are their own gods. They may not admit it but that is true, captain of their own destiny. Proverbs 16:2, &#8220;All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the heart&#8221;. I see this a lot when I talk with the unsaved.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Again, men are ignorant of God&#8217;s righteousness when they do not understand His method of making sinners righteous. For someone to be made righteous, they must be living in sin. Sin is the opposite of righteousness. What is sin?  1John 3:4, &#8220;Sin is transgression of the law&#8221;. In other words it&#8217;s an offense against religious or moral law. If we have this definition, then we can say that without the law, there can be no sin. What does the law have to do with I&#8217;m sharing on sharing on? Cause men are ignorant of the righteousness of God when they do not know and understand the laws of God which reveals what sin is. The bible says, Romans 3:20, &#8220;By the law is the knowledge of sin&#8221;.  Paul says to us in Romans 7:7, &#8220;&#8230;I would have not known sin except through the law&#8221;. Paul tells us that he did not know what sin was until the law of God told him. So the law tells us what sin is cause it reveals who God is.  If I was to use SIN as an acronym, I would say Savior Is Needed. How can a person truly repent and be saved when they do not really know what sin is? How can they submit to the righteousness of God if they are ignorant of it. This is the reason that even for those who are saved ought to preach to themselves the gospel daily they may hunger and thirst for righteousness. Crucifying the flesh that craves for happiness that we may live a righteous life, a life pure before God. Romans 14:17, &#8220;for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Often times we hear the messages of God&#8217;s love and mercy. They are powerful messages we all embrace because without them we have nothing at all. At times we hear God&#8217;s justice yet we don&#8217;t see God&#8217;s justice simply because we have never understood it, who it applies to and when it ought to be applied. Some feel that God is love and therefore cannot serve justice cause that will make Him unjust. The bible says, Psalm 89:14, &#8220;Righteousness and Justice are the foundations of His throne&#8221;. He is the God of faithfulness, without injustice, good and upright is He. Lawlessness would not require justice and there can be no government without the laws governing their country. The law is the primary reason why we have justice. If there is no law, what shall justice be based on?<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">We as believers need to crave to be as righteous as He is and bring others in the light of His righteousness. I don&#8217;t hear much of justice, righteousness, holiness, purity being preached on TV but they are the foundation of His throne and the foundation of our Christianity. God has set a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness, that makes me hunger and thirst more for righteousness Acts 17:3, &#8220;because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.&#8221; Matthew 6:33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness&#8221;, Are you hungry and thirsty for His righteousness? Then you and I have to submit to His in prayer, in dying to self, in crucifying the flesh, in submission otherwise we are doomed.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Thanks <\/span><\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Ev<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 10:3, &#8220;For they being ignorant of God&#8217;s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God&#8221;.

I hope this message and the ones I have shared this week on faith will impact your life. Here is the message. Acts 12:5-18, 5 &#8220;Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church&#8221; Peter in prison! What a jolt!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">We are too far removed from the actual scene to catch the atmosphere of dismay the Christians of that day felt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Peter had moved from Pentecost to prison, from jeers to spears. He was guarded by sixteen soldiers. One wonders why such a defenseless man needed such a group to watch him. Could it be that Herod feared the supernatural, seeing he knew that Jesus escaped such a group that guarded Him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Had Peter been hedged in by sixteen hundred soldiers, the problem would not have been increased nor the escape less sure. Peter was bound not only by two chains, but also by the thick walls of the prison, by the three wards of the prison, and finally by an iron gate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">When Peter is in prison, does the church organize a plan to get him released? No. When Peter is jailed, do the believers offer a plea to Herod or suggest a price to offer the lawmakers for his freedom? No. Peter had released others at the hour of prayer; now others must believe for his release.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Right through the book of Acts, which might be called The Acts of Prayer, we find prayer and more prayer. Dig into the book and discover this power that motivated the early church. In the twelfth chapter of Acts we find a group that prayed. Though a host encamped against Peter, in this were these believers confident: there was a God who could and would deliver. The one never-failing rescue operation was prayer. There was no hedging about in the prayers of those who made intercession for Peter. Prayer was made without ceasing by the church unto God for him. They did not seem to be concerned whether Herod should die or not. They did not pray that they might escape Peter&#8217;s fate. They were not asking that they have another exodus to a more hospitable country. They prayed for one person: Peter. They prayed for one thing: his release. The answer proves the point: &#8220;Whatsoever ye shall ask,&#8230; that will I do&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Some shabby interpreters of this story have said that when the pray-ers heard that Peter was at the door, they were unbelieving. I cannot accept this assumption. I am sure that they prayed with expectation. I like to think that they were for the moment staggered by the immediacy of the answer. They could be excused if they raised their eyebrows when Peter said, &#8220;I got out quite easily with an angel escort &#8221; (Next time you pass through the magic self-opening door at your supermarket, remember that the first door to open of its own accord was operated from above!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Angel deliverances seem to find no place in our modern theology. Perhaps we would like the Lord to answer our prayers with the least embarrassment to us. After all, who expects that the angelic ranks should be disturbed just to bring deliverance to a praying soul? But supernatural results came for many of the praying saints of apostolic days. The Lord geared a property-damaging earthquake to get deliverance for an apostle. Prayer is dynamite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">There is no weapon formed against prayer that can neutralize it. Some things can delay answers to prayer, but nothing can stop the full purpose of God. &#8220;Though it tarry, wait for it.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">The first requirement in prayer is to believe. -Believe that God is and that &#8220;he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&#8221; -Believe that God is alive and therefore has power-not only for Peter&#8217;s deliverance, but for ours. -Believe that God is love and that He cares for His own. -Believe that God is power and therefore no power can stand against Him. -Believe that God is truth and therefore cannot lie. -Believe that God is kind and that He will never abdicate His throne or fail in His promise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Reflecting on the story of Peter, I am rebuked, humiliated, chagrined, stung. Why? Because there are some great modern saints, Watchman Nee for one, who for years have suffered and been held captive by communists and others. Many of the saints today are shut up in prison. The same fate has befallen some of God&#8217;s choice witnesses in Vietnam and in the Congo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Such perils to other members of the Body demand concern, concentration, and consecration to a committed plan of prayer on their behalf. I fear that prayer has not been made to God without ceasing for these suffering kinsmen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Mr. Bunyan shows us his Christian held captive by the Giant Despair in Doubting Castle. The key to his deliverance was Promise. We Christians are in captivity on many levels today personal, domestic, church, and missionary enterprise. But fetters break and dungeons fall when prayer is made by the church unto God- -Prayer without ceasing; -Prayer that might shatter our status quo; -Prayer that drains us of every other interest; -Prayer that excites us by its immense possibilities; -Prayer that sees God as the One that rules on high, almighty to save; -Prayer that laughs at impossibilities and cries, &#8220;It shall be done&#8221;; -Prayer that sees all things beneath His feet; -Prayer that is motivated with desire for God&#8217;s glory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">The praying of the believer can become a ritual. The place of prayer is more than a dumping ground for all our anxieties, frets, and fears. The place of prayer is not a place to drop a shopping list before the throne of a God with endless supplies and limitless power.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">I believe the place of prayer is not only a place where I lose my burdens, but also a place where I get a burden. He shares my burden and I share His burden. &#8220;My yoke is easy and my burden is light.&#8221; To know that burden, we must hear the voice of the Spirit. To hear that voice, we must be still and know that He is God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">This calamitous hour in the affairs of men demands a church healthier than the one we have. This blatant manifestation of evil in the youth and in the violation of God&#8217;s commandments throughout the world calls for a faith that will not shrink.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Can we let our prayer swords rust in the scabbards of doubt? Shall our prayer harps hang tuneless on the willows of unbelief -If God is a god of matchless power and incredible might, -If the Bible is the unchangeable Word of the living God, -If the virtue of Christ is as fresh today as when He first made the offering of Himself to God after His resurrection, -If He is the one and only mediator today, -If the Holy Spirit can quicken us as He did our spiritual fathers, Then all things are possible today. The seas were boiling, the winds were howling, the sails were tearing, the spars were flying, the stars were hiding, Euroclydon was blasting. The people were cringing and crying, sobbing and sighing. One man alone was praising. All were expecting death save Paul. Amidst a scene of hopelessness, if ever there was one, Paul cries, &#8220;Sirs, I believe God&#8221; (Acts 27).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">As things seem to fall apart these days, I am going to join Paul. I am going to say in faith, &#8220;Sirs, I believe God.&#8221; Will you join me?<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, In light of what we&#8217;ve been sharing, I came a cross a message that blessed my heart by the late Leonard Ravenhill.

Today let me tackle one faith killer called disappointment and how in disappointment you can master faith to over come it without it killing your faith. If you&#8217;ve never been disappointed, be sure it will come&#8230; Disappointed in your job, relationship, boss, children, church, friends. Either you will disappoint someone or they will be disappointed by you, that is a fact of life. Disappointment simply means a feeling of dissatisfaction that results when your expectations are not realized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Disappointments go hand in hand with shock because it just darned to you that what you had hopes for, worked for, groomed, expected has turned out to be something else. Shock leads to lock in, being extra careful, cautious and not ready to go through the same path again because of what you experienced last time. Often times disappointments leave people disoriented, confused leading them to want to do something they will regret later. It could lead to trying to frustrate the person who has disappointed you so as to get even with them or lead you to stay away. It&#8217;s easy to want to withdraw from trying again because you&#8217;ve disappointed. The bible says, &#8220;a righteous man falls 7 times but keeps on rising&#8221;, men of faith look at disappointments differently, they see them as temporary setbacks; blessings delayed but not denied. How can one deal with disappointments? I really don&#8217;t have a concrete answer but let me share with you how God has taught me to deal with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">First lets look at three men Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. These men were brought from Israel to serve in the land of Babylon but not as slaves. Men required for the job had to be, Daniel 1:4, &#8220;young men in whom there was no blemish, but good-looking, gifted in all wisdom, possessing knowledge and quick to understand, who had ability to serve in the king&#8217;s palace, and whom they might teach the language and literature of the Chaldeans&#8221;. These men had the qualifications. They saw themselves living in the king&#8217;s palace, serving in the high ranks and they did until one day a decree was passed that everyone was expected to bow to an idol. I can imagine them being disappointed because what they hoped for has been changed. They came to serve the king but not his gods, they had their true God whom they were serving and living for. They had been faithful to the Almighty God, why would they be in a place of disappointment at this time? Had they known&#8230;. Anyway, after a while, it&#8217;s explained to them of their destiny if they don&#8217;t bow and worship an idol, the furnace heated seven. Some would have compromised their stand but not these men, they said, Daniel 3:16-18, &#8220;&#8230;, &#8220;O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 17, If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18, But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.&#8221; Why  would they speak this way in this situation?, They had shock absorbers, faith in God. Unless you have shock absorbers, disappointments will ruin your life. What are shock absorbers? Shock is a violent collision or impact, simply  a heavy blow what disappointments are. Absorbers means enduring or accommodating. Cars have absorbers to help steady the impact on the bumps and pot holes it might or will hit. Shock absorbers help level what is already there and that is what the three young men did. I believe they looked at what the Lord had done in their lives. The qualities and the abilities they had that some other young men did not have and that became their shock absorbers. Though disappointed in one area, what had been done could not be compared to what lied a head of them. Because of that, they were able bounce back with a message, &#8220;Our God whom we serve is able&#8230;&#8221;, their shock absorber was on what God had done and what God could do, &#8220;&#8230;But if not&#8230;&#8221;, this is not statement of doubt, it&#8217;s statement of &#8220;whatever brings Him more glory, let Him do it&#8221;, you can not make a statement like this without having your shock absorbers. These men&#8217;s minds were made up, their disappointments could not keep them down. Would you allow your disappointments to keep you down when you have your shock absorbers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Bounce back, shake it off, get right back on the track, move on, put everything that has happened in the past only carry what can boost you a head. Don&#8217;t quit!! 2 Corinthians 4:8 We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed&#8221; , Don&#8217;t allow your disappointments to dictate what your faith, you can use them to create new appointments, build more faith in you. For the three men, their disappointments allowed them to see God in a new dimension cause they created appointments out of them.

He had weakness and strengths. Peter was an ordinary fisherman who walked with Jesus. His walk with Christ changed his life and I don&#8217;t believe any one can walk with Christ and not be changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">29&#8243; So He said, &#8220;Come.&#8221; And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus&#8221;. Jesus was God to have walked on water; Peter was a man, the first man to ever walk on water. God walking on water was expected, He is God He can do anything.  Greater testimony I see is when God takes an ordinary life and does something extraordinary in that life, glorifying Himself through that life. Even if it was for a short time due to little faith, he attempted something no man ever dared try or even have faith in someone else to make him or her do it. Think about it, for that short time he walked on water, he just gave God all the glory because he proved to the rest of the disciples and to us all that Christ is able to make us do the impossible if we believe. Also shows the Lord keeps His promises. Peter said, &#8220;command me to come to You on the water&#8221;, the Lord said &#8220;Come&#8221;, a seal of His approval and the ability to make it happen. Peter took the Lord at His word, asking no questions and walked on water towards Jesus. That is daring faith, taking the Lord at His word even if it does not make sense. .<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">How is God glorified in us in such a daring faith? Here is something to ponder on &#8220;If someone says to you, &#8220;You&#8217;re a man of great faith in God,&#8221; they may think that they are paying you a compliment. But they aren&#8217;t &#8212; the compliment is to God. For example if I said to you, &#8220;I&#8217;m a man of great faith in my doctor,&#8221; it&#8217;s actually the doctor I&#8217;m complimenting. If I have great faith in him, it means that I see him as being a man of integrity, a man of great ability -that he is trustworthy. I give &#8220;glory&#8221; to the man through my faith in him. The Bible says that Abraham &#8220;He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.&#8221; (Romans 4:20-21). Abraham was a man of great faith in God. Remember, that is not a compliment to Abraham. He merely caught a glimpse of God&#8217;s incredible ability, His impeccable integrity, and His wonderful faithfulness to keep every promise He makes. His faith gave &#8220;glory&#8221; to a faithful God.&#8221; By Ray Comfort. And so was Peter&#8217;s and so should ours. This is the faith that is not comfortable with the normal territories; it&#8217;s faith in action complimenting God. It&#8217;s his faith finding an open heart seeking to please God, making Him look good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">To not have faith in God is to show He is not able and cannot be trusted to perform what He has promised, what an insult and that is sin, Romans 14:23, &#8220;&#8230;for whatever is not from faith is sin&#8221;.  God has given us an awesome challenge to respond to. Jeremiah 33:2 &#8220;Thus says the LORD who made it, the LORD who formed it to establish it (the LORD is His name): 3 &#8216;Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.&#8221; Only those who have daring faith dare to respond to God&#8217;s challenge. There are three responders to this challenge, The Jawbones &#8211; they are talkers but no action, they make promises to one day respond to the challenge and never doest. The Wishbones &#8211; are wishing ones, always wishing something would happen but never stepping out by faith. The Backbones &#8211; are the ones who respond to the challenge, call on God and step out by faith. I want to be a backbone, I have chickened out of things I should have been trusting God to bring because I wanted to be on the safe grounds. Safe grounds did not demand much (prayer, faith, fasting). And I feel I have robbed God of the glory for Himself He could have gained if I only had the faith to operate in the unfamiliar territories. This is the prime product, the benefits are results from trust, the bible says, &#8220;God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him&#8221; Hebrews 11:6.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Two greatest things I have come across that the disciples ever requested of the Lord, 1. Teach us to pray, Luke 11:1 and 2. Lord increase our faith, Luke 17:5. To have asked for these two, they may have been tired of operating on the familiar and desired more, more of what the Lord had for them. They did not ask to be taught to preach, to relate, to even perform miracles. What are you asking of the Lord? You cannot pray without faith and you cannot have faith and not pray. It&#8217;s just three weeks ago when God performed a miracle, a plane with 155 passengers on board safely landed on Hudson River with no life lost. The plane did not even sink. I believe the Lord has used this incident to increase my faith. He proved He is able to do even greater things. I am done with breadcrumbs faith; I am going for the whole bread, what He has promised. I have things I am trusting God for this year and I am believing God for daring faith, hope you join me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Thanks <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Ev<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning.

The many faith teachings I&#8217;ve listened to are more about what God can do for you financially and health wise. And if you&#8217;ve listened to the same, be enlightened that here is more to faith than that. Teachings on faith today mostly dwell on by products of faith and less of it as prime product which is the essence of faith. We find that often times too many of us have enough faith for breadcrumbs and not enough for a whole bread, what He has promised. Faith enough to get us by and not ready to welcome anything else that will challenge us to grow more our faith in God.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Let me share on faith that&#8217;s beyond getting us stuff, faith that brings about more glory to God in our lives. It&#8217;s not what you will gain from God that is priority, it&#8217;s what God will gain for Himself through you, the rest are benefits. That is where the Prime product supersedes the by product. Faith ought to distinguish us from the world for we are not walking by sight but by faith; not by luck but by faith. Faith in what? Faith in God activated on unfamiliar territories. If &#8220;faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&#8221;, Hebrews 11:1, then how do we hope for what we see in the familiar territories? I believe that if we are not walking by faith,(trusting God for great and mighty things), we are robbing God of the glory He could gain from working in us and through us.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">In our text, Jesus had just fed 5 thousand men besides women and children with five loaves of bread and two little fish. Right after, He made His disciples go on the boat to the other side while He sent the multitude home. He then went to pray and then to meet them later. 24 &#8220;But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary&#8221;, come to think of it and I could be wrong, most miracles that involved ONLY the disciples appeared to be happening in water (lake, sea) and that is fascinating to me. First, the sea was an unfamiliar territory, they were far from everyone else and the usual. In the sea, they had no one to trust in but God, they couldn&#8217;t even put their faith in each other to bring them through. Everything they tried to do could not succeed. The obstacles they faced happened in the middle of the sea, in the middle of darkness and not at the shore. These were places where they could not operate by sight but by faith. And I believe that we will never trust God for great and mighty things as long as we are trading on safe grounds or familiar territories where if something does not happen as we expect it to, we have a back up plan to fall back on.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Vs 25, &#8220;Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea&#8221;, this must have been going on most of the night for when Jesus met them, between 3-6 AM, He had prayed all night while these men battled the wind all night. Jesus knew what they would be facing and still let them go, it was a faith learning class in the unfamiliar territory. He came walking on water prayed up while His disciples were hanging onto the boat for their dear lives with no avenue of escape. Then the disciples saw Him walk on water and they were afraid thinking He was a ghost.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Now the boat was just a little familiar, they have travelled by it many times and I believe that when all failed, all their little left faith (breadcrumbs) was on that boat to save them, and Here comes the King of kings, walking on water. No one had ever walked on water. And Peter all of a sudden forgets everything about what they had just gone through the night  and was still facing and says &#8220;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&#8221;  It was Peter&#8217;s idea to step out of the boat by faith, moved from asking for crumbs (wind to cease) to walk on water, while the rest were left in the boat. Desiring to step out onto what almost killed them and face it head on because the Master was present. He&#8217;s faith increased for if the Master could do the impossible and he was His disciple and a disciple ought to learn from His teacher, he mastered faith in the Lord and attempt the impossible. It&#8217;s assign that he was learning and growing. When was the last time you trusted God for something way bigger than you while in the middle of the sea? Salvation of a loved one, a miracle over what you perceived as way too bigger than even your so called back up plan. We can&#8217;t keep operating on the little faith we have when there is more we can trust God for. We got to have something, a middle of sea experience awakens, challenges and increases our faith to even step out and concur by faith what has threatened to take our lives. To walk on what could make us drown, that is faith in God. Psalm 37:4, &#8220;Delight yourself also in the LORD, And He shall give you the desires of your heart&#8221;, Without faith it&#8217;s IMPOSSIBLE to PLEASE God and to delight ourselves in the Lord is to have great pleasure in walking by the measure of His faith and not our faith that He will glorify Himself through us. Those who delight in Him He gives them desires of their heart because they are in line with His desires for us. Peter&#8217;s delight in the Lord caused the Lord to honor his desires.

A good example, when we board the plane, our faith is in the pilot to get us to our destination. We don&#8217;t dig in to find out how the plane leaves the ground, what routes it&#8217;s to takes, how much gas it has simply because we faith it has what it takes to get us where are going. I&#8217;ve never heard anyone walk over to the pilot to ask him for his qualifications, certificates to prove he is qualified to fly the plane. If Jesus is the captain of our salvation, how come it&#8217;s hard to trust Him sometimes with all?. Come to think about it, the bible says Psalm 118:8, &#8220;It&#8217;s better to trust in the Lord than to put our confidence in man&#8221; look at it closely, it&#8217;s the Lord who is in charge and not man. He may use men to accomplish what He has planned for His people. I believe that some people have made it to the other side because someone somewhere believed God for a move by faith.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">&#8220;For without faith it is impossible to please God&#8221;, straight to the point. The word &#8220;hard&#8221; is not used but &#8220;impossible&#8221;. This shows that in order to make it with God you MUST have faith. If the word &#8220;hard&#8221; was used instead, then I could see a room for compromise, the word &#8220;impossible&#8221; closes every avenue and leaves you with these four words, &#8220;have faith in God&#8221;. Why is this coming to us this morning? It&#8217;s because many have allowed Jesus to be the Savior of their lives but they have never let Him be Lord of their lives which is the basis of faith. Lordship is a powerful word as you are no longer in control of your destiny but He is. Jesus as Lord enables us to operate by faith for our lives being in His hands. If passengers entrust their lives to the Pilot, it&#8217;s high time we began to put our entire faith in Christ.  He knows where we are and where we are going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">&#8220;He that comes to God must first believe that He is a rewarder&#8221;. Who can march to someone and ask them for a million dollars if I knew they didn&#8217;t have it. When I go to the Lord&#8217;s presence, the relationship I have with Him teaches me trust and allows me to learn more that His intentions were not just to save me but do much more in my life as His son for His glory. I am confident in asking Him by faith to lead me, guide me, strengthen me, provide for me for I know that He is able. I don&#8217;t need someone to tell or explain it to me as my salvation in Christ is the greatest lesson in faith I have ever learnt. The same God who saved me, is the same God who will keep me, I have faith in His abilities to do much more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">&#8220;Diligently seek Him&#8221;, many people fail at this point simply because they asked the Lord yesterday and He did not do it in their time, why continue to have faith in Him?. I have been there if He did not do it or if He wasn&#8217;t doing it fast enough, I became my own Lord, answered my own prayers and led my own ways. There are things that have to be sought diligently, earnestly and constantly, they are greater faith builders and they teach us patience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Faith in God is what we need and faith in God is what is going to carry us through. I pray this week as we look at the subject of faith, that we will move from having faith for bread crumbs to having faith for the whole bread for there is something dynamic in going for the bread than crumbs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Thanks Ev <\/span><br \/>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Hebrews 11:6, For without faith, it is impossible to please Him for he that comes to God must first believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him&#8221; I am amazed how in life we can have faith in someone or something based on someone else&#8217; [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1201","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-jn","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1201","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1201"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1201\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1201"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1201"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1201"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1200,"date":"2009-01-30T07:58:00","date_gmt":"2009-01-30T14:58:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/01\/30\/ambassadors-for-christ\/"},"modified":"2009-01-30T07:58:00","modified_gmt":"2009-01-30T14:58:00","slug":"ambassadors-for-christ","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/01\/30\/ambassadors-for-christ\/","title":{"rendered":"Ambassadors For Christ"},"content":{"rendered":"<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Good morning,<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">2 Corinthians 5:20, &#8220;Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ&#8217;s behalf, be reconciled to God&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Ambassadors are ministers of the highest rank, with full authority to represent their country. If you are born again, you need to realize that you are an ambassador for Christ. You are a minister with a highest rank raised to represent his country, the Kingdom of heaven with the gospel. We are not of this world, we are ambassadors in this world. Those who are saved are citizens of heaven temporarily on assignment here on earth (country). No ambassador comes in his own authority and does what he wants, he displays a lifestyle depicting what his country is like.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">I find it discouraging sometimes when believers who should act like ambassadors are acting more like secret agents. For whatever reason, they find it hard to be indentified with their own country at work, in the community. It&#8217;s like living a double life. On Sunday morning everyone knows him to be an ambassador by the way he conducts himself and then the rest of the week, he is the only one who knows he is a believer. The word of God says in Matthew 5:16, &#8220;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven&#8221;?. God has called you to be a diplomat where you are, first to be a light and second with God given opportunities to bring His message to those in need. It&#8217;s not the title that defines a person, it&#8217;s the duty behind the title that displays truly who you are.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">What qualifies a person to be an ambassador, vs. 17, tells us that &#8220;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new&#8221;. That is the start but realize it doesn&#8217;t stop there, next step, vs. 18&#8243; Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, A minister is not given the title to feel good about himself, he is given a title to fulfill the roles of that title. We are made ministers, ambassadors for the ministry of reconciliation. This speaks to the reality that God wills to be reconciled with sinners. God has called believers to shine while proclaiming the gospel of reconciliation to others. Through service such as waiting on tables, God wants Christians to accept the privilege of serving unbelievers while proclaiming a desire to be reconciled. Ambassadors have authority and the back up from the country they represent.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Paul said that if we are really Christians, then we are &#8220;ambassadors of Christ&#8221;, we are God&#8217;s sole representatives in this foreign land called &#8220;the world.&#8221; With that analogy in mind, consider what a president would think of an ambassador to a foreign country, say Russia, who is told to deliver an extremely urgent message that will involve the peace of the whole world. And that ambassador (even with the best intentions) chooses not to be identified with his country in a foreign land and gives only a small part of the message, in such a way that it makes a very different impression than what the president wanted to make. How should the president think of that ambassador and reward him when he finds out the damage done?<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">An ambassador is not afraid to show whose he is and what country he represents, if anything, he delights in the fact that God would entrust him with such a high rank position he does not deserve or qualify for. To be everything He wants us to be before He takes us home to be with Him when the time comes. You and I are ambassadors for Christ, let&#8217;s act like it everywhere we are.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">*  Today is my birthday, I turned 35.

This morning we will liken the life of a believer to flower. The other day I picked some flowers for my wife, I know she loves flowers and flowers melts her heart. I don&#8217;t respond to flowers like she does maybe because I am a man and men respond to other things but you get the point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Lets begin by understanding what a flower is. According to the dictionary definition, A flower is a plant that is cultivated and appreciated for it&#8217;s blossoms. The first thing appreciated about it is it&#8217;s beauty, when God created the world, He looked at what He had created and concluded that it was good. You may not feel that you are beautiful both inside and outside, and you may feel you are not significant in this life, you need to be reminded the creator fearfully made you and appreciated His handiwork and I could imagine Him saying, &#8220;you are unique and special, there is no one else I will create like you. You have no competition in the entire world&#8221;. Psalm 139:14, &#8220;I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Not only are the flowers beautiful, they have fragrance. I know of certain flowers when the light shines on them especially at night, they produce some nice smelling fragrance and creates a warm atmosphere when the breeze blows through them. What an opportunity to allow the light of Christ to shine through the beautiful flower He has created and allow it to blossom and bring fragrance to your family, friends and this around you. With that in mind, we can say that flowers bring life to the surrounding. Go to any home, see how if there are no flowers around, that house and it&#8217;s surrounding appear dull. Add a few flowers and you bring to life the surrounding. Through that life, flowers also do attract people, birds, insects, how this shows when you begin to be the flower God wants you to be, everyone even the people who don&#8217;t like you will be moved and attracted by what they see in you. Let&#8217;s not forget that flowers brightens and melts a heart. Ladies love flowers, I say, &#8220;the way to the heart of a woman is a flower to make the way&#8221; (hope I&#8217;m not wrong), it reminds them they are special. Flowers have away of bringing joy and peace in someone&#8217;s life. Why do they usually bring flowers to a person who is sick in the hospital especially ladies? not only can the medicine be a means of healing, kind thoughts and acts of love have a way of also restoring. To add to what I am talking about, flowers are delicate and tender.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">For a flower to maintain all these qualities, it must be given a special attention, cared for. During spring and summer, as you drive around, you see people giving special attention to flowers, natured, watered, planted close to the house, around it decorated to make it look even beautiful, dry leaves around it are removed, fertilizer put around it to help it grow and more so, planted on well prepared soil. The Lord does the same with His children, He desires the best for them and He gives His children a special attention, providing everything that they need to bring to life what I have already shared. The Lord keeps on reaching out and inspecting the flower, spending time with it, putting it in the right spot to ensure enough sun light. You may think that the Lord has deserted you but look deep and you will see that He is taking good care of His flowers why? Sa Matthew Henry the commentator puts is, &#8220;Christ is pleased to compare himself to; and he condescends very much in the comparison. He that is the Son of the Highest, the bright and morning star, calls and owns himself the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys, to express his presence with his people in this world, the easiness of their access to him, and the beauty and sweetness which they find in him, and to teach them to adorn themselves with him, as shepherds and shepherdesses, when they appeared gay, were decked with roses and lilies, garlands and chaplets of flowers. The rose, for beauty and fragrance, is the chief of flowers, and our Saviour prefers the clothing of the lily before that of Solomon in all his glory&#8230;&#8221;. I too refer to Him as the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the valley. He said, &#8220;Let us make man in Our image&#8221; so here we are just like Him, a flower. He did not make something He couldn&#8217;t take care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Words from a song I love, &#8220;Of all the flowers in the world there is none that can compare, with the rose that God designed it&#8217;s beauty is so rare. With His great love, His tender care, He watches till it&#8217;s grown. Then He comes to pick the Rose and He takes it for His own&#8221; Can you see yourself the way the Lord sees you? Can you say confidently that you are beautiful, have fragrance, you bring life around, you attract, you brighten, you are delicate and you get special attention? Remember, you are a flower in His garden!!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Thanks <\/span><br \/>\n<br \/><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Ev<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Songs of Solomon 2:1, &#8220;I am the Rose of Sharon, and the Lily of the valleys&#8221; While Jesus taught His disciples and the people who came to listen to Him, many times He likened the Kingdom of heaven while using parables in order for His listeners to see something visual they relate to [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1199","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-jl","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1199","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1199"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1199\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1199"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1199"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1199"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1198,"date":"2009-01-28T08:33:00","date_gmt":"2009-01-28T15:33:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/01\/28\/the-lord-is-with-you-2\/"},"modified":"2009-01-28T08:33:00","modified_gmt":"2009-01-28T15:33:00","slug":"the-lord-is-with-you-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/01\/28\/the-lord-is-with-you-2\/","title":{"rendered":"The Lord Is With&nbsp;You"},"content":{"rendered":"<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Good morning,<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Judges 6:11-27, &#8220;12 And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, &#8220;The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor!&#8221; 13 Gideon said to Him, &#8220;O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, &#8216;Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?&#8217; But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"> Meditating on encouragements has opened my heart and mind to many men and women in the bible who encountered discouragements in the lives. These were normal people and their true stories are encouragement to us too that if they overcame their discouraging times, we too can.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Today I look at a man by the name of Gideon as told in judges 6. Gideon&#8217;s discouragement is a little different because he felt the Lord was against him and his people being that God allowed the Midianites to attack them year in year out. He couldn&#8217;t turn to God whom he felt was against him. If you read Numbers 31, you will find that the Israelites had very much defeated the Midianites under the leadership of Moses. The Midianites were no march to them.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">How did it come that the Midianites became a thorn in the flesh unto the Israelites? Vs 1 tells us, &#8220;Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Midian for seven years,&#8221; in simple words, the Midianites oppressed Israel. And if you know what oppression is, it&#8217;s to inflict distress or dominate harshly. This drove the Israelites hiding in caves, mountains and strongholds. The Midianites who would come in year in year out and destroy their produce and their animals leaving them with no sustenance. In this we are told of Gideon who knew well that the hand of the Lord was driving the Midianites against him and his people and like others, he was hiding, distressed, confused, discouraged with no one to turn to.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Vs. 11 &#8220;Now the Angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from the Midianites&#8221;, looking at the way this verse and others here are presented and punctuated, you find that the Angel of the Lord is identified as the Lord Himself. Either He appeared as an Angel or Gideon would have seen Him as an Angel. Whichever way, the Lord was present with him and watching him struggle threshing wheat in the winepress to hide it. He was used to using oxen to do this kind of job, now he is doing it by hand, hiding hoping the Midianites would not recognize him or see his stuff.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Vs 12 And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, &#8220;The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor!&#8221; How can it be that the Lord would say He is with him when the current situation painted another picture? Not only that, He mentioned to Him that he was a mighty man of valor? Doesn&#8217;t make sense and he challenges it, 13 Gideon said to Him, &#8220;O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Right now there are people who messed up in some areas and are facing trials and are feeling like the Lord is against them and is out to destroy them. They can&#8217;t turn to the Lord because of their shame, they know that Lord is dealing with them but feels like He is against them. Feeling like Gideon hiding under the wine press hoping your enemy will not find you, let this be an encouragement, the Lord is with you and will bring you through. If He was against you, He would have destroyed you, the bible says Proverbs 3:12, &#8220;For whom the LORD loves He corrects, Just as a father the son in whom he delights&#8221;. He has not forsaken the one He corrects.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">How was the Lord with Gideon anyway, God prevented him from being captured, God gave him wisdom on how to keep something for himself, even in his discouragement he wasn&#8217;t suicidal, his tribe was the weakest yet the Lord prepared a leader to be. If you feel the Lord is against you, how come you still have life? Are you going without food? Are there enemies driving you out of your home? Etc Yes we have tough times but are we seeing the Lord present even in them for us to be encouraged that He has it all under control? Gideon was wondering whether the Lord was with him because there were no miracles or victories like before. I would say they were there but not as he expected them.

Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?'&#8221; And she answered, &#8220;It is well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I find there other things the enemy use in obstacles to tear families apart. Under pressure, people say or do things they later regret. While discouraged some people become very insensitive, feeling like they are the only victims and if no one joins their pity party they become hostile to those who might not be discouraged as they are. Such victims fight flesh and blood not knowing there is an enemy behind it trying to find ways to tear apart. It&#8217;s frustrating and discouraging when you feel that those who are around you are not challenged the same way you are directly. I can see this with couples where the wife dealing with something chocking out courage and leaving her discouraged and frustrated and she gets worse when she perceives her husband does not understand, shows little or no sign of care. Again if we don&#8217;t master how we stand in the presence of obstacles, we can bring down our lives and those around us.<\/p>\n<p>The bible tells us of a story of a shunammite woman. Very ordinary notable woman married but without a child. Any time Elisha was in town, she would prepare a place for him and his servant to rest and besides that prepare food for them. She perceived this man to be a prophet and so she took good care of them with her husband&#8217;s permission. Her act of kindness led Elisha to promise her a son by prophesy the year to follow. It was hard for her to believe the promise while looking at herself barren and her husband old. What was about to happen would change the course of her life and family. God honored the prophesy.<\/p>\n<p>Her act of kindness opened a door for her and husband to have a son. Back then to have a son was huge, a son to inherit what the father had and even the name. What a miracle baby, they cared for him, had hopes and dreams for the son, a child in their old age, vs. 18, and the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. 19, &#8220;and he said to his father, &#8220;my head, my head&#8221; So he said to a servant, &#8220;carry him to his mother&#8221;, 20,&#8221;When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died&#8221;. There are a couple of things that puzzle me from these two verses, first the whole time the son was well, the father appeared to be present in his life but when sickness came, the father had no idea what to do. How many would frustrate with their spouses at an hour like this? Instead of doing something, he tells one of the servants to take his son to the mother. You may be wondering as I have wondered, what kind of father is this? And when the son is brought to his mother, she places him on her knees maybe pondering what this is all about, that it appears to be her problem. Confused, broken, discouraged, fear gripping her heart, whom can she turn to? A promise to her by the man of God has turned into tragedy in just short time. If she was not promised a son, she would not be dealing with grief. A husband who should be beside her to encourage and strength her is nowhere to be found. Very discouraging situation, what can she do, where can she draw strength? No one is there to encourage her, so she gathers strength in the midst of her pain and makes a move in search of the man of God. She is not blaming her husband for anything, not fighting him, not bad mouthing him, if anything she may have known that she had faith to carry her through and had more composure than her husband in this situation.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 21, and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out&#8221; vs. 22 Then she called to her husband and said, &#8220;Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back&#8221;.  A discouraged woman not ready to throw in the towel yet, she is not burying the dead yet. She knows the facts are real but her faith is not facts, &#8220;the just shall live by faith&#8221;. Faith to rise, faith to encourage oneself and faith for herself and her loved ones. Faith to believe that after it has been said and done, only God gets the credit. Facts could not give her a child before only faith and that is the same faith will carry her through.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 23, &#8220;so he said (her husband), &#8220;why are you going to him today? It is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath&#8221; And she said, &#8220;It is well&#8221;. Even when the husband tried to discourage her, her faith was strong keeping her encouraged. In the midst of the loss and the discouragement. She said, &#8220;It is well&#8221;. Vs 25, &#8220;&#8230;when the man of God saw her a far off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, &#8220;look, the shunammite woman! Vs 26, please run now to meet, and say to her, &#8220;Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?&#8221; And she answered, &#8220;it is well&#8221;. Note something here, she was not showing any sign of distress, she was not seeking to appear like she had problems, she may have not wanted to discourage others or others to discourage her. All she could do was keep her focus to meet the man of God and there pour her heart out. What a woman who learnt to pour out her heart to the right person, the person who could help her. Meanwhile she encouraged herself speaking well of his family. She is well, though grief was heavy in her heart; Husband was well, although he did not encourage her; son is well though he is dead. She could only speak these words because of her faith in what the man of God could do through the power of God. As long as Elisha had not declared nothing could be done, her encouragement was that it&#8217;s not over until it&#8217;s over. In the end, her son was restored to life and the entire family rejoiced again.<\/p>\n<p>She was her best encourager and had she not encouraged herself, nothing would have happened. Who knows whether this act of encouragement accompanied by faith lifted up her husband&#8217;s spirit and faith. To conclude that he has a virtuous woman who knows how to encourage herself and others. She could have been frustrated because of her husband; she took the opportunity to shine in the midst of it all because she learned to encourage herself. Psalm 61:2, &#8220;&#8230;, When my heart is overwhelmed; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. Psalm 42:5, 11, 43:5, Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me?

Discouragement cuts off the flow of encouragement leaving you paralyzed gasping for breath. From what I have learnt in my life, discouragements tends to come where there are obstacles. Something is not working or flowing like it should or expected, or something in my life is threatened.  We as believers have to learn how to encourage ourselves and be an encouragement to others. It&#8217;s easy to wait for someone to come to encourage you but this morning I would pray you will learn to be our own best encourager in the presence of every obstacle that might try to being you discouragements.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">David and his men were faced by a situation that brought discouragement in their lives. David had just come back to Ziklag a place where their families including were camping. During this time, David had been anointed the next king meanwhile a fugitive pursued by Saul before his time to reign. David and his 600 men were out to team  up with the Philistines to fight Israel. The Philistines did not trust David for they feared he was in a position of turning against them while in the battle field and so they refused to allow him to team up with them and David and his men came back to what they called home.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">When they came back, they found in their absence their enemies, Amalekites came in and captured David&#8217;s wives, his children and possessions, not only that, they took all the wives of his men, their children and their possessions. They went as far as burning the entire place down. Does this not this remind you of the mission of the devil, John 10:10, &#8220;The thief cometh not but for to steal, kill and destroy&#8221; and when they found what happened, 4 &#8220;&#8230; David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep&#8221;. What would you do if you were in David&#8217;s shoes, I would do the same, weep until no more strength is left. Do you have something you are facing that has caused you to weep or distressed leaving you with no more power? It was very discouraging time for David, the soldiers he could turn to for encouragement were in the same predicament, discouraged as he was. In David&#8217;s discouragement, more pressure was put on him by his soldiers, they wanted to stone their leader, you may be feeling pressure from others too. 6 Now David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">In his hard, dark, discouraging times, when no one was there to encourage him, he turned to his source of strength, God.  I can imagine him revisiting the many testimonies of how God had brought him through hard times, the promises of God that he will be the next king, knowing that God would not bring him this far and leave him defeated. He strengthened himself in the Lord maybe through Psalm and songs. Who knows what he did, all we know is that he drew strength from the wells of salvation.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">He learnt to lay his own foundation of encouragement in the Lord. He learnt that he was his best encourager. Knowing himself better than anyone else, he knew what would encourage him to ask for it. Maybe he moved a little away from the discouraged men so he could call on God to strengthen him before he could be effective to encourage others. You can not give out what you don&#8217;t have within. When you are torn inside, the house has to be brought back in order for it to stand. Are you discouraged this morning due to the economy, sickness, family situations and other things?. Stop speaking death in your life that bring about defeat and stop looking to people to lay a foundation of encouragement for you. Shut everything and everyone out, seek God to strengthen you, read His word and practice it, sing if you must but shut every door of discouragement out, if God&#8217;s sends someone to encourage you, let them find a foundation already laid that they help you build the wall. Choose to live a life full of encouragement. Boats and ship only sink when the water outside comes on the inside. As long as it&#8217;s sailing and there are heavy winds and heavy storms, it can make it as long as the outside is not allowed inside. You too can stand if you do not allow discouragements to come inside. Psalm 27:13, &#8220;I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living&#8221;, Don&#8217;t allow the enemy to steal your courage.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Thanks<\/span><\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Ev <\/span><\/span>     <\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Sam 30:1-30, &#8220;&#8230;But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God&#8221; Discouragement is one of the destroyers of lives and I believe one of the most dangerous things to allow in your life.

To fight effectively in your spiritual battle, you must know Christ, obey His standards, and be prepared to fight. Anyone in Christ is targeted by the enemy. If Jesus was attacked in the wilderness by the devil, be ready to be attacked.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Paul in his conclusion to the epistle he wrote to the Ephesians, he begins in verse 10 by saying, &#8220;Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might&#8221;. I find it very important to pay attention to the last words for they sum up everything that has already been said. He&#8217;s encouragement to them is to be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Later he shares with them on how to be strong. In the power of His might is derived from Zechariah 4:6, &#8220;&#8230; Not by might, not by power but by My Spirit, says the Lord of hosts&#8221;. It&#8217;s clear that by His might we are talking by His Spirit because God empowers us through Him.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Vs. 11, &#8220;Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil&#8221;. It will be beneficial to define armor to understand why we need to put it on. Armor is a defensive, as of metal, wood, or leather, worn to protect the body against weapons. So we can say that we have weapons formed against us always flying to destroy us, we need protection. To know that we are at war, let vs. 12 bring it to light, &#8220;For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places&#8221;. I don&#8217;t want to concentrate so much on what we fight against, I want to concentrate on how to get ready for it.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Vs 14, &#8220;Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth&#8221;, What really holds us together is the truth, the truth becomes the belt that holds what we know dearly. The truth tightens and chocks every lie out. &#8220;Having put on the breast plate of righteousness&#8221;, this is like putting on the bullet proof vest why? because it is the most sensitive part of the body. It is a part that is vulnerable and can be destroyed easily. The bible says in Proverbs 4:23, &#8220;Keep thy heart will diligence, for out of it are the issues of life&#8221; That is where life begins for a Christian and that is a place that must be girded well as I know that it defines who we are in Christ. vs. 15. &#8220;Having shod your feet with the preparation of gospel of peace&#8221;, a soldier is someone who is ready to march into the battle field. His aim is to defeat the enemy, win and rescue those that are held captive in sin, vs. 16. &#8220;Above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked one&#8221;, if you are going to win, you got to have a shield, something to strengthen what you already have. The neat thing about the shield, it can be used to protect every part of the body not like the other gargets that are used to protect a particular area. Faith defends the truth, the heart, the feet, and the head to mention a few. Hebrews 11:6, &#8220;without faith, it is impossible to please Him&#8230;&#8221;. This means we can have everything but without the shield, we will not please Him the reason why the bible says &#8220;ABOVE ALL TAKE THE SHIELD OF FAITH&#8221;. vs. 17. &#8220;And take the helmet of salvation&#8221;, people who go riding horses, bike, motorcycles always where helmets. It has been proven that it can save lives and it has done so many times. When we have the helmet of salvation, we too are safe when we sometimes fall, yes we might have bruises and pains but we still know that we haven&#8217;t lost our salvation. &#8220;and the word of the Spirit, which is the word of God&#8221;. This is the only offensive weapons as the rest are defensive weapons. Hebrews 4:12, &#8221; For the word of the Lord is living and powerful, sharper than any double edged sword, piercing even division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrows, and is a discerner of thoughts and the intents of the heart&#8221;. The word does all the fighting with an aim to win. Different gargets talked about that we need them all the reason Paul tells us to put on the WHOLE OF THE ARMOR.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">I would like to sum up the entire process of dressing for the battle by quoting this scripture, Romans 13:14, &#8220;But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill it&#8217;s lust thereof&#8221;. Putting on the Lord Jesus means putting on the Whole Armor of God. He is everything from the truth, John 14:6, He is righteous Romans 10:3, His is the reason for the gospel Isaiah 52:7, He is the shield of faith, Psalm 3:3, He is salvation, Romans 10:13, He is the sword of the Spirit, John 1:1. You put on the Lord Jesus, you have all it takes to stand against the wile of the devil. Put Him on always!!!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Ephesians 6:10-20, &#8220;Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil&#8221; I would like to take us to the book of Ephesians 6 and share some thoughts from it.

And this is the victory that has overcome the world\u2014our faith&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The battle every believer faces is the world, the flesh and the devil. And the more you walk with the Lord the more the battle intensifies and the more you ought to crave to be an overcomer.  If you are born of God, your walk with the Lord will continue to reveal things you are vulnerable to, things you may have never thought to be sin and conviction will bring you to your knees, why?,  because the more you walk with the Lord, the more His righteousness is revealed and the more you see yourself in your true state leaving you helpless in need of God&#8217;s power to overcome. Who in their right mind wants to live a defeated life? I don&#8217;t, I want to live a victorious life under the power of God present.<\/p>\n<p>Romans 1:17, tells us, &#8220;For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, &#8220;The just shall live by faith.&#8221; Right after verse 16 which talks about the gospel of Christ as the power of God unto salvation, we are told more about what the power of God through the gospel does, in it is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith. The same power that saved us, is the same power that ought to keep us. 1John 5:4, tells us that those who are saved, born of God should have the power to overcome the world, the flesh and the devil. To overcome, you got to have a battle in before you and the power over it..<\/p>\n<p>The saving faith is the first characteristic of an overcomer, born of God. The second is Love, 1 john 5: By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and \ufeffkeep His commandments&#8221;, a person who is an overcome, a victor, a conqueror, a winner is one who keeps God&#8217;s commandments. Not out of obligation or fear of punishment but out of love, it demonstrates what a changed life looks like. An overcomer is one who is craving for righteousness Matthew 5:6, &#8220;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled&#8221; what you feed the most is what overcomes, you feed the spirit, fuel the spirit you overcome.  Such a person understands that it&#8217;s not by might, nor by power but by the Spirit of God. We couldn&#8217;t do it while were in the world ourselves, how can we do it in Christ without His help?<\/p>\n<p>2 Timothy 1:7, &#8220;For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind&#8221; When we love God we overcome fear because of His power within us. Fear is not of God, it&#8217;s an enemy of faith that must be conquered. Romans 8:37, &#8221; says &#8220;Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us&#8221;. we overcome (conquer) when we love our brothers and loving our brothers would mean not stealing from them, lust after them, murder with words, jealousy, stinginess, coveting, dishonoring etc, these are the things we battle daily while serving the Lord we must overcome to live a victorious life. How many even battle honoring their spouses or loving their children? I believe one true test of an overcomer is one who is faithful to his spouse in word, in conduct and in thoughts.  It&#8217;s amazing how we can be nice to people out there and be nasty at home to our loved ones. The ones at home are the ones the Lord uses to bring about things in us that need to be conquered. An overcomer lives a life pleasing to the Lord before his family and by your own strength it&#8217;s impossible.<\/p>\n<p>We ought to continue to have victory day by day while battling and overcoming what is set before us. What you don&#8217;t battle and overcome will come back to haunt you, from a movie Shaka Zulu, Shaka made this quote &#8220;Never leave an enemy behind or it will rise again to fly at your throat&#8221;, the enemy must be defeated by all means and the power of God in us is what will help us overcome by faith.<\/p>\n<p>I want to say no to lust, no to pride, no to jealousy, no to fear, no to doubt, by fueling the fire of righteousness that has power to overcome the power of sin, and it begins by faith that it can be done. My obedience is required, &#8220;And this is the victory that has overcome the world\u2014our faith&#8221; Are you living in victory? Crave for righteousness, pray like crazy, stand firm and overcome the enemy of souls. It&#8217;s not by might, nor by power but by His Spirit says the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>Ev<\/span><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><br \/><\/span><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1John 5:4, &#8220;For whatever is born of God overcomes the world.

Many of us know about the power, the question is?, is it present in our lives and are we craving to see it at work? Could it be that the Lord has switched off power in some lives because people are not hungry to actually cry out to God for more? While meditating on Romans 1:16, I cannot think of a story in the bible that brings this clearly like the story of Lazarus being raised from the dead in John 11. I have seen people get saved to my thought appeared to be the hard ones to come to Christ and I believe the Lord does it constantly to remind us of His power to save through His gospel. I believe the Lord is calling on us to pray to Him to empower us to share and at the same time pray for His power to save the lost. I will share some thoughts and also borrow words shared by men of God I respect (Ray Comfort and John McArthur)<\/p>\n<p>First of all, Paul declares, the gospel is the power of God. Dunamis (power) is the Greek term from which our word dynamite is derived. The gospel carries with it the omnipotence of God, whose power alone is sufficient to save men from sin and give them eternal life.<\/p>\n<p>John reports to us that Lazarus is 4 days dead and buried. When Jesus comes, He comes to give life that no one can give and His message to Lazarus&#8217; sisters in John 11:25 &#8230;, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. 26 And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?&#8221;.  And only Christ in His power could give Lazarus life and it&#8217;s the power of God through the gospel that can give a sinner life.<\/p>\n<p>If the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, how is it that there are people who can make profession of faith and not live it? Could it be that the power of God actually never saved them? To quote Ray, &#8220;What it is is a sad admission of the amount of confidence we have in the power of our message and in the keeping power of God. If God has saved them, God will keep them. If they&#8217;re born of God, they&#8217;ll never die. If He&#8217;s begun a good work in them, He&#8217;ll complete it to that day (Philip. 1:6); if He&#8217;s the author of their faith, He&#8217;ll be the finisher of their faith (Heb. 12:2). He&#8217;s able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by Him (Heb. 7:25). He&#8217;s able to keep them from falling and present them faultless before the presence and glory with exceeding joy (Jude 24). Jesus said, &#8220;No one will pluck you from my father&#8217;s hand&#8221; (John 10:29).<\/p>\n<p>You see, saints, the problem is that Lazarus is four days dead (John 11). We can run in the tomb, we can pull him out, we can prop him up, we can open his eyes, but &#8220;he stinketh&#8221; (vs. 39). He needs to hear the voice of the Son of God. And the sinner is four days dead in his sins. We can run up and say, &#8220;Say this prayer.&#8221; Still, he needs to hear the voice of the Son of God, or there is no life in him; and the thing that primes the sinner&#8217;s ear to hear the voice of the Son of God is the law. It&#8217;s a schoolmaster to bring him to Christ that he might be justified through faith (Gal. 3:24)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>John 11:38, &#8220;Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 39 Jesus said, &#8220;Take away the stone.&#8221; if Christ had the power to bring life, He had the power to remove the stones too yet he tells them to take away the stones by the grave. While it&#8217;s the power of God that gives life to Lazarus, we as believers have the task of removing stones by the grave side by simply living Christ before the lost, Interceding and witnessing to the lost. That&#8217;s we can ever do to our unsaved loved ones, friends and those we reach out to. Remember Lazarus&#8217;s sister called on Christ, Christ encouraged them, Christ used them too and Christ gave life.<\/p>\n<p>To quote John McArthur, &#8220;Only the power of God is able to overcome man&#8217;s sinful nature and impart spiritual life. Romans 5:6, &#8220;For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly&#8221; Salvation through Christ is God&#8217;s powerful hand, as it were, that He has let down to lift men up. His salvation brings deliverance from the spiritual infection of &#8220;\ufeffthis perverse generation\ufeff&#8221; (\ufeffActs 2:40\ufeff), from lostness (\ufeffMatt. 18:11\ufeff), from sin (\ufeffMatt. 1:21\ufeff), and from the wrath of God (\ufeffRom. 5:9\ufeff).

You would imagine that they were there to hear the word of God, contrary. An important binary in the NT is the opposition between law and love. Accordingly, the NT presents the Pharisees as obsessed with man-made rules (especially concerning purity) whereas Jesus is more concerned with God&#8217;s love; the Pharisees scorn sinners whereas Jesus seeks them out. They were always opposing what Jesus was doing. In the presence of all the opposing sides, the bible says, the power of the Lord was present to heal them, who is them? those who were opened regardless of who they were.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">    <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">We now have to understand what power talked about is and it&#8217;s effectiveness before we can see if we need it. Nelson&#8217;s New Illustrated Bible Dictionary defines power as the ability or strength to perform an activity or deed. Power is sometimes used with the word authority. If power suggests physical strength, authority suggests a moral right or privilege. Those who are born of God require power in their lives to live for God. Many times we do things in our own strength unaccompanied by the power of God.  No person at no time, now or then, could ever do anything that would please God apart from God&#8217;s power. Ephesians 3:20, &#8220;Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us&#8221;. I&#8217;ve quoted this verse many times but today it hits me from a different angle and that is the last part that says &#8220;according to the POWER that works within us&#8221;, that God is able to do more because of the presence of His power in a believer. I am learning that this verse is irrelevant in my life if the power is not first present. The last part enables the first part to be effective in one&#8217;s life. Acts 1:8 tells us how what drives the power &#8220;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses&#8230;, the disciples could not accomplish God&#8217;s work on their own strength, they needed power, not power for their own programs but power to fulfill the call of God in their lives for His glory.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">    <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Where there is power, there are opposing agents and we see it at the current situations where the Pharisees and the doctors of law appeared. Pharisees in this case are the discouraging agents and the doctors of the law represent facts closing every avenue of victories because they present impossibilities. You and I have to learn that despite the Pharisees and the doctors of the law present, the power of the Lord is present to heal (not just physical). The power of the Lord was present before they arrived and their arrival did not change or minimize the power of God, if anything, I say their presence intensified it. It was mighty to heal them; it was exerted and put forth to heal them, to heal those whom he, to heal their souls, to cure them of their spiritual diseases, and to give them a new life, a new nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">    <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">We need to pray more that God will empower us with His Holy Sprit and then according to the power that works within us, we can be healed (more than physical healing) of whatever we are facing. You may have been trying to break a habit by yourself, God&#8217;s power is present to heal you of it. You may have opposing factors, may you be reminded they have no ability to terminate the power. It&#8217;s there for you and for me. A victorious life is not out of human strength, it&#8217;s our o the power of God. You cannot be saved without it and you cannot concur sin without it. Let&#8217;s call on God to increase the power.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/>Ev <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 5:17, &#8220;And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them&#8221;

I believe when the people on board realized something was wrong with the plane regardless of their beliefs took an opportunity to cry out to God for mercy. This reminded me of Luke 17 where Jesus was on a journey to Jerusalem. His journey required Him to pass through Samaria and Galilee and vs. 12 says, &#8220;Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off. 13 And they lifted up their voices and said, &#8220;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&#8221;, the timing on all this strikes me, there had to be more than ten lepers in that city, these ten happen to be present at the time Jesus was passing by. It was their day of miracle if they called. In their present situation, they lifted up their voices and pleaded for mercy. What does Jesus do, immediately, vs. 14, &#8220;&#8230;He said to them, &#8220;Go, show yourselves to the priests.&#8221; And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed&#8221;, my understanding of this line is, I have heard your cry, I have provided a way, go and testify of the what has happened. And like this plane coming down, God had already prepared away regardless of what it was. This kind of plane may have never been designed to land on water; only God could make it work. Who do we thank?<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">What amazes me about the story of the lepers is not so much the miracle but the action right after, the bible says, Luke 17:15, &#8220;And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks&#8221;, this verse indicates that out of the ten who were immediately healed, one turned around before even reaching the priests came back and with a LOUD VOICE GLORIFIED GOD, fell down on his face at His feet, GIVING HIM THANKS&#8221;. What a heart of gratitude. He understood nothing just happens, he knew he did not deserve the healing he got, there were more lepers who missed that opportunity. What made him better than the rest? nothing and he knew that. Oh he came back with something, sacrifices of praise. It could have been worse but God&#8230; From watching people being interviewed after the crash, I have been disappointed so far because I haven&#8217;t heard anyone who has come back to give praise to God for the miracle yet they sought for his help. And if someone on board did not pray, someone in that plan prayed that they would ALL make it. Much has been said about what happened; little has been said about God in the matter. It would have been easy to blame God if something really went wrong and lives lost, but what about now? Maybe there are some thanking God and may not even be brought on TV but they are like the one leper who came back to give thanks. Despite the people God used to make all go well, who is the Hero in the picture? I woke up this morning thanking God for the miracle, lives He spared. Unsaved people were on board who have gone to eternity without Christ, children were on board, it would have been worse, oh He proved to us again that He is God and nothing is too difficult for Him. That He is the God of 11:59, when you think it&#8217;s over, He does something breath taking. Who do we thank?<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Jesus paints to us a picture of how we can be ungrateful sometimes, He says, &#8220;17 &#8220;&#8230; &#8220;Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? 18 Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?&#8221; The other 9 took the miracle and moved on with their lives. Could it be possible that when Jesus said to all the 10 to go and show themselves He wanted to see if they would see a need to give thanks when they got healed? Only God knows. The rest went to live their lives as though nothing happened, maybe they thought they deserved the healing, one man new better, he deserved nothing but received something. As Ravi Zacharias says, &#8220;while the kids are thank Santa for putting candy in their socks, who do I thank for putting two feet in mine?&#8221; I am a firm believer that nothing just happens, there is a cause. If I was to trace back my life and family from the age I can remember, I can completely see the hand of God in every stage. Even before I became a Christian, I knew the workings of the Lord. The Lord was gracious many times to hear my cry. Not to long ago while praying on Saturday morning, my thanksgiving day, I began to recall how some of my family members escaped near death experiences and sickness that could not be detected by the doctors. Two of my brothers survived hot water burns at different times when they were young, one of my brothers who survived water burn almost drowned in his teenage years in a dam and recently survived ladder fall, my dad survived in a valley, I survived attacks by crooks one time going home, I almost drowned twice, my mom, dad and brother got healed of diseases that could not be detected, Who do I thank for all these miracles? How about you, if you were to sit and begin to recall more detailed account of your life and family and how you&#8217;ve made it this far, who would you thank for making it this far? Have you thanked God for the yesterday&#8217;s miracle? Oh it&#8217;s so good to give thanks unto the Lord.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Ev<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 17:11-19, &#8220;And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks&#8221; A miracle just happened in New York yesterday where an airbus flight 1549 carrying 155 passengers crashed into Hudson river [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1191","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-jd","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1191","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1191"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1191\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1191"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1191"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1191"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1190,"date":"2009-01-15T08:15:00","date_gmt":"2009-01-15T15:15:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/01\/15\/road-less-traveled\/"},"modified":"2009-01-15T08:15:00","modified_gmt":"2009-01-15T15:15:00","slug":"road-less-traveled","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/01\/15\/road-less-traveled\/","title":{"rendered":"Road Less Traveled"},"content":{"rendered":"<div style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"gmail_quote\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 25, vs. 4, &#8220;Show me your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths vs. 5, Lead me in Your truth and teach me&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Solving math equation was challenging to me in my school years and so were others. To try and pass, we would sometimes have RIGHT ANSWERS but we could not explain to the teacher how we exactly arrived at it because we likely copied from others or from the back of the book. There were those math questions that required several steps most taking at least a half a page to solve one question step by step. The valuable lesson I ever learnt was that the teacher was not so much interested in the right answers, he was interested in how I got there. He needed me to show him step by step and gave points to each step that was correct. I found I got more points for the steps than for the answer.<\/p>\n<p>Road less traveled are roads that require steps and often times we crave for answers and hope there are no steps to the process. It&#8217;s like saying, &#8220;I want to graduate without studying or sitting for an exam&#8221;, &#8220;I want to have an answer to a math problem without steps to lead me there&#8221;. The psalmist in this text begins with a plea for deliverance in vs. 1 and deliverance calls for an answer but look at how he goes about it. He is not seeking for an end result to which he will get to at some point, he is seeking for a process, a very rare thing people ask. He is not seeking to be &#8220;brought out&#8221; but &#8220;brought through&#8221;. Vs 4, says &#8220;Show me your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths vs. 5, Lead me in your truth and teach me&#8221;. Three important things he asks for &#8220;show me&#8221;, &#8220;teach me&#8221;, &#8220;Lead me&#8221;, looking at these closely, I can see that there are no short cuts. All these three calls for complete submission to the Lord. &#8220;Show me&#8221; says to the Lord I&#8217;m lost and blind, open my eyes and show me, not my ways but Your ways. Show me what you have planned and purposed for my life, show me what you require of me. &#8220;Teach me&#8221; calls for the Lord to instruct but you can only instruct someone you have their full corporation (their ear and their heart) with great eagerness to learn. It&#8217;s like saying, &#8220;I want to learn everything I need to learn in Your path because there has to be a good reason you let me be distressed. &#8220;Lead me&#8221; is the Lord having to hold my hands as He guides me in His truth while bringing me to what He purposed when He allowed the distress to come my way.<\/p>\n<p>When you compare Moses life and the Israelites, God gave the Israelites answers but to Moses He showed him His way (process), compared to the Israelites, Moses learnt a lot in the process. There is something about the process that shapes and molds you in the &#8220;show me&#8221;, &#8220;teach me&#8221; and &#8220;Lead me&#8221;, it brings about fulfillment and growth in ways you could never imagine or learn in anyway. Romans 5:3, &#8220;and not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing tribulations produces perseverance vs. 4, and perseverance, character; and character, hope. Vs 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us&#8221;. Paul had it rough but he counted it joy to have been a student. These are the same things the psalmist would have not wanted to miss in the Lord&#8217;s class when faced with the impossible. He wanted things that build perseverance (patience), establishes character (experience), increases faith (hope), teaches humility and surrender (self denial) and testimony.<\/p>\n<p>It was like the psalmist, David was saying, sign me up for this class &#8220;Road less traveled&#8221;. It will not be fun but it will be vital. It will be nice to have answers but I will benefit more by taking the class. It&#8217;s a shaping class. He wasn&#8217;t signing up in good times, he was signing up in distressing times for him, he says in Psalm 86:11, &#8220;Teach me Your way, O Lord; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name&#8221;, his desire, &#8220;His truth&#8221; and &#8220;fear of God&#8221;, how best can you learn these without taking the class? Many have been trying to avoid the class by crying out &#8220;give me an answer&#8221; and yes sometimes you have been given an answer but you have missed the dynamics that comes about in taking the class where you are totally committed because you are craving for more. I believe God is MORE present in the process than He is in the answer, take a look at some men in the bible and you will see it. The process is the road less traveled and that is why we find that even in reaching the lost, we want to give them answers and avoid the process. If they cannot withstand the process, the answer will not be of help. The road less traveled is narrow, very few find it. What is your prayer like when you are in distress &#8220;BRING ME OUT?&#8221; or &#8220;BRING ME THROUGH?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<\/p>\n<p>Ev<\/p>\n<p><\/span>             <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"> <\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 25, vs. 4, &#8220;Show me your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths vs. 5, Lead me in Your truth and teach me&#8221; Solving math equation was challenging to me in my school years and so were others.

The first thought possible and I have seen it in my life is ask &#8220;what did I do wrong&#8221;?, we equate it to be a punishment for something we may have done wrong. We begin to scan our memories of what it could be and we see it with the disciples when they encountered with a man who was blind from birth. John 9:2, &#8220;And His disciples asked Him, saying, &#8220;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&#8221; and vs. 3, &#8220;Jesus answered, &#8220;Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him.  To the disciples, there had to be a cause and that cause to their thinking had to do with sin. Jesus had a different response. Arise Oh God in my sickness or any situation and demonstrate your power. Give me something to build my faith and testimony to your power.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">It&#8217;s interesting to see how Jesus healed this man, Naaman was told to go and wash in river Jordan 7 times, he had a problem with that. As for this man in John 9, Jesus spat on the ground, made some clay and anointed his eyes. Here is what got me, imagine a blind person who desires his eyes opened, you take something thick and you apply it in his eyes and then tell him to go and wash in the pool of Siloam? How can a blind man lead his way to the pool? Why is Jesus making it even tougher for him? Here is what I believe, in as much as this man needed the physical healing, Jesus wanted to demonstrate that He can give spiritual eyes to see things the natural eyes could never see. I believe the Spirit of God directed this man to the right pool. The Spirit was like that cane the blind use to find their way. It also shows that though Jesus gave him spiritual eyes, He cared about him to give also physical. He dealt with the spiritual then physical.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">This man who we are not even given his name humbles himself, builds faith and moves as commanded. So he goes to the pool and washes, scales falling off his eyes and came back seeing. Here is another thing that got me, the bible says he was born blind, I&#8217;m not sure whether he had ever been to that pool and even if he did, he would not know which way but here he comes back with his eyes opened and knows where to go, doesn&#8217;t this show us that the same Spirit that led him to the pool blind is the same Spirit that led him back seeing? This shows that when we are touched and healed, it&#8217;s not the end but the beginning. He came back rejoicing and became a voice and a testimony to many. They kept on asking him how his eyes were opened and he kept on testifying how Jesus opened his eyes. The Pharisees kept on asking him many questions hoping that he would change his story but he would not.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">With so much pressure on him, and Jesus having been called all sought of things stood firm proclaimed again his testimony, John 9:25, &#8220;He answered and said, &#8220;Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.&#8221; No one can take away what God has done in your life, the enemy might whisper in your ear that you are not healed and even try and convince you that Jesus did not do it that it happened by chance or the doctors did it. Do you see that he did not even say the pool healed him? Cause he knew Jesus did, going to the pool was a demonstration of faith and obedience. I love his final strong testimony before they kicked him out of the temple, vs. 30, &#8220;The man answered and said to them, &#8220;Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes! 31Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him. 32, Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. 33 If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing. He healed me, period, he delivered me!!! Nothing can talk me out of what He did and nothing can talk you out of what He did if you stand firm in your testimony. Let the enemy whisper all he wants, He can&#8217;t take what you don&#8217;t give him.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/>Ev<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 9:1-38, &#8220;He answered and said, &#8220;Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know.

And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"line-height:115%;font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"line-height:115%;font-size:100%;\">With the help of God through His word, I would like to paint a picture of what I believe a young man&#8217;s honor to his father should be by looking at an episode where Isaac is led of his father to be sacrificed. The Bible does not give Isaac&#8217;s specific age when God asked Abraham to sacrifice him, but there are events surrounding Abraham&#8217;s sacrifice of Isaac which gives us clues. Most scholars believe that Isaac was in his late teen&#8217;s or early twenties at the time of the offering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"line-height:115%;font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"line-height:115%;font-size:100%;\">To show that Isaac may have not been a young child, we see him old enough to travel three days with Abraham but without his mother. His conversation with Abraham is that of an older child or a young adult. Finally, Isaac is the one who carried the wood for the sacrifice up the mountain (Genesis 22:6). The latter is strong evidence that Isaac was no longer a small child and serves as the main reason that our best guess is that he was at least in his late teens or early 20&#8217;s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"line-height:115%;font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"line-height:115%;font-size:100%;\">If Isaac was in his late teens or early 20&#8217;s while his father was over 100 years old, we can conclude that Isaac was willing to obey his father even to the point of death. Mathew Henry paints a picture, &#8220;Isaac, for aught that appears, is as willing as Abraham; we do not find that he raised any objection against it, that he petitioned for his life, that he attempted to make his escape, much less that he struggled with his aged father, or made any resistance: Abraham does it, God will have it done, and Isaac has learnt to submit to both, Abraham no doubt comforting him with the same hopes with which he himself by faith was comforted. Yet it is necessary that a sacrifice be bound. The great sacrifice, which in the fullness of time was to be offered up, must be bound, and therefore so must Isaac. But with what heart could tender Abraham tie those guiltless hands, which perhaps had often been lifted up to ask his blessing, and stretched out to embrace him, and were now the more straitly bound with the cords of love and duty! However, it must be done&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"line-height:115%;font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"line-height:115%;font-size:100%;\">I can only imagine father and son sticking side by side encouraging each other. Abraham had already lost his first son Ishmael who was sent away with his mother, the Lord was ok with it. Here comes Isaac, the only promised son God required Abraham to, the son who he loved. At a young age where he could have driven his father to an early grave with his life, one episode tells it all, a willing son honoring his father. This is how best I could imagine Isaac speaking to his father, &#8220;I know that you honor God first more than anything else and I know that you love me regardless of what is asked of you, I am ready to glorify God by obeying as you fulfill the call of God through me, this is my HONOR TO YOU&#8221;. I believe Isaac was more of an encouragement to his father the most when he needed that encouragement, he looked like the victim but he wasn&#8217;t. Only God could give and could take way. The servants who came with them could have discouraged him sacrificing his son but here is a young man who carries what is required for sacrifice only to discover he is the sacrifice and still be willing to go through it. This is a son a father is proud of, a son that God blesses. If there is a young man or young woman who claims to fear God and does not honor their father and mother, it&#8217;s nothing to God. The honor may not necessarily mean that they deserve it, parents fail like anyone else, the whole reason for honor is a means of glorifying God. God has placed parents in strategic places for a reason. Honor of Isaac has taught me a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"line-height:115%;font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"line-height:115%;font-size:100%;\">Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/>Ev <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 22:1-19, 9 &#8220;Then they came to the place of which God had told him.

Unlike Paul and Peter, Barnabas had a very unique ministry. I am yet to come across where he ministered alone, performed miracles and the like. You don&#8217;t hear much about him, there is no book dedicated to him. He only appears mostly in the book of Acts and then mentioned by Paul and Peter in the other epistles but Barnabas is special.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Who was Barnabas anyway? First, the name Barnabas means &#8220;son of encouragement&#8221;. He is not so much on the fore front but one who is always on the side encouraging. I would say that he must had been the one who discipled Paul when Paul was converted why? Acts 9:27, &#8220;But Barnabas took him and brought him (Paul) to the apostles&#8230; &#8220;. He is the type of an individual who forgives easily and sees far beyond what natural eyes could see. If you remember, Saul now known as Paul was persecuting Christians. Even after his conversion, Christians still had a hard time accepting him and Barnabas played a very important role in encouraging brethren to rally around him for he was now a brother in the Lord. God had graciously done something in Paul&#8217;s life to which I believe the disciples may have prayed earnestly for his salvation. Barnabas became like a leader unto Paul for a while. If you read more in the book of Acts, Luke constantly introduces them as &#8220;Barnabas and Paul&#8221;, look at the order (Acts 11:30). Barnabas first, then Paul second. Around Acts 13:43, the introduction changes to &#8220;Paul and Barnabas&#8221; revealing to us that now Paul was mature enough to be a leader and Barnabas as usual became a supporting minister. I love Barnabas, a man of sweet spirit, a very meek individual who knows that his position is important. Yes he is not so much known but his ministry of encouragement was necessarily needed. Paul benefited from it so was John Mark when Paul did not want to take him with him to another mission. Barnabas encouraged Paul to take John Mark but he would not, later you hear Paul calling for John Mark in 2Timothy 4 to come and help him minister. John Mark&#8217;s ministry was vital to Paul and may have amended their differences. Barnabas was a patient man, seeing far beyond faults knowing that with time, there will be growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Acts 11:23, &#8220;When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord&#8221;. What a blessing to know that the ministry of encouragements is vastly needed in our lives today. Barnabas went about encouraging believers to continue with Lord. There must have been those who were discouraged, weak, loosing hope but he was there to encourage them. I have seen people who lost hope and direction yet little encouragement awakened the desire to keep standing strong. A little encouragement allowed them to blossom again. When was the last time you were a Barnabas to someone? You might not have a ministry like Paul but don&#8217;t forget that there was a Barnabas in the background encouraging him and others around him. You never know how the one you encourage today could turn out to be. Your little encouragement could save someone who was fed up with life and was ready to end it. A little encouragement could save one from making bad decisions.

As soon as he touches the heater bars he no longer believes they are hot, HE now KNOWS they are hot.  His experience brought him from the realm of cognitive belief, into experiential knowledge.

What an ironic title for a man with such a timid record. Gideon himself even challenged the validity of such words of himself. Gideon proclaimed that he was from the weakest family, and that he himself was the weakest one of his own family.  He felt least qualified for the job.  But it is just like our BIG GOD, to use the weak things of this world.  God assures Gideon, &#8220;I will be with you, and you will strike down ALL the Midianites together.&#8221;  WOW, He hadn&#8217;t really done anything for God yet, but God saw Gideon threshing the Midianites, the way he was threshing the wheat.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">God tells Gideon to break down the altar to the false god of Baal, his fathers altar.

Pictures speak louder, clearer and harder to forget. No wonder Jesus used the natural to make a point so that His listeners would learn something and retain it. To put this message together, I thought of using spinal cord.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">The question that first comes into mind is what is a spinal cord, it&#8217;s function and it&#8217;s importance? Spinal cord is part of the nervous system cordlike structures, which are made up of nerve fibers. They are the nerves that carry most of the messages from the brain to the body and vice versa. We can tell that it&#8217;s a communication system of the body which includes sensory, motor and autonomic functions. Whoever has spinal injury is always left paralyzed from the waist down. This would mean that the command center has no communication with the legs. The command is there but the communication is missing hence leading to loss of motion or feeling in the lower parts of the body especially on the legs. It looks and sounds small but very vital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">It&#8217;s hard to tell what the man in the scriptures had but we can conclude that he had some type of spinal injury and because of that, he was impotent. He could think, reason, and know the season when the water was troubled but his condition would not allow him to move. There was a command but no communication, and that left him in his condition for many years. He gambled with his life hoping that one day he would be lucky to jump in the pool when water was troubled but for 38 years nothing happened, waited to hit a jackpot but year after year he was in the same place. At times I find myself in places and situations for too long. I want to move, I send commands to move but the communication to that part is missing. Paul says, &#8220;The things I should do I don&#8217;t do but the things I shouldn&#8217;t do are the ones I do&#8221;(paraphrased). This is being impotent, want to be free from certain things of the world. You promise yourself that next time you will rise but the command is there, the response is missing to cause the legs to move and change locations, how frustrating. What happens when you have waited for too long and nothing is happening? Discouragement comes in and before long if nothing completely happens one gets numb to the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">However long someone has been into a situation like this, there is still hope. There is hope for the hopeless; there is no need to fear. When all hope is gone, Christ will be there. When you can&#8217;t reach Him, He will find and reach you by the pool where you are waiting for luck. The impotence can be made important because the Lord is not done with you yet. What has been carrying you will be the thing that you will carry when it&#8217;s said and done. He can restore your spine and the command will cause the communication to reach that part which was impotent. That is why I thank God for prayers &#8217;cause it allows Him to restore me to the point that every part of my being  can function effectively. When I pray, my faith is boosted to attempt the impossible, resist sin, make wise moves and be responsible. This causes me be an asset and not a liability. Prayer is the communication that activates God&#8217;s commands in a situation, Psalms 37:23, &#8220;The steps (goes with legs) of a good man are ordered (commanded) by the Lord, and He delights in his way,&#8221;. I can now see that when I have that communication, the commands from Him will reach my legs and cause me to move. Those who have no prayer life have spinal injury and need healing. It may look small and insignificant but check again. Without a prayer life, one becomes impotent sitting in place forever. You could do greater things that you could never do by yourself because you have a communication through prayer, Mark 11:24, &#8220;&#8230;whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them&#8221;.

A family friend tried to witness to me and right before his presence I mocked the gospel. My brother even begged me to just receive the Lord after seeing this poor guy struggle with me but still I refused. There were days when in trouble, I used the Lord as my means to an end. &#8220;I gave my life to Christ&#8221; for a season and for a reason until I got what I wanted then abandoned Him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">I don&#8217;t know about you but I identified with Judas Iscariot and I will explain why. Judas was one of the disciples, hanged around Jesus, looked and sounded like the rest. Unlike the disciples, only Jesus truly knew him. He was entrusted with the moneybag to which he stole from. He did not care for Jesus because when a woman brought an expensive oil to anoint Jesus, Judas had a problem with it.  John 12:4, &#8220;But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon&#8217;s son, who would betray Him, said, 5 &#8220;Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denari and given to the poor?&#8221; 6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it&#8221;. Just like Judas, I too hanged around the Lord, was partaker of the blessings, was stealing from Him, did not worship Him and I had a problem with those who worshipped Him and how they worshiped, I was a hypocrite going to church, identified with those who were truly saved but knowing for sure I wasn&#8217;t. When I got what I wanted, I betrayed Him with my life style, blaspheming His name by how I lived.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Matthew 26:14, &#8220;Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 15 and said, &#8220;What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?&#8221; And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.&#8221;, Judas so hated Jesus that despite the fact that he loved money and would have sought ways to make more, he went to the chief priests and was willing to take anything even the least so as to betray Him. Oh how my life was like Judas&#8217;, I was willing to do anything to get rid of Jesus out my life, after all, I got the blessing I was looking for. To the world Judas was ok but again Jesus knew better, to the world I was ok, but Jesus knew better. Like Judah, I sold Him out cheap. How this pains me when I think about it. And more and more I became a slave to sin. Ensnared without even guilt. Back then it was no big deal but when my eyes were opened to see how wretched I was and how my lifestyle would have made Judas look like a choir boy, I said Lord, I&#8217;m done with myself and in my sin of breaking his laws where rebellion and betrayal were present, I heard that He died for me and paying the highest price to save a wretch like me. How that hymn &#8220;Amazing grace&#8221; makes grace sounds amazing. I have seen the cost to appreciate the sacrifice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Let me share a story that brings this point home, I first heard the late Paris Reidhead mention it in one of his messages, I googled it and found the story. Here it goes. During the years when slavery was legal in the United States, a gentleman happened upon a slave-bidding in a crowed street. The man paused to observe the activities. As he watched from the edge of the crowd, he saw one slave after another led to a platform, their arms and legs shackled with ropes as if they were animals. Displayed before the jeering crowd, they were auctioned off, one by one. Some onlookers would inspect the &#8220;merchandise&#8221;, grabbing disrespectfully at the women, examining the muscular arms of the men. The gentleman studied the group of slaves waiting nearby. He paused when he saw a young girl standing at the back. Her eyes were filled with fear. She looked so frightened. He hesitated for a moment and then disappeared briefly. When he returned, the auctioneer was about to start the bidding for the young girl he had noticed beforehand. As the auctioneer opened the bidding, the gentleman shouted out a bid that was twice the amount of any other selling price offered that day. There was silence for an instance, and then the gavel fell as, &#8220;sold to the gentleman&#8221; was heard. The gentleman stepped forward, making his way through the crowd. He waited at the bottom of the steps as the young girl was led down to her new owner. The rope, which bound her, was handed to the man, who accepted it without saying anything. The young girl stared at the ground. Suddenly she looked up and spit in his face. Silently, he reached for a handkerchief and wiped the spittle from his face. He smiled gently at the young girl and said, &#8220;Follow me&#8221;. She followed him reluctantly. As they reached the edge of the crowd, he continued to a nearby area where each deal was closed legally. When a slave was set free, legal documents, called manumission papers, were necessary. The gentleman paid the purchase price and signed the necessary documents. When the transaction was complete, he turned to the young girl and presented the documents to her. Startled, she looked at him with uncertainty. Her narrowed eyes asked, what are you doing? The gentlemen responded to her questioning look. He said, &#8220;Here, take these papers. I bought you to make you free. As long as you have these papers in your possession, no man can ever make you a slave again. The girl looked into his face. What was happening? There was silence. Slowly, she said, &#8220;You bought me, to make me free?&#8221; &#8220;You bought me, to make me free?&#8221; As she repeated this phrase over and over, the significance of what had just happened became more and more real to her. &#8220;You bought me, to make me free?&#8221; Was it possible that a stranger had just granted her freedom and never again could she be held in bondage and servitude to any man? As she began to grasp the significance of the documents, which she now held in her hand, she fell to her knees and wept at the gentleman&#8217;s feet. Through her tears of joy and gratitude, she said, &#8220;YOU BOUGHT ME, TO MAKE ME FREE&#8230;. I&#8217;LL SERVE YOU FOREVER!&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">I am like the slave girl who spat on His face and Judas who stole and betrayed Him, and even in that, He bought me to free me. 1993 at the age of 19, I repented and put my trust in Him alone for my eternal salvation and I vowed to serve Him forever. To give Him the obedience I refused to give Him. My question to you, are you a Judas like I was or have you passed from death to life? You could be saying you will do it one day and continue to use the Lord as your means to an end. Tomorrow is promised to no one. I wasted my teenage years living for the devil as his slave while I could have started living for God then, are you wasting time? Do you know you are running out time? Today is the day of salvation, He has done everything to save you, what is holding you from repenting and trusting? How else can I drive this point home that He bought you to free you?. Oh the wonderful cross.

After the Master finished teaching, feeding them with the spiritual food, He turns to perform a miracle that would bring about natural food. He tells Peter to deep his nets for a great catch. Point no. 4, are you purposing in your life to go deeper in your prayer life? Great things placed in the deep because they teach you faith, perseverance, character. Some people have been operating on shallow waters all their lives and may have been comfortable there, this year purpose in your heart by the grace of God to take God at His word and launch into the deep. Attempt the impossible and believe God for breakthrough. Deep waters require deeper faith, deeper faith is brought by responding to the challenge the Lord has for us in Jeremiah 33:3, &#39;Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.&#39;&quot;. Leonard Ravenhill said something that struck me about prayers, he first started this way, &quot;Sunday morning services many times show how popular the church is, Sunday nights shows how popular the preacher is, PRAYER MEETINGS SHOW HOW POPULAR GOD IS&quot;. Paraphrased). Do we see God being popular when He met Peter? YES. I know that prayers and prayer meetings are a struggle to many and to some it may not be that important, but that is where we launch into the deep for a great catch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;\">vs. 5 But Simon answered and said to Him, &quot;Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net&quot;. We see Peter here being very vulnerable and very real. He was not dismissing what had happened. He said Lord we have tried our way and failed but at this moment we will trust your way even if it does not make sense. Remember they fished at night because that is when fish was expected, here Jesus is telling him to cast his nets on a day light. Professional fishermen bowing their knowledge, expertise and experience for the move of God. Point no. 5, are you willing to obedient to act on what the Lord tells you no questions asked even if it does not make sense to you?. That your expertise and knowledge will be subject to His word? Knowledge and expertise sometimes fail, God fails not. See the miracle of the great catch was not when they caught the fish, its when they believed and obeyed. Mark 16:17, &quot;And these signs will follow those who believe&#8230;&quot; Some follow signs, the bible says signs follow those who believe and believe has obedience in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;\">I hope and pray that these few points I have laid out will help you in your walk as you begin this new year.

nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Having tackled the challenges of 2008 in the last part, let me share a few thoughts to prep us for start 2009. We looked at 4 men who had toiled all night fishing only to catch nothing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">How did it all start, let read in Luke 5:1, &#8221; 1 So it was, as the multitude pressed about Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret&#8221;, Peter at this point had not received his calling to be one of Jesus&#8217; disciples and so we see here that those who followed Christ desired to hear more of His teachings and he led them by the lake just where the discouraged Peter and His friends were washing their nets. I can only imagine Peter and the rest looking at the multitude they could have sold fish to and how that morning could have been a booming business. I believe the people who followed him were going to be hungry at one point. What did Christ do with his followers first, He fed them with Spiritual word. He came right where Peter was and maybe that morning the message was specifically for Peter. Point no. 1, are you going to press in to study and feed on God&#8217;s word even more? That you will esteem His word more than your necessary food? That His word will be more precious to you than anything else inspite of what comes your way? The multitude pressed about Him to hear the word of God. God first!!, Matthew 6:33, &#8220;But seek first the kingdom  of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Vs 3.&#8221;Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon&#8217;s, and asked him to put out a little from the land&#8230;. &#8220;, As Jesus got by the lake with the multitude, He got into Simon&#8217;s boat and asked him to push it a little into the water. Jesus needed the boat not to fish but to use it as a pulpit to teach. The boat was not built for that purpose yet the Lord used it for that purpose. Point no. 2. Are you willing to give the Lord everything about your life and say &#8220;Lord use it whichever way you want for your glory?&#8221;, and not feel like making a deal with the Lord that He can bless you after He has used what you gave Him? Peter was giving the boat for the use in his disappointment expecting nothing in return. Why? Because Christ was worthy of his obedience. It&#8217;s all His and we give back to the Lord what He requires for His glory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Vs 3,&#8221; &#8230;And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat&#8221;. Who knows what the Master taught on that day, I believe He may have taught the multitude on faith. Peter though at a distance must have listened to every word. The bible says in Romans 10:17, &#8220;So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God&#8221;, Point no 3. Are you determined to live by faith? Now faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God which would mean more than reading, more than hearing a nice sermon. It will be as James says in James 1:22, &#8220;But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves&#8221;. Faith is waiting for God&#8217;s timing without doubting His love and ability.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Have a few more points to share on Monday.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Thanks <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 5:1-7, &#8220;But Simon answered and said to Him, &#8220;Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net&#8221; Having tackled the challenges of 2008 in the last part, let me share a few thoughts to prep us for start 2009.

I don&#8217;t know about you but 2008 was a very challenging year for my wife and I and some of our family members. Can you testify of the same? we hoped that 2008 would top the previous years, to some it did, to others it did not. I would like to lay a ground work to reflect on 2008 then share from the same passage for the new year..<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Let&#8217;s look at some individuals under the leadership of Peter who faced a challenge one time. Peter was a professional fisherman just like his brother and two of their friends James and John (sons of Zebedee). Every night, I believe they went out fishing, it was their occupation. They looked forward to toiling all night fishing, it was worth it for they would get a great catch by morning. As this was their occupation that brought about food and income, they had to work hard. They depended on it, on this night, they caught nothing having toiled all night. All they were left to do was wash their nets feeling very disappointed and exhausted (physically, emotionally and perhaps spiritually). It was going to be hard facing the family members empty handed, nothing in their hands to give. The market was waiting for them to provide for others who depended on their fishing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Like these fishermen, do you feel like you toiled all night in 2008 with little or no catch and all? You toiled in prayers, you worked hard, you sacrificed a lot, you planned but still and you are now left washing your nets, all that could have been did not work out as you anticipated?. Nursing disappointments, drained, not knowing what to do next? What you counted on all failed, you had hopes of going through 2008 and finishing well but right now you feel like you are barely making it?  I have encouragement for you and I, &#8220;&#8230;weeping (toiling) many endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning&#8221; Psalm 30:5.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Think about those people who quit before the night was over or those that circumstances forced them to surrender before time. That despite toiling through the cold night, battling with waves, sometimes feeling like the boat was going to capsize, you made it through the night. What is your greatest testimony on this day, YOU ARE STILL STANDING BY THE GRACE OF GOD. Do you know the number one response I get from people facing challenges?, they say, &#8220;I&#8217;m hanging in there&#8221;, there is a problem with hanging in there, you can hang in for so long. Those who are &#8220;hanging in there&#8221; are barely making it. A believer should confess, &#8220;I&#8217;m standing in there&#8221;. Standing on what, standing on the promises of God. 1 Corinthians 15:58, &#8220;Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor (toiling) is not in vain in the Lord&#8221;, When you have done all you could do by the grace of God, &#8220;STAND!!!!&#8221;, &#8221; &#8230;Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the LORD, who is with you&#8221;, 2 chronicles 20:17.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">We can finish 2008 strong regardless of how rough it&#8217;s been. How we finish will prep us on how we start the new year. The same God who has given you grace to make it this far, is the same God who will begin the new year with you. You can&#8217;t keep crying over what you lost or how things could have been, don&#8217;t you know it&#8217;s dawn?, it&#8217;s already morning the sun is about to come up. They say that weird hours of the morning are the darkest hour of the night, the good thing is, it shows us daylight is just around the corner if we can stand a little while. Praises be to God, our victory is not based on WHEN, it&#8217;s based on WHO. To continue&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Happy New Year<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 5:1-7, &#8220;But Simon answered and said to Him, &#8220;Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net&#8221; This is the last day of 2008.

I mean someone with more degrees than a thermometer read a scripture and miss the whole point of it. that they can get everything else but the scripture though they have read it over and over again. How many times have we also read verses after verses and it was plain and then one day as we were reading them again, it became alive?. Anyone can read the scripture, only God can give understanding to His word. The devil knows the scripture, he tempted Jesus with it, the only thing he does not understand it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Understanding is revelation only God gives to those whom He has open their hearts. As I&#8217;ve said already, we can hear the word or even read it but without understanding of it, it will not make sense and it will be of no benefit to us. Jesus shared with His disciples of the things that were to be fulfilled, they heard what He said but did not make sense, some even forgot what He said. Then after it was all fulfilled, He reminded them again of what He had told them and the bible adds another verse to show us something profound,  45 Then He opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures&#8221;. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">I don&#8217;t want to read so as to read, I want to read with understanding and understanding is revelation from God. Do you know that &#8220;salvation is revelation&#8221;? And it&#8217;s revelation that comes about where God takes his spoken word and makes it alive in a person He is saving so that they understand who they are and what He has done for them and they respond through repentance and faith?. In Acts 8, we are told of how God sent Phillip the evangelist to meet an Ethiopian Eunuch whose heart was open to read God&#8217;s word. Acts 8:30, &#8220;So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, &#8220;Do you understand what you are reading?&#8221; 31 And he said, &#8220;How can I, unless someone guides me?&#8221; And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him&#8221;. This man was reading but did not understand what he was reading until God sent Phillip,vs 35 &#8220;Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him&#8221;. Only God could give understanding of the scripture through Phillip to this man and it&#8217;s because his heart was open, God did it. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">We have another example in Acts 16:14, &#8220;Now a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God. The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul&#8221;. If God opened our hearts to heed to the gospel, are we continuing to pray that He opens our hearts to understand what we are reading?

At this particular restaurant, he buys coffee, upon checking his wallet, he finds that he has only enough change for coffee and nothing on the side to leave for tip. At that moment he remembers he had a lottery ticket in his hands he and his wife were hoping to win. His promise to the waiter was to come back and give her the tip or split with her half of the lottery if they won. The waiter (Yvonne) who has dealt with many people who make promises they can&#8217;t keep including the man she was married to has a hard time believing him. She does not see anyway the cop is going to come back but  the cop vows to come back. Not long after that, he and his wife finds that they have won 4million dollars. 4 million dollars?, half to go to the waitress? he has a chance either to fulfill the promise (vow) or break the promise (vow). His wife does not want him to give out the 2 million buck, his friend tells him to do the right thing, he thinks in his mind to lie to the waitress then he concludes to &#8220;keep his word&#8221;. With the word kept, the waitress gets 2 million in the midst of his wife&#8217;s protest. I&#8217;m told the movie was based on a true story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">In as much as I believe that Christians should not gamble because we don&#8217;t live by luck but by faith, there is something about the story I just shared that brings the point I would like to make, &#8220;making a promise and keeping it&#8221;. It&#8217;s very easy to make a promise then hard to keep it. You can say you will do something just to be left a lone and then find it hard to fulfill it or not do it at all. At times promises are made on the basis of what it is in for me and how can I benefit from it. You ask yourself,  &#8220;will it inconvenience me in any way? Marriages are based on promises (vows) but if you look at it, performing those vows are hard for many couples because it&#8217;s more about them than others. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel the love in this marriage like I used to, I don&#8217;t get satisfaction like I used to&#8221; the word here is &#8220;I&#8221; (ME, MYSELF and I), it doesn&#8217;t matter how the kids will be affected as long as &#8220;I&#8221; get what &#8220;I&#8221; want if I have to stay, it&#8217;s not about what &#8220;I&#8221; can do to improve it, it&#8217;s a matter of what can &#8220;I&#8221; gain from it. There is no &#8220;I&#8221; in teamwork.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Ecclesiastes 5:4, &#8220;When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it&#8221;. What is a vow anyway, it&#8217;s an earnest promise to perform a specified act or behave in a certain manner. It has to come from the heart and you&#8217;ve counted the cost of performing it. When we make vows to help someone, to do something we do it in the presence of the Lord and unto the Lord if you think about it. God takes vows seriously and He would rather you make no vow than make it and break it. The scripture also says, do not be slow to fulfill a vow, it needs to be fulfilled on the specified time. You make it, you owe it and should pay it. Charlie from the story made a vow, he had a chance to pay that vow in time as promised and his conviction moved him to perform it and perform it soon. In Mathew 21:28, we are told of two sons who were asked by their father to go and work in the vineyard, the first one said he will not go but after some time regretted and went and performed it. The second son said he will but did not go. Out of the two boys, only the first one did the will of his father. 1 Corinthians 10:3, &#8220;Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God&#8221; Colossians 3:17, &#8220;And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , Colossians 3:23, &#8220;And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men&#8221; 3 John 1:5, &#8220;Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers&#8221;. If you said you will do it, take the time to do it, go out of your way to do it, it may not benefit you in anyway but do it, this goes for ministry, work, family, community service you name it. Keep your word. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Blessings <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Ev<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Ecclesiastes 5:4, &#8220;When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it; For He has no pleasure in fools.

What best gift can we give to Christ, I will take Romans 12:1 and make it my Christmas gift to the Lord. &#8220;Present our bodies a living and holy sacrifice&#8221; Galatians 2:20, strengthening it by saying &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me&#8221;., presenting all our members and faculties devoted and consecrated to God as acceptable sacrifice, instruments of righteousness. This is our spiritual service of worship because of who He is. It&#8217;s more than lip service. Not giving God what is LEFT but what is RIGHT, speaking like David who said in 2 Samuel 24:24, &#8220;&#8230;to Araunah, &#8220;No, but I will surely buy it from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God with that which costs me nothing.&#8221; David sought for a land to buy so as to build an altar to sacrifice to the Lord. Araunah offered him a piece of land for free but David refused to take it for free. To present a living and holy sacrifice too will not be free. It will cost you everything for He is worthy of it.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">I know we think the most about the birth of Christ at this time but I prefer taking it from the end &#8220;the cross&#8221; because then the birth of Christ becomes more powerful when I look at the cross. The cross paints the whole picture. The world today has a problem with Jesus and so why embrace His birth if they have not understood the cross. Paul in writing says in 1 Corinthians 2:2, &#8220;For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified&#8221;, He preached the cross first. Without the cross, the birth of Christ sounds like a nice story to some.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Why start at the cross? To quote Paris Reidhead, &#8221; Why should a person come to the cross? Why should a person embrace death with Christ? Why should a person be willing to go, in identification, down to the cross and into the tomb and up again? I&#8217;ll tell you why! BECAUSE IT&#8217;S THE ONLY WAY THAT GOD CAN GET GLORY OUT OF A HUMAN BEING&#8221;, THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY THAT JESUS CHRIST WILL GET GLORY OUT OF A LIFE THAT HE&#8217;S REDEEMED WITH HIS PRECIOUS BLOOD IS WHEN HE CAN FILL THAT LIFE WITH HIS PRESENCE AND LIVE THROUGH IT HIS OWN LIFE&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">As we think about the cross, we will be driven to reflect on where the whole journey started here on earth, with the birth of Jesus and then &#8220;.. let&#8217;s come and cast ourselves at the feet of the nail pierced Son of God and tell Him that we&#8217;re going to obey Him, and love Him, and serve Him, as long as we live BECAUSE HE IS WORTHY!,Paris Reidhead. That we present our bodies crucified with Him (Gal 2:20) and &#8220;MAY THE LAMB THAT WAS SLAIN RECEIVE THE REWARD OF HIS SUFFERING!&#8221; Paris Reidhead. Think about the Cross, think about the Savior who gave His life and give Him the Glory in your life for great things He has done.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">To God be the glory, great things He has done;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">So loved He the world that He gave us His Son, <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Who yielded His life an atonement for sin, <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">And opened the life gate that all may go in. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">chorus <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Let the earth hear His voice! <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Let the people rejoice! <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son, <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">And give Him the glory, great things He has done<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">MERRY BLESSED CHRISTMAS TO YOU ALL<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 12:1, &#8220;Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship&#8221;

It&#8217;s the type of message you don&#8217;t shout hallelujah when you read it because it deals matters of the heart strategize to hinder you from progressing with the Lord. For a believer who knows the law of God, sin condemns you, it leaves you in a guilty state, your conscious accuses you but leaves you with no solution. The thing that comes to mind after you have sinned is, &#8220;I could have done better than this&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">It&#8217;s easy to be strong to resist sin in the presence of people until you are alone then you become vulnerable. A test of a Christian life is who you are when no one is around. If it goes too far without repentance, it will hinder your walk with the Lord and you will be considered a person &#8220;living in sin&#8221; and &#8220;not struggling with sin&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">We are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses waiting to see a believer fall. You fall, they will have a story to tell. The story is, &#8220;How can you call yourself a Christian and sin?&#8221; What they fail to understand is that being a Christian doesn&#8217;t make one perfect, fleshly drive is still present, we live in a fallen world.  Paul, the man responsible for most of the New Testament says in Romans 7:24, &#8220;O wretched (very miserable) man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death (sin)?. I wonder what kind of sins he may have been struggling with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">&#8220;Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles&#8221;, Macdonald fast food restaurant came up with a new slogan, &#8220;Change is good&#8221; and for us, change is good too. I am not saying change is fun. Change is where if you can&#8217;t fight the sin you are facing, change locations. This word is specifically to us men. If you can&#8217;t beat the devil in his game, move away from him. The bible says, &#8220;flee youthful lusts&#8230;&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t say cast them out, or stay and be strong. Running away could mean getting rid of those magazines besides your bed that are stir up lust, having wondering eyes towards the opposite sex (avoid the second look), movies that set your motor running, your computer that causes you to sin, places that causes you to stumble, people who cause you to compromise. The bible says, &#8220;throw off everything that hinders you&#8221; get rid of the sins that EASILY complicate things. When these things are present in your life, 1. You are sinning before a holy God, 2. You are being selfish towards your spouse or your spouse to be if you are not married. You may eat at home but where do you get your appetite?. Your appetite and meal should be at home, All your affections should be to your wife. 3. you are setting yourself to hindrances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">At times you have to get away from a confrontation that would stir anger that would lead you to sin, cool down before you come back to deal with it. Deal with whatever causes you to stumble. The enemy will only finish what you&#8217;ve started.  Like mentioned, change is not fun but it is good.

This is what  I normally call, &#8220;getting double for your trouble&#8221;. God knew of what she deserved for she was a virtuous woman, everything that she does is not out of selfish ambitions but you can see that God watches the motives and the intents of the heart. From being a wife of a junkie to being a wife of the next king, double for trouble. God did not have a problem establishing her and taking her to new levels but also look at how David was now blessed with a virtuous woman, intelligent woman, decisive, hard working, respectful, patient and one cares for other people&#8217;s needs. Listen to a king talking about a virtuous woman in Proverbs 31:10, &#8220;Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies. 11, &#8220;The heart of her husband safely trusts her;  So he will have no lack of gain&#8221;.  12, &#8220;She does him good and not evil All the days of her life&#8221;.  As you remember we said Abigail means Father rejoices, can we say her heavenly Father rejoiced over her? Proverbs 31:25, &#8221; Strength and honor are her clothing; She shall rejoice in time to come. 26, &#8220;She opens her mouth with wisdom, And on her tongue is the law of kindness&#8221;. Abi rejoiced in the time when it came for God establish her in due time. Here is the final piece of that Proverbs 31, 29&#8243;Many daughters have done well, But you excel them all.&#8221; 30, &#8220;Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised. 31, &#8220;Give her of the fruit of her hands, And let her own works praise her in the gates&#8221;. David praised, God established her and her story is still touching lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">My prayer is, God raises Abigail&#8217;s of today who will ride it out even in hard times because they know they are blessed in spite of. To know that character goes a long way. To be reminded that heavenly Father rejoices over them because they are faithful at all times. That they will trust God to establish them and maintain their qualities and values at all times. One sided beauty is not enough. Many have the outer beauty but missing the inner beauty, trials will either refine or break you. Proverbs 31 defines what a virtuous woman is, it sets a standard that all women should strive for but remember, &#8220;Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised&#8221;.

Have you realized how some times the Lord sends people your way who need your encouragement at the time you are very discouraged and need encouragement yourself? That when you have almost nothing, He sends someone not to add but for you give away the little you have. That when you need your spouse the most, it may turn out that they need you the most.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">1Samuel 25:32, &#8220;Then David said to Abigail: &#8220;Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself&#8221;. David believed God sent her so he blessed the Lord, blessed her advise and called her blessed. She may have never been called &#8220;a blessed woman&#8221; or she may have never seen herself as blessed. Question, how can she be called blessed when her current situation does not suggest any blessings? simple, she is not blessed when she has it all together,  she is blessed because she is in God&#8217;s will demonstrated in her character. She is better than her current situation but doesn&#8217;t act like she is. Just as she knows there are things that only God can fight for a person, she knows she is in the right hand. You may be facing challenges like Abigail and may even have an opportunity to do your spouse evil, this is the time to shine even more brighter in the midst of darkness. Defend, bless and pray for your companion, God is in control. He knows where you are and where you are going. Be faithful to your covenant and trust God with the rest. Along those lines, think about a difficult person you&#8217;ve worked with or a boss who frustrated you, instead of praying evil would befall them, let your light shine. Instead of trying to do things to make them quit, leave them in the hands of God.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">I have come to learn that there are times you don&#8217;t need to fight for yourself, God will. I see this strengthened in 2Chronicles 20:20, &#8220;&#8230;believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be established&#8230;&#8221;. The word establish means, to bring about, to place or settle in a secure position and condition. It also means to be recognized and accepted. God establishes His people by fulfilling all these in their lives. You will agree with me of the times God fought for you when you couldn&#8217;t fight for yourself.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">1Samuel 25:35, &#8220;So David received from her hand what she had brought to him, and said to her, &#8220;Go in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your voice and respected your person&#8221;. Abigail has had an experience of a life time, found favor before David, gave good advise, called blessed yet going back to her evil husband. Even David knows she is better than this but what he has spoken in her life, God will not leave her in the same condition for long. Back home as a good wife, she waited for the right time when Nabal was sober to share what she had done and how God through her had spared her household. With wisdom, one of her qualities, she gives her testimony of doing the right thing. Instead of Nabal rejoicing over what God had done, his heart died over what he lost. vs. 38, &#8220;Then it happened, after about ten days, that the Lord struck Nabal, and he died&#8221;. No one was seeking harm on Nabal, God gave him several chances to see His goodness through David and Abigail but his attitude clouded his way. God is gracious, slow to anger. God fought for Abigail and David within days. David didn&#8217;t have to get rid of him, God did it Himself at the right time when He needed to. Don&#8217;t be frustrated because God is not doing what you want Him to do or He is not doing it fast enough, He can either change the situation by making it well, or move something or someone for your establishment without your help. All he requires you is to be faithful till the end. God is more than able to accomplish what concerns us today, how He will do it? We don&#8217;t know, we know we have placed it all in ABLE hands. If no one calls you blessed, call yourself blessed right where you are.

She makes good food, sends it a head of her while coming behind maybe rehearsing her plea case (response and words) to David. She is teaching me something that no matter how tough situation is and no matter what judgment has been passed, before it becomes effective, there is still an opportunity to do something, intercede. If the door is still open, you have an opportunity to walk through it. Esther made a move to go to the king though she understood that she could perish but because of her people, she said I will go, if I perish, let me perish but at least I made a move.

She has a chance to smear her husband because of who he is, she has done nothing wrong but willing to take the blame for the sake of her household. She has every stone in her hands to throw at her husband but she throws none. She says, &#8220;It&#8217;s me who has sinned but don&#8217;t hold anything against him for that is his nature&#8221;. She is not seeking opportunities to leave him but seeking opportunities to protect him. She has a chance to do him evil, her character shines beyond that. Trials reveal your true character. How many would look for reasons to leave their spouses during trials? One Christian woman told me how she wished her husband would cheat on her and have a reason to divorce him because they were in a trial.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">This is what Paul says in 1Corinthians 7:13&amp;14, &#8220;And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife,&#8221; if you are already married to the unsaved, you never know your act of kindness could one day be a reason for him to be saved. Willing to sanctify for the sake of her household even if it means not having her way but the Lord knows that she is better than what she is dealing with at home with her husband.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Read Vs 25-31 and see her reasoning and advise, 29 Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; and the lives of your enemies He shall sling out, as from the pocket of a sling&#8221;. Her first move is to protect her family; her advice is to protect the next king. So far nothing she is doing is about herself. Her advice, one stopped David from doing harm not just to her family but also to him. Saul who is out to kill him is pursuing David, he has had opportunities to kill Saul but he lives everything in the hands of God. He knows that he is the next king but the timing is not in his hands and doing something stupid could jeopardize his destiny. So if the Lord is handling all his enemies, can he trust the Lord enough with Nabal&#8217;s case? Instead of stepping in to get rid of Nabal, he lives him in the hands of God an advice Abigail gives him. She is also letting him know that his blessings are not coming through what he does with his hands but how obedient he is to God. David is being reminded that what the Lord has started, He will accomplish it without the enemy terminating it. I would say, behind every successful man, there is a virtuous woman encouraging him to do good, bringing out his strengths and qualities, and giving him godly advises because she desires for him to succeed. I found out that under pressure or anger, men are quick to retaliate, causing more harm or making a situation even worse. Thank God for our wives who calm us down. Through Abigail, God constrained David from killing Nabal because just like he had an opportunity to kill Saul, he respected his position instead. I think it&#8217;s good at times to be reminded of what you stand for when overwhelming situations want you to do things that are contrary to your life style (character). My dad has many times told us how mom helped him put things into perspective when overwhelming situations that brought about anger and frustration almost pushed him to do something or quit to regret later.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Is Abigail blessed?

Ever asked yourself that question? I have many times. A precious woman ending up with a very, I mean very wrong husband in my opinion and the other way round. This is my conviction about the whole situation, however bad someone is, there are certain people who have the grace to live and endure with them that no one else can. You couldn&#8217;t take it because you don&#8217;t have that kind of grace. Such people have been prepared for such people to take that responsibility. What could be your mess, by God&#8217;s grace could be someone else&#8217; blessing. Look at these two women in the bible, Job&#8217;s wife and Jezebel, King Ahab&#8217;s wife. Job&#8217;s wife under pressure gave Job wrong advise but he never took it, Jezebel who is an evil woman gave her husband a wrong advise and he headed to it. Let me talk about a different woman today by the name of Abigail who also gave a good advise and that advise was taken by someone she wasn&#8217;t married to at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Abigail is one of those women in the bible who blesses my heart. About the whole chapter is dedicated to her story. First of all, Abigail means Father rejoices. Her name does not seam to be working in her favor but God knows her dilemma. We are told of her character in 1Sam 25:3, &#8220;&#8230;And she is a woman of good understanding and beautiful appearance&#8221;. By reading her story, I gathered some of her qualities, she is a very intelligent woman, decisive, hard working, respectful, patient and cares for other people&#8217;s needs. She reminds me of what a virtuous woman is described in proverbs 31. She is married to a man by the name of Nabal who is harsh, evil, arrogant, stingy, lover of himself etc. I know that opposites attract but to me there is something wrong with this picture. How could a woman of all these qualities be married to a man like this? It seams to me that a lot of information is not conveyed to her yet concerning things she is suppose to know, she is not cherished as I gather from what I have read. Her qualities are left to go down the drain because she is not even appreciated for what she does. Her words, opinions, works are criticized by the person who should cherish them. How did she end up in a marriage like this? Who is she in this marriage? what is the purpose of her life? we will find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>David and his men are in Carmel. A while back in Carmel, we are told he and his man protected Nabal&#8217;s life, his family, servants and all his properties. None of the things did they miss but now David is asking for a small favor from Nabal. He is not asking for reward, wealth, partnership in Nabal&#8217;s business, all he desired of Nabal was hospitality to which he never received. Nabal has so much to have forgotten David, he is asking who David is. vs. 11, &#8220;Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, to give it to men when I do not know where they are from?&#8221;. The verse has a lot of &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;MY&#8221; to which means, I take all the credit for what has happened. Do not be full and forget who you are, where you came from, who helped you, by what means things came about. Pride goes before a fall we know that. Nabal is really walking on thin ice, this will not only affect him but the people who are close to him. Nabal the rich man insulted David and his men and David was very angry and wroth that he rose up with his four hundred men heading towards Nabal&#8217;s territory to destroy it but here comes Abigail.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>I wanted to lay a ground work on who Abigail and Nabal are and then tomorrow I will share more on Abigail&#8217;s qualities. Though her situation is tough and complicated, her beauty from within and outside is shinning brighter and brighter as you will see. IT&#8217;S NOT WHAT YOU GO THROUGH THAT DEFINES YOU, IT&#8217;S WHO YOU ARE, what a virtuous woman. What you go through may refine you or break you, the choice is yours. She doesn&#8217;t look blessed in her situation but she is blessed, check out what her name means and see her character.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Ev<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Samuel 25:2-42, &#8220;Then David said to Abigail: &#8220;Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!

These are the times you find yourself doing things you would not normally do, going extra mile, constantly thinking of the one you love and wondering, how did you make it all these years without him or her? It&#8217;s a good feeling but I as have learnt, love is more than feelings, it&#8217;s a CHOICE. The other thing that makes it to blossom even more is when you learn the language of love your partner responds to. What you respond to might not be what your partner responds to.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>I am also a firm believer of this quote of mine, &#8220;MARRIAGE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT TO BE WITH GOD&#8217;S HELP&#8221;. Out of the abundance of this love one man asked, where does it go after one gets married? I have spoken to some people and it was clear, what they once had was no longer present or if it was, less attention was given to it. Let me take a principle from the story of Joseph and his two wives. Jacob was in love with Rachel, so he served her father seven years in order to marry her and what happened, he found himself with Leah in the morning, Rachel&#8217;s older sister exactly the opposite of what he desired. This is where my scripture comes in, someone in a relationship or marriage is feeling like they labored for Rachel but one morning they found themselves with Leah instead. What happened to the Rachel you labored for? How did she (he) turn out to be Leah after marriage (this is for both men and women).? Are you feeling like you were tricked into to marrying Leah thinking it was Rachel? What do you do now, get rid of Leah to find Rachel?. Jacob was disappointed to have married Leah but he did not get rid of her, since he still desired to marry Rachel, he still had a chance and therefore labored another 7 more years for her. This is what I call patience laboring in good times and in bad times to bring out what is missing. So Jacob had two wives, Leah and Rachel sisters but different. Both have different qualities and are all significant and vital.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Where does this leave us? Should we be in more than one relationship because what we desired did not come forth in the other? What we labored for was not birthed and so we throw in the towel? For me I see an opportunity to labor for a Rachel within the presence of a Leah. I have heard stories about people who labored for Rachel but felt like they ended up with Leah therefore labored in their marriage for some time without giving up on Leah to be married to Rachel. Same woman, double qualities. They confessed they almost threw away the best gift from God. They just realized there was a Rachel trapped inside their Leah&#8217;s they needed to labor for. They learnt that Leah had qualities Rachel did not have and vice versa. Their gifts and blessings complemented and completed each other. That is why we need to thank God for both strengths and weaknesses in our spouses.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Those who have succeeded learnt to speak the love language their mates could understand. Not their own love language they hoped their mates would understand. The more they did, the more the beauty both inside and outside was revealed to blossom. They came in as separate pieces together and began to assemble their love together, fitting each piece in it&#8217;s rightful place without trying to force around peg on a square hole. They learnt that it&#8217;s more than being together, it&#8217;s about assembly because you can be together but feel separate. Assembly requires work and skills building together. They didn&#8217;t want to try to separate a Rachel and a Leah, they discovered they could assemble both together after all they came from the same womb and fitted well by God&#8217;s design. Don&#8217;t dismiss Leah when she is a Rachel to be discovered and yet a Leah not lost. We can have extra ordinary relationships out of the ordinary because we have learnt to maximize opportunities within what we already have to bring out what we never had.

Often mistake made is when you encourage someone who has either lost a dear one and say the same words when you&#39;ve never been in that situation yourself before. If you&#39;ve not gone through it, you don&#39;t know how it feels, period. The best way to respond is &quot;I don&#39;t know how it feels but I want to let you know I care&quot;. The good encouragers are the ones who have had a taste of it and can stand and encourage because they are the point of reference to that person at that point.<\/p>\n<p>For God to create, He only had to speak yet for Him to redeem, Christ had to suffer. There are many things that accompany Jesus&#39; presence here on earth. We know His main mission was to come and die on the cross to save mankind at the same time when He was here, He taught, healed, raised the dead, raised leaders etc. We also need to understand He became a person (Man) to identify with us. YOU CANNOT REDEEM WHAT RELATED TO. Christ had to relate to us, bring Himself to our level then redeem us. He was here on earth 100% God and 100% Man. Living a normal human life, that was Jesus. He was tempted like any other man, was moved when He lost His friend Lazarus, rejected by men, lied on, hated by many, hungered, denied, had no place to live and call His own, experienced hardships, experienced exhaustion, emotionally drained, became a servant, whipped on the whipping post, stripped naked, crucified on the cross etc. When Jesus says to me, &quot;I know how it feels son&quot;, I know He does, HE HAS BEEN THERE.<\/p>\n<p>Here comes the good part, after His resurrection, He ascended into heaven but before then He says, John 14:14, &quot;If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.&quot; Why do we pray in &quot;Jesus name&quot; and not in &quot;God&#39;s name&quot; directly? Jesus said, when you pray, pray in my name. God has never been flesh and blood, yes He is God but He has never reduced Himself to the level of men to feel what men feels. In the old testament they did not have GRACE like we do, they did not have the kind of mercy we have today, all these came more as a result of Jesus experience, the ultimate sacrifice. We offer prays to God through Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit, Jesus takes our prayers and presents them to God in a better way. It&#39;s like a child who has picked flowers for his dad, he gives them to the mother and the mother preps them in a way they look presentable and gives them to the father saying, &quot;from your son&quot;. Jesus having been here on earth prays on our behalf when we ask, &quot;Father, I know how it feels to be in their position, do not destroy them, provide for them, let GRACE and MERCY plead for them. When I pray in Jesus name, Jesus presents my case to the Father as an experienced God\/Man because He has been there. Proverbs 18:10, &quot;The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous run to it and are safe&quot;. Praying in His name causes you to stand strong supported by a strong tower. You are safe under that name when Jesus is busy presenting your case and my case to the Father. Romans 8:34, &quot;Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us&quot;. Anything desired in line with God&#39;s word is released under Jesus name (signature, label). If we ask God through His Son&#39;s name, Jesus puts His seal of approval. Go through the one who knows your feelings.

Yes He may allow temptations to come but He is not the author of it. If that is the case, how do we explain Matthew 4:1,&#8221; Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil&#8221;. If God is not tempted and Jesus was God, how is it that He was led of the Holy Spirit not demonic spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil?. He was in the wilderness as God Man and the bible says He was tempted in all manner. While still at it, mark that the bible does not say that while he was in the wilderness, the devil tempted Him, He was led there to be tempted. And the temptation did not come to Him in His strong moments, it came in His weak moments as a Man. God Himself is never the agent of temptation (James 1:13), but here as in the book of Job God uses even satanic tempting to serve His sovereign purposes. And for Christ to be tempted is an indication that we will not be immuned to trials and temptations. Of course no one wants to be tempted and tried, but it has it&#8217;s place in our lives and can serve God&#8217;s purposes for His glory depending on how we handle it. Remember Christ was tempted in all points (Heb. 4:15; 1 John 2:16); Satan tempted Him with &#8220;the lust of the flesh&#8221; (Matt 4:2, 3); &#8220;the lust of the eyes&#8221; (Matt 4:8, 9); and &#8220;the pride of life&#8221; (Matt 4:5, 6). These are the same three temptations we all face in our lives, summed up the Flesh, the World, and the Devil  <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> Jesus was tempted in all manner yet without sin. Here is a Martin Luther quote to make this point clear &#8220;YOU CAN&#8217;T STOP BIRDS FROM FLYING OVER YOUR HEAD BUT YOU CAN KEEP THEM FROM BUILDING A NEST IN YOUR HAIR.&#8221; In other words, you can&#8217;t stop temptations from coming your way but you can stop them from dwelling in you and taking control over you and God has to be our help in this area. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> It is by temptation that we are tried and educated; yet we are justified in praying to our Father not to lead us into temptation so long as we live with childlike submission, to His loving will the means by which our faith is to be strengthened and our spiritual life purified and ennobled. We are not to go willingly into temptation, the reason it&#8217;s a battle. The temptation itself is not sin, but we fear that we may sin through it. 1Corinthians 10:13, No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it. It&#8217;s through temptation that we see areas we are more vulnerable to and we cry out to God to deliver us from it. It&#8217;s in our weakness that He is strong, 2 Corinthians 12:9, &#8220;And He said to me, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.&#8221; Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me&#8221;. Think of it this way, what has been manufactured is taken through tests to see how ready it is to be used. If they find that it&#8217;s not ready in certain areas, they take it back to the shop for more development Thank God that through temptations, He is growing us more in holiness. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> And so when we pray, &#8220;Lead us not into temptation&#8221; it&#8217;s like saying, :&#8221;Lord, I know that temptations will come my way to serve your sovereign purposes and I know I am vulnerable to temptations for my flesh is craving to sin with it present, yet I pray that I will not be stubborn that I push aside everything and yield my flesh into the sin in the temptation and YOU LET ME HAVE MY WAY&#8221;, the last thing any one wants is to hear God say, &#8220;have it your way&#8221;. James 4:7 Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. 8 Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL is the process of knowing God&#8217;s power, we ask Him to deliver us from the evil that is in the temptation, relying upon His promise that He will not suffer us to be tried above what we are able to handle, but with every temptation will provide us a way of escape. Everyone is vulnerable to some kind of temptations and no one is exempt from it. The first thing is knowing where we are and desiring God to bring us out of it while yielding to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. 2Corinthians 10:4-, Philippians 2:13-14, Job 23:10.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Ev<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Matthew 6:13, &#8220;And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one&#8221;

To forgive and to be forgiven have such great weights. I heard of a story of a man who was involved in killing the Jews during the time of Adolf Hitler. What he did resonated in his mind every single day and as he got closer to the death, he opted to find peace by looking for any Jew who would find in his heart to forgive him of his crime. He sought forgiveness diligently and was hard to find a person who could pronounce him forgiven.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">I break out forgive into two words For &amp; Give. &#8220;For&#8221; could be interpreted as Free. &#8220;Give&#8221; is the act of letting go what one is holding onto to (confession). If we want God to forgive us, we have to forgive others (let go what we are holding onto freely), drop the charges, throw the case out of the court. We have been forgiven much, we still fail the Lord every single day and we cry out to Him to forgive us what about us forgiving others. To continue looking at the parable Jesus gave, we see a servant forgiven of all his debt, Matthew 18:28 &#8220;But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, &#8216;Pay me what you owe!&#8217; Amplified bible version shows that a 100 denarii could be equivalent to 20 dollars. He owed 10 million while he was owed only 20 bucks. Remembering what he was forgiven should have filled his heart with gratitude and would have been willing to show compassion and kindness to one who owed him. Yet in the realm of our day to day living we find it hard to forgive our debtors, those who have wronged us. It&#8217;s like what they have done to us could not be done to anyone else. If we only understood what we&#8217;ve been forgiven, we would find it in our hearts to forgive. Therefore I believe Matthew 6:12, &#8220;And forgive us our debts, &#8230;&#8221; not only addresses our current sins we are seeking forgiveness for, it also reminds us of the great and many sins He has forgiveness us of already. Look at what this man did, he took matters into is own hands demanding to be paid and when this other servant could not pay, he threw him into prison completely forgetting the mercy he was shown when he needed one, how is this applicable to us. It&#8217;s easy to forget and react in away not expected of you, again we need to always remember what He has done for us. Here are some of the results of un forgiveness, un forgiveness takes a toll on you, it&#8217;s a thief of time, joy and peace. Un forgiveness is a poison the enemy uses to destroy a believer, it imprisons you, it prevents God from forgiving us; healing of the body, mind and spirit can be blocked because of un forgiveness; un forgiveness opens doors for you to be tormented, It blocks our prayers from being heard and answered, un forgiveness hinders your spiritual growth. Luke 6:14 &#8220;For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. , Matthew 18:34 &#8220;And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him. 35 &#8220;So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses., Mark 11:25, 25 &#8220;And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses, Colossians 3:12, 12 Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; 13 bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do. James 5:16, &#8220;Confess your faults one to another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed&#8221;. Not only forgive, take it another mile and pray for those who despitefully use you, don&#8217;t pray about them, pray for them, pray a blessing over the lives . Peter asked how many times we should forgive people who wrong us, Jesus replied seventy times seven meaning always. Choosing to forgive is power in your hands you can use to release someone of your charges against them and open doors for greater blessings. The only way you can want to forgive is to remember of what you&#8217;ve been forgiven of and what un forgiveness does. Forgive us as we forgive.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/>Ev<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Matthew 6:12, &#8220;And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors&#8221; Forgiveness is a very powerful word yet it&#8217;s also a very hard thing to deal with.

God is brilliant, He set it that way for a reason we will learn. God deals with us as we deal with us. Here is what I believe the reason is, Peter asked Jesus how many times one ought to forgive, Jesus in turn told them of a parable, Matthew 18:23, &#8220;Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settles accounts with his servants&#8221;. In this parable, we find that there was a king who had servants and one servant owed him Ten thousand talents. Amplified bible version estimates 10,000 talents to be over 10 Million Dollars. Back then, 1 talent was a monetary unit worth about twenty years&#8217; wages for a laborer. If this man lived 80 years, he could only repay back his master about 4 talents, what a debt. Matthew 18:25, says, &#8220;But as he was not able to pay, his master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and that payment be made&#8221;. There was no way ever that this man could pay his debt back in his state.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">I think we still have failed to understand and also bring people to the knowledge of what we owe or owed the Lord. We want to tell people their debts are paid before they understand what their debt is and the cost of it. The Lord not only told us that this man owed, he told us exactly what he owed to shed light that it was no small debt and there is a reason why. The bible says in Romans 6:23, &#8220;for the wages of sin is death&#8230;&#8221;, that is the payment for sin which is transgression of the law, that is what it takes to satisfy the demand of the law broken. If a man was fined only 100 dollars, you can conclude his crime was petty but if you hear a man was sentenced to death, you can conclude his crime was huge the reason this parable hits home. What he owed condemned him to death.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">You have to understand what you owe and in no position to pay it back however hard you try. The man who owed could not pay back and the payment which would still not be enough to cover his debt was to have him sold, his wife, his children and all that he had. In other words, him and all that was his.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Matthew 18:26, &#8220;The servant therefore fell down before him, saying, &#8216;Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.&#8217; 27 Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt&#8221;. This man had good intentions but no ability even if he was given a life time to repay. The same today, people are trying hard to pay their debt by trying to be good hoping they can be good enough to erase the debt. I think people try to pay it because they have not been told the cost of paying it back. In this man&#8217;s condition of hopelessness, the master did three things that took care of the matter, 1. he had compassion on him 2. he released him 3. he forgave him of his debts.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">To understand the magnitude of the debt of sin we&#8217;ve been forgiven, we have to look at the cross where the Son of God suffered and died. DL Moody said, &#8220;To create God only had to speak, to REDEEM, Christ had to SUFFER&#8221;, that is what it took to make things right, Christ payment through His suffering and death. Isaiah 53:5, &#8220;But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed (NIV), Hebrews 9:22, &#8220;In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.(NIV).<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">With this I now have a great understanding of what it means to pray, &#8220;Forgive us our debts&#8230;&#8221; (Vertical)  and it prepares me for &#8220;&#8230;As we forgive our debtors (Horizontal).

I don&#8217;t see how we can effectively pray for &#8220;our daily&#8221; needs without being in the word when the request for your daily needs are filtered through the word. The bible says, &#8220;We don&#8217;t get because we don&#8217;t ask and if we also ask we ask a miss&#8230;&#8221; paraphrased.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">There are two key words in this line that will definitely change how we approach God with needs. We have &#8220;US&#8221; and &#8220;OUR&#8221;. In as much as we desire our needs met by God, we need to understand that there is someone somewhere in need of the same things too and we are allowed to be in some situations that we might remember to lift up someone else&#8217; needs too. This is what I would call corporate blessings while interceding for others. It&#8217;s easy not to pray for someone else in a situation when you are not in it too. Happens to me a lot.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">On this verse alone, we understand that it&#8217;s God first, other&#8217;s second, me third. Loving God first and loving my neighbors as much as I love myself.  That my blessings can never be complete until my brother and or my sister has received their portion and so I pray for them that they too may also receive. I have heard people say that they have nothing to offer, well prayer can be offered on someone&#8217;s behalf. I used to offer prayers about what affected me and mentioned my family in prayers and that was it but I later realized that someone&#8217;s marriage was on the rocks and needed prayers, someone was sick, someone&#8217;s family was going through tough times, some of my colleagues at work were going through tough times, my surrounding were filled by unsaved who needed prayers that God would save them. The more I prayed for other people&#8217;s needs, the more I was blessed myself. There are certain things I received not because I prayed for them but because I lifted up someone&#8217;s needs, this is in relation to the topic we did before, &#8220;the power of borrowing vessels&#8221;. Take care of God&#8217;s business and He will take care of yours,<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Job 42:10, &#8220;And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before&#8221;. Imagine what Job went through and nothing happens until towards the end when he prayed for his friends. God would not hear his friends prayers because He was angry with them but when Job prayed for them, God heard his prayers. The bible says, &#8220;God is angry with the wicked daily&#8221; (paraphrased), how will He hear their prayers if He is angry with them? He will hear the prayers of the ones who He has saved on their behalf. Abraham interceded for Sodom because Lot was there, Moses interceded for his sister Miriam when she had leprosy.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">God gives you what you &#8220;need&#8221; not &#8220;want&#8221;. Hebrews 10:35&amp;36&#8243; Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise&#8221;, Philippians 4:19, &#8220;But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">When you find yourself in a situation where you are praying for God&#8217;s intervention, count it a privilege to be in a position to pray for someone else who may be in the same situation. And the same intensity you have to pray for your need, would be the same intensity to pray for someone else. Who knows whether the Lord allowed you to be in that situation for the sake of someone else. That He will not hear their prayer directly because they are not right with Him.

There is nothing wrong about praying for our daily needs, the question is, what comes first? Jesus also said according to John 6:57-58, &#8220;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on Me will live because of Me. 58 This is the bread which came down from heaven-not as your fathers ate the manna, and are dead. He who eats this bread will live forever.&#8221; His word is Him John 1, and His word is about Him. Hebrews 10:7, &#8220;Then I said, &#8216;Behold, I have come-In the volume of the book it is written of Me-To do Your will, O God.&#8217;<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">To desire Him more than anything else is to desire His word. 1 Peter 2:2, &#8220;As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby&#8221;.

To treasure His word, to study it, to desire it, to have an appetite for His word. And I have come to cherish even more His word and refuse to go a day without reading it even if it&#8217;s for a short time. I cherish His word that I listen to teachings and preaching of His word every day because His word is precious to me.

At first I thought it was just where I was, but then I looked outside and realized that the block where I worked in White Plains had black out too. I then learned that a huge part of NY was out of power.  Then news came to me that the blackout had further reaching implications than I had thought.  What would be doing at a time or thinking, and how would you be affected?  Maybe the Word of God can shed some &#8220;light&#8221; on things in our lives and serve as an intense implication.  John 8:12, &#8220;Then Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, &#8220;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> I am the light of the world: Jesus had an identity, He surely knew who He was and His purpose.  He was the light for the entire world.  He came into the world to shine upon the darkness of it.  And what is darkness, but simply the absence of light.  And Christ was not going to be light for a small community, or just for Israel, but for the WHOLE WORLD. Jesus came in more important than the sun, because the spiritual darkness of this world needed a great light.  The &#8220;candles&#8221; of judges, prophets, and patriarchs throughout history were not complete in that the &#8220;wicks&#8221; of their times were light for a time, but would go out with the death of the prophets.  BUT NOT WITH JESUS!  He was a light that would shine for the whole world to experience, because it was the whole world that needed Him, even unbeknown to themselves.  So why is not the light of Christ shinning throughout the hearts and lives of ALL in the world?<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> Whoever follows me will NOT walk in darkness: The key is in the following Christ.  Are you a fan or a follower is a message I heard once by a preacher Pat Mesiti.  A fan is someone who when the Yankees, or their team are winning stay with, and support the team as long as they are winning.  But the followers are the ones that stay with their team, win or lose, good and bad times.  A follower follows no matter what happens.  They will paint their car, or their body with the symbols of their favorite team.  There are some who are only fans of Christ: whenever; things don&#8217;t go their way, they jump off the ship.  Then there are the followers, no matter what happens they will stick it out. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were followers.  When the king said to bow to the idol, they refused, saying God can save them, but even if He does not they still would not bow. WOW, now that&#8217;s a follower.  Daniel would not allow a lion&#8217;s den to keep him from his prayer time.  That&#8217;s a follower.  And Job refused to curse God in his tough times, but rather stay committed no matter what.  That&#8217;s a follower.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> The rich young ruler when invited to follow Christ, chose his riches, his idols, instead of following Christ.  He stayed in darkness.  Is it all contingent upon following Christ?  Yes!  Jesus said in Rev. 3:20, &#8220;Behold I stand at the door and knock, anyone who hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him, and sup (eat) with him and he with me.&#8221;  Whoever opens the door of the light, let&#8217;s the light in, and will not be in darkness, but in the light of the Lord.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> What keeps us from being a follower?

That it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will that we give Him thanks in everything. Note that the bible does not say to give Him thanks &#8220;FOR&#8221;. It&#8217;s while we are IN it that we give thanks. Now look at vs. 16 and 17 how they are punctuated and see that there is more to it. The bible says, &#8220;Rejoice always, 17 pray without ceasing, 18 in everything give thanks&#8221;. If you ever struggle to know what the will of God is for your life, think on these three because I believe they are the foundation of knowing God&#8217;s will and should not miss in a believer&#8217;s life, 1. Rejoice always 2. Pray without ceasing 3. In everything give thanks. You can never miss His will if you remember these three. Not only do these three help us understand the foundation of the will of God in our lives, it drives the devil nuts.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">If the enemy&#8217;s work is to kill, steal and destroy (John 10:10), how can he break someone who is constantly rejoicing in all things, praying without giving up and in everything always giving thanks? The devil wants you to reject God when things are not going right, he wants you to be depressed and moody, he wants you to complain and be grumpy but those who know their God will not fall for his tricks. They will remember that God is in control always and will let them deal with more than they can handle. Paul says 2Timothy 12 &#8220;For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">I can rejoice because I know in who I believe in, I can pray without ceasing because I know He is more than able, In everything I can give thanks because I am in a position to learn, grow, be stronger knowing there is a reason why He has allowed me to be in a situation. This morning as I was getting ready to come to work, while checking car oil, my car electronically locked the doors with my ONLY set of car keys in it. Oh how I should have been upset and frustrated on a cold morning trying to figure out what I would do. Anyway, I calmed myself down, rejoiced in it however hard it was, prayed for wisdom and gave thanks. The enemy would have loved to see my flip but he did not see it happen. Anyway, with God&#8217;s wisdom, as I was trying different things to see if I could open it, believe it or not, by God&#8217;s grace I was able to open it in 15 mins (last time even the police could not open it up). What a miracle from the Lord when I needed it most. I came to work rejoicing even more. Praises be to God. In all things, remember the foundation of God&#8217;s will for every believer.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/>Ev <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Thessalonians 5:16, &#8220;Rejoice always, 17 pray without ceasing, 18 in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you&#8221; In looking at the few verses in 1Thess 5, I realize that many times we look at verse 18 in reference to the will of God.

Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.<\/p>\n<p>I think that Paul invested more in his spiritual son Timothy than anyone else. Paul reached many churches through his preaching and his writings but when it came to Timothy, he had special place for him. He took time to invest truth, what to do, what to watch out for etc as he journeyed with the Lord. In 2Tim 4, it sounds like Paul&#8217;s journey on earth was almost coming to an end, and he takes time to impart in Timothy to what I would call the last words. People are intrigued by other people&#8217;s last words before they pass into the eternity. There is something about the last words. I&#8217;ve read last words of some famous people and they left me thinking.<\/p>\n<p>If I was to sum up Paul&#8217;s last words to Timothy I would say he told him to &#8220;Preach the word in season and out of season&#8221;, in other words, preach Christ as He is at all times without addition or subtraction from the word. He knew Timothy would face trying times that had the ability to push him to dilute the word or manipulate it for the sake of people. Paul encouraged him to &#8220;preach the word&#8221; whether it would make him popular or not. His duty was to please the Lord and not people. Paul Washer says, &#8220;We should have seeker friendly churches&#8221; but that is &#8220;church seeking for God&#8221;. Our times people equate success with whether something works. If you are successful in it, can draw crowd, is eloquent etc it&#8217;s ok, if that is the case as Paris Reidhead would say, then men like Jeremiah and Jonah would be considered failures. Jeremiah preached many years and I don&#8217;t recall him having any converts, Jonah preached, had only his family as converts. In the eyes of many, they may have failed but not God, He was pleased because they preached His word.<\/p>\n<p>I am very concerned as to what many preachers teach on today. Many years ago I went to a church where they practiced drinking anointing oil. I was still new in Christ and too naive to figure out<span>  <\/span>it wasn&#8217;t scriptural. Thereafter in still learning I was listening to men&#8217;s teachings that sounded very scriptural until some men of God pointed me to the word to see the truth. Not long after, I began to test the spirits, listen carefully to some teachings and not too quick to receive any word just because it was preached or taught in Jesus name. That is why we need to discern, not every one who uses the name of the Lord is of the Lord. I am now very careful not to listen to every kind of preacher just because they may be preacher celebrity and can pull great crowds. All I want to know, are they preaching the word as it is. 1 Thessalonians 5:21, &#8220;Test all things; hold fast what is good&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2Timothy 4:3, &#8220;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers;&#8221; We live in those times, where people don&#8217;t want to hear sound doctrines (teachings). They go about looking for preachers who will preach what they want to hear. They run from one conference to another, move from one church to another, can receive all preaching about life enhancement and is closed to any preaching on sin, law, righteousness, holiness, judgment, self denial, faithful endurance and hell. I believe that there should be a balance including preaching on prosperity, healing, deliverance, callings, reaching the lost. With my constant meeting with the unsaved, I understand why people do not care for the sound doctrine. Infact the line I hear a lot is, &#8220;I am comfortable with my own sets of beliefs&#8221;. People throw out what is good (the truth) because it does not make them comfortable, they would rather live a lie than be exposed. If you are comfortable in your own sets of beliefs, you will either try to find someone who can support what you believe or get grounded in what you believe. It begins with salvation and the late Keith Green puts it beautifully, &#8220;It&#8217;s better for someone to be afraid that they are NOT saved and TRULY be saved, than someone to THINK they are saved and they AREN&#8217;T. it&#8217;s better to have a salvation you are doubting than to have NO salvation that you are SURE of. See Paul is saying that it will be according to their own desires and having people who can preach what they purpose to hear. I will not be surprised if in some churches the preacher will only preach on what the people who give more money hint to them what they should preach on.<\/p>\n<p>The time is now that we need to be careful of what we hear, what we take in, what we apply. We don&#8217;t want to live in error, we don&#8217;t want to go by false prophesies, we don&#8217;t want to be deceived and we don&#8217;t want to live a lie. Paul said, &#8220;Preach the word&#8221;, not to others only but to yourself. I would rather have the total package that deals with everything from the word of God whether it be easy or hard TO RECEIVE. If there be something not right in my life, I want to preach to myself, be convicted of it and change. Paul gave Tim the total package 2Tim 4:2, &#8220;Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching (doctrine)&#8221;.

All rise please. The Superior Court is now in session, the Honorable Judge, presiding&#8221;. As soon as the Judge is seated, the Court Usher invites those present to be seated. Right before the Judge steps in, everything is out of place, there is noise, people scattered but the moment the Judge comes and sits, the house is in order and peaceful as the court is in session. Anything that disturbs the decorum and good order of the Court is prohibited. On one side we have the prosecutors and their lawyers and one side we have the defendants with their lawyers. All heads are turned towards the judge for He is the boss. Everything in that court is under his jurisdiction. I would like to talk to us a little bit about our Judge the King of kings and how we fall in His court session.<\/p>\n<p>Our powerful tool we use to defend ourselves with and use to plead for mercy when we fail is prayer. A couple of years ago when I was being raised to be a prayer warrior, God taught me about what prayer is all about and how I can defend, act and plead in His courts of law. When we go to pray, we are calling the Judge to have a session with us and the first thing we do is usher Him in just like the court usher does with our earthly judges. Ushering Him brings everything to order, Isaiah 40:22, &#8220;It is He who sits above the circle of the earth&#8221;. No one can sit until the judge sits. No hearing of any cases until He sits. When God sits, the court is in session, there is order for He is a God of order. That is why I don&#8217;t just run in the courts of God and present my case immediately, I take the time to usher Him with praise and worship and when He is sited, then my case comes in. But this is not my message today, it&#8217;s helping tailor what I will say.<\/p>\n<p>If you are going to defend yourself, act or plead you have to know the law, you have to know what, when and how to speak the law. I must admit that I am one of those people who don&#8217;t just run and say, &#8220;whatever your will is let it be&#8221; I want to know what it is. Like  when you have fallen short, the judge tends to ask you what you have to say after hearing your sentence. Many plead for mercy, grace, pardon. I saw Hezekiah, Moses, Abraham plead with God when His will was about to prevail cause you never know how what was about to happen could be turned and made something better. Grace and Mercy are always present to fight for us, not because we are innocent but because they see far beyond the failure. That if the judge hangs on that culprit for a little while, He can make Him what He wants Him to be regardless of the His current situation.<\/p>\n<p>I realize the people who tend to leave it at, &#8220;whatever you say&#8221; do not know the word of God and how it is applicable to them. The bible says in John 1:1, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God&#8221; therefore, I who is coming to Him according to His word, I am agreeing with Him about what He says about His Word. If I know the Word, I know who He is and what He stands for. If I am going to pray, I am going to have to pray His Word, why? John 1:4, &#8220;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men&#8221;. He who has light is sure of where they are going but he who does not have light, tries different things hoping to find the way. Psalm 119:105, &#8220;Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path&#8221;. A person who has the Word, walks confidently because the light shines on his path while a person who has no light tries to walk cautiously at times hitting their foot on things. This is the part of John 15:7, &#8220;If you abide in Me&#8230;&#8221;, abiding in the light.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, let&#8217;s look at another scripture that completes the whole process, John 1:14, &#8220;And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth&#8221;. The word which was invisible became visible through the flesh. I believe that the Word is never complete until the intangible becomes tangible; the invisible becomes visible; the impossible becomes possible; the ineffective becomes effective; until the disappointments turn into appointments; until chaos are turned into order. This is what the Word does, it does the opposite of what is already present. How cool that is. This is why when I pray, I pray the word into the now ness of my situation that whatever had been there can be reversed because of the power of God&#8217;s word applied correctly. Hebrews 4:12, &#8220;The Word of the Lord is living and powerful&#8230;&#8221; You may only see it in black ink on paper but let it be known to you it&#8217;s living. The reason you may not see it living is because before your eyes it&#8217;s invisible but when you begin to bring it into action, you begin to see the life in it and how it has the power to affect everything that you apply the Word to. John 15:7, &#8220;&#8230;and My words abide in you&#8221;, His words give life to every part of our being and situations that are paralyzed or dead. The Judge hears all cases and often times you will hear them quote certain sections of the law that the judge himself knows, I quote a lot of scriptures when I pray by saying, &#8220;according to your word&#8230;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In my prayer, this is important to quote scriptures, they boost my faith. I gain courage in His presence and I am confident not in myself but in His Word. It&#8217;s one thing to abide to which many do but it another thing to allow God&#8217;s words to abide in you to which many miss. Look at the last part of John 15:7, &#8220;&#8230;you shall ask what you will and it shall be given unto you&#8221; Who can bring that apart from the residing judge. Usher Him in, Know the word, pray the Word.

Parenting becomes manageable when two parents are present to raise their child or children. Each parent has a responsibility in the life of the child or the children they have. There are things the Father will teach better than the mother and there are things the mother will do a better job than the father. So together they team up to bring the child in the fear and the knowledge of God. It becomes a greater challenge when the mother has to play the role of the father and the mother in the life of the child or the children. Without the male figure in the home, how would they instill some of the Father like values?<\/p>\n<p>Hagar, Sarah&#8217;s maidservant cast out by Sarah. She is forced to leave a home she has always known. She had a job that paid her dues. She had a man in her life, Abraham who she looked up to as her lord and master. She had all the protection she needed not forgetting the presence of people to comfort her. Trouble continues when after having giving birth to a son, 14 years later, Isaac the promised son is born. She is cast out with her son because they were considered a threat, given little bread and water and left to wander in the wilderness with her teenager. Life is cruel right? someone wrote a book entitled, &#8220;Life is not fair but God is good&#8221;. What life presents to you does not change the goodness of God. His goodness does not depend on what you and I are facing everyday. It may be tough and you may be thrown out like Hagar but He is still good. And some of you single mothers have come from having enough to barely making it. You are in some type of wilderness with no support, with less people to encourage you. You have a child or children to raise and cannot provide for them their needs, time, values like you would want to. You try your best and then there comes those times you throw your hands up and tears run down your cheek. I have a message for you, God knows where you are and where you are going.<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 21:15, &#8220;And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs&#8221;. 16 &#8220;Then she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, &#8220;Let me not see the death of the boy.&#8221; So she sat opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept.&#8221; Paul did everything he could do for the churches he wrote to. He had taught them, prayed for them, preached to them, guided them and after he had done all, he commended them to God. To commend is to commit to the care of another. What do you do when all you have done is all you could do?, commend it to God. God gives you the ability to do your part then He intervenes to do His. Hagar had provided for her son, cared for him, protected him, was there for him. The new situation is so rough that she can&#8217;t stand to see her son in this condition. I know some of you mothers have done the same for your children. It has reached a time you have to release them but it&#8217;s hard. Instead of worrying what might happen to them when they are in school, play ground or any other place, commend them to God. Lay hands on them and pray for them. Praying for them is commending them to God. Commend your tough time to the Lord, Commend your less than enough to the Lord. Remember that God knows where you are and where you are going. Before you even got to the situation, He already provided away out. Commend everything to Him.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 21: 14-19, &#8220;&#8230;Then she departed and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba&#8221; I would like to take a few moments to minister to the single mothers.

You may not feel like rejoicing because of something which is bothering you. You may be very tired or discouraged about something. The environment you are in may not be very pleasing and the people around you may not seem to be concerned or care. At times, you may be feeling lonely and emotionally drained. The thought of going through the week feeling this way may be wearing you down so much you get scared. The devil may be whispering in your ears &#8220;You can&#8217;t make it&#8221;. Your mind may be very clogged with a lot of fearful thoughts and doubts. It may feel like a blocked sewage. You want things to flow, but nothing seems to be flowing the way you would wish. And so, you get frustrated and discouraged. Life doesn&#8217;t seem to be very exciting. So, what do you do?<\/p>\n<p>Have faith in God! Faith in God is the answer for all your questions and needs today and will be, always and forever. If you have faith, you have everything  you need.<\/p>\n<p>First, you need faith to please God. That should be your greatest need and concern. Without faith, it is impossible to please God ( Hebrews 11:6). If your life pleases God, then you have the confidence and assurance that He is with you at all times and that He delights in giving you the desires of your heart ( Psalms 37:4).<\/p>\n<p>Second,  you need faith for living victorious life. The Bible says &#8220;the just shall live by faith ( Romans 1: 17). You don&#8217;t have  life without faith. Faith is the essence of a Christian&#8217;s life. Where there is no faith there is fear. And where there is fear, there are failures and fatality. One sure way to overcome with fear and failure is to have faith in God and self. Only your faith will save you. Your faith alone, will move the mountains that stand before  you. Faith can change your life positively if correctly applied in time.<\/p>\n<p>Third,  you need faith to share with others. You can&#8217;t give what you don&#8217;t have. In Acts chapter 3, Peter and John met a man who was in need of money. They didn&#8217;t have money to give away, but they  had something. They had faith, they said to the man &#8220;silver and gold we don&#8217;t have, but such as we have we give you. In the name of Jesus Christ, rise up and walk&#8221;. Immediately, the man got up and walked. That is what faith in Jesus name can do for others and for yourself if you exercise it. You don&#8217;t have to be special or extraordinary in anyway. You just need to believe that you have faith and use it. Faith is spend able. If we deposit faith daily in our &#8220;Faith Deposit Account&#8221;, we will be able to draw faith every time for overcoming and having every need of ours met. Above all, we will please God by our life style of faith. Let everything you do,  be done by faith. Faith that looks up to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. You have nothing to loose if you live by faith, but you stand to loose everything if you live by fear, the chief enemy of faith.<\/p>\n<p>I urge you today to get hold of God&#8217;s  word and read it and deposit in your spirit and mind. Meditate on the word day and night and your faith will grow. There is no other way of growing your faith but through the word. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. The word of God will not leap into your spirit from the Bible if you don&#8217;t open it and spend time with it in the presence of God. One reason you may be feeling overwhelmed, confused, undecided, depressed, discouraged and defeated in some areas of your life, is lack of knowledge of God&#8217;s word or correct application of it.

And again we are told about it in Matthew 6:33, &#8220;But seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness&#8221;, again, what does this mean? A passage that helped me understand this is found in Romans 14:17, &#8220;For the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost&#8221;. You can automatically see the things ruled out about seeking God&#8217;s kingdom. It&#8217;s not about happiness when it talks about meat and drink. It&#8217;s something far bigger and greater than what the world could ever offer.<\/p>\n<p>You kingdom come is desiring a good thing and that is the presence of the Almighty to come, power, dominion, righteousness, peace of God and joy from the Kingdom. The world cannot make us righteous, God can. 2 Corinthians 5:21, &#8220;For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him&#8221;. The world cannot give joy, God can. He gives unspeakable joy, un describable joy. Nehemiah 8:10, says &#8220;&#8230;for the joy of the LORD is your strength.&#8221;  He gives peace that passes all understanding in all things (good and bad) Philippians 4:7, His grace is sufficient, 2Corinthians 12:9. The increase of our faith flows from the kingdom Luke 17:5. To bear the fruit of the Spirit of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness&#8221;, Galatians 5:22 all from praying your kingdom come. Why is this so important? Because these are the qualities that make us be like Christ. Yes the Lord knows our other needs but the kingdom needs are prime in our lives. These are the things that distinguishes us from the world. The world is ignorant of the righteousness of God, the world has peace and joy when all is working out fine. The world is craving for happiness, we are craving for righteousness. And the other reason I believe we pray &#8220;your kingdom come&#8221; is to prepare us to pray &#8220;your will be done on earth as it is in heaven&#8221; I find it nearly impossible to pray, &#8220;your will be done on earth as it is in heaven&#8221; when I have not prayed &#8220;your kingdom come&#8221;, when I have prayed to walk in the path of righteousness whatever the cost, and I have prayed for joy in the midst of it all, and prayed for Grace to make me comfortable in every situation and God&#8217;s peace that no one can give, and more faith to trust even when I can&#8217;t see, oh how it&#8217;s is beautiful to pray &#8220;YOUR will be done&#8221;.  That the Lord prepares us for what He is to do. That we ask Him to execute it here on earth. His will in heaven could be interpreted as a plan, blue print and that plan is brought here on earth that it may be built. It&#8217;s giving God permission act on His will. Knowing that anything done by God is perfect, nothing can be added to it and nothing can be taken away from. He knows our destiny as He had planned it way before were born.

This is where I cease to live for myself, meaning living a Christian life and knowing I have passed from death to life and that&#8217;s it. I want to live a life that is pleasing to the Lord by dying daily (crucifying the flesh) and be challenged to do things my flesh does not crave at all but are good for my growth. I die to self so as to be alive in Christ. Galatians 2:20, &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. I want to know His will for my life and there are two things that are definitely God&#8217;s will for every believer and that is Prayer (intercession) and Evangelism. Yet these two are the ones easily put aside from my experience.<\/p>\n<p>This is my personal conviction, you cannot grow MUCH in the Lord without Prayers and Evangelism. I believe these two are the wings that stabilizes our Christian walk. Wings provide a balance. They work together, hand in hand. Prayers shows your total dependency on God, Evangelism is your response to His last command. Prayer changes and conforms you into what God wants you to be and so is gospel. If you are praying and not evangelizing, you are a Christian with one wing and so is evangelizing and not praying. One cannot work effectively without the other. I pray that I may evangelize and I evangelize that I may pray. A good analogy to make this point clear, God requires us to push rocks (pray and witness to the unsaved) but He doesn&#8217;t expect us to move the rocks (save them). In the process of us being obedient to push the rocks (pray for them and share with them), He steps in to move the rocks (save them) and the glory goes back to Him for the gospel of Christ is the POWER of God to SALVATION, Romans 1:16. In the Great Commission (as it is frequently labeled; Matt. 28:19), Jesus commanded His disciples to &#8220;Go&#8230; and make disciples.&#8221; The objective was not that they attract their own disciples, but that they win new followers of Jesus. Acts tells the story of how the Spirit-filled apostles obeyed that command. If we were to pray the Father&#8217;s will and if we were to lay our heads on the Father&#8217;s breast so to speak, I believe we would feel His heart for the lost according to Matthew 18:14, which says, &#8220;Even so it is not the WILL of your Father who is in heaven that ONE of these little ones should PERISH&#8221;. We may not be too concerned but He is and the moment we get a glimpse, a taste of what He requires of us, we will make His last call our priority. How can we make a last call our priority unless we have prayed the will of the Father to be our burden. We put legs to our prayers and respond to the call as our own God answered prayer.<\/p>\n<p>John 15: 7, &#8220;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you&#8221; this may appear as a blank check but look again at how the verse begins, &#8220;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you..&#8221; the more we abide, the more we learn and experience what the Lord requires of us. How will He get more glory if we do not go about His business of sharing with the lost?, The bible continues to say, 8 By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples&#8221;. A disciple is a follower of Christ and what did Christ do with His disciples? He made them fishers of men. This is the &#8220;prime product&#8221;, the blessings of other things are the &#8220;by products&#8221; of being obedient. Read the book of Acts and see how they grew much while doing the Lord&#8217;s work, Acts 6:4, &#8221; but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.&#8221; Not that other ministries were less important, these two helped them grow much.<\/p>\n<p>And there are no two things that have caused me to grow much like these two. When you share, you are preaching the gospel to others and yourself. The gospel never gets old and it&#8217;s not just for the unsaved, the gospel is for us everyday till the day the Lord comes. We have not prayed enough and never will but we have to if we want to grow.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>Ev <\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 15: 7 &#8220;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. 8 By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples&#8221; I am a firm believer of being in [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1157","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-iF","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1157","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1157"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1157\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1157"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1157"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1157"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1156,"date":"2008-11-14T06:50:00","date_gmt":"2008-11-14T13:50:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/11\/14\/to-grow-more-in-the-lord\/"},"modified":"2008-11-14T06:50:00","modified_gmt":"2008-11-14T13:50:00","slug":"to-grow-more-in-the-lord","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/11\/14\/to-grow-more-in-the-lord\/","title":{"rendered":"To Grow More In The&nbsp;Lord&#8230;"},"content":{"rendered":"<div class=\"gmail_quote\">Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>John 15:1-8, vs. 2, &#8220;&#8230;and every branch that bears fruit He PRUNES, that it may bear MORE fruit&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I shared on what it takes to bear fruit, today I would like to share on what it takes to bear MORE fruit.<\/p>\n<p>I cannot think of anything that causes more and faster growth like adversities. In the light of things going backwards or getting less or dying or eliminated has potential of causing greater growth in ways we could never imagine or fathom. You would think that in cutting back should create less opportunity for growth until you understand why a plant needs pruning (cutting back).<\/p>\n<p>Jesus defines Himself as the true Vine in vs. 1 and God the Father as the vine dresser (Gardner) and the believers are the branches. Those who abide in Christ, the true vine are inspected by the Father (the vine dresser) and 2 Every branch in Me (Christ) that does not bear fruit He takes away;&#8221;. God the gardener is not looking for branches, He is looking for fruit. You may be trying to please the Lord with your braches and how green they are, how  big and healthy they are. The Lord is not impressed with branches, He is looking for fruit, a sign of growth in your life. There are many who call themselves Christians who have more leaves than fruits and they are excited that they have leaves but again, it&#8217;s not the leaves that the Lord inspects, it&#8217;s the fruit. So the branch on the vine that does not bear fruit, He takes it way.<\/p>\n<p>2, &#8220;&#8230;and every branch that bears fruit He PRUNES, that it may bear MORE fruit&#8221;. Here is where many Christians are, they are excited that they have fruit, little fruit and that&#8217;s it. Why desire more when you have something to cling to? Then here comes the Lord who takes the branch that bears fruit and prunes it. What is pruning? Pruning is the practice of removing diseased, non-productive, or otherwise unwanted portions from a plant. The purpose of pruning is to shape the plant by controlling or directing plant growth, to maintain the health of the plant and increase the yield or quality of fruits. Pruning requires cutting back, cleaning, removing dead leaves for a reason. You may be facing some setbacks right now in your own life and you may be wondering why go through all these when you are bearing fruit as a believer. You may never know if the Lord has set your life for pruning so as to move you from bearing fruit to bearing MORE fruit. Maybe the Lord wants to grow  more faith in you, more patience, more love, more joy, more peace, more grace, more prayer in your life, more reading of His word, more reaching the lost and so cutting back propels you to grow more and more under what you will call adversities. That there have been things hindering you from growing some more therefore, he cuts them back. The key word is MORE.<\/p>\n<p>Cutting back does not mean destruction, it means the branch through the vine has potentials to grow more if pruned. How can we abide on the true vine and remain the same? Now Proper pruning is as much a skill as it is an art, since badly pruned plants can become diseased or grow in undesirable ways but the Lord is the Master in pruning. He knows how best to prune each of us so as to bear more fruit. He knows what kind of pruning and how much of it He has to do to make a difference in our lives. Setbacks are temporary results brought about by pruning, the end result is more growth that brings about more fruit bearing that is desperately needed in your life. David says, Psalm 119:71, &#8220;It is good for me that I have been afflicted (pruned), That I may learn (grow) Your statutes&#8221;. Pruning can either make you or break you, we make the choice. Tough times don&#8217;t last, tough people do.

This has come to us through promises that we may be partakers of divine nature. Why is it that different lives turn out worse than others when we have been given the same ingredients? simple, if you do not follow instructions as to how to utilize the ingredients, you will end up with something else. One can do away with one, two or three ingredients and say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need them&#8221; or put less or more of one thing and with that you loose what the recipe book had in mind to produce.<\/p>\n<p>Here are things we are advised to do in vs. 5, &#8220;But also for this very reason, giving all diligence&#8221; meaning be persistent, stead fast unmovable in the things of God. &#8220;Add to your faith virtue&#8221;, virtue is moral excellence, in other words, in your foundation in Christ, add virtue for people to see what you stand for. I believe people see the faith in you more when virtue is present (the outworking of the internal). &#8220;To virtue knowledge&#8221;, Proverbs 1:7, &#8220;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge&#8221; which is understanding through experience or training. Knowledge can lead to truth if channeled in the right direction. vs. 6, &#8220;To knowledge self-control&#8221;, Self-control is denying yourself things that bring destruction and distraction that you may maintain what you have received. When you have knowledge, it will show you which areas you need to employ self-control. &#8220;To self-control perseverance (patience)&#8221;, tough one but vital. You may love a cheerful giver, I love a faithful enduerer. &#8220;To perseverance (patience) godliness&#8221;, endurance produces godliness in you for it reminds you and I that if God can be patient with sinners like us, how much more should we be with people and situations. Patience is one of the greatest killers of all, but it is an ingredient in this recipe for growth. Just know where it comes in and you will minimize or kill frustrations. vs. 7 &#8220;To godliness brotherly kindness&#8221;, kindness is the quality of being warm hearted and considerate, sympathetic and forgiving. Ephesians 4:32, &#8220;Be kind to one another, tender hearted forgiving each other even as Christ as forgiven you&#8221; (paraphrased). &#8220;To kindness love&#8221;, without kindness, love will not blossom for kindness prepares the heart to love. Kindness is what opens the door to see far beyond someone&#8217;s faults and love them any way. It&#8217;s the crown and the heart beat of this recipe. Looking at this recipe, you can see how it&#8217;s set up systematically and flows. All the ingredients work hand in hand. They fit in well..<\/p>\n<p>Without the a strong foundation where virtue, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, kindness are ingredients in your life, I believe your growth is in jeopardy and something must be done<\/p>\n<p>Peter 1:8, &#8220;For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221;. We have what it takes to be fruitful (grow) without adding what is not on it or taking away one of the ingredients. We shouldn&#8217;t get rid of what we think is hard, there is a reason it&#8217;s there. Who wants to be barren? and who does not want to grow and bear fruit? Do something, ask the Lord help you in every area.

Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a world full of disappointments from people to situations, how often do you wonder if any thing is possible when all you can see is impossibilities?. There has to be a greater power, greater being above everyone and everything that nothing else is a march to Him. God is the Ultimate being we need. In Genesis 1 says &#8220;In the beginning God&#8221;, the life chapter begins with Him and finishes with Him in the book of revelation when it says, &#8220;&#8230;Even so come Lord Jesus&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>To trust God in everything, you have to know His Resume (cv). He does need to explain or try to convince you of what He has done and what He is cable of. Psalm 19:1, The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands (NIV). He does not need to speak to be known as God, He has enough to speak on His behalf. How you see God affects who you are and where you are going. I see in my life that there are times when situation rises up, I first look at the size of the situation and then God, instead of looking to God first then situation. As long as I look at the situation first, it&#8217;s magnitude is enough to discourage me from looking to Him because in my human mind, I don&#8217;t see how God can do it. If I do it the other way round, then God becomes bigger than the situation. That is what Jeremiah did with his situation. He first sized God then sized the situation. He begins by saying &#8220;Ah Lord God! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm&#8221;. God is a Mighty Warrior, Big, Powerful, Excellent, Magnificent, Omniscient, Omnipotent, Awesome, Honorable, Sovereign, Deliverer, Way maker, Auspicious, Alpha and Omega, etc and what I am dealing with cannot come even close to who the Almighty God is. Jeremiah&#8217;s introduction led him to say these words boldly, &#8220;There is NOTHING too hard for You&#8221;. Amen NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Have you looked at the world?, you can&#8217;t point the beginning or the end of it. God made it, does your situation even come close?<\/p>\n<p>If nothing is impossible with God, why do we have impossible things then? Simple, they are impossible as long as God is not in them. Can &#8220;nothing&#8221; be impossible in our lives? I believe so and here is why NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON WHO DOESN&#8217;T HAVE TO DO IT HIM OR HERSELF. Philippians 4:13, &#8220;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me&#8221;. Paul knew nothing was impossible in his life as long as he wasn&#8217;t doing it himself. Things can only be possible in your life when you have the God of impossibilities equipping you to overcome what you called impossible. Ephesians 3:20, &#8220;Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us&#8221;. When you think it&#8217;s impossible, employ the hand of God and the impossible will become possible and watch this, God gives bonus for letting Him be God in your situation, He will do &#8221; exceeding abundantly ABOVE all that we ask or think.<\/p>\n<p>When I started the devotion ministry years back, it was impossible. I was imagining, how in the world will I come up with a word and strength to type everyday. What if I came to work and I did not have a word? Don&#8217;t people need to study books and bible to share? What if I did not have much time to study? I was never good at writing, preparing everyday message or studying God&#8217;s word for even 15 minutes was a struggle. All were impossible things until I understood; &#8220;nothing is impossible for a man who doesn&#8217;t have to do it himself&#8221;. You can see God has been faithful. God has given me messages to share sometimes even on a very short time and little time to study and put it together. I still struggle to study the word of God but God has taken my impossibilities and turned them into possibilities. It&#8217;s like God dictated and I typed, what a way to learn that nothing is impossible. I don&#8217;t know what you have sized that has discouraged you from trusting God, speak like Jeremiah, size God first then the situation, employ God and do all things through Him who strengthens you and remember, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON WHO DOESN&#8217;T HAVE TO DO IT HIM OR HERSELF.<br \/>Blessings Ev<\/span><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Jeremiah 32:17,&#8221;Ah, Lord GOD!

Luke is reporting of what he saw and experienced, there is one little episode that he reports to us when Jesus was crucified. He  was close death. He being crucified in the centre, there were two guilty criminals also crucified with Him. on their death row waiting for their death. One is insulting Jesus while the other is thinking about his fate, where he will spend eternity. If you read the previous verses, you will find that both criminals were insulting Jesus but one came to his senses and began to think about his mortality. Only one life to live and not knowing where that life will lead him. All under the same sentence but One is innocent.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Luke 23:39, &#8220;One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you the Christ? Save yourself and us!&#8221;; We as human beings could be insulting Jesus without even knowing. When you reject the one who has given you life, has led you, has given up everything for you, you are insulting Him. You&#8217;ve heard his Name, you&#8217;ve been witnessed to but still refuse to surrender your life to Him. Just because you have not seen Him perform miracles in your life you think He is a wimp, a crutch for Christians. You even take His holy name and reduce it to a four letter filth word to express disgust simply because He is quiet. You refuse to admit your sins because you don&#8217;t think your sins are that bad compared to someone else. You don&#8217;t see it as exceeding sinful because you keep covering it up with self righteousness. You try to work your way into heaven by what you call &#8220;good works&#8221; making His dying on the cross in vain. What an insult. This is the same kind of attitude the first criminal had. I will not be surprised if he even thought that he was being punished unjustly. Too careless to think about what happens after this life. What is sin, transgression of the law (lying, stealing, lusting, fornication, adultery, coveting, dishonoring, murdering (also includes hating), taking God&#8217;s name in vain, failing to keep Sabbath holy, Him not first in your life, having other things given reverence instead of God.

But this man has done nothing wrong&#8221;. I love this other criminal because he has but a moment, he has thought about his life, all that he ever did, what landed him on the cross. He knows that if he dies, there is something beyond the grave he has to be ready for. He has no one to condemn or blame for being on the cross. All he does is see himself in his true state, a criminal who deserve justice and justice means crucified. He knows he is getting what he deserves, in the middle he sees a man who has no criminal records, doesn&#8217;t even make sense why He is there and not complaining for being there. He is humbled on the cross. If He is not doing it for His sake, He must have been accused wrongfully and someone is going free. Oh I remember, it was a custom to release ONE prisoner during a feast, in this case it was either Jesus the Christ or Barabbas the murderer. They let go the murderer and the innocent Man is condemned to die instead of a murderer. Philippians 2:7,&#8221;but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.  8 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death&#8211; even death on a cross!&#8221;(NIV) All I can imagine is as this thief was on the cross, thinking had it between Jesus and him instead of Barabbas, they would have let him go and crucified Jesus. He now understands that Jesus is also on the cross to take his punishment.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">42Then he said; &#8220;Jesus; remember me when you come into your kingdom.&#8221;; 43 Jesus answered him; &#8220;I tell you the truth; today you will be with me in paradise.&#8221; (NIV). With one life to live, no avenue for escape, condemned to die justly, hanging in the balance of eternity he cries out to Christ to remember him and Jesus promises to be together with him in paradise (eternity), James 4:6, &#8220;But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: &#8220;God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble&#8221;. One was proud and arrogant, God resists such but this other criminal was humble and Christ gave him grace. Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sin and without Grace, there can be no salvation. One made it to heaven while the other made it to hell based on the choices they made. You have one life to live here on earth, think about your eternal salvation, you too are on the cross for what you&#8217;ve done. You are not crucified wrongly, you are crucified for sinning, either you continue to throw insults by your life style or humble yourself and come clean, this is your day of salvation, tomorrow may never be. Saying sinner&#8217;s prayer or doing ritual stuff or going to church or paying tithe does not save you, only God does. And God only saves those who are see themselves lost in dark sin and cry out to Him to save them from their sins. A patient will never desire cure until He sees the sickness in his life killing him.

When his brothers and his father&#8217;s household heard about it, they went down to him there. All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him. 1 Sam 22:1-2<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">David was on the run from King Saul for his very life in the cave of Adullam.  Here is the soon to be king, on the run, in a cave, not exactly the kind of kingdom promised to him.  Caves don&#8217;t lift the spirits much, the environment is not conducive of hope.  It was dark, wet, cold, stale and lonely.  What did David do then, but began to become the greatest psalmist, hymnist, and comforter of broken hearts the world shall ever know.  Why, because in the midst of this lowly time in &#8220;Death Valley&#8221; whereby death was calling out of Saul&#8217;s heart to David&#8217;s, David could learn about something no book could teach him. David was learning about something we all need so desperately and that is brokenness.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">And then perhaps the strangest thing of all took place.  Others had to flee as King Saul&#8217;s madness grew.  First one came, then three, then ten, and eventually hundreds.  From in a cave four hundred men gathered to David, and he became their leader.  Misery loves company.  Man you thought David had problems before, being a fugitive in Saul&#8217;s estimation of him, now he had his problem plus the problems of all the others in the cave with him.  The four hundred men gathered to him were &#8220;All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented&#8221;.  I thought that David was going to be a leader as king in the palace, and have an army and servants at his disposal, but what is this?  The Message Bible says that all the &#8220;losers&#8221; gathered to David.  In NYCC we are trying to reach &#8220;All those in distress, in debt, and discontented&#8221; are we not?  We were all like that at one point.  Why did God allow these kinds of people to gather to David?  Where were the encouragers, those who would lift David&#8217;s spirits?  Let me challenge your perspective.  I believe this was God&#8217;s way of building David into the powerful leader, king, and the man of God he was too become.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">David would be a king (leader).  David obviously would have people to lead, or else he wouldn&#8217;t be called a leader without followers.  Here God is allowing David to go through &#8220;boot camp&#8221; and teach him to lead the lowest of the low, in a palace called a cave.  I hope you are getting this.  One day David would have to lead a different group (Israel&#8217;s army) in a different place (a palace).  Before we can be on the top in leadership God molds us at the bottom of the barrel.  How could David have led armies if he couldn&#8217;t lead &#8220;the losers?&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">It&#8217;s lonely at the top, is a saying with a lot of truth.  When you are the top man, who can you send your complaints, your hurts, frustrations, fears, confusion, etc to?  David could only send them to the One place he knew, to the Lord.

Death was all around.  Even the bones were dried up, which is to say that the marrow inside our bones was deceased.  The marrow gives strength to our bones which make up the skeletal system of our body.  Our body is held up by our bones, our support structure.  What happens when the very life of your support structure is eroded, and dried up?  This is when all looks hopeless, all signs of life have ceases, and it seems as if there is nothing left to do because all resources are exhausted.  Here Ezekiel was staring at an impossible situation.  God asks him a very probing question, when He says, &#8220;Son of man, can these bones live?&#8221;  Ezekiel in his wisdom knew that his knowledge was limited, and therefore replies O Sovereign LORD, you alone know.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">In a practical way God was asking Ezekiel my people Israel are dead (they are the dead bones in your vision) do you think I can bring a dead situation to life?  Do you think I can make a seemingly impossible situation possible?  Can I bring forth life from death, can I bring all these people who decided to stay in &#8220;Death Valley&#8221; and died because of it, out of this valley?  No wonder Ezekiel responded as such, &#8220;O Sovereign LORD, you alone know.&#8221;  What was he saying?  Lord You know Your power.  I know I can&#8217;t do this, and I don&#8217;t see how it can happen, but there is no one on this earth that can answer this question. Imagine that, God asks you a question that you can&#8217;t answer.  God asks many people many questions in His Word.  It would be interesting to search the Scriptures and examine the topic &#8220;questions God has asked ordinary people&#8221;.  But, here God asks Ezekiel the question that no one but God alone could answer.  And perhaps he was seeing if Ezekiel would run to a human answer.  When problems in this world arise, everyone has their human opinion on the subject, &#8220;the lawyer says&#8221;, &#8220;the politician promised&#8221;, &#8220;the psychologist stated&#8221;, &#8220;my mom thinks&#8221;, &#8220;the self help book showed&#8221;, etc.  And we are so quick to find an answer that suits our finite thinking, our limited perspective, our many times clouded minds. But not Ezekiel, he wasn&#8217;t going to tackle this question in his human estimation.  He knew that God had infinite knowledge, unlimited, holy, and eternal perspective, and a mind that could not be clouded but that was far above the clouds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">If you read the rest of the chapter which I suggest you must do to get the full impact and not just a taste, you will see what God does with this &#8220;Death Valley&#8221; Situation.

We say can, God get me out of &#8220;Death Valley&#8221;. Perhaps we say Lord, get my family out.  Have we asked the Lord to get our city out, our nation out!  We limit God so many times to a personal relationship and forget His desire for a corporate relationship.  He sees His church as His Bride.  In Cinderella the prince kissed her to wake her up from her &#8220;Death Valley&#8221; and as Pastor Dave shared, the Lord has kissed the face of His children with His divine favor.

thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Precursor:  David wrote this Psalm when he was an old man and reflecting back upon his life.  After killing Goliath, getting chased by Saul, being King of Israel, committing adultery with Bathsheba, he reflected back upon all that he had been through in his life and penned the most famous Psalm, as a summation of the Lord in his life.  This is written from a shepherd that shepherded sheep and then the nation of Israel.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want- David was well versed in the life of a shepherd for that was his first role as a boy.  He personalizes it by saying my shepherd.  It was God who was leading him. The shepherd always provided all the sheep needed and the Lord was certainly no different.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.  A shepherd brings the sheep to green pastures because that is where the food is and they can lay down there comfortably.  The Lord nourishes our spirit and hearts with his love and truth, which is more valuable then food.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">He leadeth me besides still waters.  Shepherds would always bring the sheep to still waters because if they drink from running, rushing water the sheep could get swept away by the current.  If the sheep fell, their wool would act as a sponge and drown the sheep.  Surely our Shepherd leads us to places that we can spiritually drink of His living water that are still, and healthy.  Jesus said if we drink of the water he gives we shall never thirst again, because the source never runs dry &#8211; praise God!<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">He restores my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name&#8217;s sake.  The shepherd cares for the sheep and helps them when they are sick or overwhelmed.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  The shepherd is there with the sheep through the most horrific times.  God is certainly there because there is a shadow, which can only be cast from the light.  His rod is there to count and discipline the sheep.  God needs to discipline, and he only disciplines those he loves. The staff was to pull the sheep up when they ended up wondering away and the shepherd would find it hanging off a ledge.  He would reach down and pull the helpless sheep up to safety.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  God can set a feast in the presence of our very enemies. The shepherd would anoint the nose of the sheep to keep a certain kind of parasite from burrowing up the nose of the sheep into the brain.  WOW!  We are anointed with God&#8217;s precious holy spirit to keep the enemy from getting into our head with things.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.  All in all because the Shepherd stayed with David his whole life, all that God had to offer: His goodness, and mercy never left David.  He was a man in the palace of the Lord, and would dwell in the house of the Lord (heaven) all the days of his life (eternally).<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Application:  Don&#8217;t focus on Death Valley, but rather the presence of the Lord in Death Valley.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Blessings,<br \/>\n<br \/>Phil the Evangelist<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 23:1 The Lord is my shepherd;

once or twice that taught me a biblical principle. As depicted in this movie, Two days after the launch, the Apollo spacecraft was crippled by an explosion, caused by an electrical fault in an oxygen tank. The explosion damaged the Service Module, resulting in a loss of oxygen and electrical power. A failed mission was aborted before it became successful. Not only did the mission fail, to bring the men back to earth safely was a challenge. At one, the man in charge on the ground was trying to find everything they could use to bring the astronauts to a safe landing. He goes to one man who explains what one of the systems what is was designed to do and how it can&#8217;t do anything else besides what it was designed to do. His reaction, &#8220;let&#8217;s forget everything the machines were designed to do or not do and lets see how we can take what we have, modify it to do what we want it to do (paraphrased) bring the astronauts back home safely&#8221;. And that is what they did and it worked. God has many ways of bringing victory in situations you thought there was nothing around to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">If you know the story of Samson, you will understand that he is a very unique individual. Born at a very specific time in history to fight against the philistines. If you look at Joshua and David, they were men of war, trained and had men with them. Samson was different, not born to be a warrior, had no training of any kind yet he would be used to deliver Israel from the Philistines. After being born, he began to grow and God blessed him. He had seven locks of hair that was not supposed to be cut. It was a sign of strength from above. The uniqueness of Samson was, he did great and mighty things when the Spirit of God moved in his life. That is what the Spirit of God does; He empowers you to do what you have not ability to do. He makes you do the impossible by taking something in the natural and using it to accomplish something in the supernatural.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Anytime the Philistine faced him, the bible says, the Spirit of God would come upon him mightily and use him to destroy the enemy. On one particular day when he was delivered to the Philistine bound, the Spirit of God came upon him. There were so many men against him; he did not have any sophisticated weapons to fight back like Rambo. All that present was, Judges 15:15, &#8220;&#8230;a fresh jawbone of a donkey&#8230;&#8221; To think about it, what can a jawbone do? God did not design it to be a weapon. It might injure one or two people, but how can you face over a thousand men with something like that? This is where the Spirit of God makes a difference. He empowers to the extent that you can take less and do much with it. The strength is not on the weapon but in the ability given to one to accomplish something. Jesus said in Luke 4:18, &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord is upon, because He (God) has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor&#8230;&#8221; Jesus being on earth inform of flesh, there are certain things He was limited to do and God had to empower Him through His Spirit, remember He laid aside His majesty and completely yielded to the power from above through the Holy Spirit. Acts 10:38, &#8220;How God anointed Jesus Christ of Nazareth who went about doing good unto the children of man&#8221;. Just like the captain taking what was designed for other things and improvising it to use to bring victory in one area, so was the jawbone Samson used. God used something that was available a jawbone. Judges 15:15, &#8220;&#8230;reached out his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it&#8221;. It&#8217;s not the jawbone that killed men, it&#8217;s the Spirit of God driven through the jawbone that killed men. Anyone else who might have tried to take the same jawbone to do the same job would have failed.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">I want us to know that God can use anything around to bring victory in your life. It could be something around you that was never designed for what you want to accomplish but God could use it. It may just be a jawbone, not have significance or even look stupid to use. You may be waiting to see sophisticated things before you see yourself becoming victorious. Let this be a reminder to you, It&#8217;s the Spirit of God that empowers not what is around. When Samson was done with the jawbone, he did not keep it because of the work it did. I believe the reason was, he knew God had used it just as a means to destroy the enemy. It could be a temporary thing to use but it would have done a work to remember. Pray that the Spirit of God will empower you to take less and do much with it.

It&#8217;s either God&#8217;s way or no way as simple as that.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">God&#8217;s seasons are not at your beck. If the first stroke of the flint does not bring forth the fire, you must strike again. God will hear prayer, but He may not answer it at the time which we in our minds have appointed; He will reveal Himself to our seeking hearts, but not just when and where we have settled in our own expectations. Hence the need of perseverance and importunity in supplication.  Prayer is not to change God, prayer is to change us.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Daniel set himself to pray and fast for three weeks when he saw a vision that needed interpretation. Here is a man who knew what he needed to do and set himself to do it. He knew it would cost him to get results but he still set himself anyway. Are you always waiting for someone to pray for you or have you learnt like Daniel to set yourself to pray?. Pray without ceasing add fasting to strengthen your prayers and see what God will do. Daniel&#8217;s prayer reached the first day and answered but there was the prince of air blocking and delaying the messenger from bringing the answer to him. There was a delay but Daniel kept on seeking, knocking, asking while the heaven was in motion breaking through the barriers. When the bible says in 1Thessalonians 5:17, &#8220;Pray without ceasing&#8221; does mean, &#8220;pray without stopping&#8221; it indicates, &#8220;pray without giving up&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">In the days of flint and steel and brimstone matches we had to strike and strike again, dozens of times, before we could get a spark to live in the tinder; and we were thankful enough if we succeeded at last. At times we stopped but did not give up. Shall we not be as persevering and hopeful as to heavenly things? We have more certainty of success in this business than we had with our flint and steel, for we have God&#8217;s promises at our back. Never let us despair. God&#8217;s time for mercy will come; yea, it has come, if our time for believing has arrived. Ask in faith nothing wavering; but never cease from petitioning because the King delays to reply. Strike the steel again. Make the sparks fly and have your tinder ready; you will get a light before long. &#8211;C. H. Spurgeon. Daniel the man of God did, we too need to.

Over the last few years my eyes have been opened to see the state of human beings and the methods the church have used to bring them to Christ. Years back I brought many to Christ based on how I was taught and to my horror 99% of them fell away. It&#8217;s alarming to note that 80-90% of those who &#8220;supposedly asked Jesus into their heart&#8221; have fallen away from their faith. Man has adopted a different way of responding to the gospel and with that response, some people have ended up not lasting long serving Christ. It&#8217;s suppose to be coming to Jesus Christ in His terms NOT to be  reduced to coming to Jesus Christ in man&#8217;s terms. &#8220;I will serve You Jesus as long as I can still do what I used to do&#8221;, &#8220;I will serve You as long as I can still control of my life&#8221;. I will allow You to be the Savior but not My Lord.

There can be only one Lord and not two, one driver and not two. The moment the introduction of who the boss is in your life is wrong, you will go no where. You and I can only walk together in agreement when we have defined who is in control. When we received Christ for those who have, we said, &#8220;Lord it is no longer about me but about You&#8221;. Before then we were the drivers of our own lives, when we received Him, we transferred our trust from what we used and gave Him everything and said, &#8220;take over my life&#8221;. We took the back sit and the Lord took the driver&#8217;s sit. If He is the driver and He knows the way, why do you and I want to dictate Him on how He should do His job? HE PAID THE PRICE TO BE THE BOSS, His actions commands our obedience. It&#8217;s sad to see people who had Jesus on the driver seat boot Him out when they went through bumpy roads and rocks&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">On a serious note, I would like to introduce the Man who paid the price to be the boss. In Titus 6:15, the bible calls Him the Lord of lords. He is above every lord living and has ever lived, never forget that. In Ephesians 4:5, He is the one Lord, who is Mighty. When John the Baptist talked about Him, He did not introduce Him as a friend, He said, &#8220;There comes another One who is Mightier than I, whose shoes I&#8217;m not worthy to carry. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire&#8221;. He is Sovereign, He is glorious, He is all we are not. Acts 2:36, &#8220;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ&#8221;. He has dominion over the things in heaven, on earth and beneath the earth, that at the mention of the name Jesus, every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. One day every knee will bow to him either in heaven or in hell. If you thought that He is just the Lord over some things, let this be a reminder to you that He is the Lord over all. Mark 2:28, &#8220;Lord also of the Sabbath&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Romans 14:9, &#8220;For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living&#8221;. If the Christ had died and not come back to life, it would have been a different story, but He died and then rose and now lives again forever and ever. He did this that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. You can see the word &#8220;might&#8221; underlined, this to us shows that He never forced Himself to be the Lord of the living (saved). If He was just our Savior then we would get saved and then die and go to heaven, His Lordship reminds us that getting saved is not the end but a beginning and in this life we need the Lord to go through it. Getting saved means. &#8220;I&#8217;m no longer in charge of my life but He is&#8221; Galatians 2:20, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me&#8221;. It may look like I&#8217;m in control but I&#8217;m not for He is. He is my Lord, I&#8217;m no longer in charge of my life. As long as I was in charge, I was messing things up, now my life is under NEW MANAGEMENT. I don&#8217;t want Him just to be the Savior but also the Lord of my life. David writes in Psalm 31:15, &#8220;My times are in thy hand&#8221;, that sums up the Lordship of Jesus Christ in our lives for it&#8217;s showing that everything I do which involves time are in His hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Stop giving the Lord what is LEFT and start giving Him what is RIGHT, Let Him be the LORD of LOADS.

We each carry our troubles like heavy load. There are many hard turns and some dead ends. However whenever we are stuck, we must know whom look to. With the elections, many are putting their confidence in the next president hoping he will turn things around but for us as believers, are we doing the same?. The scripture verse above is right in the middle of the bible. I would call it the heart bit of every man who understands what life is. When I look at a scripture, I tend to pick out a word or two to understand why the author chose to use those particular word&#8217;s . In this case, the author used the word &#8220;Confidence&#8221; instead of &#8220;Faith&#8221; and my first reaction was, is there any difference? Let&#8217;s start with &#8220;faith&#8221;, faith is trust, belief and confidence. Can we say then that both faith and confidence are the same? The answer is yes but their use has different WEIGHTS. Confidence is derived from the word confide which is to tell confidential matters or imparting secrets. Confidence is also faith that one will act in a right proper and effective way. My favorite definition, confidence stresses faith in one&#8217;s self and one&#8217;s power without any suggestion of conceit or arrogance. God is confident in Himself, His ability can no one match. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">This is my personal conviction, I can have faith in man but I CANNOT confidence in man or in a system. Why is this so important to us then? Confidence in man or systems are shaky as man is weak in the flesh and can stumble over what they have committed themselves to. Putting unrealistic expectations on people is not wise, be it in a ministry, work force, relationship, cause when they don&#8217;t come through, views of them may change. I have seen people attach themselves relationships for ages because at the beginning, they gave out everything about themselves and put their total confidence in that person, when things did not work out, they were left hurt, confused, raged and some went into depression. How many have planned their lives well that if they did A,B,C,D, they will not be in lack anymore, they would have gotten their lives exactly how they wanted to, all would turn out as they desired and then something happens? The world and it&#8217;s systems are shaky. It&#8217;s ok to plan but our confidence should not be in the planning. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">We can vote, but our confidence is not in the outcome or who will lead us. We maybe voting maybe the means by which God raises up a new leader but our confidence is not in the leader. Our confidence is the Lord who could use the leader to turn things around. Psalm 118:8, &#8220;It is better to trust in the Lord than to put your confidence in man&#8221;. People can fail you and so will you fail them, the heart bit of the scripture teaches us that it&#8217;s okay to trust man and have confidence in him but it is better or better off trusting and having confidence in God. I would say the reason is simple, if you can learn to confide in God, if you are failed by people, you will have learnt to handle them. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Distancing yourself from them wouldn&#8217;t be right, but you will learn to forgive and forget. You will have someone to completely trust in who will teach you how to handle a person who either has failed you or can fail you. God never fails and shouldn&#8217;t be looked at the way the other person who failed. He holds the secrets without blowing your cover, knows your weakness yet still accepts you. He wasn&#8217;t attracted to you based on what you presented to Him. In this time, who do you have confidence in?.

Everyone is affected in these tough times. The magnitude maybe small or great but the fact remains life is tough. I&#8217;m sorry to say that as believers at times we have promised the world that if they come to Jesus, all their troubles will disappear and so many have come to Jesus expecting comfort and good life and when everything did not go as they expected, they abandoned their faith. You and I have to address this early in our Christ walk this question, &#8220;Why you serve Christ&#8221;. It&#8217;s been said, &#8220;life is not fair but God is good&#8221;, situations and circumstances will not make Him less of Himself, He is the same forever. So understanding that we will always be faced with situations leads us to address them.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Would our prayers be something like this, &#8220;Father, please get me out of this&#8221;, and if the situation does not change in a day or two, we come back to God and pray, &#8220;Father, when I&#8217;m I getting out of this?&#8221; or should we be praying, &#8220;FATHER, WHAT SHOULD I GET OUT OF THIS?&#8221; David found himself in this kind of dilemma if you read psalms 55. He was going through overwhelming situations. This might have been the times when Saul was after his life and he was constantly running for his life. With the trials, temptations, exhaustion, confusion, frustration, brokenness, spent, troubled and the list continues, the word &#8220;enough is enough&#8221; must have come to his mind and so his faith was replaced by a &#8220;wish&#8221; &#8220;So I said, &#8220;Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest&#8221;. I have wished this many times when everything was out of control.

Doves are symbol of peace, the Spirit of God descended on Jesus as a dove, and who wouldn&#8217;t love doves? the bible says that, &#8220;be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves&#8221;, Mat 10:16. Once again we see a good word about doves. David&#8217;s desire was to fly away from his problems by having the wings of dove for they fly fast. They flap their wings fast to get out of a situation at any given time. But with God, flying away from situations is not His style as in Romans 5, the bible says that tribulation works patience, patience experience and experience hope and hope does not a shame&#8221;. Situations are learning opportunities. I do not want to have the wings of a dove for that will make me escape and miss the opportunity to learn something in the current situation. Psalm 119:71, &#8220;It&#8217;s good for me to have been afflicted that I may learn thy statutes. Alright Lord do not give me the wings of a dove, but  give me some wings.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Isaiah 40:31, &#8220;But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings as the eagles&#8221;. These are the wings we need and that is the wing of eagles. Look at the way the wings are given to us, as we wait on God meaning serving God without complaining about what we are dealing with or facing, our strength will be renewed in tough situations and through the renewing of our strengths, we will be mounted with wings like eagles. Eagles don&#8217;t struggle to fly, they just stretch their wings and the wind carries them around. In rare cases will you see an eagle flap it&#8217;s wings. When it&#8217;s in the air flying, it could be up there for hours and hours while the dove would fly, get some rest and continue it&#8217;s journey. The eagles fly above and so we are expected as Christians to fly above our situations and not run away from them. While flying above, the Spirit will blow us (direct us) in the direction He wants to lead us, just like the wind will move the eagle to different directions. Where will your wind blow me oh Lord? To add to that, being above causes us to see how the Lord is working all things together for our good, if you fly away like a dove, you will miss an opportunity to see God in your situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">David&#8217;s desire to have wings like dove and fly away would not even make his problems go away as they would have caught up with him. What you don&#8217;t deal with in the night will catch up with you in the morning. Flying to the desert? boy it&#8217;s not getting any better but I love how he later mentions something for us to do vs. 22 &#8220;Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous fall. (NIV) &#8220;.

When the foundation is wrong, it may take many wrongs before God steps in and fixes it and yes there can be consequences but God&#8230; Why go down the wrong path even if you know that God is able to transform a life even in a mess? The bible says in 1 Corinthians 10:11, &#8220;Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come&#8221;. God told the Israelites what they would have to go through if they insisted on having a king, they insisted and things happened as He said. They went through a lot under the leadership of Saul before God gave them a good king David. What I&#8217;m I saying, when a foundation of a relationship is defined wrong, it has missed God&#8217;s direct will and you are setting yourself up for a big fall. You can pray all you want just like David but unless you have a garden of Gethsemane experience where you say, &#8220;not my will but yours be done&#8221; and be content in your singleness where God has placed you as His servant and serve Him faithfully as you wait on Him to bless you with a true companion, approved and blessed of Him, God will let you have your way and that is a tragedy.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">David denied himself food so as to pray for restoration, he invested through prayer on who he loved but God took him away. I believe God takes certain relationships away as they are a hindrance to what He wants to do in a person&#8217;s life. He wants us to develop such as strong vertical relationship with Him that in turn it may be reflected on horizontal relationship with a person who too has vertical relationship with Him. How can darkness and light relate? That is what happens when the unsaved and the saved are equally yoked. What the saved believes is wrong may not be wrong to the unsaved. In this kind of relationship, standards are opened to be compromised.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Son&#8217;s tend to learn how to treat their wives and children through their earthly fathers. I have learnt a lot by watching my earthly father treat his wife and his children. With that I mirroring the same to my wife and hopefully my children when they come. God allows us to be in His school of learning investing in each of us qualities that will cushion what is to come. He is building a strong foundation that will stand the test of time. I remember how a relationship I was in had to be terminated cause it was standing in the way of what God wanted to do in my life. The moment I let go though painful, He built  my relationship with Him, established my foundation in prayers, witnessing, teaching, preaching, encouraging etc. I have a stronger foundation today than a few years back. In waiting for His will for 8 years, He blessed me with my wife Judy. I am so grateful he terminated the other relationship, taking away the first that He may establish the second.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">In all, David&#8217;s son dies, everyone is wondering how to break the news to him over the lost relationship. Already he has been fasting and praying, what would happen if he was given news that the one he&#8217;s been praying for is dead?, he might do some harm as the bible puts it. You might be depressed, angry, disconnected, blame God, blame the person who has been disconnected from you. Accuse them of treating you badly or blame them for the failure of that relationship. Read what David did in his situation that is breathtaking, vs. 20, &#8220;So David arose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate&#8221;. He did not go into the house of the Lord to launch a complaint, he went to worship then had food. Here is a man who understood that the chief end of all beings is the glory of God, not the happiness of man. Here is a man who learnt to let go and let Him (God) be. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;I had plans and hopes, I would have loved to see God do something but because He is sovereign, He has good reasons and better plan for my situation&#8221;. I cannot continue to cry and mourn over the relationship I lost, He is in control. Can you see the servants were more concerned about what he lost while David was kissing what He lost goodbye, encouraging Himself as He worships the Lord and trusting God to do something new. Yes he made mistakes before and God forgave him of them, now he is in marriage (covenant) with Bathsheba and God is ready to bless him. Your attitude matters a lot in a case like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;font-family:trebuchet ms;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Vs 24. &#8220;Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. So she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Now the LORD loved him. New foundation that pleases the Lord opened doors for David&#8217;s blessings of a son and the Lord loved Solomon. What a seal of approval on this relationship, God taking away the first to establish the second. What God approves, He will bless. Mess ups turned into something beautiful. Had he not let go, he would have missed a unique opportunity to be blessed. A better man, blessed with a son who becomes, the wisest man that ever lived, built a temple for the Lord, highly favored of God, the richest etc. David concludes Psalm 119:71, &#8220;It is good for me that I have been afflicted, That I may learn Your statutes&#8221;, Had he learnt the statutes from the beginning, he would have not been afflicted, why do you?. Evaluate, is your relationship of God? has He tried to terminate it but you hanged on to it cause you were not willing to let go. Don&#8217;t assassinate the best He wants to bring in your life by being stubborn. If you are already married to unbeliever, that does not qualify for termination, God&#8217;s seal is on that marriage, this is for those who have not crossed over yet. LET GO AND LET HIM BE!!!

When I talk about dead things, I&#8217;m not talking about something we picked dead but something that was once alive but as time went by, it began to loose it&#8217;s life and finally died. What you once hoped for, worked hard to keep alive all of a sudden is pronounced dead. It&#8217;s a hard reality to live by but the truth is, it&#8217;s no longer effective. I see many people waste months and years trying to keep alive what is dead especially &#8220;relationships&#8221;. Hanging on to that woman or that man who was once alive in many ways but not anymore. Too much has been invested in the relationship with very little in return. The more you worked to make it a live, the more it deteriorated. If it&#8217;s of God, that&#8217;s a different story because God could be preparing you for something, what I&#8217;m taking about is what someone looks at and knows for sure it&#8217;s not godly and can never be God&#8217;s will. This message is for the singles. I would like to take a story in the bible and glean some principles off it to make a point.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">David in my text committed adultery with Bathsheba, Uriah&#8217;s wife that resulted into a son. David had a relationship with this son, his own flesh and blood. He cared for his son cause when a judgment was pronounced that his son would not live because of what he did, he goes into prayer and fasting 2Samuel 12:16, &#8220;David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and day all night on the ground&#8221;. This is trying to hold on onto what God wants to terminate. There is a good reason for this son not to be in the picture as he was not born in a marriage therefore he will not be an inheritant. The bible does not even waste time telling us his name. How many waste time praying to God to sustain a relationship He wants to terminate? You are yoked with unbeliever, one who is outside God&#8217;s covenant (married to Christ) in other words not saved and God says, &#8220;he or she has to go&#8221;. The hard things to let go is what you have invested so much in. Scared of loosing this cause you don&#8217;t see yourself getting anything beyond what you already had. It&#8217;s like a son who is hanging on the tree, the father tells him to let go of the branch cause he will catch him but the son is too scared of letting go cause he does not trust that the father has the capability of catching him when he let&#8217;s go. You are not ready to be caught till you are ready to let go. You are not ready to gain until you are ready to loose.  My first point today is, God will not bless what we have made and insist on. He can only bless what He has planned and provided. I will share more.

It&#8217;s a place where respect for each other&#8217;s thoughts and feelings can be instituted. I believe with all my heart that there are certain ministers whose ministries can never be complete without having a companion alongside them in their ministry. Your wife or husband is your greatest and number one ministry. If you cannot be effective in ministering to the one God has joined you to, how will you be effective outside that boundary?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><br \/>\n<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">So why do we have many problems in marriages today? Communication is one of the greatest developing tools in marriage. Terrified of communicating, bad communications, miscommunications, misunderstandings tends to cause problems in relationships. Most of us are afraid of revealing ourselves, showing what is truly inside our hearts and minds. I am terrible at times in communicating certain things I need to. I hate to be misunderstood or say the right thing the wrong way. Many have problem communicating because they operate on the level of assumptions about each other based on previous experiences and conversations. It&#8217;s thinking and feeling that the other person knows everything you are trying to communicate without actually doing it. Deep love responds to deep sharing, being opened and not afraid of being yourself. How we communicate will result to how it will be received. You could be saying something good and true but how communicate it matters a lot. You could be yelling and screaming trying to make a point but that would not help. Nagging and constantly pinpointing and dwelling on someone&#8217;s faults and weakness is not &#8220;building communication&#8221;. We are to build each other with our words and actions. The bible says, &#8220;A married woman&#8217;s is concerned about the affairs of this world, how she can please her husband and the bible instructs husbands to be considerate to their wives, loving them and treating them with respect for this is pleasing to the Lord&#8221; (paraphrased)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><br \/>\n<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Jesus was open in His communication to mankind. He did not withhold anything that His bride needed to know. And when they crucified Him naked, He wasn&#8217;t ashamed because He was demonstrating His love towards His bride. Genesis 2:25, &#8220;And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed&#8221;, I&#8217;m not talking about physical nakedness, I&#8217;m talking about being real, opened to the one you love without feeling ashamed. Knowing that the one you love will accept you for who you are, and love you unconditionally as you learn to communicate freely. Through genuine communication and companionship, the result from continued choices of behavior of both individuals in partnership will experience something more of what God means when He says He is with us. You can be the voice of God sometimes for your husband or wife in giving guidance and direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><br \/>\n<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">The relationship will grow, the love will flourish, and the marriage will reflect something more of the nature and the character of God to the world. It will affect you even at your place of work and how you relate to people why? because there is joy in honest communication and genuine companionship. We are choosing to live more fully through the acceptance of another person who knows us intimately simply because we are both naked and not ashamed.

A lot of life adjusting styles and you have to make changes cause CHANGE IS ALWAYS A CHOICE ACCOMPANIED BY COMMITMENT.

It&#8217;s a school of learning.<\/p>\n<p>What if marriage was not created by God to make us happy but to make us holy, how would you approach it? I believe marriage is designed to help us be like Christ. Marriage is two best friends (a man and a woman) who have decided to be joined together in a holy matrimony by God through His chosen people. The bible says that, Mark 10:9, &#8220;Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.&#8221; This is not just people outside but even people in that marriage covenant. It&#8217;s God&#8217;s seal and honors the commitment. I have been married for 2\u00bd years now and I keep praying for strength to lay my life down for the sake of the one I love&#8221;. That is what marriage is, laying your life for the rest of it for the sake of someone else. Jesus taught us what marriage is like when He the Groom laid down His life for the sake of His friends. He laid aside His majesty, giving up everything for the sake of those He loved but never forced His bride to love and follow Him. A Christian teacher said something that was breath taking, he said &#8220;do you realize that in the bible wives are not commanded to love? Why is that, they are created to love on the other hand, husbands are commanded to love&#8221; Wives are commanded to respect their husbands. As a husband desires respect so does the wife desires to be loved.<\/p>\n<p>Marriage is based on trust, if you don&#8217;t trust your best friend, you have a weak foundation. Excessive conflicts tend to put a marriage in a bad shape. Actually the enemy tends to use this for his advantage. He knows power is multiplied and not added when couples come together through prayers and reading of the word. He knows that if He can bring excessive conflicts, instead of couples joining forces to fight him, they will be fighting each other. Marriage should be a win win deal, if it&#8217;s one sided, that is domination. Unrealistic expectations cripple a marriage. It&#8217;s not about winning an argument cause you could win one but put a relationship in jeopardy. It&#8217;s about taking time to deposit in each other&#8217;s accounts. How can you withdraw what you&#8217;ve not deposited? Many break ups takes place because when two people came into a relationship that led into marriage, they came with their accounts full but as time go by, they withdraw from each other&#8217;s accounts without depositing. When the accounts became empty, what is there in the relationship to live for?<\/p>\n<p>I believe God created marriage to help His people understand His love towards the church and to help one another live a life pleasing unto the Lord as we deposit in each other with a desire to help them be better in the site of the Lord. Laying down you life would be a heavy price to give up, the payoff is personal growth and the opportunity to develop a wonderful and supportive relationship where there is the art of helping each other put God first, working and building together, forgiveness, honesty, gentleness, humility, submission, responsive, loving, affectionate etc. To love is to lay down your life. Blessings Ev, God&#8217;s servant.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>Ev<br \/><\/span>           <\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 15:13, &#8220;Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one&#8217;s life for his friends&#8221;.

It&#8217;s easy to see what we want to see and our eyes can also play trick on us making us miss what we should see or distort it to appear as something different. What is truth? Something we need to see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Stephen was a man of faith, full of the Holy Spirit. The bible says he did great wonders and signs among the people. Very few people embraced what he spoke and did. Most conspired to silence him in anyway even if it meant killing him. To kill him required a cause, a reason. They first thought of disputing him, he stood his ground, Acts 6:8, says, &#8220;And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke&#8221;. Like I said yesterday, here we have another picture of a man fulfilling 1Peter 3:15, which says &#8220;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason for the hope that is in you with meekness and fear&#8221;. Stephen knew who his God was, what had been invested in him and he was not afraid to defend his faith. He had seen what many had not seen and therefore standing out there, he was able to give them a glimpse of what standing for the truth is all about. There are and will be people who will try and challenge your faith in Christ questioning you, what kind of stand will you take? Romans 1:16, &#8220;For I am not a shamed of the gospel of Christ: for it&#8217;s the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes&#8230;&#8221;. They lied on him but he stood firm and defended his faith which later led to his death. Having encountered with Christ, they that saw him saw a transfigured man, Acts 6:15, &#8220;And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel&#8221;. What an awesome opportunity for the people to see him as a man who had encountered with the Lord. He had faith, the Holy Spirit, wisdom, boldness and a shinning face all that come from above. Do people see all these when they encounter with you? Stephen&#8217;s continuous connection gave him a chance to tap from the heavenly sources that in turn may be revealed to the people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">He takes the time to take the people in history from the time of Abraham and covers everything even how the people killed all those who brought the good news. The more the people heard what he had to say, the truth, the more they wanted to tear him apart. Acts 7:55, &#8220;But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, vs. 56, &#8220;Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!&#8221;. I read this the other day and pondered because the verses I have come across talks about Jesus SITTING on the right hand of God. Here Stephen tells us about Jesus STANDING on the right hand of God, could it be that Stephen saw that it pleased the Lord by his stand that the Lord was willing to stand with him in the midst of hostility?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Glory be to God, when you know what you stand for, though you may share with people the truth, many may not see what you see. Stephen was not frustrated because these people were not seeing what he was seeing, he knew it took truth and the power of God to see what He saw. They already saw his face shinning, he gave them a chance to see where he&#8217;s was from strength. Do not be frustrated because people are not seeing what you are seeing, even Elisha had a servant who began to panic because those who were about attack them. Meanwhile Elisha remained calmed for he had seen what his servant had not seen. Instead of him being frustrated with his servant, he prayed to God to open the eyes of his servant to see what he was seeing. I&#8217;m praying to God to work on me on this part for there are times I would like people especially the unsaved to see what I am see and it&#8217;s tough and can be frustrating, my prayer is that God will open their eyes to see what I see, Jesus sitting on the throne ruling forever and ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Acts 7:58, &#8220;And they cast him out of the city and stoned him. vs. 59, &#8220;And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God saying, &#8220;Lord Jesus receive my Spirit&#8221;. With His eyes gazing into heaven while being stoned, he remained calm and called on God. You can be stoned with words, be ridiculed, be put down and these things can be hurting but as Stephen, look to heaven. Acts 7:60, &#8220;Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, &#8220;Lord, do not charge them with this sin&#8221;. And when he had said this, he fell as a sleep&#8221;. Because of what he had seen that people did not see, he couldn&#8217;t blame them for their actions all he prayed was for God to forgive them. Jesus did the same hanging on the cross, those who crucified him did not know what they were doing. If they understood who Jesus was and is, they would have thought twice. Forgive those who stone you with their words, those who talk ill about your faith, those who reject the truth for they haven&#8217;t seen the light. Remember that they may not see what you see but what they see in you they will not deny. Saul (Paul) was present at the stoning of Stephen, actually he was carrying the garments of those who stoned Stephen. It&#8217;s not recorded but I believe that Stephen&#8217;s last moments must have impacted him in away. A man of God not afraid to be stoned to death for the sake of Christ. Where he was going could not be compared to where he had come from and there was no reason to hold anything inside. Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing!.

But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">There is an on going war between Relative and Absolute statements. We get caught up in the middle many times. Let&#8217;s tackle a few questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">First question, &#8220;What do you believe?&#8221;. This question is a little bit broad until you add elements to it to identify what the questioner is targeting with his question. I believe in trucks on the road because I can see them on the road. Is that the response to the question the author is really looking for? I believe that trucks can take away life if it comes into contact with a living being at a certain speed. Can we say that facts can negate beliefs? of course we can. If I was to say that trucks don&#8217;t kill, I would have to be 100% sure as a fact, that would be considered an absolute statement, in this case this statement is not true. We all know that trucks can kill so my belief that it cannot will not affect or change facts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego were in a place where they are faced by two kingdoms. They were to serve and obey one of the kingdoms. In the earlier chapters we are told of these four young, good looking brought to the land  of Babylon to serve. They knew their God all this time but coming to this land, they were faced by knew challenges, they had to rely on God to bring them through and He did. We can tell that these men had a God whom they believed in, the God of truth. Job tells us that He knows his Redeemer lives (Job 19:25), Paul tells in 2Timothy 1:12, &#8220;&#8230;I know whom I have believed&#8221;. All these men believed because they knew who their God was (is).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">If you know what you believe, question, &#8220;Why do you believe what you believe?. This is tough to some people, they have no idea why they believe what they believe. I would say that one of the reason is because it&#8217;s easy to create what you want to believe in and stick with it without proper reason. A Christian should know why he believes partially because the bible says in 1Peter 3:15, &#8220;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you&#8230;&#8221;. I have to know why I believe when asked, I have an answer. Why did these men  believe in God?. We can tell that through the miracles God had done in their lives. God had seen them through all their life and being in that nation, they knew that they had been sent there by God to serve. As the bible says, &#8220;Their footsteps were ordered by God&#8221;. These were men who did not just hear about it, they experienced it causing them to move from the realm of belief to the realm of experience, Psalm 34:8, &#8220;O taste and see that the Lord is good&#8230;&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Another vital question, &#8220;Where do you get your back up from?&#8221;. Anyone who is going to defend what they believe in has to have some type of backup. Talk to many people and discover they believe in some things they can&#8217;t back up, they don&#8217;t have a source of authority to fall back on. If I am going to believe in the word of God to which I am, I will always have His word as my backup. 2Timothy 3:16&amp;17, &#8220;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profited for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works&#8221;. We Christians ought to defend what we believe through the Holy Scriptures for it ties to who we believe in. The scripture is God Himself revealed through the word, John 1:1, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God&#8221;. So it&#8217;s no longer what I have created to believe in but what I have tested and tasted to believe in the word. The word may reveal things I don&#8217;t like about myself but I know that it&#8217;s the truth for I have tested it. I believe in the law of gravity for I have tested it, there are things I haven&#8217;t tested but because I have seen it work in someone&#8217;s life, that is evidence, proof.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Last but not least, &#8220;Would you be willing to die for what you believe?&#8221;. This is tough but is called for. Jesus died for what He believed, He would redeem, mankind. Back in 99 at Columbine high school, a girl died because of her faith. With a gun pointing at her, she was asked if she believed in God, and her answer was YES, that cost her life. Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego, were men ready to die for the sake of truth. THEY WERE MEN STANDING FOR SOMETHING SO AS NOT TO FALL FOR ANYTHING. They had counted the cost why? because they believed, they knew why, had back up and were willing to die for it. They knew that this was the truth and no one could take it away from them. They understood that &#8220;to be absent in the body is to be present with the Lord&#8221;. They were very aware of their outcome unless the Lord miraculously delivered them. They were determined for God to receive glory whether in His deliverance or in their death.

For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">In life everyone is identified or known by either what they present or what come out of their mouths. People become cautious when something not always seen in one person comes out. Most of the time it is the bad coming out of a someone who has the indwelling Spirit of God. If you were to tell somebody about something so and so did out of his nature, if they truly know so and so, the response you might get, &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t sound doesn&#8217;t sound like so and so&#8221;. We are known by our fruits and Christ in us is the hope for good fruit. Paul says this about himself, &#8220;For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find&#8221;, Romans 7:18. In his flesh nothing good dwelt but in his spirit. Who you are outside there speak louder than what you say. People like real Christians who talk the talk and walk the walk but how can we on our own?.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><br \/>\n<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">A good man out of the good treasures of his heart brings forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasures of his heart brings forth that which is evil is shown to us in the passage. If we understand that no one is good except Christ then to bring out the good fruit has to be through Christ. Paul tells us that the will to perform the good is there, the power to is lacking. Many times you can tell who someone is by what comes out of their mouths. Whatever comes out of their mouths is a result of what is stored inside. One cannot give birth to what they are not pregnant with and that is why we always need to be very carefully about what we store inside because sooner or later, it will be manifested outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><br \/>\n<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">As believers we have hidden treasures and as you know, a treasure is something that is very valuable and so to have good treasures that is something. The bible says that, &#8220;for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks&#8221;, mark the word abundance. Christ in us is more than enough, He is a treasure to be treasured, for in us dwells Christ and because of Him, out of the abundance in our hearts He will cause our mouths to speak with wisdom, encourage, inspire, uplift, congratulate without feeling being robbed, not kill with words, not swear or even cuss, not even speak defeat or fear. If you store the good in your heart, for sure the good will come out of you. The moment you begin to speak, for a sec check what is coming out of you constantly and you will know what and who is in you. Remember that we will be known by our fruits and this is a result of the out working of the internal. Ephesians 4:29, &#8220;Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers&#8221;. Proverbs 18:21, &#8220;Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof&#8221;. An ambassador will not speak anything that degrades his country because he is motivated by his country&#8217;s principles and he lives by them and he brings them out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><br \/>\n<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Ev<\/span><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 6:43-45, 45 &#8220;A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart] brings forth evil.

The bible calls<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">on everyone to examine themselves, do a spiritual evaluation to see<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">where they are. At times we may not know our exact state and like David<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">we should pray, Psalms 139:23-24, &#8220;Search me oh God and know my heart;<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">lead me in the way of everlasting&#8221;. By allowing the Lord to search us<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">and try us that we may not loose our edge.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span class=\"apple-style-span\">There are things that are beyond repair, they have to be created. In<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">verse 10 of Psalm 51 starts with &#8220;create in me a clean heart&#8221;. &#8220;The<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked&#8221; Jeremiah<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">17:9 tells us and we cannot expect God to repair it, He has to create it<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">make it out of nothing as a new heart. David had just sinned by<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">committing adultery with Bathsheba and he understood his heart to be<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">deceitful, instead of desiring that his heart be renewed, he cries out<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">for the creation of a new heart. &#8220;create&#8221; is key. The bible says, &#8220;if<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">any man be in Christ, he is a new creation&#8221;  not &#8220;a repaired creation&#8221;.<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">&#8220;Renew&#8221; is the second thing mentioned in the same verse. Once creation<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">of the heart has taken place, it remains empty until filled with the<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">Spirit of God. The spirit of God is not created , He is forever<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">existing, perfect, complete and a live. The only thing I believe happens<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">when we make mistakes, He&#8217;s effectiveness is blocked by sins. For us to<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">function effectively as believers, His dwelling place our hearts has to<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">be renewed.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span class=\"apple-style-span\">&#8220;Restore&#8221; unto me the joy of thy salvation&#8221; is another line shown in<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">this passage. This is a very powerful thing that I want to dwell on this<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">morning. I can break the word &#8220;RESTORE&#8221;  into two words &#8220;RE&#8221; &amp; &#8220;STORE&#8221;.<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">I would define &#8220;RE&#8221; as an action of repeating something that was done<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">before and the word &#8220;STORE&#8221; is keeping something in a safe place away<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">from many things. When we combine the two together we are talking about<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">something that was once stored but because sins, it was lost and has to<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">be restored (kept). When it is restored, it&#8217;s not just a portion of it<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">but a complete thing, meaning the way it was before something happened<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">to it. God is in the business of doing more than we could ever imagine<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">or think but before He can do it, He is restoring His people. He has to<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">bring them back to their first love. David cries out that his joy will<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">be restored and when you look in the bible it says that the &#8220;Joy of the<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">Lord is my strength&#8221; so he understood that if the joy of the Lord could<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">be restored in his life then he would be an over comer gain simply<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">because the ,joy of the Lord gives him strength. David had always been<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">an over comer and when he sinned, guilt and shame took over replacing<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">the joy that was already in him. The Lord wanted to take him to greater<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">levels but that could not happen until what he had before had been<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">brought back. If anything new is done without the restoration, you will<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">never know the difference because the new will try to replace what<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">should have already been there. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size:100%;\">Maybe you have desired more in your life, or move from stage to stage,<\/span><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><span class=\"apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size:100%;\">remember you will not get there until He has restored in you what you<\/span><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><span class=\"apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size:100%;\">lost. Someone has lost faith, joy, peace, strength etc. How can you<\/span><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><span class=\"apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size:100%;\">expect to more without being restored?. Just like someone driving east<\/span><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><span class=\"apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size:100%;\">for miles only to discover he is suppose to be going west. When he<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size:100%;\">realizes he is going the wrong way, he has to restore his way back to<\/span><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><span class=\"apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size:100%;\">where he started going east then go west There are no shortcuts.

God is a Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and Truth&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">I have discovered something about lingering longer in the presence of the Almighty God, I may begin in the flesh but His presence transforms a life. You cannot encounter with God an remain the same. That is why working with Christ calls for dying to self and alive in Him. I decrease that Christ may increase, less of me and more of Him, none of me and whole of Him for it&#8217;s not about me but about Him. I remember a song that says, &#8220;let the Spirit rise and let the flesh be removed&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">The more the woman at well spent time with Christ, the more He revealed things about her people, her life then Himself to her. She is began to know the Lord whom she had never encountered with. I have been in the presence of the Lord at times without knowing that I was there but the more I lingered and got to search, seek, knock and ask, the more Jehovah Shammah which means Jehovah Present revealed Himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Lets finish this series today by looking at how this woman discovered that whoever she was speaking with was none other than the Messiah promised. After the Samaritan woman had said the truth about her being without a husband and Jesus revealing to her what she had always been, her eyes are opened and her response is, vs. 19, &#8220;sir I perceive that You are a prophet&#8221;, Can you imagine standing with someone who knows your history and yet He is still with you despite the fact that you&#8217;ve messed up? He is not intimidated by her scars and old self cause He has the power to change you. I thank God for His grace and mercy, when the law passed that I had failed, grace and mercy stood not to defend my actions but deliver me from them. He can take junk and make it whole for His use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">From talking in the flesh, she begins to talk about spiritual stuff addressed in vs. 20. Worship is the key word today, as for the next five vs. worship is talked about. I am learning the art of worship as a believer. When I received Christ, my first duty was not to preach, teach, be a leader or an encourager, my first responsibility was to be a worshiper, a follower of Christ. This is the first duty for every believer. John 12:32, &#8220;And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me&#8221; says the Lord, Psalm 150:6, &#8220;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord, Psalm 34:1, &#8220;I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in my mouth, Psalm 103:1, &#8220;Bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me worship Him. We have to worship Him as He is looking for a people who will worship Him in Spirit and truth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Vrs25, &#8220;I know the Messiah is coming (who is called Christ), when He comes, He will tell us all things, Vs. 26 and Jesus said to her, &#8220;I who speaks to you am He&#8221;&#8221;. This blows my mind as this what I would call the presence of God made manifested in other words revealed. Like I have said, His presence changes a life and what she did was leave her earthly water bucket and runs into the city to be a witness to the promise. By one woman, the whole of Samaria gets to know the Master. One powerful encounter changes her completely for it&#8217;s no longer her but God inside of her, Galatians 2:20, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, but not I but Christ lives in me; the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by faith through Him who gave His life&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Can I talk to you ladies for a second? I have respect for ladies more than anything else; maybe it&#8217;s because my salvation came as a result of a woman seriously, constantly and earnestly praying for me (my mom). You ladies have some powerful things that make you more favorable with God than any other creatures in the world. Persistence has always been your style example (the woman with the issue of blood), Faith that negates the facts (Shunammite woman), Followers (Ruth), Leadership (Esther), Prayer (Hannah the mother of Samuel). Protector  (Rahab the harlot) and more. Whatever you do, you do it diligently until it yields a result to you. Keep it up, as these are your defenses. Our desire to linger longer in the presence of the Lord, going through different stages (obedience, willingness, truthful, worship, used of God) causes us to be prepared to be used of God. Do you feel ordinary? Meet Him, for when He reveals Himself to you, you will be changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/>Ev <\/span><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 4:23, &#8220;But the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.

She was out to fetch something in the natural that was not satisfying. Jesus on the other hand had something Spiritual that can fulfill and satisfy. Jesus was not out to minister to her physical needs, natural water, He was out to minister to her spiritual needs. This is why we need to be careful about how we present the gospel as some may come to the kingdom  of God based on Jesus meeting their physical needs. We come because He deserves man&#8217;s obedience because of what He has done and we desire the spiritual over the natural.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">When God begins to work on an individual, He reaches to the heart, that is what responds to His spirit. Vs. 13, we see Jesus witnessing to this woman talking to her about spiritual water to which this woman does not understand but remember her obedience causes the Lord to serve her. In the process of her obedience, thirst for something fulfilling begins to well in her heart, yes it was for the natural, Jesus was ultimately bringing her to understand that what He was talking about was the supernatural. Psalms 42:1, says &#8220;As the hart (deer) pants after the water brook so does my soul pant after thee. We should hunger and thirst for righteousness and those we bring to Christ should desire the same. The bible again says that they that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled. We need not to be lukewarm in our living for Christ, every day we should hunger and thirst for His righteousness. This is how we will cultivate more on the fear of the Lord in our lives<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Jesus was ready to give this woman the living water but then dealt with something that would not agree with the living water, SIN which called for repentance. Sin hinders one from getting saved and sin also hinders a believer from living spirit filled life. Question to this woman, &#8220;vs. 16, &#8220;go call your husband, and come here&#8221;, This is what I would call exposing one to truth, the bible says again that you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Jesus was confronting her sin by seeking TRUTH. The Lord requires Truth in our inward parts. From obedience, to thirst (willing) and then the truth. Unless we confess our weaknesses, failures, pride, whatever that sin is without covering it or justifying it, we set ourselves for growth. To my amazement, she confessed part of not having a husband and Jesus then reminded her of other 5 husbands she already had before. We can confess some sins, but the Spirit of God will also remind us of those other sins we have not dealt with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">What&#8217;s my point this morning, we can be willing but willingness requires facing the truth that exposes sin without rejecting it. God will not anoint lies. Search me oh Lord and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts and see if their be any wicked way in me and bring me into the everlasting life, Psalm 139:23&amp;24.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/>Ev<\/span><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 4:1-42, &#8230;

When He is wind, He is moving Wind; when He is waves, He is crushing Waves; when He is fire, He is consuming Fire and when He is water, He is Living Water. He can take any form and be effective in whichever way He plans to move. This is a reason not to limit God in what He can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Jesus had been with His disciples for a while, besides being with the disciples, the Pharisees were constantly on His case attacking and challenging Him. On one occasion He was accused of baptizing more disciples than John when in the actual sense He only baptized His disciples. When He hears about this, He embarks on a journey from Judea to go back to Galilee with His disciples but His journey requires Him to pass through Samaria. Stopping there and being exhausted off long walk, He takes a rest by the well Jacob had dug many years before while His disciples went to the city to buy food. It&#8217;s so amazing to know that God can appear to anyone at any time in an ordinary place. Here comes a woman to draw water, actually the time of drawing water was not yet but she comes by herself. I can imagine that during this time, women were not used to going to the wells alone, they went in groups. What could prompt this woman to go to the well alone? Maybe her life style caused other women to distance themselves from her.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">I truly believe that when the Lord wants to deal with you, at times He needs to meet you alone as there are no distractions when He begins to minister to you. I love when the Lord finds me in a vulnerable state, where I can&#8217;t help myself and I know that I have made mistakes and no one is there when I need them then He comes.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">When she got to the well, she saw a man sitting by it. I would think that she would run away being that she is the only a woman before a man alone she has never met but she does not. It&#8217;s dangerous to be out there by herself but she does not most likely because she had held more men in her life and this Man would be not different from other. She must have been very cunning to talk her way out if need be. That could have been the case but we know Lord knows us better than ourselves, He knows what we are into and what we are vulnerable to. The bible says &#8220;that a man cannot come to the Lord unless His Spirit draws him&#8221;.  No one can manipulate the Lord however good they are at manipulating others. Well the woman appears at an ordinary place, a place she had always come to draw. It doesn&#8217;t appear that there had ever been something unusual about the place and of course  nothing new was expected to happen  on this particular day. I love the way the Lord does surprise us when we least expect Him and when we don&#8217;t know how things will happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Obedience is the key word to this passage. She is asked of water, it&#8217;s not like Jesus had no power to draw water, He wanted to see how she would respond to the natural. Her response causes us to understand that they were self centered people, trained not to serve anyone out of Samaria. She must have been born with this mentality and in her growing up, she always had this in mind. Jesus goes beyond boundaries to minister to people even in the midst of their foolishness. He knows how He can revolutionize a life until he or she becomes a witness to Him everywhere. He knows how to bring down walls and partitions, He will change the surrounding, He will change the atmosphere and the dead will come back to life, the deaf will hear. Hatred, bitterness and resentments will diminish when He deals with them. If the law stops us from knowing and reaching Him, He will come to us. The lost may not know Him but by the time He is done with them they will. Feel like in an ordinary place you come to every day? Do you believe that the Lord could make you whole and different in what you call ordinary? Yes it&#8217;s an ordinary place but His presence makes a difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Can&#8217;t finish today, I will continue in the morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Ev<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 4:1-42, &#8230; &#8220;If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked Him and He would have given you living water.&#8221;&#8230; We serve the God of impossibilities, He is an extraordinary God who changes the natural to supernatural.

The bible says, &#8220;The earth is the Lord&#8217;s and the fullness of it&#8221;. He owns it all including the people He created. I&#8217;m amazed that we can take the Lord&#8217;s doing and call it our own inventions when in reality we are nothing at all. Did I choose to serve the Lord? Or choose to get rid of stuff in my life that were leading me to hell?  No, our desire to serve the Lord comes from Him, why, John 15:16, &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you&#8221;. That is why we don&#8217;t accept Christ, He accepts us. Nothing about dealing with the Lord is our inventions, He plans and orchestrate. I thank God for the desire He has put in me to love and serve Him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">When you think of 911, you think of emergency correct? I would call Psalm 91:1 as 911  verse. It originates from the Author of all creation, the maker of the universe and once again He puts a desire in our hearts to do something when we are in trouble. Who do you call when you are in trouble? I love the way it begins, &#8220;He who dwells in the secret of the Most High&#8221;, Dwelling is living or a permanent residing place. That is where your stuffs are and that is where you have your address. When we travel, we check ourselves in hotels and by morning or after a period of time, we check out to go back to our residing places. They say, &#8220;There is no place like home&#8221;, true. At home there is comfort, protection, familiarity and you know your way around. How cool it is to be able to have a home in the secret place of the Most High. I must admit many times I have checked in the secret place and by morning checked out. Now the secret place is not an open place but a concealed place beyond ordinary understanding. You may not even explain it yourself when things are happening in your life you have no control over while residing there. He gives us joy, unspeakable joy full of His glory, how do you explain that? you have to experience it. Remember it starts, &#8220;Unspeakable&#8221;, can you define it or explain it?. His peace passes all understanding, how do you explain this either?, it passes all human understanding. He builds confidence in you to the extent of trusting the One you can&#8217;t see, over the one you can see. Once again, how do you explain that? These are some of the things we experience in the secret place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">&#8220;&#8230;Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty&#8221;. Abide is to withstand and wait patiently. When you dial 911, they try to calm you down assuring you that all will be alright. God does the same with His children, He brings them to a place of safety, speaking encouragement. The situation might not change immediately but can we withstand the pressure and patiently wait? the waiting happens under the shadow of the Almighty. There is something about shadows, they tend to appear bigger than the actual object. Imagine God present then His shadow, what a presentation of Himself. I remember a song with this line, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to hide right under the blood, where the devil can do me no harm&#8221;. If the devil wants to attack me while under the shadow (blood), He has to go through my Heavenly Father and He will not prevail. Just at the mention of Christ&#8217;s name, the devil trembles. Whatever you are facing and dealing with this morning, He is putting a desire in your heart to dial Psalm 91:1 for there is safety within.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">FYI -1. It&#8217;s been hard of late to share devo everyday especially the days when I am very busy at work, or out of the office or dry. Do keep me in prayers that I may faithfully share with you all as the Lord enables me. 2. Continue to pray for the persecuted Christians in India.

And he said:, &#8220;I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice&#8221;. Amen, out of the belly of the fish cried I to the Lord. Out of the mess I got myself into cried I unto the Lord and He heard me and answered me. God had every right to reject Jonah&#8217;s prayers but His love is an everlasting love and if we call on Him, He will answer us. Being in the belly of the fish reminded him that God was always there with him and that is why he could call and be heard. That was a place of humility where he would say, &#8220;Lord is not about me but about you&#8221;, WHEN YOU CALL ME, I WILL ANSWER; WHERE YOU LEAD ME I WILL FOLLOW; WHERE YOU SEND ME I WILL GO; WHEN YOU NEED ME, I WILL BE AVAILABLE AND WHEN YOU FIND ME, I WILL BE DOING SOMETHING FOR YOU. Read it for yourself and you will see how he was vomited and he takes the assignment with dignity and humility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">So lets find out why Jonah decided to run from the presence of God. Being that Nineveh was a wicked city, God had passed a judgment that the city would be destroyed in 40 days. Jonah&#8217;s mission was to come and preach this message to a people who had mistreated his people. He was to preach judgment to his enemies and expect them to be destroyed but he knew better. He knew that if he preached, they would repent and God would grant them mercy, he didn&#8217;t want God to grant them mercy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">When he was in his own mess that required God&#8217;s judgment, God granted him mercy instead. Mercy rejoices over judgment. The Ninevites needed to hear the truth and be converted and a man who understood God&#8217;s mercy was the man to bring the message. I believe with all my heart that we will never desire and have a passion to preach to the Ninevites (lost souls) until we have understood what we&#8217;ve been saved from, how we deserved the wrath of God because of our sin and yet in the midst of our rebellion, He showed us mercy, saved us and granted us everlasting life..<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Do we have to hit rock bottom to cry out to God? Do we call on Him when things are bearable? do we desire to see the lost come to a place of grace, mercy and pardon just as we did receive it, or would we careless as long as we are saved and going to heaven. HE HAS CALLED ME, I NEED TO ANSWER TO THE CALL.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">What is our calling? We are not called to be preachers, missionaries, pastors, prayer warriors and the like, we are called to be FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST, picking up our cross and following Him daily, dying to self, being crucified with Christ. The calling in our lives is to be obedient to God, to give Him the worship He deserves, to honor Him, to live a holy and righteous life.

And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights&#8221;. I have met people who blame God for what they brought upon themselves. People who did terrible things that landed them even in jail and yet they stood to blame God. &#8220;why did God do this to me or why did God allow this to happen to me?&#8221;. It&#8217;s the choice made by an individual that will cause them to either suffer or be safe. In this case, though Jonah brings all the calamities upon himself and deserves to die, in the midst of his foolishness God was still gracious to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Now you might say how was God gracious to him if He had prepared a great fish to swallow him? Someone else would also say, how was God gracious when he allowed you to go to prison or be down and broken, well let me tell you, something worse than where you were could have happened but His hand of mercy kept you from the worst of worse. It&#8217;s not that they could not happen, He kept them from happening. I am not better than those who have already gone to an early grave, the worst could have happened to me too but he preserved me even in the mess I was in. Jonah could have drowned without repenting and we don&#8217;t know what could have happened to him in eternity. Being that he was in the sea, he could had been torn into pieces by the sea creatures but God preserved his life by allowing a great fish to swallow him that eventually he will bring him to a place of repentance.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Jonah acted what Jesus would do many years after his incident. Even in his foolishness and not knowing what he was doing, he was acting what Jesus would do. Jonah being in the belly of the fish three days and three nights shows what Jesus did when He died on the cross and was buried. He was in the tomb three days and on that third day He rose again and became a victor over death. While we are still on the subject of being swallowed by fish, Jonah was covered by a lot of yucky stuff, he is in a place of no freedom, nothing to eat, dark place, can&#8217;t move and he is not aware of where he is apart from knowing he is swallowed. I think this is the time when people appreciate what they had before they landed in the worst places. I bet a lot of things were going through Jonah&#8217;s mind while in the belly of the fish. He had a chance to repent but he blew it, he almost drowned but God was still there to show him love and mercy. He began to evaluate his life and how he had made it this far by the grace of God. God still loves His people and will always fight for them even when they fail because HIS LOVE IS NOT BASED ON WHAT WE DID BUT WHAT HE&#8217;S SON DID ON THE CROSS. Romans 5:8, &#8220;But God demonstrates His love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us&#8221;. In the midst of Jonah&#8217;s rebellion, God still preserved him.

Many knew that any time something was not happening right, most likely someone had sinned and the only way they could deal with it was to zero out the victim and deal with that sin so as to have peace again. The situation would not change until the issue was dealt with. It&#8217;s even with us today, many of our prayers will not be answered even though they may be genuine until sin is dealt with in our lives. We cannot shout on top of sin, we got to deal with it. 1John 1:8, &#8220;If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us&#8221;, meaning that if we say we have no sin, we are calling Him a liar. Sin for sure will hinder us from getting where the Lord wants us to be. Jonah began to explain how and why he ran from the presence of the Lord after refusing to take the assignment he had been given. The men in the ship were suffering for the sake of someone&#8217;s sin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Chapter 1:12, &#8220;And he said unto them, take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you&#8221;. Surprisingly enough, he has shared with the men in the ship about what he has done, he is in a position to repent and allow God to forgive him but instead, he wants people to drown him. He is not even taking the responsibility of jumping himself, he want others to do it for him. The bible says the Lord is good and gracious, slow to anger, He rescues them that call upon His name. 1John 1:9, &#8220;But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us of all our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness&#8221;. Well we could say that Jonah is tough headed but while we are at it, how many times have I messed up and when I had a chance to repent and be cleansed again I ignored and kept on trying to run away from Him? We have been talking about trying to run away from His presence but let&#8217;s use something in the natural to strengthen it, when I was young, that is about 18 years ago, at sunrise, I could see my shadow just before me or behind me. Many times I tried to run away from my shadow but could never escape from it for it was always with me. When received Christ, His light was shone upon us and we saw Him as He is and we can never escape His presence. You might say that I haven&#8217;t seen the light yet, well His presence is always with you, the light gives the proof that He never leaves us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Chapter 1:13, &#8220;Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land: but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them&#8221;. Instead of the men even encouraging Jonah to repent and be saved, they tried their human effort to bring the ship to the land safely by fighting the waves. Pause for a second, God is in control here and men want to be their own god, lead themselves to safety without His help, trying hard to do what only God can do? I&#8217;m not surprised, we always do the same trying to do it in another way when we know the right way to do it. Trying to escape from the responsibility we got to deal with. So they failed to beat God in His game and Jonah is thrown into the sea. I ask myself a question here, was he willing to die just because of his disobedience? Are we willing to suffer more because we have refused to repent? God could loose His patience with those whom He has shown it all and have refused to repent and put their trust in Christ alone for their eternal salvation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">We know that it&#8217;s not by might nor by power but by His Spirit says the Lord Zech 4:6, it&#8217;s a simple as that, in as much as we might try and fix it ourselves like the men in the ship, it will not work out for we are trying to fix the spiritual stuff through the flesh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">To continue<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Ev <\/span><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Jonah 1-4, &#8220;And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me;

out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Yesterday we looked at the first verse of the first chapter of the book of Jonah. We looked at three important keys Word, Arise and Go. Like I mentioned yesterday, there are times where God will give us a certain assignment to accomplish and if you know about assignments, they are at times short term or long term but the key word to accomplishing the assignment is being faithful till the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Let&#8217;s look at what Jonah did when he received an assignment. Vs. 3, &#8220;But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord&#8230;&#8221; Jonah should have know very well that you can never run a way from the presence of the Lord, God is ever present everywhere. Psalm 139 talks about how God knows us from the beginning to the end, He knows when we sit and when we stand, He is familiar with our ways. David continues to say, &#8220;Lord if I put my bed in heaven, there you are, and if I put my bed in hell, there you are and if I took the wings of the morning and ascended to the uttermost parts of the earth, You will still be there&#8221;. Right now there are many who are trying to run away from God. They know they are being convicted sin and instead of obeying the Lord, they have decided to run away from the presence of the Lord like Jonah. May I remind us this morning that what God has designed for us to do, no one else will come and do it on our behalf. We can run all we want but eventually we will have to answer to that call. John 15:16, &#8220;You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain&#8221; We did not choose Him, He chose us for a reason and for a purpose. You might say, &#8220;well it&#8217;s me who decided to follow Christ, I walked to the altar, I said the sinners prayer and I got saved&#8221;. The truth of the matter is, when you gave your life to Christ, He chose you, put the right words in your heart, convicted you and caused you to see that the things which you always thought were foolish were actually good news. The bible says, &#8220;a man cannot come to the Lord unless the Spirit draws him&#8221; . We can&#8217;t make people saved and declare them saved because they said the sinner&#8217;s prayer. The sinner&#8217;s prayer does not save anyone, it&#8217;s the Holy Spirit that does the conviction, conversion and assurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Jonah boarded a ship to go the opposite direction for he has his own good reasons for not responding to the call. Well everything seams to be going on well as planned by him but God will not let you do the opposite when He has a plan to save and deliver yourself and many. God wasn&#8217;t going to allow Jonah to abandon the assignment and let a whole city go to hell simply because he did not want to do it (he wanted God to pass a judgment). So what did the Lord do, even in the midst of Jonah&#8217;s foolishness, He is still demonstrating His power, number one to get Jonah know who the Boss is and number two to turn the hearts of some men who were worshiping idols. vs. 4&amp;5, &#8220;But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be brake. Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the luggage that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it for them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay and was fast a sleep&#8221;. Our disobedience can make many suffer. We may be comfortable somewhere but someone somewhere will be hurting simply because of what we did or did not do. Remember in the OT, if one man sinned, the whole family suffered. Thank God, even the midst of our foolishness, God remains faithful. Watch something here, the men in the ship prayed to their gods, and their gods could not save them, they tried the human effort of getting rid of some stuff in their ship, but still that did not work out and let&#8217;s look at vs. 6, &#8220;so the shipmaster came to him (Jonah), and said unto him, what do you mean, O sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not&#8221;. Amazing right, we see men who never called on the true God, they meet a man of God for the anointing of God was upon him and I bet that is how they could tell that he worshiped the true God and they said to him, &#8220;call upon thy God&#8221;. Romans 10:13, &#8220;Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, Psalm 18:3, &#8220;I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">I thank God that even in the midst of my foolishness He still shows Himself mighty around me and through me that many may know Him. Jonah may have not known that &#8220;All things are working together for good to them that love God and to them that are called&#8221;. It will cost him dearly for the disobedience but the work will still have to be done and God would be glorified. Remember when David sinned having committed adultery with Bathsheba, even in his failure, God had prepared something good out of it. Yes He suffered the consequences but out of that marriage, Solomon was born to become the wisest and a rich man. God does not want anyone to fall but if we do, He has already prepared something good in the midst of our failure.

We are not told of who Jonah was, his calling, how he grew up. We are also not told of how he aged and died, we are only told of his assignment, his reaction and his action. I believe that there are certain times in life where God will give us an assignment at times for a given period of time for He has desired to do something during a certain time of assignment. Sometimes in 98, I was given an assignment to pray for schools. During that time there was so much going on in schools and God laid a burden in some hearts including mine to seriously pray for schools. What I am saying is when God gives an assignment, He has already set up enough grace, strength and the ability for one to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Chapter 1:1, &#8220;Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that city, great city and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me&#8221;. We are introduced to some neat things in just verse one to which we will break it down as time goes by. The word of the Lord is present meaning alive everyday. It&#8217;s always a now word for the Lord Himself is the Word. We hear Him introduce Himself as the &#8220;I AM&#8221; in the bible. Hebrews 4:12, &#8220;The word of the Lord is living and powerful&#8230;&#8221; we see it again as not a dead word or a word that will live but a word that is already living and this is the word that comes to Jonah. Number one point, the WORD coming, after the word comes, the first instruction in the word is ARISE. I would interpret as coming out of what someone has been in because of the word and making the first move by obeying the voice. Then GO which is to change of locations by allowing a motion to take place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">The three, WORD, ARISE and GO are very familiar to us in the bible for we see the Lord constantly using them when getting ready to do something. He is always in the business of speaking and in His speaking there are clear instructions as to what is to be done. We also have this kind of calling in our lives where the word comes, we arise and we go. The bible says , &#8220;go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature&#8221;. We don&#8217;t hear about &#8220;sit ye&#8221;, it says &#8220;go ye&#8221;. My flesh loves the &#8220;sit ye part&#8221; but that is not the instructions. The words of the Lord are always action (doing) words for He is constantly on the move, He is always doing something and we are part of these things He is doing. Ready to move?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">To be continued&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Thanks<br \/>\n<br \/>Ev <\/span><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Jonah 1-4, &#8220;And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me;

No one wants to be in the same place forever. At times we don&#8217;t see those things being manifested in our lives but hear them being mentioned by someone else. Has anyone ever come to you and told you of something good happening in your life you were not aware of? In the process of learning these things, you wonder how the Lord can show someone else something that He is doing in your life without you really knowing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">2Kings 7 introduces us to Four men, leprous, outcast, no signs of hope that they can be healed, living at the entrance of the gate. Weak, no relationships, no destiny, no dreams to mention a few. What can you do or say when all that was going well all of a sudden get crumbled because of a new development. I believe that before they had leprosy, they had good families, dreams, desires, visions and the like but with the new development, what else to live for? Ever heard some type of experience that shook everything you believed in, stood for and desired to accomplish?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Listen to their reasoning, vs. 3, &#8220;&#8230;and they said to one another, &#8220;Why are we sitting here until we die&#8221;. This is what I call initiating a move. I have been in some situations where I waited for the Lord to say a word and He did not, all He needed for me to do was initiate a move and He would take over. When David faced  Goliath, that was his move and so was Peter when he saw Jesus at a distance and desired to walk on water. These lepers knew their condition and understood that everyone was affected by famine but that would not change what they were about to do. They made a move which did not mean everything was going to be fine but meant changing location, doing something different. If they stayed, they would die anyway, if they moved there was a possibility of either dying in the hands of the enemy after surrendering or being made slaves and get food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Vs. 5, &#8220;And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians (enemy); and when they came to the outskirts of the Syrian camp, to their surprise no one was there. vs. 6, for the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and noise of horses, &#8230; the great army so they said to another, &#8220;Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings &#8230;. to attack us, vs. 7, &#8220;Therefore they rose (Syrians) and fled at twilight&#8221;, This is the core of the message today, THE LORD MAGNIFIED THE SOUND OF THE FEET OF FOUR WEAK, SICK MEN THAT THEY SOUNDED LIKE A MIGHTY ARMY. When something is magnified, it does not change it&#8217;s size or the look of it, it just allows the person looking at it to see it bigger or sound mightier than it&#8217;s usual size. Watch this, the four men&#8217;s condition did not change, but the initiative move allowed God to cause someone else to hear them coming as an army because He had magnified them. What I&#8217;m I saying, there are moves when you make, even when your condition does not change, I believe God will still magnify you in the presence of people. That may not mean you change, it may mean people see the greater one in you. The four men came to the camp and found no one but good stuff. What they did not know that God was involved, He magnified the sound of their feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">I am not a risk taker for sure, but I tend to initiate many things in line with God&#8217;s word and many times He has blessed them. Don&#8217;t wait till you&#8217;ve got everything in place before you move, your blessing could be in the move you make. God has a way of magnifying the sound of the feet of those He has called.

Of all my brothers, only Kefa I trust his driving. When he is driving, I can doze off and relax. I know his driving and that is why I could relax and doze off because number one, he knows what he is doing and he is good at it and number two, he know where we were going. With that knowledge, I have peace in side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">The world craves for peace. You can give love but I don&#8217;t think you can give peace, you can speak it but that is about it. This is one of the greatest tools people need in their life. Many suicides take place because the victims most of the time do not have peace within. Peace in the home, at work, in marriage. What is peace? Peace is to be calm, quiet, still, silence, harmony. In other words, peace is the absence of war. Without peace, chaos, frustrations and confusion erupt and the devil is the enemy against peace. If he can steal away your peace, he knows he would have stripped you of something very important and powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">True peace originates from God. Let&#8217;s look at three types of Peace. PEACE WITH GOD, PEACE IN GOD, and PEACE OF GOD. Romans 5:1, &#8220;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have PEACE WITH GOD through our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221;. This is the kind of peace we have when we receive Christ, in other words the war between us and God is over. We are no longer children under his wrath. When I am not in Christ, I am an enemy of God and the only way to settle it is repentance and faith.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Romans 15:13, &#8220;Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and PEACE IN BELIEVING, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost&#8221;. This is peace in God knowing that I have hope and joy for I have escaped the wrath to come, I&#8217;ve passed from death to life. This is also peace knowing that I am no longer alone cause He lives in me. My peace comes from knowing that one day when this life is over, I will be with Him in heaven and not in hell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">My message is on peace of God, Philippians 4:7, &#8220;&#8230; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your heart and minds through Christ Jesus&#8221;. This is the kind of peace we need everyday to sustain us through everything. I don&#8217;t see how one can truly have the peace of God without first going through &#8220;peace with God&#8221; and &#8220;peace in God&#8221;. Peace of God is what we need when we have overwhelming situations, things getting out of control and out of place. Having the Lord take over as the driver and you sleep through His driving is &#8220;peace of God&#8221;. Your knowledge of who He is and what He is cable of gives you peace inside. Psalm 34:8, &#8220;O, taste and see that the Lord is good, blessed is the man who trusts in Him&#8221;. Peace comes through trusting. This is not even your peace but the peace of God. The funny thing is that you can feel it but can never explain it. You can see all hell breaking loose, instead of crying and throwing things, you smile because you have peace of God. This peace acts like a soothing pill or I could also call it a pain killer but I would say that it does far beyond killing pain, it also treats the pain. Like the bible puts it, it surpasses all understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">How do I get this peace, Philippians 4:6, &#8220;Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make your request be known to God&#8221;, stop worrying and trying to dictate God and believe that He&#8217;s got it covered. Surrender everything to Him through prayers and take the back seat, don&#8217;t forget to thank Him for what He is doing and what He will do, then go to sleep, rest, relax, be calm, Psalms 46:10, &#8220;Be still (be at peace) and know He is God&#8221;. How do I maintain this peace, Isaiah 26:3, &#8220;You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You&#8221;. This is what I call meditation, Paul continues to write in Philippians 4:8, &#8220;whatsoever things are true&#8230;noble&#8230;just&#8230;pure&#8230;lovely&#8230;good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy, meditate on this things&#8221;. You keep the peace by meditating on the things of God. If you have no &#8220;peace with God&#8221; and &#8220;peace in God&#8221; ask yourself, where are you heading to? If you lack &#8220;peace of God&#8221; in what you are going through, ask of Him and when it comes, by all means maintain it. The peace of God will sustain you through everything, the situation may not change immediately but having peace to go through it will bring you joy and not happiness. Peace of God will pull you together but chaos from the devil will tear you into pieces. Without the peace of God, you will be torn into pieces.

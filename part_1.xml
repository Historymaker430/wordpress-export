  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><b>2Timothy 3:10-17, “10 But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, 11 persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image15.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-6247 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image15.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="224" /></a></b></p>
We take a dive in a new series to deal with what it means to be a man of God from Paul’s life because he points us to someone greater than himself, Christ. In <b>1Corinthians 11:1</b>, Paul writes, “<b>Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ” (NIV 1984)</b>. In his final words to his son in the faith Timothy, he reminds him of what he had seen in this warrior of faith and to embrace and continue what he had learned from him.

Today a number of things would be considered in defining a real man. As my friend Pastor Phil shares, many men have taken the Hollywood version/mentality of what men are to be.<!--more-->  Some may mean climbing mount Everest, have more toys, or higher leadership positions, or kill a lion in some tribes in Africa etc. While these are false view of men's definition, roles and responsibilities in the society, we must turn to ALL sufficient Word of God and be instructed accurately by Scripture to KNOW, THINK, PRAY and ACT biblically in addressing this topic on biblical manhood (a state of being a man rather than a child in understanding and acting). Biblical manhood puts the focus on other greater things, spiritual things that affect our human response and behaviors.

Paul in vs. 10 of this chapter highlights things that made him a man, and more so a man of God. Take notice of the chronological order in terms of priority. He says <b>vs. 10, “But you have carefully followed my doctrine..."</b> A man of God must commit himself to being a man of doctrine, his worldview must be instructed by Scripture. Paul reminds Timothy of how he carefully followed his (Paul’s) doctrine (worldview). What is Christian/biblical worldview?, I turn to Chuck Colson to help explain. He says, "<i>Christian/biblical worldview is to practice the Kingship of Jesus by KNOWING and serving Him in every area of our lives, drawing on the resources and making the most of the opportunities in all the various worldview spheres so as to glorify God and enjoy Him forever".</i> While this is true, you cannot become what you don't know, this is why KNOWING is the first on the list.

We minimize doctrine/theology in our times. Majority say we don’t need it, we just want to worship Jesus. True worship must be aligned with sound doctrine (TRUTH) Jesus told the woman at the well in <b>John 4:23-24, "23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. 24 God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth</b>". The zeal (spirit) must be accompanied by TRUTH for true worship to take place otherwise we worship a god in our making. David also tells us why God’s word, doctrine is important, <b>Psalm 138:2, “I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your lovingkindness and Your truth, For You have magnified Your word above all Your name”</b>. God has magnified His word above His name because in knowing His word can we truly know His name, love Him  and truly worship Him.

Sound doctrine is important because what we believe affects who we are and what we do. Behavior is an extension of theology, and there is a direct correlation between what we think and how we act. Theology simply means the study of God. Christian theology is simply an attempt to understand God as He is revealed in the Bible. No theology will ever fully explain God and His ways because God is infinitely and eternally higher than we are. Therefore, any attempt to describe Him will fall short (<b>Romans 11:33-36)</b>. However, God does want us to know Him insofar as we are able, and theology is the art and science of knowing what we can know and understand about God in an organized and understandable manner. Some people try to avoid theology because they believe it is divisive. <b>Properly understood theology unites believers. </b>Proper biblical theology is a good thing; it is the teaching of God's Word the foundation on which we build our lives upon. <b>2Timothy 3:16-17.</b>

The study of theology, then, is nothing more than digging into God's Word to discover what He has revealed about Himself. When we do this, we come to know Him as Creator of all things, Sustainer of all things, and Judge of all things. In this we glorify Him through our love and obedience as imitators of Christ. Notice the progression here: <b>we must get to know Him before we can love Him, and we must love Him before we can desire to obey Him. </b>Paul urges his other son in the faith Titus to embrace and teach sound doctrine , <b>Titus 1:9, “holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict</b>…". <b>Titus 2:1,”But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine:". Titus 2:6-8, "6 Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded, 7 in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, 8 sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you.”, 1Timothy 4:13, "Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."</b>

It is easy to get side-tracked in the Christian life. We have to keep our eyes on the prize being rewarded in heaven by Jesus Christ <b>(2Timothy 4:8</b>). We must strive to avoid both false doctrine and ungodly practices. This can only be accomplished by being grounded in our knowledge of God’s Word as the foundation of our manhood and be firm in our refusal to accept anything that is unbiblical. <b>A man of God who is to lead and protect his wife, children, the body must be biblically sound, embracing the doctrine of Christ as his</b>. To continue, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><b>2Timothy 3:10-17, “10 But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, 11 persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image16.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-6249 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image16.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="166" /></a></b></p>
Paul in writing to Timothy he says, <b>“you have carefully followed my…Manner of life…</b>”. We learn some of the things shaped by his theology. Paul was a diligent praying man right from his conversion in <b>Acts 9:11,</b> his epistles opened with greetings and assurance that he was praying for those he wrote to.

He encouraged believers to pray, <b>1Timothy 2:1-3. </b>Paul also surrounded himself with men who he encouraged (sharpened) and those who encouraged (sharpened) him in this journey, for example Onesiphorus, <b>2Timothy 1:16-17, “16 The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; 17 but when he arrived in Rome, he sought me out very zealously and found me”.</b><!--more-->

Paul’s manner of life was driven by diligence, excellence and hard work, laboring to meet his needs and others. He let go many times what he deserved to have. He says, “<b>Yes, you yourselves know that these hands have provided for my necessities, and for those who were with me”, Acts 20:3. </b>He even says, <b>2Thessalonians 3:10, “…: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat”</b>. His life was agreeable to his doctrine, and ornamental to his profession: and even the secrets of his mind, his views, his aims and ends in all he did, which are signified by his.

Timothy had carefully followed Paul’s manner of life. Paul never deviated from his purpose. If I was to summarize his purpose in a few words, it was to <b>“Preach Christ and Him crucified by the power of the Holy Spirit</b>”. In <b>1Corinthians 2:1-5, </b>he declares his mission<b>, "1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. 2 For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. 3 I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling. 4 And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 5 that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God”</b>. In other words, he communicated what he believed as an ambassador for Christ. He encouraged Timothy to make this his purpose also, he says to him, <b>“1 I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom: 2 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching”, 2Timothy 4:1-2.</b>

The drive for Paul here was not to obtain glory and applause from men, nor to gather wealth and riches for himself; but that God might be glorified in his manner of life and purpose in the salvation of men. That Christ might be magnified both in his life and death; that His Gospel might be spread so that His kingdom be enlarged, and that many souls might be converted and brought to the knowledge of Him; and hence He became all things to all, that he might by all means gain some.

A man’s manner of life and purpose are shaped by the doctrine he has embraced. It shapes how he prays, relate to others (his wife, kids, parents, siblings, neighbors, other believers etc.), his work ethics, those he surrounds himself with, his purpose, his leadership. What is shaping your worldview? How is your life and purpose impacted by your worldview?. To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong> 2Timothy 3:10-17, “10 But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">faith</span>,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> longsuffering, love</span>, perseverance, 11 persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image17.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-6251 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image17.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong>

Under endurance, I group "faith, longsuffering (patience), love, perseverance, persecutions, afflictions" together because they bond or are under the umbrella on this word endurance . What is endurance?- the capacity of something to last or withstand wear and tear, <b>2Timothy 2:3, Matthew 24:13, Jude 1:24</b> (PRESERVATION), <b>Luke 22:31-32</b> (Jesus prayed that Peter's faith would endure through preservation), <b>1Corinthians 13:4-7</b> (love chapter).

When Paul talks to Timothy about his “<b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">faith”</span></b>, he is talking more than belief. He is referring to the evidence of faith, enduring faith. He knows he is justified by faith apart from works, the evidence of that faith is the presence of works. He is echoing James message<b>, “For as the body without the spirit is dead, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">so faith without works is dead also</span></b>”, <b>James 2:26.</b><!--more-->

We have an example of faith evidenced by works to the immediate family, <b>1Timothy 5:8</b>, “<b>But if anyone does not provide for his own, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith</span> and is worse than an unbeliever</b>". The support of relatives and servants is referred to here. We grew up being instructed that children and grandchildren must support their aged parents and Paul lays it out here. Anyone who does not provide for his own family, whether it be a wife and children, or aged parents, has practically denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever, for even unbelievers do these things. If a man is a hard worker but spends what he has labored for his own lusts, that which should maintain their families, he has denied the faith “…<i>and is worse than infidels”.</i>

Faith without love and its works is dead; "<i>for the subject matter of faith is not mere opinion, but the grace and truth of God, to which he that believes gives up his spirit, as he that loves gives up his heart</i>", Mack. “<i>Faith does not set aside natural duties, but strengthens them", Bengel. </i><b>Galatians 6:9-10 </b>extends that faith to believers<b>,” 9 And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. 10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith”. </b>Biblical manhood calls for practical faith.

Paul was not ashamed to highlight his “<b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">longsuffering…persecutions, afflictions</span></b>”. His adversities worked to his advantage and more so in advancing the cause of his purpose. Longsuffering would go hand in hand with patience. To us it is strange but not to Paul, he could glory in tribulation, <b>Romans 5:3-5, “3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us</b>”. His tribulations, longsuffering came about through open enemies and persecutors of the Gospel, and towards them that were within, the brethren, whose infirmities he bore. To the Philippians he writes, “<b>12 But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel, 13 so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my chains are in Christ; 14 and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear”, Philippians 1:12-14. </b>Biblical manhood calls for endurance, a biblical perspective in relations to longsuffering. This is about profiting from trials instead of crumbling under them. <b>James 1:2-4, “2 My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, 3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience 4 But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing</b>.” Loving God under trials is reflected on how you and I respond to those trials. James calls a person tried blessed, <b>James 1:12, “12 Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him”.</b>

Biblical manhood calls for faithfulness in good times when all needs are met and in bad times when longsuffering is present. This underscores the importance of trusting God’s purposes in the midst of suffering, even when we don’t know what those purposes are. In the end, we learn the lesson that we may never know the specific reason for our suffering, but we must trust in our sovereign God. That is the real answer to suffering.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>2Timothy 3:10-17, "10 But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering,love, perseverance, 11 persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me” </b>

<b><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image18.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-6253 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image18.jpg?w=240" alt="image" width="240" height="300" /></a></b>

The motivation to be a man of God and fulfill for all these is LOVE. Love is fueled by PERSEVARANCE, you see them side by side. <b>Romans 5:8, “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us”</b>. <b>Jesus demonstrated His love by dying for us, Paul demonstrated his love by living for Him</b>. <b>2Corinthians 5:14-15,</b> “<b>14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again</b>." This love is not devoid of truth. He was showing Timothy that everything he did, be it preaching, correcting, taking men like him under his wings, confronting men like Peter, it was all motivated by love. That love was to bring unity because it all centered on the foundation of truth. To the Ephesians, he talks about how God has gifted men differently. <!--more--><b>Ephesians 4:11-16, </b><b>“11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, 12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, 15 but, speaking the truth in love may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ 16 from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love”</b>

Paul who also penned the love chapter, <b>1Corinthians 13,</b> which outlines what love is not followed by examples of what love is, all fueled by perseverance, <b>1Corinthians 13:4-7, “4 Love SUFFERS long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 5 does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 6 does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the TRUTH; 7 bears ALL things, believes all things, hopes all things, ENDURES all things”. </b>Paul spoke to Timothy about a life as a soldier, an athlete and a farmer. <b>2Timothy 2:2-6</b>, endurance (perseverance) is what they have in common<b>. Those who endure till the end the Lord delivers them (saves them).</b><b> </b><b>2Timothy 3:17, "... what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me”.</b> Many quit marriages, being fathers, being workers, leaders when it is tough. Biblical manhood’s perseverance is driven by love. Winners don’t quit and quitters don’t win<b>. </b>Paul endured till the end<b>, 2Timothy 4:7-8, “7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 8 Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing”</b>

The more fully we know the doctrine of Christ, as taught by the apostles, the more closely we shall cleave to it. When we know the afflictions of believers only in part, they tempt us to decline the cause for which they suffer. A form of godliness, a profession of Christian faith without a godly life, often is allowed to pass, while open profession of the truth as it is in Jesus, and resolute attention to the duties of godliness, stir up the scorn and enmity of the world. As good men, by the grace of God, grow better when they heed to these words to Timothy, <b>2Timothy 3:14-17, “14 But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, 15 and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 17 THAT THE MAN OF GOD MAY BE COMPLETE, THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED FOR EVERY GOOD WORK". </b>May the Lord complete and thoroughly equip us as men for every good work and help us teach it to others especially our wives and children, Amen.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b></b><b>Acts 12:5-6, </b>“Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church. And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison.”  

Times of adversity have a way of testing our faith.  What do you do when adversity strikes?  Do you run away, pray, complain, and become depressed?  The gospel message that is preached by many at this time is this, “God has a wonderful plan for your life.”  <!--more-->Is this the Gospel that Jesus preached?  I don’t see this in the Scriptures.  Jesus said in <b>John 16:33  "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">In this world you will have trouble</span>. But take heart! I have overcome the world." </b>

Let me give you some background about the verse above.  James (one of the Apostles) was just beheaded.  Herod saw this pleased the Jews so he locked Peter up in prison to do the same thing to Peter that he did to James, take his head off with a sword.  Peter is sitting in prison, basically as far as he is concerned, on death row waiting to die.  He doesn’t stay up all night worrying; he is not even trying to escape.  What would you be doing at this point?  Do you think that you would be doing what Peter was doing, SLEEPING?!?!  This is truly faith in action.  How can Peter sleep during a time that his life is about to be taken?

<b>1.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Peter leaned faith from the Master</span></b>.  When the disciples were in the boat during the storm they were frantic, but Jesus was at rest sleeping.  They woke up Jesus and said ‘Lord, save us! We're going to drown!"  He replied, "<b><i>You of little faith, why are you so afraid</i></b>?" Peter was no doubt experiencing this lesson which, unbeknown to him, he would need to apply while waiting to die in a prison cell. Who has shown you how to respond by faith during trouble?

<b>2.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Peter applied the faith he learned</span></b>.  Peter was sleeping like a parishioner in the back row of a church.  Peter’s faith was resting in Christ, because faith snoozes even in a storm.  Stephen had already been stoned, and James beheaded, yet Peter slept in the cell, as Christ slept in the boat. Paul admonishes us to, “<b>Be anxious for nothing…</b>”  Do you rest during times of trouble, or do you doubt, complain, worry, etc…?

<b>3.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Peter’s faith surpassed understanding</span></b>.  I wonder what the guards that he was chained to were thinking as Peter slept.  I can imagine that Peter fell asleep first and then because Peter was being an inactive prisoner they fell asleep after him.  Perhaps they said to each other, “how can this guy sleep when he is going to be headless tomorrow.”  This is speculation of course.  Peter was a man of prayer, and the church was also praying for him, which caused the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, to guard his heart and mind through Christ Jesus.”

Do you experience this kind of peace amidst your trials?  Do others see the peace of Christ in you during the storms of your life?  Do you share your faith with others so they as they repent and put their faith in Christ they too will know how to rest in the midst of trouble.  The unsaved are currently in the biggest trouble ever, awaiting Hell if they die without the Savior?  What are you doing about it?

Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">James 1:19, "Understand, my beloved brethren. Let every man be quick to hear (a ready listener), slow to speak, slow to take offense and to get angry" (AMP)</span></b>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Words that come out of our mouths are very powerful. They either do good or do damage. I think words can really cut deep and may take long time to heal compared to a natural deep cut.</span>

<!--more-->

I have said some things that I did not mean to and some came out the wrong way I wish I could take them back because they did such a great damage. Isn't it amazing that God created only one mouth and two ears which would indicate we need to listen more than actually speak? If it wasn't for my mouth, I would have gotten myself into less trouble.

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">James encourages believers by saying<b>, "Let every man be quick to hear (ready to listen)" </b>first. Even the judge before he delivers a verdict first listens to the case. Listening lets you process what goes in, then applying wisdom as to how it will come out. Those who are quick to speak lack the wisdom that is required to process what comes out of the mouth. You know of those times things came out of your mouth you wished you took time to process in your mind before speaking them out. One of the barriers to communication in marriages is couples tend to be quick to speak and slow to listen when it should be the other way round. What happens is that our mouths are loaded with words ready to fire. We want our points to come across first and therefore what is being said is not being taken in to be processed and brought out in wisdom. Under pressure we speak words we don't mean and once they are fired, they cannot come back. We can also do this with our kids. There are parents who just want to tell their kids what they must do neglecting the opportunity to listen to what their kids have to say. Some have belittled their kids by what they say to them. The kids should get their definition from home. Mom and dad who are raising them are the ones to affirm them. Listening may not mean you do what they say but giving them a place to air their voices, this would also let you know which areas they are growing in and which areas you need to help them develop. Parents say, "kids don't listen", and now kids are saying, "parents don't listen". Listening is hard but vital.</span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Then James says, "slow to speak", The order of things, "quick to listen" then "slow to speak". This is not talking about speaking slowly but being careful about what you say and how you say it. This requires wisdom for in the process of being hasty to speak, corrupted words may be close.<b>Proverbs 10:19, says, "In the multitude of words sin is not lacking, But he who restrains his lips is wise". </b>There is safety in listening than speaking.</span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">If we become great listeners and slow to speak, I wouldn't be surprised if offenses and being angry would be minimized because of the order of things. Listening shows you value what someone has to say and without listening, we will continue to battle without great solutions. Be quick to listen and slow to speak, you could save yourself a lot of heartache. Blessings Ev</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Phi 4:6, “Be anxious for nothing but by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make your request be known to God”</span></strong>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"> </span><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">It is vital that we pray earnestly, effectively, constantly and by faith. I am talking about beyond our usual prayers, prayers that causes heaven to stop and listen. The prayers that sends hell into chaos. Daniel made these kind of prayers and what did Daniel have that we don’t have at our disposal? If there is one mission the enemy has, it is to stop believers from praying and I think he has succeeded in many levels.

<!--more-->

He is afraid of weak men on bended knees. I have purposed in my heart to make prayers that move heaven and prayers that shake hell, my life depends on it. I have found that the times I prayed these kind of prayers, the more I was able to fight my battles effectively, my faith was elevated to the next level  and  the more I was encouraged for I knew I had brought all my cares upon Him who cares, </span><b>1Peter 5:6&amp;7.</b><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"> </span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Be anxious for nothing in  other words be careful, nervous, moody, worried, concerned, restless, fretful, fearful, frightened <b>for nothing </b>for all these are a hindrance to effective praying. When these things begin to creep in, faith and confidence in Christ is paralyzed. With prayer and supplication, which are the praying stages, we understand the reason we pray is because we know<b> GOD CAN. </b>I used to get frustrated because when I prayed at times to God sometimes it felt like my prayers were not being answered and I became discouraged. I later realized with God’s help that the first thing why I should pray is because <b>God can</b> (able). I should not pray primarily because <b>God will</b>, I should pray because <b>God can</b>. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Whether He does it or not should not be my biggest concern. My concern should be, did I believe that He could do it to bring it to Him?</span></b> This kind of attitude humbles me to trust Him for something I know I’m not qualified to have but because He has qualified me to have it, He will give it to me any way according to His will while I pray. <b>Mark <a href="//0">11:24</a>, "What thingsover you desire when you pray, believe you receive them and you shall have them" . </b>Let the priority of your prayer be that GOD CAN<b>. </b>The leper who came to Jesus in Mathew 8 did not come because Christ was willing to heal him but rather because he believed Christ had the ability to heal. <b>He said, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” 3 Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed”, Matthew 8:2-3. </b>He did not say “if you CAN”, that was settled in his heart.<b> “God can” leads to “God wills”.</b></span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">This is good stuff knowing that instead of worrying, we can come to the Lord in prayer and supplication. I believe that for a prayer to be complete,  praises and thanksgiving must be incorporated. David tells us that he will come into His gates with praises and thanksgiving in his heart. I don't need to wait for a thanksgiving dinner to give a one minute thanks, it is a daily thing. Here thanksgiving could be in two ways, giving thanks for the things He has done and thanking Him in advance for the things not yet done.</span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Prayer is vital for it paves away for God to move in our lives, <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">but we have stop worrying about the outcome</span></b> and pray because Christ has called us to pray <b>2Chro <a href="//2">7:14</a>, "If my people which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and forgive their sins and heal their land"</b>. No way can one survive and make it without prayers. If you are not praying for whatever reason, adjust your attitude, take time to pray effectively, earnestly, constantly and by faith. Pave away for move when you pray because God can, blessings Ev.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Proverbs <a href="//0">10:22</a>, "The blessings of the Lord makes one rich, and He adds no sorrow with it"</span></b>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Blessings are very vital. We see in some cultures where the old bless their children before they pass. Some bless their children in their early stage of life. We also have a loving God who is concerned about us and wants to bless us.<!--more--></span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"><b>Psalm 68:19, "Blessed be the Lord our God who daily loads us with benefits", </b>if you look at the way it has started, you can see that it refers to a blessed God, God of abundance, God of more than enough, God of too much. He is blessed  in turn blesses His people. Only God could be rich to bless His children, not once a year especially during Christmas, he does it every day and every year. He daily loads us with benefits (blessings).</span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Look at how God promised His blessings upon the children of Israel, <b>Deut 28:1-3, "<sup>1</sup> And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: 2 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.</b>Please take time to read Deut 28 and you will see how God had prepared blessing after blessing if the children of Israel hearkened unto His voice.<b> Isaiah <a href="//2">1:19</a>, "If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land", </b>this is another promise of blessings if we do what the Lord requires of us. The Israelites were given guidelines to receiving their blessing. We too have been given guidelines to receiving our blessings. <b>Proverbs 28:20, "A faithful man shall abound with blessings, but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent", Ephe 1:3, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: ".</b> This is all about obedience</span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"><b>Proverbs <a href="//3">10:22</a>, "The blessings of the Lord makes one rich, and He adds no sorrow with it",</b>What a bountiful blessing from the Lord that makes us rich. The riches here more than wealth and material things, if anything it would be at the bottom of the list. God makes us rich in spiritual blessings, physical blessings, emotional blessings, wisdom blessings, blessings in your walk with Him, blessings in your going out and coming in, everything you touch God blesses, your family is blessed, your children are blessed, your husband or wife is blessed, your boyfriend or girlfriend is blessed. You are blessed in your job, you are blessed in the ministry, blessings overtaking you. If you've been whining about what has not been done, can you stop for a second and look back and see the bountiful blessings the Lord has bestowed upon you? His love is a blessing, His touch is a blessing, His words are a blessing and come to think about it, we are more blessed than we think. I don't have to receive Christmas gifts, birthday gifts, or people’s appreciation to feel blessed. The Lord daily loads me with blessings. Mark this word, <b>"<span style="text-decoration:underline;">You are not only blessed when you have received blessings, you are blessed while you are on the verge of waiting for it</span>". God is bringing us from a land of less than enough blessings to a land of just enough (living on miracles) blessings to ultimately bring us to a land of more than enough blessings. "Behold I set before you this day, blessings and curses, choose wisely</b>", says the Lord. Have a day full of bountiful blessings. Ev</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Romans <a href="//0">15:13</a>, "... may the God of hope fill <span style="text-decoration:underline;">you with all joy and peace in believing</span>, …"</span></b>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Feelings are good and can be bad some times. If we based our salvation on feelings then we are in trouble, because there are times you may feel you are not saved or feel God. If we are to feel God to know He is present then we still lack understanding that God is ever present. The one thing many ask in their difficult times "how come I don't feel God in my situation?". This is the whole reason why we can live a defeated life if our whole experience is based on feelings.<!--more--></span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">One evening as recorded in in Mark 39:35 onwards, Jesus tells the disciples to cross with Him to the other side. He had been teaching the multitudes most likely along the lines "faith". The bible says, "<b>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God</b>", faith learnt in class room yet to be mastered in the sea of life. Some of the teachings were not new to them, they listened to the Master teach many times on such subjects. To cross to the other side required a means of boat. And the bible says, in the midst of their sailing Vs.<b> 37, “…that a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was <span style="text-decoration:underline;">already filling</span>. 38 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow</span>”. </b>In their sailing, they faced a situation that challenged and threatened their faith. Everything was okay when they left, Jesus was present with them but when the situation arose, Jesus was nowhere to be found. He was at the bottom of the boat peacefully sleeping. Imagine the boat beginning to fill with water as the bible mentions it, who would have been first to be affected by the water? Jesus definately. While in this tough situation, they tried to steady the boat on their own but failed, they began to get hysterical and everything they had learned in class was out the window. One thing they were lacking was PEACE and because they lacked PEACE, they could not have JOY.</span><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"> </span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">I tie this story to <b>Romans <a href="//1">15:13</a>, "... may the God of hope fill <span style="text-decoration:underline;">you with all joy and peace in BELIEVING</span></b>. Mark that it's not saying “to be filled with joy and peace in FEELING”. There are times feelings will fail you. Through His teachings, Jesus was filling them with hope that it might produce peace and joy in every tough time they would face in life. This might have been a little test to see if they could put into practice what they learnt. The disciples should have been filled with peace and joy in believing that the presence of Jesus on the boat was enough to make them sail through the windstorm. Just knowing that even if He was a sleep, even if they could not feel His presence in the middle of the windstorm, knowing that He was somewhere within the boat was enough to produce peace and joy.</span><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"> </span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">You might say, "how would that happen?", well if Jesus was in this boat that was being rocked by the wind, water filling the boat and He was peaceful, don't you think that should have filled them with peace and joy? If anything, <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">do you think Jesus who is 100% God could have drowned??</span></b>. What about you in your boat sailing in this sea of life, facing windstorm, you are loosing your peace and joy because you might have based everything on feelings , don't you believe that God of hope can fill you with His peace and joy in believing that He is ever present in your boat? That as long as He lives inside of you you cannot drown because He can't drown? <b>1 John 4:4, says, " You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world”. </b>This verse alone gives me peace and joy knowing that He is greater in me than the challenge (storm) before me. I can ride through the storm believing that He is present. If I don't feel Him, that is still ok for I know He did not leave me. I can smile in the midst of the storm because His peace surpasses all understanding and his joy is unspeakable in me full of His glory. I can make it not because everything is in place but because <b>2 Timothy <a href="//2">1:12</a>, “...I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day". My heart, peace, be still, He is in the boat!! Blessings, Ev</b></span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">2Timothy 1:7, "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind"</span></b>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Fear is one of the greatest battles I face every day and I constantly fight it for I know it's not of God. Fear can be scary, horrific, dreading, frightening, alarming and even worrying.<!--more--></span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">Are you battling some fear in your life? Fear of tomorrow, life, rejection, failing, nightmares and many more. Many fear to share what they have learnt, inspiration, encouragement for they feel that it will rob them of what they already have. Fear of thinking that someone will be better than you when you share with them what you have. There is a fear of going to greater levels for there is a feeling of incompetence, fear to marry and who to marry and not feel like a mistake is made, fear of flying for what has happened in the past, fear of getting into ministry for you do not feel qualified. We have all kinds of fears circulating in our lives. Let's look at one man who had so many fears to deal with.</span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"><b>Judges <a href="//0">6:11</a>, "...Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide from the midianites". </b>Gideon is hiding because he is afraid of the enemy, we have our own enemies who inflict fears in our lives but the bible says, <b>Psalm 23:4, "Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me". </b>The enemy is always out to kill, steal and destroy but we have a covering and assurance that no matter what we deal with, we will not fear evil for God is with us.</span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"><b>Judges <a href="//1">6:23</a>, "Then the Lord said to him, "peace be with you; do not fear, you shall not die", </b>Here we see how Gideon has encountered with the Lord and he is afraid for we saw this many times when people encountered with God in the old testament, there would be such a fear of possibly losing a life because of God’s awesome presence. He is assured of life in the midst of his experience.</span><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"> </span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"><b>Judges <a href="//2">6:27</a>, "...But because he feared his father's household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night". </b>As the Lord was directing Gideon and Gideon was beginning to know the Lord he had never knew, he offers a sacrifice to the Lord which was good and the Lord gave him another instruction to tear down the altar of Baal which was the idol Gideon's people worshipped. Because of the fear of his life, he does it but at night and by morning all the idols were destroyed. Battling fear of rejection and possible death. </span><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"> </span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"><b>Judges <a href="//3">6:36</a>, "So Gideon said to God, "If You will save Israel by my hands as You have said", vs. 37, "look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is a dew on the fleece only, and it's dry on all the ground then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said". </b>Once again we see Gideon with another fear and that is the fear of trust. He has encountered with the Lord and so far everything looks good until the Lord tells him that He has chosen him to save Israel. For him to trust and believe, he asks the Lord to perform certain miracles and to my amazement, the Lord is patient with him and does as he has requested. I believe that as the Lord prepares us to be instruments, yes we might have fear but He will be patient enough with us to work with us and reveal to us what He can do that our total trust may strangle the fear inside of us.</span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"><b>Judges 7:2, "And the Lord said to Gideon, "The people who are with you are too many..., vs. 3. "Now therefore proclaim in the hearing of the people saying, "whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn and depart at once from a Mount Gilead". And 22,000 of the people returned". </b>The Lord has a sense of humor for He is telling Gideon that the people he has are too many to fight the battle. God is more concerned about His glory. He tells him to release all the people who are fearful and afraid. Remember the leader is fearful and afraid and should be the first one to leave but he is not for the Lord is already dealing with his fear as time goes by. Through this, the Lord is building him up not to put his confidence and trust in man.</span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"><b>Judges 7:9, "It happened on the same night that the Lord said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into you hand, vs. 10, "<span style="text-decoration:underline;">But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp..</span>." vs. 11, "And you will hear what they say; and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp".</b> I thought the Lord finished dealing with his fears. Gideon is still afraid but he is sticking with God, He is fighting scared and he keeps on moving, one last thing before his strike helps him see that what is fearful about is actually nothing for the fear o the Lord is already in the camp of the enemey. The Lord sends him to the camp and if you read the portion of the scripture you will find that in as much as Gideon was fearful of the enemy, the enemy was more fearful of him and his people. It is very possible that what we are really fearful about is actually afraid of God in us, meaning it can be conquered.</span>

<span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"> </span><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">We have a chance to fight scared, someone said that, </span><b>"Courage is not the absence of fear, it's the force that concurs it". I want to overcome fear for God has not given me a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind</b><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;">. I don't want to leave and go back like the 22,000 who left, I want to move forward even if I am fighting scared so help me Lord, what about you?. Blessings Ev</span>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jude 1:3, “Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deceivers1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5938" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deceivers1.jpg" alt="deceivers" width="259" height="194" /></a></strong>

I conclude with Jude’s opening word right after his introduction and greeting, for it is the key to battling toxic gospel.

Jude had purposed to write about our common salvation; but he found it needful to exhort his readers to stand fast, guard, and contend (struggle, fight, defend) for THE faith once given to the saints. For already faith was being corrupted by the denial of the rights of Christ as Lord and Master; and thus, by giving the reins to self-will some abused grace. These are the two elements of the evil Satan introduced, <strong>1. The rejection of the authority of Christ (not His name):</strong> and <strong>2.</strong> <strong>The abuse of grace, in order to indulge their own lusts.</strong>
<!--more-->

In the light of the toxic gospel, we are called to defend the faith with all the strength we can muster, both by <strong>true doctrine</strong> and <strong>good example of life. 1Corinthians 15:58, “Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord”</strong>

We need the spiritual wisdom to discern, the Bible says in <strong>Ephesians 1:17-20, “17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power 20 which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places”</strong>

While we have many false teachers, we take comfort that God as in the days of Elijah has preserved a people who are faithful to preach the whole counsel of God (Doctrine and lifestyle). <b>1</b><strong>Thessalonians 5:12-22, vs. "12 And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, 13 and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.”</strong> There are true ministers of God out here laboring faithfully in doctrine and lifestyle, let us esteem them, bless them, support them, pray for them to continue doing God’s work... <strong>1Thess 5: vs.” 14</strong> <strong>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all”</strong>, like someone who is asleep, turn on the light gently; speaking the truth in love is what they need but with a lot of patience, comforting and helping them turn from error and heresies <strong>vs. 15</strong> “<strong>See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all”</strong>. For those who pervert the gospel, we are not out to hate them but we are to be concerned for them and for those who follow them. May we pray for Holy Ghost conviction to bring them to repentance while there is still time <strong>vs</strong>. <strong>16 -18, "16 Rejoice always, 17 pray without ceasing, 18 in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you”</strong>. It’s all about contentment in Christ that we rejoice, pray and give thanks. Our sufficiency is in Christ, <strong>vs. 19“Do not quench the Spirit”</strong>. We must be careful not to quench the Holy Spirit, by indulging carnal lusts and affections, minding only earthly things. Believers often hinder their growth in grace by not giving themselves up to the spiritual affections raised in their hearts by the Holy Spirit”, vs<strong>.</strong> <strong>20 “Do not despise prophecies”</strong>. Do not neglect the true preaching of the word, interpreting and applying the Scriptures in your life correctly, vs. <strong>21 “Test all things; hold fast what is good”</strong>. We must search the Scriptures like the Bereans proving all things only to hold fast that which is good <strong>vs</strong>. <strong>22 “Abstain from every form of evil” </strong>We should abstain from sin, and whatever looks like sin, leads to it, and borders upon it.

Brothers and sisters, <b>“...contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints” Jude 1:24-25, “24 Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, And to present you faultless Before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, 25 To God our Savior, Who alone is wise, Be glory and majesty, Dominion and power, Both now and forever. Amen”</b>. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Peter 2:3, “By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words;…" </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deceivers.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5936" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deceivers.jpg?w=300" alt="deceivers" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

The more I study <b>2Peter 2,</b> the more I find alot to share. <b>2Peter 2</b> and <b>Jude</b> portrays what is happening today especially with those associated with Word Faith movement, it’s like Peter and Jude just wrote these chapters yesterday. Now not all fit in what they talk about, majority do perfectly. And while not all televangelist fit in this, many are.

<!--more-->

Up to this point, we have only tackled two verses. As we get to verse 3, Peter is observed as describing that the underlying motive of a false teacher/prophet is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>not love for the truth, but love for money</strong>. </span>He says to us that by greed “...<strong>they will exploit you with deceptive words...”</strong> because people are desperate. Desperate people do desperate things even if its lies leads to destruction. Their words are deceptive, appealing, and very spiritual. They concur with words as Peter reminds us. They're not interested in virtue, holiness, righteousness, obedience, and godliness. One prominent word faith preacher in an interview had the boldness to say that Jesus is the PRODUCT, the product used to exploit people.

The first three verses Peter gives us an overview, then takes time in the remainder of the chapter to paint a picture of who a false teacher/prophet looks like and their judgment. I will highlight a few verses and leave their end result to God; but for us, we need to identify them and distance ourselves. Peter writing to us by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is calling true believers to wake up. Paul records in <strong>Romans 13:12, “The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light</strong>”. Now line by line, let Peter unmask them to us that we identify them.

<strong>vs. 10, “…They are presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries”.</strong> They are arrogant; they don’t want accountability; they find it hard to be transparent; they brag about what they have; they brag about the size of their followers; they twist the scriptures to suit their practices; they have the right mission statement, they don’t follow through. Some have had moral (sexually, financially) failures but were quickly restored to the pulpits; some have been divorced but moved on as though nothing ever happened and even found ways to blame the devil for attacks. They want to live like kings, travel like royalties, accumulate expensive stuff, dress and operate like CEO’s; parade themselves as God’s anointed; operate like the untouchables; they even talk about others as the false teachers and are quick to defend themselves not as false teachers/prophets etc

<strong>vs. 13, “…They are spots and blemishes, carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you</strong>”, they show themselves to be teachers of truth while sitting with Christians covering up their corruptions with religious talks.

<strong>vs. 14, “…They have a heart trained in covetous practices,”</strong> they are mentors and have their mentors trained in coveting practices without feeling any sense of shame. They take from the widows, the sick and desperate people and justify their actions. When one starts something, sooner or later you see a trend of others doing the same.

<strong>Vs. 15, “They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;…”</strong> sad, many of these false teachers/prophet started so well, with good intentions, obedient to God and His call but as years have gone by, they have strayed from the truth. Peter gives us a classic example of Balaam who was not a PROPHET but a PROFIT. He was a compromising prophet who sold himself to whomever paid him well. He preferred wealth and popularity over faithfulness and obedience to God (<b>Numbers 22-24)</b>

<strong>Vs. 17, “ These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest, …”, </strong>they promise to quench your thirst and hunger through conferences, crusades, meetings etc and people travel hundreds of miles if not thousands to attend, and they get excited for the time but find what they had dried up when they got home and need another conference. The signs of the clouds would seem to promise rain but nothing happens, so is with a false teacher/prophet who makes all the promises when you support their ministry only to be in the same condition year in year out. Even the woman with the issue of blood year in year out went to worthless physicians who kept promising her healing.

<strong>vs. 18, “For when they speak great swelling words of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who have actually escaped from those who live in error”, </strong>they are very eloquent, sound very deep leaving you with wow factor. They appear to have been given this divine revelation that no one else has ever seen or heard. But it’s all words of emptiness as Peter tells us, they don’t hold water.

<strong>Vs. 19, “While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage</strong>”, they promise escape from the struggle of life, they write books even giving steps to victory, healing and prosperity. They spend time promoting their products (music, dvds, oils, prayer clothes, vitamins, programs to stay healthy etc) with promise that those things will help in life while they themselves are enslaved by the corruption people want to escape from. They say,<i> “if you do this, you can get that</i>” so blessings is working formulas right. When one way of getting things fails, a new one is invented and the cycle of promises continues.

<strong>Toxic gospel reduces God to a formula that must be done right as instructed if God is to bless</strong>. What happened to the blessings of <b>Psalm 1</b>? <em>“Paul renounced the pursuit of money as the goal of ministry and so received fewer physical pleasures. And he renounced the pursuit of morality as the way to be justified and so he received more physical persecution. Peddlers are driven by greed for money and fear of pain. But let us preach Christ as the all-satisfying treasure and God-satisfying obedience” </em>John Pipper, to finish I hope, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Peter 2:2, “And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5934" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blog.jpg?w=300" alt="blog" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

<strong>“…because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed”. </strong>The world mocks and scoffs at the gospel of Jesus Christ because of nominal Christians who do not follow the Lord they claim and have been unmasked as hypocritical people.

“<em>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the people love to have it so. The spreading of error will bring up an evil report on the way of truth; that is, the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life. The Christian religion is from the God of truth as the author, leads to true happiness in the enjoyment of the true God as the end, and works truth in the inward part as the means of acceptably serving God</em> “ Matthew Henry. <!--more-->The way of truth is also blasphemed when false prophesies are made in the name of Lord and do not come to pass and no one is raising questions so that those who prophesied are held accountable for their prophesies. God’s great name is dragged on the mud, blasphemed all day long. God has a concern for His great name. Should not prophesies if any be in line with His word and not contradict it? Are we so fascinated with extra biblical manifestation that we violate God’s written word and don’t challenge those who contradict it? If anything, prophets of today should be PROCLAIMING God’s word and not FORTH TELLING. We are to be the Ezekiel’s in the valley of dry bones proclaiming the word of God <b>Ezekiel 37 </b>to the dry bones until life is restored in the valley. If the Gospel we preach cannot be preached at all times in every place, it’s no gospel at all and has no power.

The tragedy of a false teacher/preacher is that they are not clear on the gospel or how they teach it. They may say “Jesus is the only way” but the rest of the message sounds like “inclusive gospel”, a gospel that is non-offensive so as to avoid losing followers or being controversial. Jesus never got excited about the crowds, He knew exactly the kind of gospel they wanted but He would not give it to them, He refused to change the message. He is unchanging God, His message is unchanging in a changing world. True gospel preaching starts with the nature of God and then reveals the nature of man and the commitment to Christ. Jesus said, <strong>Matthew 16:24 “…, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me”.  Matthew</strong> <strong>10:37-39, "37 He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. 38 And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. 39 He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it”.</strong>

Paul was not ashamed of the true Gospel even when he was being persecuted because he knew in the gospel lied the power of God to save souls<strong>, Romans 1:16-17, “16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. 17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, “The just shall live by faith.”, </strong>Popular or not, Paul said, <strong>Acts 20:27, “For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God”.</strong>

Toxic gospel gives people want they want which perishes, rather than what they need which is eternal. It is many times half gospel which is no gospel at all. Therefore they preach another gospel that gives many people assurance of hope when they don’t have the truth that saves which is Christ. <strong>2Corinthians 4:1-6, "1 Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart. 2 But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. 3 But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, 4 whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them. 5 For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus’ sake. 6 For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."</strong>

This is why it’s important we know those who pour into our hearts. Do they preach the same gospel Paul, Peter, Christ preached or they preaching another gospel? Do what they preach in public the same as what they preach in private or do they change the message to appeal to men in certain arenas? Is the gospel they preach man centered or Christ centered? Do they have biblical qualification to be a bishop, a minister, a preacher? <strong>Titus 1:7-9, ”7 For a bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, 8 but hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled, 9 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict.</span>" </strong>God’s work must be done God’s way if we are to see God move. The fair question to ask, are we hindering God’s move because we are enabling those who preach another gospel?, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Peter 2:2, “And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image9-e1423400626245.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5927" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image9-e1423400626245.jpg" alt="image" width="236" height="143" /></a></strong>In asking why many follow the destructive ways of false teachers/prophets we addressed one aspect, 1). <strong>Biblical and theological illiteracy, </strong>lets look at another aspect.

2). <strong>Elevation of experience above the truth in the bible</strong>.

<!--more-->

Jesus said in <strong>Matthew 24:24, “For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect”. </strong>Just because someone shows signs and wonders or appears to show them does not necessarily mean they are true teachers/prophets. When Aaron cast down Moses’ rod and it turned into a serpent, pharaoh’s men, magicians did the same. Jesus warned that we should not be excited about signs and wonders above other crucial matters because people can easily be deceived. Even when 70 disciples came back from a mission in <b>Luke 10</b> and were excited of the outcome of their mission because even demons were subject to them, what did Jesus say?, <strong>Luke 10:20, “Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven</strong>.”

In our time, it’s easy and we see people elevate experience (feelings) above the word of God, I see this mostly in the word faith movement, to quote Justin Peters, “<em>One of the fundamental problems of the word faith movement, faith preachers and those who follow this movement is they interpret the bible by what they experience, rather than interpreting their experience by the bible which is how it should be”</em>. For this reason you hear the words, “<i>thus says the Lord”, “I’m speaking prophetic words</i>” all in the name of the Holy Spirit even if it contradicts the word of God. The mystic feeling, people fascinated with the spirit world and feeling that testing the spirits is rarely exercised.

What is the work of the Holy Spirit? To get people excited, slain, healed etc?, let’s find out what the bible has to say, <strong>John 16:13-14, "13 However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. 14 He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.”</strong>

Some five crucial areas we see the work of the Holy Spirit:-

1). When He comes, He will guide us in ALL TRUTH of God’s word - In other words, He will not speak to us something else other than the word of God. He will open our eyes and understanding to know God’s word. The Holy Spirit was not bringing any NEW teaching but to declare the revealed.

2). He will not speak on His own authority - but whatever He hears He speaks, “<em>Where the Holy Ghost is actually in control, Jesus is proclaimed the Head - the Holy Ghost, His executive</em>.”, David Wilkerson.

3). He will tell us of things to come as instructed - Yes He is God who co eternally exist with the Father and the Son in the same rank, yet He has His position.

4). He will glorify Christ - He will take what is Christ’s and declare it to us. <em>“There seems to be a great danger of losing sight of the fact that Jesus was ‘all in all.’ The work of Calvary, the atonement, must be the center for our consideration. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Holy Ghost will never draw our attention from Christ to Himself, but rather reveal Christ in a fuller way</span>. We are in danger of slighting Jesus - getting Him ‘lost in the temple,’ by the exaltation of the Holy Ghost and of the gifts of the Spirit. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Jesus must be the center of everything</span></em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">.”,</span> Frank Bartleman

5). He does the work of regeneration - anyone who does not preach sin, judgment, righteousness etc, in reaching the lost has excluded the Holy Spirit from His work of convincing, convicting, converting and containing souls, <strong>John 16:8, "And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:”</strong> The Holy Ghost came to put the spotlight on Christ and not Himself. When the Holy Ghost is lifted above Christ, believers are out of line. When the experience is lifted above the word of truth, we are trading on dangerous territories however glamorous the experience might be.

What is a true Holy Ghost meeting? Is it where people all speak with tongues? Or where people are healed? Where saints jump for joy? Where saints are prophesying? More - much more than that! <span style="text-decoration:underline;">It is where Christ is being exalted, where His holiness pierces the soul, where men and women fall before His holy throne, broken, humbled crying, “Holy, Holy, Holy.”</span> The moving of the Holy Spirit is empowering us to move closer to Christ, deeper in Christ, with a greater submission to His Lordship!

<strong>Christ is made a stranger in our midst when we want His POWER more than His PURITY! </strong>Who is the man or woman of God who has power? Is it the one who can heal the sick and raise the dead? Is it the one who can best talk in tongues and prophesy? Is it the one who draws the most people and builds the greatest church? <strong>No! The one with the power - is the one with the purity!</strong> <strong>“… the righteous are bold as a lion.. ” (Proverbs 28:1 KJV), </strong>to continue Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Peter 2:2, “And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed”</strong>

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image7.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5922" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image7.jpg" alt="image" width="236" height="236" /></a>Much of what the world believes about Christianity is what they see mostly on the media; and anytime anyone says they are pastor or evangelist, they think of televangelism. You are considered one of them when you are not. And here comes the sad part, many follow their destructives ways.

<!--more-->

Now these may not necessarily be non-believers, but believers too. Mark that Peter does not say few follow, he says many. This was a big concern for Paul too when he wrote to the Galatians, <strong>Galatians 1:6-9, vs. “6 I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, 7 which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed (banned)”.</strong>

It is not easy to spot false teachers/prophets, they prey on their listeners primarily by what their listeners crave for the most, health and prosperity. While there is nothing wrong with these two in their right context, they are only byproducts not prime product of Christianity and they are not guaranteed.

Why do many follow their destructive ways?<strong> 1.) Biblical and theological illiteracy.</strong> If we don’t know the bible, if we don’t know doctrine, if we don’t know theology, it’s virtually difficult to identify false teachers/prophets. This is one reason we become uncomfortable when one identifies a false teacher/prophets. We lack spiritual maturity as described by the the writer of Hebrews. Read his diagnosis, “<strong>12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food. 13 For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. 14 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</span>”, Hebrews 5:12-14.</strong>

If we don’t know the biblical gospel, we will follow their destructive ways. One way the false teachers /prophets are doomed is because of the way of righteousness. Peter in vs. 4-11, stresses this point of righteousness. <strong>Vs. 4”… but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly</strong>”, and <strong>vs. 7" and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked 8 (for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds)". </strong>In these two examples, we see Noah a preacher of righteousness, his life spoke righteousness as he called people to repent and avoid flood judgment. We then see righteous Lot, who had spiritual weakness but his heart was right with God. The issue is here is not that of happiness but that of righteousness, how to be made right with God.

Majority who say they are saved are unable to articulate what salvation is, why they are saved, and how they are saved. Therefore, few plumbline messages through <strong>the EYES of the GOSPEL</strong>. The gospel starts with the kingdom of God and what it entails; everything else is tested in the light of His kingdom. The kingdom of God is about righteousness, <strong>Psalm 89:14, “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; Mercy and truth go before Your face”</strong>. Paul tells us in <strong>Romans 14:17-18, “17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men”. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Christ did not die on the cross to make us happy, Christ died on the cross to make us righteous</span></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">.</span> This is the reason <strong>Isaiah 53:5 </strong>is not talking about physical healing primarily, it’s talking about spiritual healing. <strong>2Corinthians 5:21, "For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him</strong>”. <strong>Proverbs 11:4, “Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness delivers from death”</strong>

<strong>1Peter 2:24-25, “24 who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose stripes you were healed. 25 For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls”</strong>

Do those you listen to preach righteousness, do they exalt Christ and His cross? Are they more concerned of giving you what you want in this life than preparing you for eternity? If we don’t know the word/gospel, we will definitely receive toxic gospel without discerning. <strong>2Timothy 2:15, “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth”, </strong> Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Peter 2:1-22, “1 But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image5.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5915" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image5.jpg" alt="image" width="300" height="197" /></a></strong>

In the bible, Jesus addresses extensively false teachers (prophets) in <strong>Matthew 7:15, Matthew 24; </strong><strong>and so is Paul in 2Corinthians 11; and Peter in 2Peter 2; and in Titus 1; and John in 1John 4; in Jude 1</strong>. They kept sending warnings and even gave marks of such people. Peter here deals with the false prophets and he teaches us how to identify them so that we flee. These were not personal issues but doctrinal the same reason I address them. How sincere they are and many are is also not the issue, TRUTH is the issue. Peter and Paul could tolerate those who were hostile to them as long as they preached the gospel of Christ.<!--more-->

This chapter is parallel to the epistle of Jude. Peter says that one mark of a false teacher/ prophet is that vs. 1<strong>. "They will secretly bring in destructive heresies, …”</strong> . False teachers parade themselves as Christian pastors, teachers, evangelists, faith healers. They bring heresy (a deviation from the truth), self-designed religious lies which lead to division. “<strong>…, even denying the Lord …</strong>”, this is the heart of deception because if you deviate from the true teachings of the Lord, anything goes in the name of Christ. <i>They have Christ label in their ministry (theologically) but their lifestyle denies Christ as the center</i>. They deny supreme authority of the Lord, they may confess Him as the Savior, but they don’t receive His divine authority. From the way they sound, it seems the Lord is their master who is out to meet and service their needs. The Lord is not their treasure, what they want from the Lord is their treasure. The Lord is like a gene they rub on to get whatever they want. While it’s hard to spot them, the primary way to get started would not be theological, it would be ETHICAL. <em>“It is not their theology that unmasks them, it is their morality that unmasks them.”</em> John McArthur

They have elevated themselves in the level of the Lord, they have dethroned Christ, and they have perverted the truth preaching another Jesus, another spirit, and another gospel (<strong>2Corinthians 11:3</strong>). They have elevated another spirit, they preach Christless Christianity, He is rarely mentioned in their midst, and His finished work on the cross is a ticket to get stuff. They are more concerned about now than eternity. The false teacher’s basic error is that they will not submit their lives to the rule of Christ. <strong>Titus 1:16, "They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work”</strong>

<strong>Vs. 1, “… who bought them”, </strong>A master bought slaves, and the slaves owed the master allegiance as their sovereign. While the Apostles always referred to themselves as bondservants, not so with the false teachers. Among the ones I know, they have elevated themselves as small gods, they believe they have the ability to create and bring things into existence with their own words calling it faith. Some believe Christ is not the only begotten Son of God because they too have been begotten. They believe they are little messiahs walking on earth and they teach others to follow. These are some well-known televangelists.

How do we test those who claim to speak for the Lord<strong>, 1John 4:1-2, “1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world, 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God”</strong> this is more than mouth confession, this is a life style confession. Listen to Paul talking to Timothy his son in the faith, <b>2</b><strong>Timothy 3:10-14,”10 But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, 11 persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me. 12 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 13 But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 14 But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.”</strong>

Those you listen to, do they deny Christ in their living? leave alone what they may believe or teach. Do you know their doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith etc? Timothy was a good Berean, he did not receive Paul at face value, something we do many times. He knew Paul’s background and followed him carefully. He did not look at one aspect of his life, he looked at the totality of  his life. He could have not done this without God’s word as the plumb line. Paul did not deny Christ in words, thoughts and deeds. Toxic gospel may not deny Christ's salvation, it would deny His Lordship.

“<em> Unless I am convinced by Scripture and by plain reason, …, my conscience is captive to the word of God. …”</em>Martin Luther, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>2Peter 2:1-22, “vs. 1 But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction. 2 And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. 3 By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber</b>”

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5914" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image4.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="277" /></a>

A few months ago I was reading and meditating on <b>2Peter 2 </b>which deals with false prophets and false teachers in detail and I began to pen a series of messages off it. The more I read, the more I became burdened.

I was led as I am from time to time to address the subject of biblical discernment. Then around that time I was handed an account to work on only to find that it was an account of two ministers I would call false teachers with a very expensive private jet worth millions.<!--more-->

About 12 years ago I was hooked on their teachings among others and later I became aware of their false teachings primarily by their <b>doctrine</b> and <b>their living</b>. As I carefully began to study the word and listen to sound biblical teachings, I distanced myself from them and those like them. That is why this subject is dear to my heart. I want to see believers especially those we reach beware and distance themselves from these people and their teachings.

In many cases when I chat with believers, I tend to ask of those who influence their lives. Many times we address this subject in our conversation, and they will say how they can’t stand false teachers only to find that some in their list of their favorite preachers I would label false teachers, again based on their doctrines and their life style. I am very concerned for our brothers here in the US, in India and Africa because many have become victims of bad teaching and bad living and it’s spreading like wild fire.

As Peter’s life on earth drew close to an end, he dedicates this chapter to address a subject that must be dealt with so that believers can stand. The letter is a warning about false teachers and their doctrines.<b> He wants us to know what they look like, how they act, how they talk, how they function and operate, and he describes them in detail.</b>

At the expense of truth, there are some who have  said, “<i>Doctrine divides, can’t we just put doctrine aside and get a long?”</i> It’s always hard to draw the line and call someone a heretic, false teacher or false prophet when they are doing some nice things, when they have some truth in their teachings. <strong>If anything, that’s what makes them toxic</strong>. They are hard to spot and the only way is to plumb line what they teach with the word of God. As Pastor Voddie Baucham puts it, “<i>many of us are allergic to truth exposing false teachers”</i>, if anyone brings it up, we feel uncomfortable addressing such a subject and sweep it under the carpet as fast as we can. And while we let things slide, we continue to enable those who practice such things that blaspheme the name of the Lord. Another thing that is prevalent in our time when you talk about false teachers, people say, <i>“you are being judgmental”</i>, I am guilty as charged but here is my question for you, hoow will you identify without judging? Right and wrong are identified by judging, so it’s needed.

<em>“I'm afraid the church today is a bit witless on these matters. It has become very tolerant of error, and it literally absorbs the very deception that Paul warns about and Peter warns about. The cry today is for everyone to agree with everyone, to tolerate everyone who names the name of Christ no matter what he teaches. This sort of endless tolerance has produced indifference to truth. Mark that. Tolerance has produced indifference to truth. The church is witless, careless, foolish, blind”,</em> John McArthur.

D.A. Carson wrote of this passage in<b> </b><b>2Corinthians,</b><i> "If we are embarrassed by the force of Paul's denunciation, our embarrassment may only be testimony to the degree by which we have departed from the apostolic gospel." If it embarrasses us that the Apostle Paul calls some in the church who name the name of Christ false apostles, deceitful workers who are headed for destruction, and if we think that's a little much, it only indicates how far away we are from battling for truth and how tolerant we have become”</i>

Jesus, Peter, Paul among others told us to beware of false teachers, but they did not leave it there, they gave us the means to identify them, God’s word. As Martin Luther said, “<em> <strong>Unless I am convinced by Scripture and by plain reason, …, my conscience is captive to the word of God. …”</strong></em><strong>.</strong> This is beyond feelings; it’s the word of God that must be used to battle toxic gospel. We will dig in to find the words Peter gives us to identify false teachers. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Job 19:25, "For I know that my Redeemer lives; And He shall stand at the last on the earth"</strong>

We need to be aware of is that as we walk with God we are reminded that He owes us nothing. I know of people who walk and talk as though God owes them something, it's like they gave God something to keep, or they did God a favor and now God owes them and should pay them back. God owes you nothing, as a matter of fact, you owe it all to Him. <!--more-->The fact that you breathe is an indication that you owe Him. If that is not enough many walk around accusing God for doing evil things in their lives, well may I remind you that God does not tempt any one and does not bring any calamity in one’s life, He may permit but He will not author it for God is not evil and He cannot tempt anyone with evil.

In <b>Job chapter</b> 1 talks about a conversation God had with Satan, the bible says that the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came along with them. First point to note, the devil is not always in hell as people think, he is called the prince of the air, he also reigns in the heavenlies and he has access to the throne of God and that is what happened. So when God asked him where he came from, he said that he had been roaming back and forth on earth. He is the accuser of the brethren for he came to the throne to accuse Job. God talked highly of Job, Satan said that the reason Job was loyal to God was because of the blessings God had bestowed upon him and the covering. Satan says, "take away all that he has and he will curse you" and God gives him permission to touch him and everything that he has but not kill him. God may allow up to a certain level of attack to come our way but He will not allow more than we can handle <strong>1Corinthians 10:13, There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above all that you are able; but with temptation also make a way of escape, that you may be able to bear. </strong>With temptation, with that which you are dealing with, God will make a way of escape, He will use that which we go through to work for our good.

In <b>Job 19</b> we see how one of Job's friends who should be an encouragement to him during his tough time began attacking him. No servants to command to do things, the wife to stand by him has already asked him to curse God and die. He has boils all over his body, he stinks, he is broken. He has lost all his possessions, respect, children I mean all that he could need in life was all gone. He does not feel the presence of the Lord. Ever been in a situation where everybody you thought would stand with you were nowhere to be found? and all the help was gone? This was Job's experience. Next time you think you have it bad, try getting hold of Job and he will show you how your situation is nothing compared to his Job complained, murmured, desired that he would not have been born, he wished he could die, but still after every scene and after every episode, he encourages himself <strong>Job 13:15, "Though He slay me, yet I will maintain mine own ways before him", Job 23:10, "He knows the way that I take, after He has tried me, I will come forth as gold". </strong>When no one could encourage him, he encouraged himself during his tough times. You are your best encourager when it comes to hard times. Build your own foundation of encouragements. Let someone come and help you build the walls but be the one to lay a foundation.

After talking about what they had done to him in <b>Job 19</b> nearly at the end of the chapter he encourages himself in vs.<strong> 25&amp;26 "For I know that my Redeemer lives; And He shall stand at the last on the earth. And after my skin is destroyed, this I know, that in my flesh I shall see God"</strong>. After going through everything, all you have is God. <strong>The word Redeemer comes from the word redeem which means to recover ownership of by paying a specified sum, it also means to set free, rescue or ransom</strong>. Jesus Christ redeemed us from the law of sin and death by shading His blood on the cross. We were once worthless yet bought with the highest price, the blood. He paid more than we cost and so even with Job, he knew that his <strong>Redeemer (rescuer lived) after going through everything the Redeemer would stand on earth in him because 1John 4:4, "Ye are of God ye little children for you have overcome them, for greater is He that lives (Redeemer) inside of you than he that lives in the world". And after my skin is destroyed, this I know, that in my flesh I shall see God, 1Peter 5:10, "But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish you, strengthen you, settle you</strong>". All this can only happen because our Redeemer lives, He… <strong>Psalm 103:5, "Who redeems my life from destruction". </strong>Can you imagine someone paying a price for you not to be destroyed, not to fail, not to perish? I thank God for He is my Redeemer, I haven't earned it and I will never but I'm glad that He has Redeemed me. When no one could buy me back and free me, the same God whom I thought forgot about me is the same God who came and rescued me. <strong>He owed me nothing yet He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood</strong>. Job knew that it was a matter of time before he would come out of his situation, God is able. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 94:17-19, "Unless the Lord had been my help, My soul would soon have settled in silence"</strong>

You could be facing something that is really tearing you apart. There are days everyone is so overwhelmed with things you just can't take no more. Frustrations have pushed you to the edge and how to deal with them are nearly impossible. You have tried to strengthen yourself but you find yourself back to worrying, helpless and confused.<!--more--> Tears roll down your cheeks and you just can't stop it. You wish that the people you love are around to help you overcome what you have to deal with but still that doesn't happen. What do you do? I have been there, felt it, wanted to run away, cried myself to sleep but in all I learnt more about the One who knows my down sitting and my uprising, the One who is familiar with my ways. He knows when I am so weak and just need to stop and cry.

It's easy to see someone stand strong as a soldier but like a song goes, "<strong>they don't know that I would go running home when I fall down, they don't know who picks me up when no one is around, I drop my sword and cry for a while, because deep inside this armor, the warrior is a child</strong>". Many people tend to see the armor but let them take a deeper look and see that inside that armor, the person in it has the heart of a child. A heart that can melt, be broken, be scared but that is okay because it teaches you more on who to depend on. God does bring us to those seasons so that our confidence is not in any man but in Him.

<strong>Psalm 94:17, "Unless the Lord had been my help, My soul would have settled in silence</strong>", Had it not been for the Lord's help, whatever I do or what other people have done would have either failed or just became a temporary solution to my problem. In a case like this, who can give peace apart from God? Many times it's the peace that is needed to endure. If you had peace inside, even if the situation did not change, adapting to it made you comfortable. Comfort does not mean you are okay, it means you can deal with it without it dealing with you. God helps us so that we are at peace because His peace surpasses all human understanding. The bible says in<strong> Philippians 4:7, "And the peace OF God...", </strong>it's the peace that originates from above, no one can give it but Him.

<strong>Vs. 18, "If I say, "My foot slips," Your mercy, O Lord, will hold me up</strong>". Mercy and grace tends to work together, when you have peace inside, God gives the grace to endure. Paul after praying three times for something to be removed from his life, God's word came to him in <strong>2Corinthians 12:9, "And He said to me, "My grace us sufficient for you, My strength is made perfect in weakness"</strong>. What Paul needed the most was not to get out of the trouble but the grace to endure,  his response <strong>2Corinthians 12:9, "...</strong> <strong>Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong”</strong>. When he was weak, Christ in Him was strong and Christ made him strong. See Christ's mercy and grace did hold Paul up and that changed the way he responded to his situation.

<strong>Psalm 94:19, "In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comfort delight my soul</strong>". What a way to identify all that is within you and have the Lord's comfort delight your soul to the extent that what should bother you, he has placed in under His control.  What brings tears of sorrows in your eyes has been changed to bring tears of joy for you know who holds today, tomorrow and always. What should frustrate you, He has given you peace to ride it out. Sooner or later, you are taught more on how to encourage yourself like Paul and David that even if there is no one around, you can encourage yourself in the Lord. When God has taught you more of it, don't be surprised if He brings people your way who will need the same encouragement because His words made a difference in your life. Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 91:14-16, “14 Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he has known My name. 15 He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him. 16 With long life I will satisfy him, And show him My salvation.”</strong>

The motivation for our love for God is that He first loved us. We knew not what love is until He demonstrated it. Which of the angels did the Lord says He loves? Yet the angels are more holier than man, the bible says He has made us lower than the angels yet He has bestowed His love upon us.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 14 “Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; …</strong>”. Here is the Lord speaking of His chosen ones. This is not because the one He loves deserves to be kept, but because with all his imperfections he does love his God. Therefore not the angels of God only, but the God of angels himself will come to his rescue in all perilous times, and will effectually deliver him. No one has ever loved God with a perfect love apart from Christ, but <b>Hebrews 11 </b>talks about the heroes of faith who loved God but not with a perfect love and God came to their rescue many times. It is love, love set upon God, which is the distinguishing mark of those whom the Lord secures from all trouble

<strong>“….. I will set him on high, because he has known my name</strong>”. David in <strong>Psalm 34:8, says “Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good; Blessed is the man who trusts in Him!</strong>” David knew the goodness and faithfulness of God through the love of God. <strong>Proverbs 18:10, “The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous run to it and are safe</strong>”. A child who knows his father and loves him can trust his father’s words when he says, “<i>son trust me, I will catch and hold you when you let go of the branch you are holding on to”</i>. <b>Love secures trust.</b>

<strong>Vs.</strong> <strong>15, “He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him”. </strong>The established relationship provides comfort ability in approaching the one who loves and cares. You would not feel comfortable going to another father to ask for something, but with your father who you have close relationship with, who you know his name and nature, you feel comfortable asking him anything you need. Here we get the assurance that because of who God is to us, when we call on Him, He answers<strong>. Jeremiah 33:3, “‘Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.’ </strong><b>1John 5:14-15, </b><strong>"14 Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 15 And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him. <em>“</em></strong><em>Saints are first called of God and then they call upon God; such calls as theirs always obtain answers. Not without prayer will the blessing come to the most favored, but by means of prayer they shall receive all good things. I will be with him in trouble, or "I am with him in trouble." Heirs of heaven are conscious of a special divine presence in times of severe trial. God is always near in sympathy and in power to help his tried ones. I will deliver him, and honor him. The man honors God, and God honors him. Believers are not delivered or preserved in a way which lowers them, and makes them feel themselves degraded; far from it, the Lord's salvation bestows honor upon those it delivers. God first gives us conquering grace, and then rewards us for it”,</em> Charles Spurgeon.

<strong>Vs. 16</strong>. “<strong>With long life I will satisfy him, And show him My salvation.” </strong>I think this verse has more to do with quality of life rather than quantity of life (how long someone lives). There are those who accomplish a lot in a short time and are quite satisfied with life, and are content to leave it when time comes. All the apostles had long life but not by man’s thoughts, they lived their life to the fullest because God purposed it that way and was their salvation.

All these are possible in the light of <b>Psalm 91:1</b> meaning he that by faith chooses God for his protector, shall find all in Him that he needs or can desire. And those who have found the comfort of making the Lord their refuge, cannot but desire that others may do so. <b>Psalm 91:1</b> is our 911 emergency number. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 91:12-13, “12 In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone. 13 You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra, The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot”</strong>

Recently a pastor was killed by snake he had handled for long, his dad was also killed by a snake he handled. They took this verse in the bible to justify their handling of snakes, <strong>Mark 16:17-18, “17 And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; 18 they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; ...” </strong>While this verse is true, it’s not set for us to use to look for trouble, it applies to believers who trouble finds. <!--more-->Paul in <b>Acts 28 </b>had a viper (snake) fasten around his wrist while he was setting fire, vs<strong>. 5, “But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. 6 However, they were expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had looked for a long time and saw no harm come to him…”. </strong>Paul was not looking for trouble, trouble found him and in that, the vs. in <b>Mark 16 </b>was applicable to his situation.

In continuing with the ministry of the angels, the psalmist says <strong>vs. 12,</strong> “<strong>In their hands they shall bear you up, …”. “</strong><em>They”, </em>that is the angels, God's own angels, shall cheerfully become our servants ministering to us as instructed by God. Listen to Christ confirming this when they arrested him and his disciples, Peter in specific pulled out his sword to defend Christ, He said <strong>Matthew 26:53”.. do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?”.</strong> This was right after being in the garden of Gethsemane praying God’s will to be done. At His very weakest, darkest, troubling times the bible says <strong>Luke 22:43,” Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him”. </strong>Jesus described in the book of Hebrews as above all angels was ministered to by an angel sent by God the Father. God sent an angel to minister to Daniel in the lions’ den, <strong>Daniel 6:22, “My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, so that they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you</strong>.” Peter in prison was freed by an angel, <strong>Acts 5:18-19, ”18 and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. 19 But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, …”</strong>

They don’t come in their own accord, they have no power of their own. The strength and power of angels is to carry the saints in their hands; their tender care of them. Such as a parent or nurse have of children; the helpless condition of the people of God, who are like infants, and need to be dealt with after this manner. The angels take such an office on them, in submission to the will of God. The constant view they have of the saints, being always in their hands.

<strong>“…Lest you dash your foot against a stone 13 You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra, The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot”</strong> “<em>as the Israelites, when they travelled through the wilderness, in which were serpents and scorpions; and many of the servants of God have been delivered from them, or have slain them, as Samson, David, and Daniel; and so Christ was among the wild beasts in the wilderness, and yet not touched or hurt by them; and his disciples had power given them by him to tread on serpents and scorpions, and to take up serpents, without receiving any damage from them; and when a viper fastened on the hand of the Apostle Paul, he shook it off, without being hurt by it; see Mark 1:13, Acts 28:5<strong>, it may be understood figuratively of Satan, who, for his voraciousness and cruelty, is compared to a lion; and, for his craft and subtlety, to a serpent, 1 Peter 5:8</strong>. The young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample underfoot; which also may be understood of the great dragon, the old serpent, called the devil and Satan; <strong>whom Christ trampled under his feet when he hung on the cross, and spoiled him and his principalities and powers; and who, in a short time, will be bruised under the feet of his people, as he has been already by the seed of the woman, Genesis 3:15</strong>.” </em><strong>John Gill. </strong>May God send His ministering angels when we find ourselves in the lions’ dens, in prison, under pressure, under pain etc. to minister to us. May He charge His angels over His children.Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 91:7-11 “7 A thousand may fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; But it shall not come near you. 8 Only with your eyes shall you look, And see the reward of the wicked 9 Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, your dwelling place,10 No evil shall befall you, Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling; 11 For He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways.”</strong>

I recall from back in the days where they had a commercial for a new jeep. It depicted how the jeep could dodge things coming at it to destroy it. Up on the mountain, you would see rocks, trees etc. coming at it, yet they were falling on its side none destroying it. <!--more-->One of their main points (though not accurate in my judgment) was that it could survive in that environment because they built it to.

While the jeep manufactures can exaggerate what their car can do, the life of a believer is built and secured by His maker. He is built to be an overcomer, a conqueror through Christ who strengthens him (<strong>Philippians 4:13).</strong> He is made to survive in his surrounding whether things change or not. <strong>1John 5:4</strong>, qualifies it when it says, <strong>4 “For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith”. </strong>This is a huge struggle for us as believers because even though we know this truth, we feel deficient and paralyzed.

The man who communes with God is not affected by this infection and corruption; he holds the truth when falsehood is all it fashions. God’s assurance, vs. <strong>7, “A thousand may fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; But it shall not come near you”. </strong>This truth can be seen in Egypt when the Lord brought His ten plagues. While the Egyptians were plagued by it, not with the Israelites, a thousand were falling on their left side and ten thousand on their right hand side however none of the plagues including the one that claimed the lives of the first born had effect on them. This shows both the great devastation made by the plague where it came, and the special care and providence of God in preserving His people from. The Lord assured them that , “<strong>8 Only with your eyes shall you look, And see the reward of the wicked”. </strong>They did see and hear  however none of it descended on them.

Vs. 9.<strong> “Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, your dwelling place 10 No evil shall befall you, Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;”. </strong>The Israelites took the Lord at His word and applied the blood of the lamb on the door post of their homes so that when the angel of death appeared, they would be protected from what was about to befall others. The Psalmist here may have looked back to those days and learned a valuable lesson of making the Lord His trust, His refuge, His dwelling place for safety in the midst of danger. Ascribing all this safety to the Lord; whose providence was in a peculiar manner over him, whose power protected him, and he was as an asylum or city of refuge to him; so that nothing could hurt him.

<strong>Vs. 11 “For He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways”, </strong>I think we minimize the ministry of the angels, we forget that God has set His angels (notice the plurality) over His children. Could it be a legion of angels? Only God knows. When Elisha says in <strong>2 Kings 6:16 </strong>…, “<strong>Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them</strong>”, could he be talking of ministering angels?. <strong>Psalm 34:7, “The angel of the Lord encamps all around those who fear Him, And delivers them</strong>”. As Charles Spurgeon writes, <em>“The covenant angel, the Lord Jesus, at the head of all the bands of heaven, surrounds with his army the dwellings of the saints. Like hosts entrenched so are the ministering spirits encamped around the Lord's chosen, to serve and succor, to defend and console them. On every side the watch is kept by warriors of sleepless eyes, and the Captain of the host is one whose prowess none can resist. We little know how many providential deliverances we owe to those unseen hands which are charged to bear us up lest we dash our foot against a stone”</em>.

Whatever happens, nothing shall hurt the believer; though trouble and affliction befall, it shall come, not for his hurt, but for good, though for the present it be not joyous but grievous. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 91:3-6, “3 Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler And from the perilous pestilence. 4 He shall cover you with His feathers, And under His wings you shall take refuge; His truth shall be your shield and buckler. 5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day, 6 Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday”</strong>

My early years growing up in the farm, we kept chickens in our homestead. If there is anything about the mother hen (chicken), she is very sensitive to the presence of danger especially that of hawks.<!--more--> She has a way of sensing its presence and then alerting her chicks of the danger so that they come around her or hide. She opens her wings ready to fight for her chicks. God does the same, He alerts us of the dangers of life and brings us close to Him as He fights the snare of the fowler on our behalf. We are foolish and weak as poor little chicks, and are very apt to be lured to our destruction by cunning foes, but if we dwell near to God, He will see to it that the most skillful deceiver shall not entrap us.

The Lord who is our refuge and fortress, demonstrates it by what He will do for His children, <strong>Vs. 3 </strong>“<strong>Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler And from the perilous pestilence”</strong>. “Surely” is an absolute word, the psalmist who knew his God would not use any doubting words but rather assuring words. Assuredly no subtle plot shall succeed against one who has the eyes of God watching for his defense. Even when it looks like the enemy is winning, he has no chance.

<strong>Vs. “4 He shall cover you with His feathers, And under His wings you shall take refuge; His truth shall be your shield and buckler”. </strong>Something interesting about the mother hen is gathering her chicks under her wings, sometimes you wouldn’t know that there are chicks hidden under her wings. The mother hen fiercely guards the chicks, and will brood them to keep them warm. She leads them to food and water; she will call them to edible items, and feeds them indirectly. What has God done with us, He has given us the truth of Himself to feed us, lead us, to keep us warm, and to shield us from danger. Jesus lamenting over Jerusalem tells us of how we would have wanted to treat them like a mother hen does to her chicks, He says <strong>“37 “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!” Matthew 23:37</strong>

<strong>Vs. “5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day, 6 Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday”. </strong>Such frail creatures are we that both by night and by day we are in danger, and so sinful are we that in either season we may be readily carried away by fear. The terrible things that happen in the night; as fire, storms and tempests, invasion of enemies, murders, thefts, and, robberies; a righteous man, when he has committed himself and his family to the care and protection of God by prayer and His word, has no reason to be anxious because he knows he is under God’s care. In addition, neither pestilence that walks in darkness nor destruction that lays waste at noonday creates terror to those who make the Lord their trust. <strong>Isaiah 59:19 </strong>verse among others gives us that assurances, “<strong>So shall they fear The name of the LORD from the west, And His glory from the rising of the sun; When the enemy comes in like a flood, The Spirit of the LORD will lift up a standard against him”.</strong>

We live in a crazy world, we sometimes see dangers coming and sometimes we don’t. To be and to stay safe, we need to heed to His call to come under His wings. The care God has over His children is sufficient to defend them from all dangers but only when they respond otherwise they have no covering and the enemy takes advantage of that.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 91:1-2, “1 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 2 I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.”</strong>

One of the most important numbers you learn and even the kids are taught to learn and how to make use of it is the <b>911 number</b>. It’s a very important number to call when there is emergency due to injuries, abuses, life threatening situations etc. <!--more-->You call that number because you need assistance, your life at that point depends on it because you need rescue over what is beyond you. No one dials this number for fun. While this is good and vital, we believers have another 911 number we can call <b>Psalm 91:1</b>.

<strong>Psalm 91:1, “He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty”.</strong> When you talk of dwelling, you mean residing. That is where you live, that is where you shoot for when you have had a long day. I always look forward to going home after hard work, vacation, trips etc. They say there is no place like home. We have a dwelling place, secret dwelling place in the Lord. I know not of a better way to make it a secret place in the Lord than in communing with Him in prayers. Jesus said as recorded in <strong>Matthew 6:6,”But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly”. </strong>It’s in this secret place of the Most High shall we abide (remain) under the shadow of the Almighty. His shadow is enough comfort to know He is near those who trust in Him. I tie this with <strong>John 15:7</strong> where Jesus said, “<strong>7 If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you</strong>”. The condition of this blessed promise is that we abide, dwell in the Vine. The prayer is the means by which I believe we abide and that is where the word of Christ takes root in our hearts. <strong>Faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God, and prayers lays and establishes the foundation by which these two are secured</strong>. This abides when it comes in power, and becomes the engrafted word; and may be said to do so, when such, in whose hearts it has a place, and has taken deep root, continue to have a relish and savor of it. A true and hearty affection for it, stands fast in it, steadfastly abiding by it, and constantly attending on it.

He that by faith chooses God for his protector, speaks these words in confidence, <strong>vs. 2, “ I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.</strong>” And those who have found the comfort of making the Lord their refuge, cannot but desire that others may do so, they therefore desire for them to have such experience. The spiritual life is protected by Divine grace from the temptations of Satan, which are as the snares of the fowler, and from the contagion of sin, which is a noisome pestilence. Great security is promised to believers in the midst of danger. Wisdom shall keep them from being afraid without cause, and faith shall keep them from being unduly afraid. Whatever is done, our heavenly Father's will is done; and we have no reason to fear. God's people shall see, not only God's promises fulfilled, but his threatening against all that threatens His children.

<b>When the call is made, the person who calls knows help is on the way</b>. They take comfort that they matter otherwise who would rescue a person who does not matter. Everything stops and attention is given to the one who needs it. This is the same with us, when we call our heavenly emergency line, we are brought under His care and there can we reside, making it our dwelling place. Do you have a secret place, do you abide there or is it a place you check in and out whenever you feel like it. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 5:17, “Now it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them”</strong>

No prayer requests hits my mailbox like the request for physical healing. The prevalent one is healing over cancer. How many are running to faith healers hoping for a healing touch if they have the right faith. While I would discredit many of the so called faith healers, I am a firm believer of physical healing. <!--more-->I believe God still heals today. I have seen healing take place in my family. My brother had something in his stomach a few years ago the doctors could not detect so as to provide right cure and so was my mom. We prayed and trusted God for their healing and in His mercies, He heard our cry. My dad battled stomach ulcers for years, and God miraculously healed him.

You may be asking if you have enough faith to pray and believe God for the healing you need or for a loved one to be healed. <strong>If you had faith from God to be saved, you have faith from God to be healed</strong>. That is all the faith you need. <strong>“The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ is ‘the same yesterday, and today, and forever,’ (Hebrews 13:8</strong>). The Lord Himself said, ‘<strong>I am the Lord, I change not,’ (Malachi 3:6).</strong> All God’s promises are limitless answers to prayer. ‘WHAT THINGS SOEVER ye desire’ or ‘if ye shall ask ANYTHING in My name,’ show that miracles will last as long as God’s promises are true, whenever people are given faith to trust Him for miracles.

In countless instances since the Bible was written, God has worked miracles; and these miracles have been witnessed by the best men and women of the centuries, who have given their witness that they know God still answers prayer, even miraculously. Healings still happen because <strong>the power of God has never ceased</strong>. It’s not gone cold or put out. It’s still burning changing lives and healing the sick. It’s in seeking God’s kingdom first that these other things such as healing are added to us. They are not added because we seek His kingdom, it’s while we are seeking His kingdom first that He does add them. We put our focus on Him. Healing is a byproduct not the prime product otherwise we will be out of focus.

While Jesus was teaching (what ought to be prime), in Luke 5, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by who had come to watch. These were the same type of people who opposed Jesus’ ministry. They were always looking to take fault with Him, discredit His miracles, seeking ways to trap Him but in the midst of all the opposition, arguments, all reasoning, their unbelief <strong>“The Power of the Lord was present to heal them</strong>”. Who are them but those whom He had given faith because they were open. Faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God.

He is Jehovah Rapha meaning our healer. He can heal instantly, gradually, through the doctors etc, He gets all the credit. He is the one in control of how we get the healing according to His power that works within us. Can He not be trusted to do the healing? Watch this leprous man who met with Jesus right after He was done preaching on the mountain in <strong>Matthew 8:2-3,“2 And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” 3 Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed”</strong>. Notice that he did not say “if you can”, he knew Jesus could, that is faith. The outcome was in His hands “<strong>Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” </strong>And the Lord say<strong>, “I am willing; be cleansed.”</strong> The Lord is willing, trust Him today, call on Him. There is no special power someone else has that you don’t have. This man did not look for a faith healer; he went straight to Christ, called on Him for his healing. So was Bartimaeus in <b>Mark 10:46</b>, he cried out to Jesus, the woman with the issue of who reached out and touched him in<b> Luke 8. </b>These people had one thing in common, desperation and who to call on. Yes we can have people pray with us but if your faith is based on how many people or who can pray for you, then I remind you again to know “<strong>the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power”, Ephesians 1:19, Blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 3:1-10, “6 Then Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk”</strong>

Yesterday I concluded with <strong>“for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure”, Philippians 2:13. </strong>I shared that<strong> We need the power of the Holy Ghost to keep us humble and empower us to do His work</strong>.<!--more-->

Now we come to the <b>book of Acts </b>and we see Peter full of the Holy Ghost and power living and demonstrating the exceeding greatness of God’s power in himself as a follower of Jesus Christ. He is aware of the fact that “…<strong>we have this treasure (gospel power) in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.” 2 Corinthians 4:7 </strong>and he knew that if anything is to happen, it will be done by God through Christ by the power of the Holy Ghost for His glory through unworthy life. We will see how that unfolds<strong>.</strong>

Peter and John among others had been going to the temple to pray many times. And we are told in <strong>vs. 2, “And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered the temple</strong>”. I don’t believe this was the first time they saw him, perhaps they had also given him alms before. It’s not recorded if anyone ever invited him into the temple even willing to assist him.

Though he was lame from birth, people had given him temporal things, things to fill his own life but no one ever gave him what he desperately needed, to be made whole. Silver and gold is what he asked for but what he desperately needed was not natural but supernatural. Natural is what men produces, supernatural is what God produces. Natural is what people did, brought him to at the gate of the temple, gave him alms.

We are no different, we've given the world everything (alms) but Jesus. we give advice, we give assistance, we lend, we offer to bring our loved ones and friends food, do their laundry, fix their cars, clean their drive way, give people a ride, assist them at work etc but we’ve failed many times to give them Jesus. This is like giving alms and nothing else.

The lame man <strong>vs. 3-6, "3 ... seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms. 4 And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, “Look at us.” 5 So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. 6 Then Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.” </strong>Peter said look on us and expected alms, only to hear something different. Instead of silver and gold which he had none, he gave him Jesus.

<strong>In the name of Jesus Christ.</strong> Christ worked his miracles in no one's name. The power was his own, but with the apostles all things were done in Christ's name, and the power ascribed to him. Though Peter was full of the Holy Ghost, he proclaimed the name of Christ because the Holy Ghost was sent to glorify Christ. He empowers us to do God’s work of glorifying Christ. Also Peter did not tell him to rise and walk alone, he adds the most important name <strong>In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth </strong>to show the exceeding greatness of His power to make one whole.

If we would attempt to do good, the purpose of healing men's souls must be on top of our list. We must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, that in respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy and rapture shall we tread the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes us to enter therein by his strength.

We’ve given alms and we should continue, but can we give our family members who are not saved, friends, workmates what they desperately need, Jesus? It begins by knowing “…<strong>the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power”, Ephesians 1:19, Blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 5:1-11, " 5 But Simon answered and said to Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.” 6 And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking. 7 So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. 8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!”</strong>

I find it humbling some men in the bible who encountered our Holy God, seen Him in His power, majesty, glory, splendor were not left excited in the experience to talk about, rather left they were left in awe which led them to humility, broken and overwhelmed by the presence of the Almighty God. His presence revealed things in their lives leaving them feeling unworthy of such awesome presence yet desired.<!--more-->

Today I hear people who claim to have been to heaven writing books, appearing in talk shows, invited to talk about their experiences in heaven which raises enough red flags. In listening to Justin Peters of “A call for discernment” ministry talking about Paul who went to heaven (2Corinthians 12), shares how Paul first felt unworthy to have had such an experience, Paul even referred to himself in the third person to prevent him from boasting. If you read his encounter, he’s comes back humbled and even in his humility, he was still given a thorn in the flesh to humble him even more and could not talk about what he saw in heaven.

Now think of Peter in <b>Luke 5</b>, multitude drew close to listen to Jesus preach. At this time, Peter had not received his calling, he was a fisherman in business. In this story, the professional fishermen had caught nothing the previous night. At this point they had gone away washing their nets nursing disappointment. Jesus seeing Peter’s boat asked him to push it a little into the water so as to use it as a pulpit. Upon finishing preaching, He told Peter to launch into the deep <b>vs. 5-6, "5</b> <strong>But Simon answered and said to Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.” 6 And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking”</strong>

If faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God (<b>Romans 10:17)</b>, Peter heard the word that day and took Jesus at His word. He did as he was instructed and  had the greatest catch of his life. This is to show the power of God in the presence of the unworthy of it. It also shows the presence of the One who holds all the power that makes a difference. But did this demonstration make Peter excited and gave him something to talk about? contrary, vs. "8 <strong>When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!”. </strong>He was amazed at the greatness of the miracle wrought, and struck with the sense of the power of Christ, put forth therein; and with the greatness of His majesty so near him; and as conscious to himself of his own vileness and unworthiness to be in his presence. In his unworthiness, Christ gave him what he did not deserve, grace.

In his state, Christ called him to do what he could not do on his own power but under His power, made fishers of men. For what he had seen, he knew that if anything was going to happen, it was going to happen because Christ in His power would work something extraordinary in the life of a man who counted himself unworthy. These are the people who are candidates for grace and these are the people Christ fills with Himself and lives His own life through them demonstrating His miracle power. And this is how when we preach Christ, sinners would be struck by the power of Christ bringing them to their knees as they see their unworthiness before a holy and just God and with one cry say, “what must I do to be saved”

How I desire for God to so work in us to bring about that sense of Awe that reminders us of our unworthy as He demonstrates His power. And with His call in our lives, people would tremble at the presence of the power of Christ in us. That those who have mocked Christ, his children, His work will tremble before a just and holy God and repent of their sins, <strong>“for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure”, Philippians 2:13. We need the power of the Holy Ghost to keep us humble and empower us to do His work</strong>. We only catch what He has caught because of His great power. Oh that we would know<strong>, “… what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power”, Ephesians 1:19, blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 1:19, “..And what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power”; Ephesians 3:20 Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us"; Philippians 3:10</strong>

The word power has been the running through my mind for some time now, even greater in the last week when the Lord intensified my meditation on it. This was confirmed by my pastor’s preaching this Sunday as he addressed among other things the power of the Holy Ghost. It’s sad when we see people mock God and His power. <!--more-->His power is being abused by many false teachers and true but sad, many genuine believers have distanced themselves from this power because of the abuse by others. Then there are those who are afraid of it.

It was in 1940’s in Sudan Africa while witnessing to a Muslim, Paris Reidhead (one of favorite preachers) was left puzzled about God’s power when a Muslim he had been witnessing to for weeks asked him a tough question, “<strong>What can your living Jesus do today that our dead Mohammed can’t?</strong>”. For five long years Reidhead’s Mohammedan friend’s question had been as a sword behind him driving him to the Bible to read, study, search, and believe, for there lies the power of God. There lies the need for the power not for programs and man’s fulfilement but for demonstration to the world. I believe preaching the word still lies the power to salvation and I also believe in demonstration of God’s power in other areas (healing, provisions etc) are great testimonies to His ability to silence the mouths of mockers. This makes us Christians different from other religions.

Paul’s epistle to the Ephesians opens with greetings and prayer for them as he heard of their faith in Christ. One of his prayer to God for them was that they would know “...<strong>what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power</strong>”. He knew of their faith, he prayed for them to desire and know the greater power of God in a believer that would serve God’s purpose for His glory<strong>. “The Excellency of faith is declared by the effects, because the mighty power of God is set forth and shown in them. It happens as the hunger for God is a desire activated by the power of God by faith"</strong>

John Gill’s exposition explains, “<em>This power is that which is exerted in the implantation of faith, and in the continuance of it, and in the finishing of that work. This is a great power, an exceeding great one, a super eminent one; which is attended with energy and efficacy, and is irresistible and insuperable. The greatness of this power as displayed in the work of conversion and faith appears, if it be considered what the work itself is called, a creation, a resurrection from the dead, a regeneration, and a transformation of the man into another man, which must needs require almighty power; as well as what is then done, some things are removed. Satan is dispossessed, the stony heart is taken away, the enmity is slain, the old man is put down from His throne, and put off with His deeds; and there are some things wrought. Christ is formed in the soul, His grace is implanted, His image is stamped on, a new heart is given, and principles of light and life, of grace and holiness are put. The understanding is enlightened, the will is subdued, the affections are set on other objects, and the mind and conscience are cleansed and purified; and the means of this are the ministers, and ministry of the word, which are weak, foolish, and contemptible, in the eyes of men; to which may be added, the opposition made both from within and from without, from a sinful heart, a tempting devil, and an ensnaring, reproaching, and persecuting world: <strong>so that this work of faith cannot be ascribed to anything short of the exceeding greatness of divine power</strong>; <strong>and which is seen in supporting faith when it is wrought, under great discouragements; in delivering believers out of divers temptations; in assisting them to discharge their duty, and in their final perseverance: and to increase the idea of this power it is added</strong>”</em>

According to the working of His mighty power, or "according to the energy of the might of His power": the strength of His power, in all the mighty energy of it, is exerted towards and upon believers; and which they should know, own, and acknowledge, to the glory of the grace of God: and this is in proportion, and agreeably to that power. “<strong>What can your living Jesus do today that our dead Mohammed can’t?</strong>”, He gives power to the unworthy to serve His purpose to reach Mohammedian’s and others like him.

Do you truly know this power? Are you shying away and distancing yourself from it? You and I need this power. Let’s make this our prayer earnestly as Paul prayed for the Ephesians, it is very important. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Philippians 1:12-18, “12 But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel, 13 so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my chains are in Christ; 14 and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 15 Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from goodwill: 16 The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; 17 but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. 18 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice”</strong>

Apostle Paul in my judgment had one of the most unique ways of expressing himself in things most of us would have negative response too. I can imagine how his enemies could not figure him out. <!--more-->Whatever they tried to do to him, they found only worked to his advantage. When left to preach, he spread the gospel like wild fire. When they tried to contain him by locking him up, that did not stop him but rather fueled the fire of the gospel, jailers were hearing the gospel, one in particular being saved in <b>Acts 16. </b><strong>While</strong> <strong>Paul could be chained, the gospel he preached could not be chained</strong>. When they threatened to kill him, his response, <b>“for me to live is Christ and to die is gain”</b>. What else would you do to him to diminish his joy? Absolutely nothing.

The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the cross, he showed the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. While our time people would be casting out demons, Paul rejoiced in his suffering. He says, <strong>vs. 12. “But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel</strong>”. Not that it was preparing him for comfort or made him happy, but rather Christ was being magnified in the midst of it. These things made him known where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. <strong>It’s interesting to note that Paul always thrived in adversity more than he did in comfort. </strong>That gave him such great joy.

The other thing that gave him joy was brethren taking courage from his boldness while in bonds. They became engaged in preaching the gospel with greater zeal than ever before without fear, Vs. <strong>“14 and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear”. </strong>Pastor Phil’s boldness to preach on the streets of New York City and the Bronx area has rubbed on me to fearlessly preach the gospel. I have witnessed him being ridiculed, heckled and threatened but that has never stopped him from preaching the gospel. Two of his buddies Ivan and Jose have gained boldness to preach on the streets because of what they see in him.

To add to his joy, he says, <strong>vs. 15-17, “15 Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from goodwill: 16 The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; 17 but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel”. </strong>There are two classes here, those who preached Christ the right way with the wrong motive and in that he rejoiced. Paul would rather have the right gospel preached the right way by the wrong people than the right people preach the wrong gospel the wrong way. There were those who were envying Paul's success, and striving to hurt him thereby. Now this would be a stumbling-block and discouragement to some. These were people who were secretly pleased when he was laid up in prison, that they might have the better opportunity to steal away the people's affections to gain to themselves the reputation he had. As the gospel was not about him, he rejoiced that Christ was preached to which he responds in <strong>vs. 18 “What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice”</strong>

Is the joy you have the kind of joy that confuses your enemies? By that I mean, whatever they try to do to silence you has no effect on you, if anything, it’s advancing Christ where you are?. Many lose joy in the midst of suffering, can we trust Christ to make us joyous in the midst of what we go through to advance His kingdom?, Paul did and may we. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Philippians 1:3-6, “3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 4 always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy, 5 for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now, 6 being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;”</strong>

Paul’s writings touched on many things such as doctrine, Christian conduct, addressing raised questions, dealing with biblical leadership among others. To the Philippians he wrote to exhort them in Christian experience. He wrote this epistle while in jail. And the drive for this message was joy (rejoice) even in hardship. <!--more-->While the church here could have been the ones to send Paul encouragement, you find that Paul being strong in his bonds encouraged them. Perhaps the church was discouraged because of what was happening to him and the thought of what might happen to them while they themselves served Christ.

What would have been the source of joy in remembering the Philippians and encouraging them of the same? First<strong> Vs. 3, “I thank my God upon every remembrance of you</strong>”. This is the object of which is God; to whom thanks is to be given at the remembrance of His name, and the perfections of His nature, and for all His mercies, temporal and spiritual. Remembrance of great things the Lord had done, the source of strength to keep his head up high. He wanted to encourage them with these words, <i>“I always think of you, you are dear to my heart and I pray for you"</i>

Second <strong>vs. 5 “for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now”.</strong> This thought gave Paul such joy knowing that his suffering was not in vain. That through Christ he labored and the Lord allowed him to hear and experience the joy in knowing that their fellowship in the gospel was still present from the first day. This ought to have also served as an encouragement to them that their joy would not be in Paul but in Christ having seen them continue in the faith in the absence of Paul.

Third. <strong>vs. 6”being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete <em>it</em> until the day of Jesus Christ</strong>”. He had done what God wanted him to do, the joy he received was that he had commended these people to God’s care trusting that God would keep them until the day He comes for them. Paul speaks with much confidence concerning the good estate of others, hoping well concerning them in the judgment of charity, and being confident in the judgment of faith that if they were sincere they would be joyous. "<b>Christ in you the hope of glory" </b>What a joy we have that He who justified us, has begun to sanctify us, and will carry on this work till glory. In the midst of hard times, I take comfort in knowing that God is at work both in me and in others around me and in that I rejoice.

He thanked God upon every joyful remembrance of them. Observe, Thanksgiving must have a part in every prayer; and whatsoever is the matter of our rejoicing ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. What we have the comfort of, God must have the glory of. He thanked God, as well as made requests with joy. As holy joy is the heart and soul of thankful praise, so thankful praise is the lip and language of holy joy.

Where is your joy, I hope in remembrance as a beginning of what God has done in your life and in others around you and with that you break out in thanksgiving. You rejoice in what you hear and you rejoice in what God will continue to do. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 1:19-20, “18 ... that you may know …, 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power 20 which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places”</strong>

A policeman has authority to execute his assigned duties because he has a badge of authority (power) to do so. People listen to him when he flashes his badge, It’s been given to him and grants him power to operate in those levels.<!--more-->

<strong>Acts 1:8, </strong>tells us of the promise of the Father,“<strong>8 But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." </strong>Each believer is to receive this power through the Holy Spirit, and this power is to be put to work. Just like the policeman is not given power to make him look good but to operate, we too have been empowered to operate. The policeman cannot do it in his own strength, neither can we. By this power, the disciples were to be witnesses to proclaim Him king, and publish those truths to the world by which His kingdom should be set up, and He would rule.

Not only that, I believe there was more this power would do in believers lives. This was also to enable believers to live in away pleasing unto the Lord by overcoming the world, the flesh and the devil. None of us have the power to live in victory unless it’s given to us. And here Paul is praying point 4.”<strong>That we may know the exceeding greatness of His power”. </strong><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">This power is for both quickening our dead souls, and preserving our spiritual life.</span></b> That this great power He exerted in Christ, raising him from the dead we be aware how much it is present in us to raise us up together because we have believed. This is dynamite, explosive power.

<strong>2Corinthians 4:7, “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us</strong>”. The treasure of the knowledge of Christ and the power by which all things consist, that power is not credited to any man, but God. And this power enables us to overcome what is before us regardless of how things are, <strong></strong><strong>2Corinthians </strong><b>4:8-18, "8</b> <strong>We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed— 10 always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. 11 For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. 12 So then death is working in us, but life in you 13 And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, “I believed and therefore I spoke,” we also believe and therefore speak, 14 knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present us with you. 15 For all things are for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God. 16 Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, 18 while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal." </strong>Only the power of God makes these possible in the life of a believer who is a witness by preaching and by living.

<strong>Ephesians 3:20, “Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us”</strong> Here is Paul ending his prayer ascribing to God’s ability and His willingness to do much more than we could ever ask or imagine but only according to the Power of the Holy Spirit at work in prayer (<strong>Romans 8:26</strong>) in us for His glory<strong>.</strong> Let us therefore expect more, ask for more, encouraged by what Christ has already done for our souls, being assured that the conversion of sinners, and the comfort of believers, and the victory of believers through this power will be to His glory, for ever and ever. Do we know this power? Is it in operation in our lives? Do we know that this is Christ resource for us? Paul’s prayer is simple, <strong>Ephesians 1:18-20, “18 ...that you may know …, 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power 20 which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places”, </strong>Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 1:18, “that you may know …, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints”</strong>

If a child was to appear in public hungry, sick and with rugged clothes, that child would not be bringing shame to himself but to his father primarily. Everyone will be asking, “<i>whose child is this?”</i> They may want to blame the father until they find out that the child may have neglected or even refused to receive everything the father has provided and in that he or she is bringing shame to his name.<!--more-->

In light of all these, Paul prayed this point 3 “<strong>that his readers would know the inheritance in the saints</strong>” and walk as children who belong that the Father be glorified in the Son. Experimentally and delightfully knowing what are the blessings which God has called you to hope for by His Word and His Spirit. And in this inheritance, Paul plugs in the word "riches" which means abundance, the immense treasure of blessedness He has provided as an inheritance for holy souls.

<b>Of course all these makes no sense until we know who we are. You cannot have inheritance unless you are an heir; for you to be an heir in this case, you have to be a son; knowing our nature, you are a slave who can only be made a son by adoption.</b>

How do we therefore know we are now sons? <strong>Romans 8:14-16</strong>, “<strong>14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15 … you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” 16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God</strong>.” Three things which confirms us as sons, 1.When you are led of the Spirit of God, 2. When the Spirit of adoption empowers you to cry “Abba, Father” which means “My Father”, 3. When His Spirit bearing witness with your spirit reveals that you are His child. This is for us to understand that those converted, or born again, are adopted as children of God; upon those adopted He bestows His Spirit; this Spirit in their hearts produces a loving trust that enables them to address God as Father. <strong>Abba, Father</strong>

For all these to make more sense, let’s look at adoption in <b>Genesis 48 (Inspired by Voddie Baucham, Jr).</b> Here is Jacob old and about to die. He is in Egypt brought by his son Joseph. Joseph is the prime minister of Egypt, he married an Egyptian and had two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. These two boys are Jacob’s grandsons who are not direct heirs of their grandfather’s inheritance, however watch what happens. Jacob begins by outlaying how God blessed him <strong>Genesis 48:3-4</strong>, “3 T<strong>hen Jacob said to Joseph: “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, 4 and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession." </strong>Then we learn why he spoke of the inheritance, <strong>vs. 5-6,  "5 And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ARE MINE</span></em>; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 6 …; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance”</strong>

Jacob adopted Joseph’s two sons, he called them his. Reuben lost his birthright<strong>, 1Chronicles 5:1, “Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel—he was indeed the firstborn, but because he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph, the son of Israel, so that the genealogy is not listed according to the birthright." </strong>And out of this adoption, they received inheritance just like the sons of Jacob being tribes also. <strong>Galatians 4:6-7, “6 And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!” 7 Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ</strong>”

<strong>Romans 8:17, ”and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, …” </strong>God in His rich grace adopts us into His family and freely bestows His inheritance on us. He not only makes us heirs, but He Himself is our inheritance and portion. We are heirs of all things which are His; we share in his love, grace, and mercy; and His wisdom, power, truth, and faithfulness etc. All things are ours who have God as our God and Father; are all represented as things to be inherited by the saints.

How Paul desired and desperately prayed that we would know the inheritance in the saints by first knowing who we are, how we’ve been made sons, what blessings He has bestowed upon us and our cry for them to be activated through prayers for His glory.<strong> 2Peter 1:1-4, “1 Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, 3 as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue, 4 by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust." </strong>Inheritance is another resource we have in Christ, may we never a shame the Father because we have neglected our inheritance. To finish, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 1:1</strong><strong>8,” the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling…”</strong>

Paul prayed 2. “<strong>for understanding that believers would know the hope of His calling”</strong>. It is with these alone that we discern the things of God. Being first opened, and then enlightened - by His Spirit. How easy it is to lose hope when you forget who is on board and who called you. I would align assurance, confidence, faith side by side with hope. <b>Hope is the expectation of good.</b><!--more-->

Christianity is our calling. God has called us to it, and on that account it is said to be His calling. There is a hope in this calling; for those who deal with God deal upon trust. And it is a desirable thing to know what this hope of our calling is, to have such an acquaintance with the immense privileges of God's people, and the expectations they have from God, and with respect to the heavenly world, as to be quickened thereby to the utmost diligence and patience in the Christian course.

<b>Luke 8:22</b>-, gives an account of how Jesus told the disciples to cross with Him to the other side. This required a boat, <strong>vs. 22-23, “22</strong>…<strong>And they launched out. 23 But as they sailed He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy”.</strong> Here was a situation that threatened their lives, a great windstorm which rocked their boat to the point that water was beginning to fill the boat threatening to break it into pieces. For a moment, they lost hope and all that they could see was death. They forgot the hope of His calling especially Christ being in the boat with them. When they came to their senses, they went to wake up fast asleep Jesus who was very comfortable in the storm with their complaint, <strong>“…Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?”,</strong> (<b>Mark 4:38</b>). They accused the Son of God for not caring. When we lose hope, it’s easy to default to accusations like these disciples. We wonder if the Lord cares, we wonder if He is present. Those who know the hope of His calling don’t have to see to believe, they don’t have to feel to know, the assurance they have is that Christ in the them, the hope of glory (<strong>Colossians 1:27</strong>). We may feel like He is fast asleep in the boat, the comfort we all need is that Christ the Son of God, God Himself can never drown.

<strong>Luke 8:24-25, “24…Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm. 25 But He said to them, “Where is your faith?”</strong> His disciples should have encouraged themselves with His presence and ply the oar of prayer rather than their other oars and accusations. Their confidence should have lay in this, that they had their Master with them; and the ship that has Christ in it, though it may be tossed, cannot sink; the bush that has God in it, though it may burn, shall not consume.

I believe the same way Paul would have wanted the readers of this letter to know the hope of His calling, to pray the same in preparations for some of the windstorms of life and to have that assurance that He who called them will never leave them nor forsake them. A number lose their peace and joy when the road gets bumpy, this ought not to be, if anything it should strengthen us that Christ is our hope. If Christ called us, He will keep us, <strong>Philippians 1:6, “being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;”</strong>. Hope is another resource in Christ, may you make this your prayer, “<em>Lord, open the eyes of my understanding that I may know the Hope of your calling in my life</em>”, to continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 1:17</strong>, “<strong>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him</strong>,”

If you are anything like me, you love for certain people to be praying for you. Not because of the eloquence of their prayers or having more power, but the content, the richness of their prayers. In this book, I would have loved to have Paul praying for me because of the content, the depth of the prayers that reminds me of the resources I have in Christ.<!--more-->

From <b>Vs. 15-22</b>, we read Paul's writing which is almost parallel to his prayer to the Colossians. This prayer is deep in the sense that it touches on something in the Lord's prayer most people neglect, "<b>Your kingdom come"</b>. This is about spiritual blessings from above effected in the believers to advance God's kingdom here on earth. <b>Matthew 6:33, Colossians 3:1. </b>God has laid up spiritual blessings for us in His Son Jesus Christ; but requires us to draw them out and fetch them by prayer.

In these few verses he gives the prayer of thanksgiving and supplication. In vs. 15, he heard of their faith and love for all saints indicating that there was growth taking place and in that he gave thanks. As you read on you find he does not stop there, he prayed 4 points I think every believers should incorporate in their daily prayers if we are to tap into the resources in Christ.

He prayed 1. <strong>For Spiritual wisdom and revelation, Vs. 17</strong>. “<strong>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him</strong>,” He is here speaking of that wisdom and revelation which are common to all real Christians, same prayer made in <b>Colossians 1:9-. </b>This wisdom is about knowing Him, discerning and making better judgments. <strong>James</strong> says <strong>3:13-18</strong>, “<strong>13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth. 15 This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic. 16 For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there. 17 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. 18 Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peac</span>e</strong>”. For this reason <strong>James 1:5</strong> tells us to ask for wisdom if we lack it, “<strong>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him”</strong>

In seeking spiritual wisdom and the revelation in the knowledge of Him, Paul evaluates what is important in his walk with Christ and he tells us what has changed and his new desires, <strong>Philippians 3:7-10, "7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; 10 that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</strong>

This prayer was to God to make believers wise unto salvation, and revealing to them the deep things of God to be pursued as new desires in their hearts. This is about the centrality of Christ in our lives. I see this with my two nieces, they could be playing with toys before them but when I show them something new, different, they are no longer interested in what they have but what I have shown to them. If they were satisfied with what they have, they could care less if there was anything else. Paul knew there was more, he therefore prayed and pursued, and he prayed for others for the same. When was the last time you prayed for the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him? This is one of our resources in Christ we cannot take lightly.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 1:3-6, "3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, 4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, 5 having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved."</strong>

The book of Ephesians is broken into two parts, the first 3 chapters are orthodoxy stressing theological (emphasizing NT doctrine) and the last 3 are orthopraxy, Christian behavior (Christian living). It’s hard to live what is expected of you without knowing by learning it first. Paul lays ground work of what believers ought to know, then he prays for the believers to know them, before he lays out how to live the life.<!--more-->

This is his letter of encouragement and admonition to the believers to remind them of their immeasurable blessings in Jesus Christ. The blessings mentioned here are way more than physical but rather spiritual. Many believers are deficient of spiritual blessings because most rarely include them in their prayers.

Believers ought to know their resources in Christ, pray they be activated and lived in Christ. We need to know that in the mind of God, our sanctification was planned before the world began, it was accomplished at Calvary; it became ours potentially at the point of repentance; it became ours experientially as we saw ourselves in union with Christ and it will be effected in us through the ages by the Holy Spirit.

And here Paul begins with the source of blessings<strong>, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ”. “</strong>Blessed” here stems from high praises to the One who deserves it and we see where we are grafted in. God's blessings is His bestowing of all spiritual and heavenly blessings upon us. Our blessing God is the paying Him our solemn and grateful acknowledgments, both on account of His own essential blessedness, and of the blessings which He bestows upon us. He is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, as Man and Mediator<strong>,… “Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ</strong>”- With all manner of spiritual blessings, which are heavenly in their nature, original, and tendency, and shall be completed in heaven. This is the reason we always should pray “<b>Your kingdom come”</b>. God is the author and giver of all blessings, <strong>James 1:17</strong> confirms it, “<strong>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning”. </strong>These are eternal essential blessings.

The first blessings I see is in vs. 4, “HE CHOSE US”, Vs. <strong>4“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love”. </strong>While this may be miss construed, it’s not us who chose Him; He did choose us before the foundation of the world that we be holy which is entirely His work. Vs. 5, “HE PREDESTINED US TO ADOPTION”, vs. 5, “<strong>having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will</strong> “. In other words, a slave was made a son by adoption that the one who has been adopted may be a partaker of the nature of the One who has adopted him, all planned by Him. <strong>2Peter 1:3-4 “3 as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue, 4 by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature,…”.</strong>

He did all these for one simple reason<strong>, vs. 6, “to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved</strong>”. As the short Westminster catechism lays it out<strong>, “Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever</strong>”. That is why He made us, that is why He is blessing us with all spiritual blessings<strong>, all "to the praise of the glory of His grace”. </strong>Do we know our resources in Christ? How does this affect our prayer lives?, to continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 2: 23, “Then he (Elisha) went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!” 24 So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the LORD. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths”</strong>

We saw how the sons of the prophets recognized the spirit that was in Elijah now present in Elisha’s life recognizing his position as God’s servant and a father figure and with great humility bowed to show reverence. While still in Jericho, even some men of that city recognized him as a man chosen by God, he performed a miracle by healing the bad water.<!--more-->

<strong>2Kings 2: 23, “Then he (Elisha) went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”,</strong> these were teenagers who were old enough to discern right from wrong. They were of the age of accountability. And by saying “go up, go up”, they may have watched from a distance as Elijah was taken and they made fun of Elisha to follow him. The repetition shows their heartiness and earnestness, that it was no sudden slip of their tongue, but a scoff proceeding from a rooted impiety and hatred of God and his prophets. These were young people who had no fear of God in them which is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10).

So what did Elisha do<strong>, vs. 24, "So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the LORD. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths” </strong>wow, that sounds severe and sounds like Elisha abused the power given to him. Let’s analyze this, he cursed them in the name of the Lord. This was a fulfillment in my judgment of the commandment <strong>Exodus 20:12, “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you”. </strong>This is the only commandment with a promise but if you read it carefully, you also discover that it has also a threat. These young people came from idolatrous city; their parents had not trained them in the fear of the Lord for they did not fear the Lord themselves. While we think it’s harsh, God demonstrated righteous judgment. This is why we must teach our young people the fear of the Lord by first never treating God casually among other things, setting the example, teaching reverence which is crucial.

Listen to Matthew Henry, “<em>Let parents, that would have comfort in their children, train them up well, and do their utmost betimes to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in their hearts; for, as bishop Hall says, "In vain do we look for good from those children whose education we have neglected; and in vain do we grieve for those miscarriages which our care might have prevented." </em>

Jesus also rebuked the Scribes and the Pharisees (Matthew 15) who had transgressed the commandments of God because of their traditions. They were more concerned questioning Jesus about His disciples eating bread without washing their hands. You know what the Lord said to them? <strong>Matthew 15:3 “He answered and said to them, “Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 4 For God commanded, saying, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.’ 5 But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God”— 6 then he need not honor his father or mother.’ Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. 7 Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: 8 ‘ These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me. 9 And in vain they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men</strong>.” What a slap in the face. These people brought curses upon themselves and their children because traded what they needed to do to embrace traditions hence neglecting to teach their young people what was important, “honor your father and mother”.

For this reason I believe, no young person can say they truly honor and serve God if they do not honor their parents. Parents should teach this commandment to their young people if they want God’s blessings and favor on their children and reverse the threat and curses that are brought about when the 5th commandment is broken. This will bring about contentment, courage, courtesy, friendliness, generosity, honesty, humility, kindness, obedience, orderliness, thankfulness, wisdom etc.

What commandments have we transgressed because of traditions therefore have exposed our young people to curses? If they have no fear and honor for you as their parents, how will they fear and honor God? Are you demonstrating the same to them by how they see you fear and honor your earthly parents and leaders? May we with God’s help pass the mantle of love and honor to them. Pass the mantle of Honor. <strong>Proverbs 22:6, “Train up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not depart from it</strong>”. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 2:15, “Now when the sons of the prophets who <em>were</em> from Jericho saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him”, </strong>

Faith by far is the greatest gift you can pass to your young people primarily by how you live it. While I’m fine with children’s church and youth ministries, I believe the greatest impact in your young people is made when they sit with you, watch you worship, pray, relate to your spouse, read, work. Why is this important? <b>Because young people learn more from your lifestyle than your words. </b><!--more-->Young people want to know their parents are real and not perfect; they tend to want to imitate their parents. <b>Parents ought to set the tone of a young person’s spiritual life</b>. How you live as a parent leads them to ask questions why you do what you do in order to learn. I also believe that by the presence of your young people, they will help you grow deeper and deeper in the things of God. Think of it this way, if you have an assignment to teach a class, would not that drive you to prepare by studying, doing research, learning a head of time? This is part of learning by teaching and being all God wants you to be before His children He has given you as talents to care for.<b> It is the parents primary job to disciple their young people.</b>

To go back to Elisha and the sons of the prophets we ask, what primarily drew these young men to Elisha? First let’s see how they came to know about Elisha, in <b>2Kings 2, </b>God was about to take Elijah to heaven. Elijah was doing final missions visiting different places and each place we are made aware of the sons of the prophets. I would speculate Elijah’s journeys was to meet the sons of the prophets who he may have been a father figure to and bid them farewell. As the Lord sent him to each place, he told Elisha to stay behind and each time Elisha said, <strong>“As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!”</strong> God sent Elijah to Bethel, Jericho, and to Jordan. All these 3 places there were the sons of the prophets. Also to note in talking of sons of the prophets, it had been revealed to them that God would take Elijah away and they became concerned for Elisha, you hear them ask him this<strong>, “Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?” So he answered, “Yes, I know; keep silent!”</strong>

At Jericho, 50 of the sons of the prophet followed them from a distance and they witnessed the miracle Elijah performed, <strong>2kings 2:8, “Elijah took his mantle, rolled <em>it</em> up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground" </strong>While they continued to walk, Elijah asked Elisha what he would do for him before he was taken away.<strong> Vs. 10, “…Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.” </strong>You have to remember the sons of the prophets are taking notes, watching Elijah pass the mantle to his servant Elisha to continue Elijah’s legacy.

Then out of nowhere the chariots come and took Elijah away and you hear Elisha cry. Though he was a servant and later a prophet, Elijah was a father to him too vs<strong>. 12-14, "12 And Elisha saw <em>it,</em> and he cried out, “My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces. 13 He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. 14 Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, “Where <em>is</em> the LORD God of Elijah?” And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed”</strong>

<strong>2Kings 2:15, “Now when the sons of the prophets who <em>were</em> from Jericho saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him”, amen, amen, amen. </strong>They recognized that this was now their father figure and they treated him with respect, they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him; in reverence of him as their master, in the room of Elijah.

The sons of the prophets saw his service to Elijah; they saw his faith in God, tenacity spirit in him. One man was faithful to God by serving His prophet and when God took His prophet away, this one man Elisha wanted to be an extension of what God had started in Elijah, and the sons of the prophets recognized that. What do you want your young people to identify you with the most? I hope your faith.

The bible says in<strong> </strong><b>Proverbs 20:7, "The</b><strong> righteous man walks in his integrity; His children are blessed after him”, </strong>he sets the tone, his children pick up his mantle when they are of age and keep running with it. I recall more of what I saw in my dad than what he said. His faith in God, his prayer life, his worship style, his love for my mom, his sacrifice to the family set the tone in my life and the rest of his children. My mom’s prayer, sacrifice, love, submission to dad, handling big family sometimes when dad was not home are things I witnessed. They shaped me. Again young people learn more from your lifestyle than your words.

We say we need prayers in schools, are we praying at home to show our young people how important it is? We say the Ten Commandments should remain in schools, do we even know them ourselves and are teaching them to our young people?. We say leave “under God” in our pledge of allegiance, but do we live as though we are under God, walking by faith?... What impacted the sons of the prophets’ were Elisha’s faith, reverence and honor for Elijah. The rest of his teachings, leadership, miracles lied on the foundation of his faith and choosing to take a harder task. <strong>Joshua 24:15, “…</strong> <strong>as for m</strong><b>e and my house, we will serve the LORD</b>.” To continue.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2 Kings 6:4, "4 So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. 5 But as one was cutting down a tree, the iron ax head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, “Alas, master! For it was borrowed.” </strong>

To continue from where we left, we see Elisha going with his disciples, students into the field to work. They have a mission to expand their dwelling place. They know it will take hard work and we see them to put to work what they were learning from their seasoned leader Elisha. <!--more-->That he was a man of great condescension and compassion; he went with the sons of the prophets to the woods, when they desired his company. Let no man, especially no minister, think himself too great to stoop to do good, but be tender to all. Good parents, leaders lead by example, many learn by observing.

<strong>Vs. 5 “But as one was cutting down a tree, the iron ax head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, “Alas, master! For it was borrowed</strong>.”, as the work continued, one of the sons of the prophets reported that the head of the ax he borrowed had fallen into the water only to be left with the handle. His cry was for different reason which shows maturity in his part Elisha would have been proud of. 1. It grieved him to lose his ax, because he could do no more work and keep up with everyone, 2. It was a borrowed ax, his aim was to take good care of it and take it back to the owner, 3. There was no cover up in his part concerning the borrowed ax, 4. There was no shifting of blame to the owner by saying he did not secure the ax head strong on the handle. 5. He was poor, and not able to pay for it, which, being of an honest disposition, gave him distress

In teaching our young people hard work, we ought to teach them to be as careful of that which is borrowed as of that which is our own, that it receives no damage, because we must love our neighbor as ourselves and do as we would be done by. This is about being responsible, entrusted with something valuable and also taking responsibility when things are not right. Today, people want to find someone or something to blame for all the wrong and we see that passed down to our young people.

This also wasn’t just about losing another man’s property, it was also learning to honor the man whose property was borrowed. When we were growing up, we were taught at home and in school that elders were to be respected not only for what they have but who they are. Elders could send young people or tell them to do something, or tell them to stop doing something and you would not hear a young person say,<i> "I will no listen to what you have to say because you are not my parent”,</i> is that not common today? In our day we would do what an elder said as long as in our conscience we knew it was the right thing to do. Today, some parents defend their young people even when they know their young people are wrong, showing a young person that it’s ok to get away with wrong. Some are not taught to obey their elders. If it takes a family and the community to raise a child, I would expect the same respect the young people give their parents be given to their elders in the community, in schools, in work places etc.

Who is going to dictate how we raise our young people? Society?, In our lawless generation, it will take parents, leaders with God fearing values, having a history of how they were raised and if they value how they were raised, they would pass to their young people what they received. This will prepare them to be good husbands, good wives if they ever get married, teach them hard work, honor etc. We lay the foundation, we teach, we trust God for wisdom and grace to raise His young people. God holds us responsible how we raise them, ask Eli the priest and Samuel the prophet in the bible. Though they were great men, they did not pass what they learnt to their sons and God held them responsible. What will you do with the talents (young people) God has given you? Pass Down To Your Young People What Made You. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 6:1-6, “1 And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See now, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us. 2 Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell.” </strong><strong>So he answered, “Go.”</strong>

How rewarding it is to sit under a seasoned leader, exactly what we see with the sons of the prophets who humbly sat under the ministry of Elisha. Elisha being a prophet of God had students he mentored echoing the mentorship he received from Elijah. <!--more-->Elisha was humble and hard worker from the beginning, he was in the family business and also known as the prophet that washed Elijah’s hands, cooked his meals and more. He followed Elijah everywhere as a humble servant even to the point where when Elijah was taken away, he requested for double portion of his spirit (anointing) upon him (<b>2Kings 2:9</b>), in other words a double portion of responsibilities by the working of God’s power in his life. He was going to continue Elijah’s legacy even to a greater dimension. We all ought, both ministers and people, to set before us the example of our predecessors, to labor after their spirit, and to be earnest with God for that grace which carried them through their work and enabled them to finish well.

Now the sons of the prophet having seen the miracles and knowing God was with Elisha chose to be under his leadership. It appears that the number grew and instead of sending others back home, they chose to build and expand their dwelling place.

The sons of the prophets were very diligent, humble and hardworking as their master the prophet. They show discernment in vs. 1 when they said, “<strong>See now, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us</strong>”. We also see humility and submission on their part; they seek Elisha’s permission as their leader to act on a solution to their good problem, vs. 2. “<strong>Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell</strong>”. We then take note of their request for Elisha to go with them, <strong>vs. 3. 3 Then one said, “Please consent to go with your servants.” And he answered, “I will go.” 4 So he went with them”. </strong>Good disciples desire to be always under good discipline. They don’t take for granted the office of a prophet leave alone abuse the powers. Instead of asking Elisha to call things into existence, perform a miracle, they seek to go to work together, willing to take pains.

Why is this passage important? It’s because we have a generation of young people not taught the reward of hard work. Things have been handed to them easily hence many have no idea what it means to enjoy the fruit of their labor, or even maintain what they are given. This quote appears frequently on the Internet and is often attributed to Dr. Adrian Rogers from 1984 in a larger series titled <strong>God’s Way to Health, Wealth and Wisdom. I</strong>t also appears as a passage in Dr. Rogers' 1996 work Ten Secrets for a Successful Family complaining that "<em>by and large our young people do not know either the importance or the value of honest labor, You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the industrious out of it. You don't multiply wealth by dividing it. Government cannot give anything to anybody that it doesn't first take from somebody else. Whenever somebody receives something without working for it, somebody else has to work for it without receiving. The worst thing that can happen to a nation is for half of the people to get the idea they don't have to work because somebody else will work for them, and the other half to get the idea that it does no good to work because they don't get to enjoy the fruits of their labor”. </em>

Parents, leaders have the responsibility to pass down to their children, students what they received. There are parents who say, “<i>I will give my children the material things I never received”</i>, sounds good but not until you ponder on how if you as a parent had everything you needed, you would have not worked hard. Sometimes the things we are trying to keep our young people away from are the things they need the most, it is what prepares them for life. One of the things I value today is the hard work teaching I received when I was young from both my parents and my grandmother. Between the age of 6-10, I could cook lunch, take care of my younger sibling, fetch firewood, fetch water etc. Was tough learning but it was all worth it, something I would want to instill in my children, hard work, learning at an early age.

If we don’t start instilling those hardworking values, we cripple our young people and their future. Elisha could not give the sons of the prophets what they would have wanted miracles, if anything, the sons of the prophets already learnt what it meant to work hard and would not abuse the office of a prophet.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 18:27, But He said, "The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."</strong>

We go through life evaluating and planning wisely. You calculate that if you do this for a period of time, you may have success (delayed gratification). Then you realize that even with wise planning things don’t turn out as you expected or planned. What gave you a fruitful promise is shattered before your eyes with no hope that anything good could ever come out of the failure. <!--more-->This begins to define where you go from here as life questions your ability to be a good wife or husband, a good father or mother to your children, or a good provider. Because of what you’ve been through, you are afraid of what your children may turn out to be as they grow older. What you thought you had mastered and had under control feels like has come to the end of the road with no answers but failure. It seems like time is running or has run out, you see un accomplished dreams due to major setbacks, all you can now see is impotency in some areas of your life and there is no way you can see things being possible. Did I just describe your situation? Then hang on tight, there is good news "<strong>all th</strong><strong>ings are possible".</strong>

Reading <b>Mark 10</b>, there is a story about a rich young ruler who came to Jesus. He felt that everything about his life was in place as he had kept most of the commandments. He had wealth and what he felt could be his ticket to salvation. When Jesus pointed to him that his god was his wealth, he went away sad. Jesus turns to His disciples and says, "<strong>How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God</strong>". They were astonished at His sayings, and He goes further to say <strong>25, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</strong> What is this all about? It's not by wealth and riches that things become possible, it’s by God’s greater hand. How many have all the wealth and have no peace, their children are on the loose running wild. If you trust in what you have, you are calling for disaster because sooner or later you will run into a situation where writing a check will not solve a problem. It cannot even buy your way into heaven; it's easy for a Carmel to go through the eye of a needle than for riches to make ways for one into heaven. <strong>This is not to discourage people from being rich but if the riches are what makes it possible for you then you have failed</strong>. God has no problem with you getting stuff; He has a problem with stuff having you.

The disciples stood there and asked, in verse 26, "<strong>Who then can be saved</strong>?”, men can't but God. This is why Jesus said with men it is impossible but not with God. I see how it begins with God and ends with God. If I am going to be a good husband, good father, good in all I do, then I can’t rely in my ability. With me it's impossible but not with God. <strong>Mark 9:23, "..., "If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.</strong>" Oh how God desires that we will believe in Him and nothing else, that we will size Him first before sizing the problem, that we will trust Him with what we cannot trust anyone else with, in turn He will turn the impossible to be possible. In Jesus final hours before crucifixion you hear Him praying, <strong>Mark 14:36, "Abba, Father, all things are possible for You. …" </strong>Jesus knew that the Father had the ability to change His fate and He chose to leave all in His hands. Can we pray the same, "Abba, Father, all things are possible with You? in light of what my children are facing, all things are possible with You; with my future, all things are possible with You; with everything that has been hard and difficult to deal with, all things are possible with You. <strong>It can only be impossible if God is not in it</strong>, <strong>NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE TO DO IT HIM OR HERSELF</strong>. Let God be God in your life and let Him melt all the impossibilities for His glory. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 28:1-16, vs. 5, "But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm" </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blog1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5974" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blog1.jpg?w=300" alt="blog" width="300" height="216" /></a></strong>

We have been created with a desire to be accepted, have a sense of belonging. Who does not want someone to say nice things about them? We all love compliments and affirmations. There is power in spoken words. It's interesting to note how you can receive 10 compliments and one criticism is enough to outweigh the 10 compliments. You shift all the energy on the negative.<!--more-->

Let’s find out how Paul dealt with a situation that could break many folks. Paul and a few people had just survived a shipwreck, God preserved them. They landed on an Island called Malta and the natives of that Island showed them unusual kindness. They then made fire for them to keep them warm just like everyone desires to be shown kindness wherever they go, a sign of acceptance. While keeping themselves warm, Paul went about collecting more sticks for the fire.

As Paul was throwing sticks he had gathered into the fire, suddenly a snake leaped off the fire because of the heat and fastened itself around his wrist. Imagine surviving a shipwreck, and out of the fire a venomous snake coils around his wrist?; we would be quick to say, Paul was having a bad day.

As you walk with the Lord, hungry for more of Him, fueling your spiritual life, it would be like putting sticks in your fire. Well do not be surprised if you see snakes leap out the fire and fasten on your wrist. If anything, only the heat of the fire can reveal them. In your life, God will reveal things that could not be revealed in any other way but by fire. Not only that, people's words and actions will leap to get hold of you. The question is, will you let their venom run through your system and kill you? The more I serve the Lord, the more I become a target to the enemy and the more I need to know to endure so do you.

<strong>Vs. 4, "So the natives saw the creatures hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow him to live". </strong>Remember these people showed them kindness, this new situation changed their mind about Paul referring to him as a murderer. People can change their minds in seconds if something happens to you or if you stumble no matter what. You cannot live by people's acceptance to make it in life. You have to know who you are in Christ to stand. Just because some people do not accept you for you does not change God's mind about you. I cannot find anywhere where God looks for votes from people to see if He should bless you or not, you are the one who needs to forget those things which are behind and press on forward with God for a blessing.

Paul already knew God was keeping him a live to serve Him. He had already survived the worse at that time compared to this challenge. Regardless of what they thought of him, he was not moved, he shook the snake off his wrist and into the fire, that is where to send everything against you. <strong>He did not care what they thought of him, He thought of Him who cared for him. </strong>Everyone was waiting for him to drop dead. In your life, something happened many are waiting to see what will happen to you, but you got to shake it off into the fire. Shake off men's opinions. Shake off confusion, frustration, bitterness, resentments, worry, fear, doubts, and brokenness into the fire. These are things that try to coil themselves around your wrist when you are adding more sticks into your fire. Don't sit and analyze the snake and see what's going to happen, shake it off at once. You do the shaking.

They waited for Paul to fall and die, the snake's bite had not effect on him, so they changed their minds about him. Paul could have sat there and tried to defend himself for not being a murderer but his actions proved he was a man of God. <strong>You may never change the minds of people even if you explain, your reaction and actions will silence their mouth</strong>.

What has leaped out of the fire to coil around your wrist today or of late sending venom of worry, doubt and fear in your system? be of good cheer it’s a sign your fire is burning therefore shake off what is holding onto you back into the fire burning Jesus name and keep living for God.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 30:11, "11 There is a generation that curses its father, And does not bless its mother.." .</strong>

Everyone has a story to tell about their mother and everyone will agree that our mothers have played key roles in our upbringing and we ought to thank and bless them. In our time children regardless of age have despised their parents. How mant sit down to think about how God through their mothers have played huge part in their upbringing. Yes they were not perfect but they gave it all. While I share on mothers, I’m not dismissing the roles of dads in our lives, I just want to concentrate on mothers on this mother’s day. Let’s see some of the blessed mothers in the bible.<!--more-->

Moses' mother Jochebed hid him when there was a decree in Egypt that all new male born were to be killed. Jochebed had a sense that God had a plan for her son and with that wisdom she hid her son in a place where he could be found and not harmed. God used Moses later mightily. Hannah prayed for a son when no one else could understand the longing and the desire of her heart. She knew her desires could only be met by God, so year after year she prayed. Finally she prayed a prayer that was to God's glory and God remembered her in her situation and blessed her. Her prayer was that God would bless her with a son and she would give him back to God. She asked for a son, God gave her a prophet. God used him mightily. How can we forget Elizabeth the mother of John the Baptist, who was born to her in her old age, John became the voice in the wilderness preparing the way for the Lord. God used him mightily. Mary the mother of Jesus, a young woman yet pregnant with destiny. She was willing to take a stand to do what she was not qualified to do, raising the Son of God. There are other mothers in the bible worth mentioning, Eunice the mother of Timothy, Samson's mother, Isaac's mother, Joseph's mother and many more. God entrusted these mothers with these children and you can see that each of them raised their children in the fear and the knowledge of God, advising, protecting, praying for them in advance, dedicating them back to God and standing by them through thick and thin. Raising these children was not an easy task and so was raising each of us.

I believe these men learnt to bless their mothers. Solomon took seriously the lessons on how to deal with parents, check out the book of Proverbs. His take on a virtuous woman, <strong>Proverbs 31:28, "Her children rise up and call her blessed; ... " 29"Many daughters have done well, But you excel them all." </strong>

Just in America, over 40 million babies have been aborted since abortion was legalized in 1973, thank God your mom and mine did not abort us. They may have never known how we would turn out yet they trusted God to raise us up in spite of. What dads could not provide because of the way they are wired, mothers did. Those days dad had to be a way to work and provide for the family, mothers took the responsibility of instilling what dads had taught. I have deep honor and gratitude for my mom and I bless her. She may have not been perfect but she gave it all. I wish I was in a position to do everything for her to make her comfortable. Do you know that many have aborted the leaders of tomorrow, thank God these women in the bible did not abort<strong>.</strong>

How does this apply to us today, many times children forget the sacrifices their mothers have made for them over the years. Some even concentrate on what their mothers should have done better. It started long time ago and that is why<strong> Proverbs 30:11, "there is a generation that does not bless their mother". </strong>Blessings are powerful and our mothers honor is in us blessing them. I don’t need to wait for mother’s day to bless my mom. You might say your mother does not deserve it, it's not about deserving, it’s about honoring God by blessing your mother through prayers, support, encouragement, time, living a life pleasing to God due to how she raised you, doing things that will not shame her name, not causing her to worry and panic in this time of her life. She has done the sacrifice, let her now sit and enjoy the fruits of her labor. Happy mother’s day. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 5:1-14, "And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and you shall be clean."</strong>

I believe in God's healing power. I believe in divine (miracle) healing or by doctors but He gets the glory. Some religions rule out God's ability to bring healing by medicine, that’s a lie I reject. We cannot limit God to what He can and cannot use. He has a lot of ways and means to heal.<!--more-->

You could be needing healing today but right in the back of your mind, you are condemning yourself thinking the reason you are sick is because of a sin in your life. To be clear,<strong> God is not the author of sickness; He is the author of healing. Sickness gives Him an opportunity to demonstrate His power and show Himself great on behalf of those who trust in Him</strong>. Satan is the author of all kinds of problems including sickness, "<strong>John 10:10, "The thief (Satan, devil) does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy</strong>. Jesus says, "<strong>I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly</strong>". This is not just for spiritual life but also physical. God desires that we may be healed for His glory. He is sovereign over all.

In my text, Naaman comes to Elisha sick with leprosy. A slave girl mentioned there was a prophet in Israel who could heal him of leprosy yet Naaman does so many wrong things before his actual healing takes place simply because he was proud and arrogant. When he comes to Elisha, he has his own idea of how he should be healed. Elisha is about to teach him that healing is far beyond praying for someone and they get healed. He sends his messenger to tell Naaman to go and wash seven times in the river Jordan.

If we were to ask, did Elisha know that Naaman was a captain? dealt with Kings? had servants working for him? instead of Elisha even coming to meet Naaman, he sends a messenger (his servant) to tell him to go and wash in a dirty river (Jordan). What a nerve!!!!. That is what is wrong with many who come to Christ today,<strong> they want to come and serve Christ in their terms</strong>! they exercise that mentality in everything in their lives including healing.<strong> Those in need of healing must humble themselves and come with childlike faith. Have faith in God, do whatever He says</strong>. Naaman became very upset and ready to go back home because he feels Elisha has insulted him. Finally his servants convinces him to go and wash after all if Elisha had asked him for something big and greater, he would have done it. Out of what Naaman was asked to do, Elisha had no gain in it, it was all to Naaman's benefit.

Finally he goes and deeps himself in the river 7 times, gets healed and has a better skin like that of a baby compared to how his skin was before he had leprosy. Now you might say his healing was waiting for him at the river, NO,<strong> the healing took place the moment he humbled himself, had faith and moved</strong>.<strong> Mark 16:17, "And these signs will follow those who believe..</strong>"<strong> miracles are the aftermath of having faith that it can be done</strong>. Naaman's victory was not in the miracle. It's like God depositing healing in your bank account. The moment you believed that He could deposit it that was your victory there, the miracle is a confirmation. Signs and wonders only follow those who have believed in humilty. It’s not how God does it, its whether He does it and He does. <strong>Have faith, that is where your healing lies</strong>. Laying hands on you and praying over and with you are the after math. Remember victory is not in the miracle, victory is in the faith you have in God. Be blessed Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 11:31, “By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace”</strong>

One of the most challenging topics to tackle for many is “faith” and “works”. The question that always arises, are we justified by grace through faith ALONE or are we justified by works; or justified by both? To answer these questions we look at Rahab’s story and how the book of Hebrews and James address faith and works in light of her story.<!--more-->

Rahab was a harlot who hid two spies in her house sent by Joshua to spy their land Jericho (<b>Joshua 2</b>). In the early chapter, you find that the two spies came in and she hid them. While the king looked for them in her house even questioning her, she lied to the king that they came but left to which they should pursue them. Later she releases the spies to go their way but before then in vs. 8, she says, <strong>“8 I know that the LORD has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of you. 10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. 11 And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath. 12 Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my father’s house, and give me a true token, 13 and spare my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.”</strong>

The bible talks FIRST of her WORKS vs. <b>1-7</b>, then we read of her FAITH in <b>vs. 8-13</b>. Now that we’ve seen her works and her faith, the question to ask, which is which? What was she justified by? The writer of Hebrews tells us that “<strong>By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace</strong>”, <strong>Hebrews 11:31</strong> and then we read in<strong> James 2:24-25, “24 You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. 25 Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?" </strong>Sounds like a contradiction doesn’t it? Hebrews says she is justified by faith apart from works,  James seems to say that she is justified by works.

There is no contradiction here; there is a harmony we need to identify. <strong>Hebrews talks about justification by faith, James then comes along and shows us that a person justified by faith will evidence their faith by works</strong>. In other words, a justifying faith cannot be without works. It’s faith that is producing works, not the other way around. This is why it’s not Faith PLUS works or faith AND works. It’s faith THAT works or faith AT work, a great difference. Yes Rahab hid the spies but that is not what she is justified by, it’s her faith in the God of the Israelites evidenced by her works when she shows kindness to the spies.

If she was justified by works, then she has something to boast of, <strong>Romans 3:27-28, ”27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith. 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law”</strong>.

Rahab's conduct proved her faith to be living, or having power. It showed that she believed with her heart, not merely by an assent of the understanding. Rahab the harlot, who was proved by her works that she was justified by a true faith

This is very crucial to salvation, why? Because of <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9,</strong> “<strong>8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast”. </strong>This is where true Christianity is different from other religions that teach you must earn your way, you must work to be saved, and you must pay your dues. True salvation and only salvation requires receiving Christ by grace through faith alone apart from works. He has given it freely as a gift. A gift you don’t work for or earn, you receive it as offered. Then when you have truly been saved, the genuine of your faith will be evidenced by works. <strong>So you don’t do works to be saved, you do works because you are saved</strong>.

Are you trusting in your good works to be used to justify (save) you? Or are you trusting in your good works and faith to save you? If any of these applies to you, then you cannot be justified. But if you come to God in repentance and faith, you will be justified through His finished work on the cross. <strong>Romans 5:1, “Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ”. </strong>And if you are not justified by faith, you are not at peace with God. That means you are at war, an enemy of God through wicked works (<b>Colossians 1:21</b>). See what camp you are in today move to the right camp if you haven’t already. When Rahab believed, she interceded for her family’s salvation. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 11:7, “By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith”</strong>

The first evangelist ever in the OT I would say was Noah. Noah was a preacher of righteousness <strong>2Peter 2:5, Genesis 6:5, says “...the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually”.</strong> <!--more-->This is one of the strongest and clearest statements about man’s sinful nature, sin beginning in the thought-life. The people of Noah’s day were exceedingly wicked inside out, and right in the midst, we are told about Noah’s righteousness by faith <strong>Genesis 6:8, “But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord”</strong>

Because he was righteous, the Lord set His grace to preserve his life, family and those who would listen to his prophetic message. He was to build an ark in God’s way as a means of salvation. Noah was a mighty good ship builder, however his main occupation wasn't ship building, it was preaching. If you read his account, you discover he was a terrible failure as a preacher by today’s standards. His wife and three children and their wives are all he had. 7 converts in 120 years of preaching, you wouldn't call that particularly effective in our day as people think. Yet he is honored because of his obedience and faithfulness to complete a task that seamed foolish and untimely by faith. <strong>Genesis 6:22, “thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did</strong>”. It had not rained so why would anyone listen to him? He was ridiculed, made fun of but still for 120 years he preached faithfully never changing the message. <strong>Matthew 24:38, “For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark”. </strong>The people in Noah’s day are the same we see today and we as the Noah’s of today must heed to the warning and warn others too.

What do we learn from Noah, a man of faith? We are to do God’s work God’s way. We are to preach the full counsel of God (<strong><em>sin, law, righteousness, holiness, judgment, repentance, hell and faith)</em></strong> faithfully to our loved ones and those we come in contact with even when it appears there are no signs because this is the means by which God saves souls. <strong>Noah's faith influenced his practice; it moved him to prepare an ark</strong>. We are called to be co-laborers with God in reaching lost wicked souls destined to hell when His wrath is poured on them on judgment day. I know in our generation there are people even believers who don’t believe in God’s wrath that leads people to hell. They say if God is love, how can he send anyone to hell? God is love; He loves righteousness and must punish sin. A good judge must serve justice, if he turns a blind eye to a crime, he is corrupt himself and should be brought to justice.

The bad news of our depravity highlights the good news of the gospel the reason we ALL must preach the gospel. To quote one of my favorite preachers Paul Washer, “<strong><em>The cross is magnificent when it's painted in the back drop of our depravity. When you refuse to teach on the radical depravity of men it is an impossibility that you bring glory to God, His Christ and His cross, because the cross of Jesus Christ and the glory thereof is most magnified when it is placed in front of the backdrop of our depravity. .., we are afraid to tell men of their wickedness and they can never love God because of it..”</em></strong>This is why we must do God’s work, God’s way (preach God’s whole counsel) if men are to make it safely to the ark of salvation. Noah never changed the message, neither should we if we want to see genuine salvation. Yes there will be rejection, but they are not rejecting us, they are rejecting God. If anything, the rejection should drive us more on our knees to pray for them. Also when we share the gospel, it’s a win win situation whether it’s received or not.

<strong>“By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household”</strong>. Noah walked with the Lord and worked with and for the Lord. May we heed to the warning moved by godly fear and prepare the ark by prayer and evangelism for the saving of our households and many because we are destined to do God’s work, God’s way in obedience by faith.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Corinthians 1:18 "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God"</strong>

There was a day  I was watching "All in the family" comedy, for those who remember the sitcom. In this episode, Archie Bunker the main character had a favorite chair he would always sit on after hard day’s work.<!--more--> No one was permitted to sit on it except him. In this episode, Mike aka meathead sat on it and broke it. He and his mother in-law tried to get it somewhere to be fixed and bring it back before Archie could find out. The try was not successful, they ran out of time. He later found out that his chair was missing and was led to the place where they had taken it to be fixed. After being fixed, someone offered to buy that same chair from him. An old chair wasn't even pretty to look at. He was offered a lot of money for it, it was tempting but after seriously thinking through, he would not trade it for money. It had a lot of memories, for example, that is the same chair he sat on when he held Gloria when she was little, reading her stories and speaking to her about life.

This is what the cross is like, a very old, not good looking cross. Not sophisticated, no wonder the gospel message is so simple many times despised. We see a lot of well-made crosses, they look smooth, well painted and worth looking at, but when you go back to the cross of our Lord Jesus, it was not smooth but it had significance. The cross was where the condemned persons were executed. It's amazing how the bible tips us on how different people view the cross, <strong>1Corinthians 1:18, "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God</strong>". To the lost it is foolishness, what can an old rugged cross be of any value to us?, it's like looking at the same old chair Archie valued. To someone else, it was just another old chair and so is to the sinner but to us who are saved, it is the power of God. Paul did not have the Lord always whisper to him that He loved him. We know that Paul went through a lot in life that in our day many would question if God loved them. I believe Paul knew that God loved him regardless of what he went through every time he looked to that old rugged cross. That is what propelled Paul to keep moving, <strong>God's demonstration of His love was displayed on the cross</strong>. <strong>Romans 5:8, "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us". </strong>I now understand why the disciples never preached the message "Jesus loves you", they preached the love of Christ by preaching "Christ Crucified".

<strong>Matthew 16:24, "Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me</strong>". Christ carried His own cross, it was not an easy cross, neither was it a pretty cross yet it had a power to show the love of God. At times He stumbled and fell carrying the cross but never did He give up on it, they mocked Him, scourged Him but He would not give up on the cross. When He died on the cross, that cross became the power of God unto our salvation. And if we hang on to our cross and follow Him, yes we may be beat up with words, we may stumble and fall and it may be foolishness to those who are perishing around us, th truth of the matter, we know it is a treasure to us knowing that it be valued. This hymn chorus paints a beautiful picture, "<strong>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it someday for a crown". </strong>The old rugged cross has a lot of memories to hold on to, it is a treasure that will one day payoff inform of a crown. If you are facing life challenges and wonder if God still loves you, look to the old rugged cross and cling to it. It has the power to keep you in line and strength to help you focus. It points you to Jesus who hang and died on it. If you can hang onto it for a little while till the end, someday exchange it for a crown. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 19:38-42, “38 After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus. .... 41 Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 42 So there they laid Jesus, ..."</strong>

In the light of Easter, may I share something about the cross. We start with an account of the burial of our blessed Savior Lord Jesus. Jesus had just died, his disciples were scattered nowhere to be found, the women including Jesus' mother were standing there helpless. <!--more-->There was no one to claim His body. He had died like a criminal among criminals; the Father had turned His face away from looking at His Son taking His wrath for our sins. And this Man who had healed the sick, raised the dead, fed the hungry, taught multitudes had no one or less people attend his funeral when He died, leave alone claim His body, but then out of nowhere comes Joseph of Arimathea.

No mention of him is made in the entire New-Testament story, but only in the narrative which each of the gospels gives us of Christ's burial, wherein he was chiefly concerned. Joseph of Arimathea was apparently a man of wealth, and probably a member of the Sanhedrin (the council that conspired to kill Jesus). According to <strong>Mark 15:43</strong>, Joseph was an "<strong>honorable counselor, who waited for the kingdom of God</strong>". He was a disciple of Jesus, only secretly. He was not on the forefront like Peter, John and the rest. He was not known for the fear of the Jews. Maybe he feared that they would stop him from going to the temple, or kill him or he was concerned of what people would think of him.

What prompted this man to come out and identify himself as a disciple of a dead Man and claim His body? I believe he died with Christ the day Christ died. His love for Christ propelled him to do something, knowing that Christ loved him first and demonstrated it by dying for him, <strong>Romans 5:8</strong>. <strong>2Corinthians 5:14-15, "14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again." </strong>The cross awakened Joseph that he no longer wanted to live for himself, or afraid of what people would think of him. He came out and identified with the Man numbered among the thieves. The bible says that he had a brand new tomb, never used. Who knows if he built that tomb for the body of our Savior Jesus Christ? While people did not believe that Christ would rise again, Joseph had faith that Christ would rise again and would need his tomb for the weekend.

Seeing His Savior die on the cross naked, battered and bruised, the wrath of God poured on Him yet He said, "<strong>Father forgive them for they know not what they do</strong>", this act awakened him. Something spectacular happened that day in the life of Joseph that he would not be silent no more. He had been secret to this point, but not any longer. While those who walked close to Christ and known by everyone to be His disciples  were nowhere, Joseph, least known Joseph <strong>"...asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus"</strong>

God raised up this gentleman to interpose in him, that the scripture might be fulfilled. When God has work to do, he seeks those like Joseph who are available to be used despite their background because they have seen the cost to appreciate the sacrifice. And for this reason, they can say "<em>I'm part of the fellowship of the unashamed. I have the Holy Spirit power. The die has been cast. I have stepped over the line. The decision has been made. I am a disciple of His. I won't look back, let up, slow down, back away, or be still ..."<strong>Author unknown</strong></em>. Have you been a secret disciple like Joseph? Picture the cross of Jesus 2 thousand years ago and let that compel you to die to everything that has led you to stay secret. The cross is the defining factor, Paul says, <strong>1Corinthians 2:2, "For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified</strong>". Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Numbers 13:30, "Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it.” </strong>

Have you ever tried to exercise faith in a situation where facts were solid? Facts stared you in the eye, closing every avenue of faith that you could not see beyond them? Facts are concrete, they are seen, they have evidence, they have witnesses. <!--more-->On the other hand, Faith stands alone defending itself and speaking in a way that if only it’s hearers would hear it’s voice and see what it sees, it’s hearers would embrace faith over facts. If we let God's promises mastered by faith break through facts, then the hearer would have a clear understanding that God's promises always negates facts for something can be a fact and not be true from God’s point of view. I will repeat the words “faith” and “facts” over and over again to drive my point home.

Moses sent 12 spies in the land of Canaan. The facts reported, <strong>Numbers 13:27, "...the land ... It truly flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit</strong>".<strong> Vs. 28, "the people who dwell in the land are strong; the cities are fortified and very large</strong>". They did not need faith to believe the facts, they needed eyes to see for themselves. Huge problem, 10 spies only came to a standstill when facts stared them in the eye. Facts overwhelmed them that they forgot about the promises of God which was to be exercised by faith. They were limited by facts, but then here comes Caleb who is not denying the evidence of facts, he understands that faith goes beyond facts. He chooses to believe God’s report. His faith is based on the promise God gave to them as the Israelites. Caleb says, vs. 30 “<strong>Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it.</strong>”

I have had facts stare me in the eye giving faith little or no avenue of escape. Financial challenges are facts along with others, but thank God for His promises are enough to generate faith that negates the facts, <strong>Hebrews 10:23 "...He who promised is faithful", Philippians 4:19, "but my God shall supply all your (my) need according to His riches in glory", 1Timothy 1:12, "...for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day".</strong> We need God's promises through the word to build our faith to break through the facts and see the promises being fulfilled. When He gave the promise, He knew there would be facts to challenge faith. The presence of facts is to stretch our faith to believe God even more and believe His report. And now He is giving us enough faith through His Word to challenge facts.

What is your situation this today? Do you know you have what it takes to challenge facts? Whose report will you believe? Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Deuteronomy 1:6 “The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: ‘You have dwelt long enough at this mountain. 7 Turn and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring places in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates</strong>

The Israelites had left Egypt under the leadership of Moses by the hand of God. They journeyed to Mount Sinai, a place where they would worship the Lord and be ready to continue with their journey to the Promised Land.<!--more--> <strong>Exodus 19:1 says “In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai”. </strong>Mark how long it took them to get there 3 months and how long it took them to stay there, 40 years, <strong>Deut 1:3, “Now it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him as commandments to them”</strong>

From a land of bondage, a land of less than enough, a land of hard labor, the Israelites were by this mountain cared for, protected, and provided for. They became comfortable, way too comfortable. Of course they were to be there for a season, they had not arrived to their destination. They had come from a land where the Lord fought for them; the time had come where the Lord would fight with and through them but they were not ready. This is where they became paralyzed. Where they were going was going to require total trust and confidence in God, they were not ready. So they sat by this mountain year after year and that’s when Moses says “<strong>The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: ‘You have dwelt long enough at this mountain</strong>”<strong>, Deut 1:6. </strong>Are we anyway different? There are people who have been in one place forever; the same prayers they prayed 5-10 years ago are the same today, excited to have left Egypt but done little or no progress in your spiritual life. Stopped progressing to God’s promised land fearing battles ahead to make it there. If you were to evaluate your spiritual life, would you find you are stagnant in your walk, no challenges, no desire to move forward?. Satisfied right where you are, complaisant, lukewarm, and not allowing the Lord to use you?, Only depending on Sunday morning church to keep your spiritual life alive. If you are experiencing any of these, you are like the Israelites who dwelt by the mountain long enough, stagnant.

Sinai dwelling was supposed to be temporary; they made it a permanent dwelling. You and I got to have something big before us that serve as a challenge to drive us to completely trust the Lord otherwise we too will stop moving with the Lord. I’m glad to be out of Egypt but I’m not bound to die by the mountain when God has revealed that there is more. We ought to turn to the One who is more than able, who has made us more than conquerors and we take Him at His word and vs<strong>. 7 Turn and take your (our) journey, and go to the mountains of (whatever your mountain is)</strong>. The following verse, tells us we are not there yet, <strong>1Corinthians 2:9,” But as it is written: “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.” </strong>

Imagine the time they wasted and so have we wasted not obeying His voice due to fear of the battle a head of us. We have battles to fight, mountains to climb, valleys to go through. All these serves as a challenge to take us far with the Lord as we bring more glory to His name. Let us examine ourselves and see where in our lives we may be stagnant at a certain mountain for too long. An let us rise, trust the Lord and move forward. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <title><![CDATA[When God Interrupts Your Life, by Evans Olang]]></title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 1:26-38, vs. 31 "And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS", 32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. 33 And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end." </strong>

Think of this scenario, a young woman is engaged to be married, she is getting herself ready, then out of nowhere she discovers she is going to have a baby. To things more complicated, the baby is not her fiancé’s. <!--more-->That was Mary’s story. Here we see a woman who is engaged as we are told, was looking forward to getting married, planning her wedding, maybe planning on when to actually have kids down the road. The timing for her and her husband to be couldn't be perfect as they paint a picture of their future together then suddenly their lives are interrupted. I remember when I was 23, I had set my life, couldn’t wait to be married, everything was running according to schedule when all of a sudden, my life was interrupted, halted and changed. It was hard to adjust to the new plan but the Lord interrupted the flow of things for a reason. When a life is interrupted, it calls for change and change can be hard when everything you planned comes to a halt.

Look at how it started with Mary, vs. "<strong>28 And having come in, the angel said to her, "Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!"</strong>. You and I would consider a favored life as a life blessed with our desires falling in place. Here we see Mary considered HIGHLY favored, the reason she was chosen. When you are in the will of God, if the Lord interrupts your life, it may not mean you are doing something wrong or being punished, it may mean He has something bigger planned for your life that will bring Him more glory. <strong>The interruption may be because He wants to impregnate you with His own destiny rather than yours</strong>. Your plans and mine are temporal, His are eternal. He may delay your plans and your response is to be obedient to His plans as Mary did. When the angel spoke to her about what was to come, instead of sharing her plans with the angel, she was willing to obey. She did not share how her fiancée would take it, or how it will slow her plans or how her people and family would think, <strong>all she wanted was to honor God in her interrupted plans</strong>, <strong>38 Then Mary said, "Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.</strong>" If it was of the Lord, the Lord would take care of the details and make things known clearly.

You may feel like your hopes and dreams have been interrupted. You had imagined by now you would have been married, had your career on the move, done with school or had kids (whatever it might be). Everyone seems to be moving ahead but you. You feel like time is running out for you. Have you considered that your life may have been interrupted by the Lord for a reason? That your desires may have been DELAYED but not DENIED? And your prayer, “Lord what do you have me do?”, Mary said, “<strong>Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.</strong>" The Lord has interrupted my life many times and in that I’ve learnt to take Him at His word as I trusted His wisdom in my plans. I found the more I yielded to His will, the more my will was refined under His will to align to His. Trusting in the Lord to live His own life through us. The Lord is more concerned about getting WHOLE of us than getting us what we want. When God interrupts, He has bigger plans. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Corinthians 3:4-6, “4 And we have such trust through Christ toward God. 5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being from ourselves, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">but our sufficiency is from God</span>, 6 who also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life”</strong>

The battle we all have is where does our sufficiency come from? It is easy to say your sufficiency comes from Christ however your talk and actions may suggest different. Sufficiency simply means adequate or enough to meet a purpose. Is Christ adequate and enough or do we look to other places?<!--more-->

At the beginning of this chapter, even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labor. Yet they understand that it’s not by their own strength or ability they are able to do it but by the power of God in them because they have considered Him sufficient to accomplish His work through them.

God’s word is sufficient , <strong>2Peter 1:2-4, “2 grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, 3 as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue, 4 by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust”</strong>. For this reason, Christ and His word does not become secondary but primary issue. We don’t look to the world and it’s philosophies to define us and how we do things, we look to Christ and His revealed word to live by and do His work. As Paul Washer in one of his messages once said, “<em>Over the last several decades there has been a mighty battle with regard to the inspiration of Scripture. But there is only one problem. When you come to believe as a people that the Bible is inspired, you have only fought half the battle because the question is not merely is the Bible inspired, is it inerrant? The major question following that must be answered: <strong>Is the Bible sufficient</strong> or do we have to bring in every so called social science and cultural study in order to know how to run a church? That is a major question</em>”. Many are turning away from the sufficiency of the scripture to embrace the worlds’ experts on how to grow a church, do evangelism, teach on marriages, raise children. Most Christian bookstores are filled with self-help books with little pointing it’s readers to study the word of God. They don’t deny that the Bible is inspired or inherent, they just don’t believe it is sufficient to address the issues that affect them and would rather turn to experts with more degrees than a thermometer. Don’t get me wrong, God may use them and has done but as a means. We believe they are instruments in God’s hand and not the source and the outcome of things.

Praying effectively, preaching, living, etc. is not about ABILITY, it is about AVAILABILITY. Example, a guitar has no ability to tune itself and play on its own. <b>The dead guitar comes alive when it is placed in the hands of a skillful player who knows how best to tune it and play it. He tunes it and makes his own sweet music filled with harmony because it is in the right hands</b>. The music is therefore not credited to the guitar but to the one who plays it. That is the same with us, when we avail ourselves, the Holy Spirit takes us, tunes us by God’s word and plays His own tune of prayer, preaching, living how best He wants us to, and Christ is exalted while God the Father is glorified. <strong>2Corinthians 4:7, “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us”. </strong>We sound better because our sufficiency is from God and the credit goes back to Him.

Confidence toward God is solid and real, as looking to Him for the strength needed now, and also for the reward of grace to be given hereafter. Any teacher, books, experts who are not turning us to the sufficiency of the scripture robs us and more so God <strong>2Timothy 3:16, “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</strong>”. <strong>Our sufficiency is from God, His word can be trusted</strong>”, blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:1, "There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit"</strong>

Devotionals are mostly to inspire and encourage, I pray these would be more than that. I pray they would be life changing, prepping us all for tomorrow’s challenges should the Lord choose to allow them to come as we go deeper and mature in the things of God. We need our foundation in Christ solidified that even in peril times (false teaching, troubled economy, under attack etc) we have a strong foundation to fall back on, truth in God’s word.<!--more-->

Resurrection day depicts the victory of Jesus over death. There had to be a death experience before there was resurrection victory. Death could not hold or contain Him, sin tried but He conquered the day death was crucified, <strong>1Corinthians 15:55, "O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?</strong> Jesus died once and now lives FOREVERMORE. He came back to life, complete and whole yet with visible marks on His body, (scars). These were marks of nails on His hands, feet, where they pierced Him on His side. I believe even the marks of the crown of thorns forced on His head and marks on His back were visible. I have often wondered how come the marks did not disappear at His resurrection. I believe serve as a reminder to us of what it took for us to be saved. Also to serve as proof to those who found it hard to believe it was Him like Thomas at His resurrection. He was wounded for our transgressions according to <b>Isaiah 53:5 </b>yet in His coming back to life He did not have wounds but scars.

Scars ought to be reminders yet many believers treat them as wounds. They go about poking their scars bringing back wounds already healed by the Lord. Are you living a condemned life over what God forgave you for and given you freedom to live for Him? The scars brought about by your history are not wounds to be poked but rather scars serve as reminders of where He brought you from. Whenever I remember my scars, I am humbled to the fact that He saw me wounded and dying in my sins and He picked me up from the miry clay when no one else could. I do not use the reminders to condemn myself; I use the reminders to thank Him even more for His finished work on the on the cross for us. I am glad that even though He saved me, He did not take away my scars (history), which brings this scripture alive <strong>Romans 8:1, "There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,...".</strong>

Those who are in Christ have their sins washed away by the blood of the Lamb. The blood of the Lamb is the only blood that could screen sin in our lives when nothing else could. The blood of the Lamb not only took care of what we did, it also took care of what we almost did and what we could have done. It took care of the past, present and future. Because we are washed clean, we might still have scars but we will not feel condemned anymore as they are not wounds. <strong>Psalm 103:12, "As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us".</strong> You might remind the Lord of your past sins, He chooses to remember them no more, He took care of them. Why not put the things in the past and look to Jesus as you desire to grow more and more in the fear and the knowledge of Him? Building your life on a foundation He has laid. Using your scars to testify to Thomas (family members, friends, neighbors) that you were once dead but now alive in Christ. That your scars are a testimony of what God can do and has done. And you live victoriously because you’ve learned that scars are not wounds to be poked. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Timothy 2:1-13, vs. "2 ..You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ" </strong>

We looked at the life of a Christian as a SOLDIER, to continue I will share on a life of a Christian as an ATHLETE.

<strong>Vs. 5, “And also if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules”. </strong>In Kenya we have a tribe the Kalenjin’s mostly known for their long distance running. <!--more-->Long distance running calls for vigorous training, endurance, and strive. Endurance does not come without proper hard work and skillful preparation. Long distance race as they call it is long, very few finish, only those who endure till the end.

It’s one thing to run, it’s another thing to run according to the rules. The marathon runners face tremendous challenges in their run, sometimes they run down the valleys, up the mountains, under the scotching heat of the sun, on rocky grounds among other conditions. They are ready for obstacles ahead, they are aware of it but their thought is on the finish line. That calls for endurance. They don’t allow themselves to be distracted on the way. They don’t let life’s challenges slow them down or even cause them to take an exit. They know where they started from and must finish the race despite the trying times.

To run the race of life one does not break God’s rules and get away with it. As the umpire of the game of life, God calls the fouls real close! Matthew Henry says, “<em>We are striving for mastery, to get the mastery of our lusts and corruptions, to excel in that which is good, but we cannot expect the prize, unless we observe the laws. In doing that which is good we must take care that we do it in a right manner that our good may not be evil spoken of</em>.”

<b>Hebrews 11 </b>gives us the heroes of our faith without hiding their scars. Dig deep in their stories and find “endurance” in their race. They were no strangers to obstacles. Part of their running according to the rules was to face trying times, even David said, “<strong>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him from them </strong><b>all</b>”, <strong>Psalm 119:71</strong> (paraphrased), we are afflicted in this race by numerous things, but we endure.

To cross the finish line is your sign of faithfulness and to get there may call for suffering. Timothy would have to comply with the ministry’s “rules,” which included the possibility of suffering, while promising a great reward. <strong>1Corinthians 9:24-27, “24 Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it. 25 And everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable crown. 26 Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air. 27 But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified.” </strong>

We therefore must endure hardship as an athlete and finish this race before us according to the rules if we are to gain a crown. When the going gets tough, don’t take exits, don’t quit the race. Don’t you realize you are far from where you started? You have gone too far to go back, you’ve gone too deep to go back to the harbor. <strong>Romans 13:11, “.. for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed”</strong> ,To finish, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Timothy 2:1-13, vs. "2 You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ" </strong>

There are a few domains Paul prepared Timothy for what was to come. Our Lord Jesus used familiar pictures and subjects to bring out great truths, and now Paul does the same with seven powerful portraits of the Christian life. I pick three for a reason. He likens a Christian life to that of a SOLDIER, an ATHLETE and a FARMER.

I wish to start with a Christian life as A SOLDIER.<!--more--> He says in <strong>vs. 2, "You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ</strong>" He does not share with him as a good recommendation but a command if he is to make it. He MUST endure hardship not as a soldier but a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Timothy’s mission “endurance”, his call “a good soldier”, his commander in chief and General is none other than Jesus Christ. A soldier is one who has counted the cost, he is commissioned, and equipped for battle. A soldier is at war which may mean wounds and suffering. Paul did not ask Timothy to do something he hadn’t done himself. He says, <strong>“I have endured hardness, now you endure it with me.”, </strong> <b>1Corinthians 11:1. Pastors and leaders must lead the way</b>

To quote Matthew Henry the commentator<em>, “All Christians, but especially ministers, are soldiers of Jesus Christ; they fight under His banner, in His cause, and against His enemies, for He is the captain of our salvation, Heb. 2:10. The soldiers of Jesus Christ must approve themselves good soldiers, faithful to their captain, resolute in His cause, and must not give over fighting until they are made more than conquerors, through Him that loved them, Rom. 8:37. Those who would approve themselves good soldiers of Jesus Christ must endure hardness; that is, we must expect it and count upon it in this world, must endure and accustom ourselves to it, and bear it patiently when it comes, and not be moved by it from our integrity</em>”

The battle is serious and a soldier cannot be distracted by entanglements of business or family affairs <strong>Vs. 4, "No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier”</strong>, I think here is where a number of believers get paralyzed, avoiding the fight. You don’t want to think of what may happen to you, to your family if you fully commit yourself as a soldier knowing that you may be a casualty. A soldier is not one known by label but one who is equipped for battle. The great care of a soldier should be to please his general; so the great care of a Christian should be to please Christ, to approve ourselves to Him. The way to please Him who has chosen us to be soldiers is not to entangle (entrap) ourselves with the affairs of this life, but to be free from such entanglements that would hinder us in our holy warfare. Those who try to avoid the battles become immature, underdeveloped, malnourished, unprepared, and disoriented. Hard times in the battle grounds break them instead of teaching them to endure as a soldier of the Lord. A soldier will endure tremendous opposition everywhere (church, family work), in addition, he does not retreat or surrender when the going gets tough.

As soldiers, <strong>“35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 As it is written: “ For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” 37 Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. 38 For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, 39 nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Romans 8:35-39</strong>.

Jesus said, “<strong>These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” John 16:33</strong>. Challenges will be there, there may be pain and suffering, and even losses may come. The truth of the matter is, we are not fighting a losing battle. I’m a soldier, in the army of the Lord. If I die, let me die as a soldier of the Lord in the battle field and on that day, He will have no trouble identifying me. Are you a soldier? Are you trying to avoid the battle field? Are you entangled with the things of this world? How prepared you are today may be your defining factor for tomorrow. When the going gets tough you stand as a soldier… To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Timothy 2:1-13, vs. "2 You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ"</strong>

The epistle of <b>2Timothy</b> are the final words of the great Apostle Paul to his own son in the faith Timothy. It's an exhortation to Timothy to stand strong in the face of insurmountable difficulties ahead. As the final writing of Paul, it is tender, sympathetic, tearful, and yet heroic and stately. <!--more-->Paul is preparing his young son in the faith Timothy for the perilous times ahead as a believer, as a pastor, as a son, as a citizen, and as a brother.

Three times in <b>2Timothy</b> the note of suffering hardship is mentioned <b>(1:8; 2:3; 4:5), </b>indicating the need for Timothy's encouragement. Paul instructs Timothy to be a "<strong>good soldier of Christ Jesus" (2:3).</strong> The whole tenor of the epistle is a note of encouragement and who better to encourage Timothy than an aged warrior ready to die. Of all the people I have read in the bible, I only know of Paul who understood clearly what awaited him in the future for the sake of the call. Right from his conversion in <strong>Acts 9</strong>, we are told, "<strong>15. But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel. 16 For I will show him how many things he must suffer for My name's sake." </strong>The other well known person we know that bore the "<strong>must suffer"</strong> was our Lord Jesus Christ. Paul was in God's will, and suffering was part of God's sovereign plan for his life. God had a wonderful plan for Paul's life, listen to that plan, "<strong>except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me." Acts 20:23.</strong>

For example, think of vehicles, they have shock absorbers for a reason. The makers prepared them for potholes they may encounter in the future. What do shock absorbers do, in a vehicle it reduces the effect of traveling over tough ground, leading to improved ride quality, and increase in comfort due to substantially reduced amplitude of disturbances. Without shock absorbers, the vehicle would have a bouncy ride. Have you ever driven on a highway or any road that was so smooth then out of nowhere you hit a pothole? These are the reasons the vehicles have shock absorbers to prepare you and the vehicle for what is to come hence reduce the impact and the damage.

<span id="__mceDel">Paul had his shock absorbers on from day one, and here we see him helping Timothy get his own shock absorbers while also preparing others too. Paul accepted the call knowing what was ahead of him. As "Must suffer" may not </span><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel">be for us all, we know as believers, we are not exempt. We are praying and hoping that we don't have to suffer but God's sovereign will must prevail for His own glory. I trust for change but if He has to take me through a different road, I ask for grace and strength to stand and endure. It's hard to pray "Thy will be done". Those who can boldly pray "<b>Thy will be done" </b>are those who have already prayed "<b>Thy kingdom come"</b>. I ask for my shock absorbers for the potholes in this journey of life. On my own I'm unable, I don't know how I would make it without His grace. </span></span>

<span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel">In the next few devotions,  I w</span></span><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel">ill pick out three things Paul encouraged Timothy with as he would face hardship in his journey ahead. Begin to seek God to prepare you for the days, years to come. The road may get bumpy, you may hit potholes with your job, family, marriage, children. I hope I'm not scaring you, that's not my intention. A good general will prepare his troops for the battle ahead. To quote Paris Reidhead, "<i>Good preparation is service"</i>. To continue.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Timothy 2:1-13, vs. "2 ..You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ</strong>

We have looked at a journey of a Christian life’s as SOLDIER and as an ATHLETE, to reflect, they all have hardships tied to their journey. To finish, let’s look at the journey of a Christian as a FARMER.

<!--more-->We are told in <strong>vs. 6. “The hardworking farmer must be first to partake of the crops”,</strong> farming is hard work but a farmer sows in faith expecting returns. No farmer I know off sows for fun. While waiting, a farmer may have to deal with weeds, insects, floods, animals, thieves, etc., Jesus gave a parable, in <strong>Matthew 13:24-28, “24…The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; 25 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way. 26 But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared. 27 So the servants of the owner came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?’ 28 He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this</strong>”. While this is in reference to true and false converts, there is a principal application we can tap into. Trouble came when the sower (farmer) fell asleep. He did the right thing, sowed good seeds, but when he stopped guarding, the enemy took advantage.

Sowing is just the beginning. He may face such tremendous challenges with his crops before he reaps. A good farmer will not sow and then fall asleep, he will be diligent to guard and fight all the enemies to his crops until he harvests. While a good farmer may deal with weeds, insects, floods, animals, thieves threatening his crops, he will not quit when the going gets tough because his life, survival depends on his labor. <strong>Psalm 126:5, “Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy”</strong>

We must first labor as the husbandman does, with diligence and patience, always watching, before we are partakers of the fruit; we must do the will of God, before we receive the promises, for which reason we have need of patience. <strong>Patience has the capacity to create setbacks</strong>. Think of Joseph who sowed good seeds of his dream only to have major setbacks for years. They threatened his life, his dreams, his destiny yet he labored with diligence, guarding, working hard, enduring through with little or no encouragement from people but only knowing God’s hand was upon his life. He sowed in tears and reaped in joy. In the end of it, everything that appeared to be working against him was actually working for him. Here is what he says in <strong>Genesis 45:4-8, “4…“I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 5 But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. … 7 And God sent me before you to preserve a posterity for you in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 8 So now it was not you who sent me here, but God;”. </strong>Those who labor for the Lord are blessed and rewarded here and hereafter. <strong>Romans 8:28, ”And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose”.</strong>

Paul admonishes Timothy to endure as a soldier, race as an athlete and work hard as a farmer while facing challenges of life. Listen to Paul’s conclusion having taken to heart what he shared with Timothy, <strong>2Timothy 4:5&amp;7, “4 But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, … 7, I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</strong>” To break it down, <i>“I Paul have fought a good fight as a SOLDIER, I have finished the race as an ATHLETE, I have kept the faith as a FARMER"</i>. Who better give us a testimony but one who has gone through it and tells us to be ready for we may face challenges in the days to come. Paul counted the cost and so should we. <strong>James 1:12, “Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him</strong>”(NIV).

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:35-39, “35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 As it is written: “For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” 37 Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. 38 For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, 39 nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord"</strong>

I often encounter with believers who question God’s love when they are facing great challenges. They sense God has left them and now they have to battle things themselves, or He is present only silent. One time while Christ was a sleep in a boat He and His disciples were sailing in, under heavy storm, they questioned Jesus’ love and care because He was a fast sleep in the boat the hour they needed Him the most while they suffered to stabilize the boat.<!--more-->

In this climax, Paul wants to remind believers of God’s love for them. He says, <strong>vs. 35</strong>, <strong>“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?...”, </strong>This does not mean "our love to Christ," as if, who shall hinder us from loving Christ? but "Christ's love to us," as is clear from the closing words of the chapter. "<em>It is no ground of confidence to assert, or even to feel, that we will never forsake Christ; but it is the strongest ground of assurance to be convinced that His love will never change"</em>, Hodge. There is nothing that you can do to make Christ love you more or less and there is nothing that can happen in your life to diminish His love for you.

Paul goes ahead to outline some of the things when believers face find it easy to conclude God’s love is missing otherwise they would not be going through any of these stuff. He says,” … <strong>Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword</strong>?”. He begins with the least and continues to more scary one. He also adds another element by which we face troubles , vs. <strong>36 As it is written: “For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” </strong>Quoted as descriptive of what God's faithful people may expect from their enemies at any period when their hatred of righteousness is roused, and there is nothing to restrain it,. Vs. 37, “<strong> Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us”. We are more than conquerers when what has been set to concur us especially to make us doubt the love of Christ is unable to convince us otherwise</strong>. We are reminded in the midst of all these, He loves us and that assurance is enough to silence the mouth of anything that appears to contradict what we know of God’s love for us. <b>God’s love brings contentment.</b>

You would think that Paul would be done describing anything that would separate God’s love to us, however he continues, vs. <strong>38 “For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come”. </strong>Another word I would use is “For I am convinced”, Paul writing to brethren in Philippi demonstrates how convinced he was.<strong> Philippians 4:11-13, “13 Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: 12 I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Every w</strong><strong>here and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 13 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”. </strong>How did Paul know the love of God even in the midst of all he was dealing with? <strong>Christ’s love was Paul’s strength</strong>. He knew the cross and every time he looked to the cross, in the midst of all, he was reminded of God’s love. That is why they preached Christ crucified, the best description of God’s love <b>(Romans 5:8)</b>

<strong>Vs. 39 "nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord</strong>”, with the final words in this wonderful chapter, with which the argument properly closes, leave us who are "justified by faith" in the arms of everlasting Love, whence no hostile power or conceivable event can ever tear us. "<b>Behold what manner of love is this?"</b> And "<b>what manner of persons ought we to be</b>," who are "<b>blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ?"</b> Nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:31-32, “31 What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?”</strong>

Apostle Paul in <b>vs. 31-38</b> climaxes his message with God’s everlasting love displayed in His working in us through Christ by the working of the Holy Spirit.<!--more-->

Having learnt all these, Paul asks, <strong>“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?" </strong>While God is for us, and we keep in His love, we may with holy boldness defy all the powers of darkness.

To live for God and to do His work, there will be opposition, however if God be for us, who can be against us. Read in these few verses that shows how we know Christ and how He builds upon the truth of His revelation and how that will always be under attack. <strong>Matthew 16:16-19, “19 Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 17 Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. 18 And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. 19 And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” </strong>This does not mean that upon the life of Peter as many believe will Christ build His church, but rather on the confession of the truth of who Christ is revealed of the Father will Christ’s church be built upon. And on this truth, there will be attack very much alive today, yet the attacks, the gates of hell will not prevail.

To go even further, He told Peter and the rest who are His and those to come that He will give them keys to the kingdom of God to bind and lose. This I don’t believe in context deals with binding the devil, but rather by “<strong>the kingdom of heaven is meant the Gospel (both doctrine and discipline</strong>)” as the keys by which believers open the door of faith to all through preaching the whole counsel of God and people are freed from the grips of satan. The office of the keys is to open the doors, or close them. On Pentecost, Peter first opened the doors and declared the conditions of which men could have their sins forgiven, be bound or loosed. And as they went about preaching the gospel, satan was on their case big time, yet in the light of these truths, satan stood no chance of prevailing against believers and the church as a whole. Satan through his agents tried to silence the gospel by killing Stephen and James, putting Paul, Peter, John in prison, however with God in control, everything the satan tried only worked as a means to fuel the fire of the gospel and he has never succeeded in containing or stopping the gospel. Who can be against us?

If God be resolved and engaged to bring us through, all our enemies must be His; and "<strong>Who would set the briers and thorns against Him in battle? He would go through them. He would burn them togethe</strong>r" (<strong>Isaiah 27:4</strong>). What a strong consolation is here! Nay, but the great Pledge of all has already been given.

This is the comfort we have vs. 32, “<strong>He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things</strong>?” If He gave His Son to die for us, it is impossible that He should refuse us anything that will help or bless us in this journey. He has nothing He values more than his Son yet He demonstrated His love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us, <strong>Romans 5:8</strong>. We resolve that God loves and cares for us, He has demonstrated it by giving the best, and what we need He will supply according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus <strong>Philippians 4:19</strong>. Therefore, there is nothing that can prevail regardless of what it is if we know whose we are. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:29-30, “29 For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. 30 Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.”</strong>

A question that I have heard asked, “<i>Is God unjust in saving some and not others?</i>” So far most lean on the side of God would be considered unjust for saving some and not others. Paul extensively addresses this in the next chapter especially using the metaphor of a potter and the clay.

<!--more--><b> Romans 9:21-23, “21 Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and another for dishonor? 22 What if God, wanting to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, 23 and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory</b>." If the potter makes the vessels out of clay and chooses to keep some and not others, does that make him unjust? Does that mean some are worthier than others to be saved? The bible declares that He shows mercy to whoever He wants to show mercy, (paraphrased)<strong> Exodus 33:19. </strong>David who knew how unworthy man is pondered on these words<strong> Psalm 8:4-5, "4 What is man that You are mindful of him, And the son of man that You visit him? 5 For You have made him a little lower than the angels, And You have crowned him with glory and honor"</strong>

All that God designed for glory and happiness as the end, He decreed to grace and holiness as the way. The whole human race deserved destruction; but for reasons not perfectly known to us, God determined to recover SOME by regeneration and the power of His grace. He foreknew us, He also predestined (predetermined, foreordained) to be conformed to the image of His Son. Jesus is our big brother who we imitate. How God does it is mind boggling, our finite minds cannot comprehend it.

Here is what David says, <strong>Psalm 37:39, “But the salvation of the righteous is from the LORD</strong>” Who are the righteous but those He makes righteous, and how does He make them righteous but by drawing them<strong>, John 6:44, “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day”. </strong>How does He draw but by the preaching of the gospel<strong>. </strong>Our work is to faithfully preach the whole counsel of God, live a sample of grace and pray for the lost. The outcome is in His hands for salvation is of the Lord.

<em>“The word “called” (as Hodge and others truly observe) is NEVER in the Epistles of the New Testament applied to those who have only the outward invitation of the Gospel (as in Matthew 20:16; 22:14). It always means “internally, effectually, savingly called.” It denotes the first great step in personal salvation and answers to “conversion.” Only the word conversion expresses the change of character which then takes place, whereas this “calling” expresses the divine authorship of the change, and the sovereign power by which we are summoned, Matthew-like, Zaccheus-like, out of our old, wretched, perishing condition, into a new, safe, blessed life</em>”, Jamieson, Faussett, and Brown. <b>It's by His gospel and His Spirit are we called.</b>

“…<strong>whom He called, these He also justified </strong>…”, this is the state of being brought into the definite state of reconciliation already so fully described. Justification is not what we do but what God does for us, declaring us not guilty. Our sins are blotted out because the demands of the law were satisfied by Christ on the cross when He said it is finished.

<strong>“…and whom He justified, these He also glorified.” </strong>This is the final stage of our salvation, when Christ glorifies believers in heaven.<strong> “Christ in us, the hope of glory”, Colossians 1:27. </strong>These are made heirs of eternal glory. As stated by a writer Godet, “<em>the purpose of the whole passage may be expressed as follows: "I see thou dost love God; art a believer; I therefore decree of thee that thou shalt become like my Son and be glorified with him."</em> The steps by which this is accomplished are calling, justification, and final glorification by the Holy Spirit actively in operation.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:28, “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. “</strong>

Besides <b>Jeremiah 29:11</b>, <b>Romans 8:28</b> is another verse many love to quote. I wonder sometimes if we fully grasp the verse to then apply it correctly. As we know this is true, I am a believer and some may disagree that it’s not the devil in control of a believer’s life to be chased around, but rather God is in control and we therefore yield to Him. <!--more-->Yes the enemy may start and even frustrate a believer, but he is not in control. God controls the thermostat of all things, and if He lets it happens, it will all work good for His own purpose for His glory. This should be a drive for believers to constantly be in submission to God first then resist the devil and he will flee <strong>James 4:7</strong>. While I see many Christians trying to cast the devil and chase him away, I see wisdom in James words when he says submit to God, then you don’t cast out the devil but rather resist him.

If we submit our understanding to the truth of God; submit our wills to the will of His precept, the will of His providence, He is ready for our good. If we yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on the whole armor of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Let us then submit to God, and seek His grace and favor; resisting the devil. Faith, humble prayers, and heavenly wisdom are the weapons of resistance. According to Jamieson, Faussett, and Brown, <em>“Submit” is a language taken from warfare. "Submit" as a good soldier puts himself in complete subjection to his captain. "Resist," is to stand bravely against”</em>. You can only resist because you are submitted. I love what David Wilkerson told a woman who came to him to tell him of how the devil was after her home, his response to her, <i>“who let him in?”</i>

If then a believer in the light of these words know that it’s not the devil in control when he is going through hard times, he will take comfort in these words. vs. <strong>28, “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose”. </strong>This verse becomes clear in the light of vs. 26 and vs. 27 which addresses the work of the Holy Spirit in our praying who helps us pray as He searches our hearts. Those who love God and are called according to His purpose, everything will work for good. I notice something here also, it does not say it will work for THEIR good but rather it will work FOR good, whose good is the question. <strong>In my judgment this verse addresses more than things working for our good in the long run, but rather it works for good in us if it accomplishes His purpose regardless of the outcome in us. </strong>All works to make God’s name great and advance His kingdom, and there in lies our joy something God is after.

<em>“Now that all things do work together for good, the saints "know," and are firmly persuaded of; both from the word and promises of God, and from the instances of Jacob, Joseph, Job, Stephen, John the Baptist, and others, and also from their own experience. Whether in things temporal or spiritual, work "together," and make an intricate woven work in providence and grace; which will be viewed with admiration another day: one copy reads, "God works together," or "causes all things to work together for good"; and so the Ethiopic version, "we know that God helps them that love him, to every good thing": and to this agrees the Syriac version, "we know that to them that love God, he in everything helps them to good"; and certain it is, that God is the efficient cause, that makes all things work together for his people's good. The persons to whom all things work together for good, are described as such”,</em> John Gill. A believer’s submitted life is in God’s sovereign control at all times regardless of whether things are going right or wrong, and all will work for good to accomplish His purpose. Whether we understand it or not is not the big issue, the issue is, in whose hands are we in. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:26-27, “26 Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 27 Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God”</strong>

The continuous theme of <b>Romans 8</b> is presence and the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer. And while we groan and travail, we see His continuous work in helping our weakness as He also intercedes for us.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 26, “Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought,…</strong>”. This is one of the most comforting verses in my judgment in this chapter having learnt that prayer is the nucleus that holds all things together. <strong>James 5:16, </strong>tells us<strong> “…The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”, </strong>this is only possible when the Holy Spirit is present<strong>. </strong>It’s one thing to pray, it’s another thing to pray effectively. The disciples desired to learn how to pray effectively so the Lord gave them the guideline by which the Holy Spirit would pray effectively through them. The Lord’s prayer puts everything into perspective, covering everything we should cover when we pray. Yet in all these, we are weak without the Holy Spirit to do it. Paul tells us in <strong>Philippians 2:13, “for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure</strong>”. The will and the ability is of God through His Son by the power of the Holy Spirit.

While we are waiting in hope, but suffering, the Spirit is a helper of our weakness. He not only strengthens us, but helps us in prayer. We often do not know in our ignorance how to pray what is best. In this He enables us to pray the will of the Father rather than our own. <strong>James 4:3, “You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures”. </strong>He strips us of anything that takes Christ off our focus and positions the spotlight back on Christ when we pray. This is especially true in the times of the greatest trial, our focus at this time would be woe me and how do I get out. In <b>Matthew 26</b>, three times Jesus prayed that the cup of the wrath of God would pass Him and three times He yielded to God’s perfect will. Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost and power, He depended on that power to bring Him through completely yielding to God the Father.

<strong>Vs. 26. “…but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered</strong>” Observe the climax: The creation groans; we ourselves groan; the Spirit himself groans. As Jamieson, Faussett, and Brown writes, “<em>as we struggle to express in articulate language the desires of our hearts and find that our deepest emotions are the most inexpressible, we 'groan' under this felt inability. But not in vain are these groanings. For 'the Spirit Himself' is in them, giving to the emotions which He Himself has kindled the only language of which they are capable; so that though on our part they are the fruit of impotence to utter what we feel, they are at the same time the intercession of the Spirit Himself in our behalf”. </em>This is all about travailing

<strong>Vs. 27, “Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God”.</strong> As the Holy Spirit is groaning for us and in us, He does not distract from the will of the Father. As the Searcher of hearts, He watches the surging emotions of them in prayer, and knows perfectly what the Spirit means by the groanings which He draws forth within us, because that blessed Intercessor pleads by them only for what God Himself designs to bestow. Just like the dock does not move closer to the boat but rather the opposite, so is the Holy Spirit interceding for us moves us closer to the Father’s will. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:18-22, “18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19 For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God. 20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; 21 because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now”</strong>

In this following verse, <strong>vs. 18 “For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us</strong>”, Paul places suffering and glory side by side. In this does a believer take comfort that the suffering of any kind (persecution, loss, sickness etc.) is for a time. It's not bound to last forever. By this word is meant not only exceeding sorrow, but also the fruit that follows from it. There is no worldview that addresses the dilemma of suffering and provides comforting answers like Christianity. It makes hope, the expectation of good to all those who are weary from its burden.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 19, “For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God. 20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; 21 because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now</strong>“. I consider this as one of the purposes God has given us the miracle of birth to demonstrate how in agony, labor pains, discomfort and even suffering for a while there is hope of a new life ushered into the world. It’s an experience with an expectation, and what a mother goes through at that point cannot be compared to the joy of holding that baby when it’s all been said and done. There is an earnest expectation, parents eagerly waits, the mother groans and labors with birth pangs, the delivery is the revelation of what has been concealed for such a time as this.

<em>“The world is in travail, groaning for deliverance. That it is in travail is certain; there is unrest and crying for deliverance everywhere. It may not understand its trouble, nor even what it wants, but the meaning is that it is fallen, its wishes frustrated, and it is sighing for deliverance. These groans and sorrows are a prophecy of a time of deliverance when "there shall be a new heaven, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."</em> B. W. Johnson's

The comforts of the saint in the midst of suffering are now given: (1) The hope of glory for which all creation, ruined by the Fall, is looking forward for. (2) The present help of the Spirit and a taste of what is to come. (3) The overruling providence of God for the very meaning of hope is, the expectation that something now and future will become present. <strong>2Corinthians 4:17, “17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” 1Peter 1:6, “In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials”,  1Peter 4:13, “but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy”., </strong>To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:12-16, “12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors—not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 13 For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” 16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God”</strong>

The life of a Christian is a life owned, governed and led by Christ. Not only is Christ our Savior, He is also the Sovereign Lord over our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin to obey it’s lusts, we are now slaves to righteousness. Paul says<strong>, Vs. 12, “Therefore, brethren, we are debtors—not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh</strong>”. We are indeed debtors but not debtors to the flesh, we owe it all to Jesus not to repay for what He has done, but a life of gratitude for what He has done. Once we were sold under sin (<strong>Romans 7:14</strong>); but now that we have been set free from that hard master and become servants to Righteousness (<strong>Romans 6:22</strong>), we owe nothing to the flesh, we disown its unrighteous claims and are deaf to its superior demands.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 13, “For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live</strong>”. This is about who is the master. If you are no longer a debtor to the flesh, then you no longer live in its bondage but rather you live by the Spirit that gives you the drive and the ability to mortify (put to death) the flesh. The apostle is not only telling us what we are not under, he also encourages us to fight and not be entangled by the things believers have been freed from. In other words, “<i>if you do not kill sin, sin will kill you”.</i> This is the reason the life of a Christian is a battle, a battle to stay free by the power of the Holy Spirit we yield to.

<strong>Vs.14,”For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God”,</strong> the previous verse apostle Paul speaks of the Spirit of God as simply the power through which believers mortify sin. He now speaks of the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit who leads believers, giving them identity, a confirmation that they belong. The Spirit of God leads from sin and from a dependence on self. He leads to the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, and to the fullness of grace in Him; into the presence of God.

<strong>Vs. 15, “For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.”</strong> Many outside the Christian circle see a Christian life as a life of bondage, however, those who are not saved are the ones in bondage. The Spirit received at the time of conversion is not a Spirit of bondage but a freeing Spirit. I believe this is seen clearly in <strong>Matthew 11:28-30,</strong> which reads <b>"28 Com</b><strong>e to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is light</strong>.” What appears to be a yoke and a burden is light.

In the light of this freedom, we cry “Abba, Father” who has adopted us. As a Father, His aim is not to put on us things that lead to destruction but things that lead to freedom. We find comfort in knowing that we are His children and He loves us and, <strong>Vs. 16-17, “16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together”,</strong><em> “The testimony of our own spirit is borne in that cry of conscious sonship, "Abba, Father"; but we are not therein alone; for the Holy Ghost within us, yea, even in that very cry which it is His to draw forth, sets His own distinct seal to ours; and thus, "in the mouth of two witnesses" the thing is established. The apostle had before called us "sons of God," referring to our adoption; here the word changes to "children," referring to our new birth. The one expresses the dignity to which we are admitted; the other the new life which we receive. The latter is more suitable here; because a son by adoption might not be heir of the property, whereas a son by birth certainly is, and this is what the apostle is now coming to” ,</em>Jamieson, Faussett, and Brown commentary<em>. </em>To continue, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:9-11, “9 But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His. 10 And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 11 But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you”</strong>

The mark of a true believer is the evidence of the Spirit of God indwelling and at work in him as seen in the fruit he displays. If the Spirit gives life, then He will continue to work in a believer’s life. The one controlled by the Spirit indicates that he is under a new government.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. "9 But ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit…”.</strong> It has just been shown that he who is under the sway of his fleshly passions is at war with God cannot please Him, and is spiritually dead. But the Christian is under the influence of the Spirit if the Spirit of God dwells in him. He does dwell in him if he is a new creature, "<strong>minding the things of the Spirit</strong>."

Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His<strong>.</strong> The proof that we have this indwelling Spirit is that we "mind the things of the Spirit and bear its fruit”. We are grafted in Christ the true Vine as the branches. Our life sustenance is from the life source, Jesus Christ. Observe that the Spirit is spoken of in this verse both as the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Christ.

Vs. <strong>10. “and if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin…”</strong> Christ is in us by His Spirit. Notice that the indwelling of the Spirit of God, having the Spirit of Christ, belonging to Christ, having Christ in us, are all varied expressions of the same great fact<strong>.</strong> Our bodies have died physically because death came into the world through sin. “…<strong>But the Spirit is life”, </strong>our spirit is made alive by union with Christ, and partaking of His righteousness.

<strong>Vs. 11” But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you”. </strong>To quote B. W. Johnson's commentary, “ <em>That Spirit in us is a pledge that God will raise us, even as Christ was raised from the tomb. Though the body be doomed to death "because of sin," it shall be "quickened" for those who have God's Spirit dwelling in them. Even our mortal bodies shall be raised, not in corruption, but in incorruption”.</em> <b>1Corinthians 15:42-45</b>, <strong>“ 42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. 43 It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. 44 It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. 45 And so it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit</strong>”

<strong>Ezekiel 36:23-27, “23 And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord,” says the Lord God, “when I am hallowed in you before their eyes. 24 For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land. 25 Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them”</strong> to continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:1-4, Vs." 1 There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit"</strong>

Paul spends time in this chapter to talk about the privileges the children of God have through the Spirit. 23 times he mentions Spirit and Spiritually to bring to light the fact that a Christian life is a spiritual life lived by and in the Spirit.<!--more-->

The apostle having discoursed largely in <b>chapter 7</b> concerning the struggle and combat believers feel within themselves, he opened the true causes and reasons of the saints' grievances and dilemma, and what gives them the greatest uneasiness in this life. He proceeds to encourage believers of the solid ground and foundation they have of spiritual peace and joy in Christ. This rises from their justification and adoption, the purposes and decrees of God, and particularly the everlasting and unchangeable love of God in Christ, the source, spring, and security, of all the blessings of grace.

In this chapter he opens with these encouraging words, vs.1,“<strong>There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit”. </strong>The “Therefore” points to the argument of <b>chapter 7</b> which shows that in Christ we are delivered from sin and from the curse of the law. “…<strong>now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus…”, </strong>these are the people who have died with Christ and have been raised with Him and in Him. They have in Him satisfied the demands of the law hence they are no longer under its control. Before salvation, we were married to the law as Paul indicates in <b>Romans 7:1-6 </b>and bound to the law as long as we lived (how a marriage works). When we died in Christ, the law had no dominion over us anymore and therefore could be married to Christ, and in this, there is no condemnation or guilt. In this, we no “<strong>do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit</strong>”. We have a new master, with new desires and we therefore yield in obedience to His leading and guidance.

Vs. <strong>” 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death”.</strong> The law of the Sprit as John Wesley beautiful declares is “the gospel” which has freed us from the law of sin and death, the mosaic law. <strong>Vs. "3 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God <em>did</em> by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: …”. </strong>Note this, the law was not weak, it was only weak through the flesh. The law could only point the disease but could not cure. Like a mirror, it could only show the true nature of sin with no ability to clean. It was incapable of conquering our evil nature and that is why God sent His own Son in the likeness of the sinful flesh to be the perfect sacrifice to satisfy the demands of the law. <i>"</i><b><i>The law giver was the law keeper that He may justify the law breakers</i>", </b>Paris Reidhead. <strong>All that God has commanded in the law is all He has provided in the gospel.</strong>

<strong>Vs. 3, “…Condemned sin in the flesh</strong>. To "condemn" is to sentence and to devote to destruction. As B.W. Johnson in his commentary writes, “ <em>Sin is condemned, (1) By the spotless life of Christ. In the flesh he was without sin. (2) By his death for sin our past sins are forgiven. (3) By our vital union with his death and life we rise to walk in a new life, with a new spirit, and hence, not under the power of the flesh. </em>

<em>vs. 4. “<strong>That the righteousness of the law”.</strong> The righteous demand of the law, its substance, is a loving obedience to God. By the Gospel the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts through the Spirit. Hence, we comply with its righteous demands when we walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. To walk after the flesh is to obey the dictates of the flesh; to walk after the Spirit is to obey its dictates. It dwells in the believer to help him, but its dictates are found in the "words of the Holy Spirit."</em> To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 4:23, "Keep (guard) your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life</strong>".

In the sea of life, there is so much to learn in all ways, this includes in marriage too. So many of us want good marriages and it scares us to death when we think of "what if it does not work as we expected it". I would say I have heard more negativity about marriages than good and makes me wonder then I stop and look at the thriving marriages and I ask myself, what is their secret?. <!--more-->The more I wonder, the more I research, the more I want to learn, the more I want to exercise. Some things I have learned already is that, lovely marriage requires ACTION and ATTENTION. I discover that one the deadliest disease that kills marriages is withdrawal, lack of acceptance.

Think of this, "<strong>the feelings of love towards your spouse in marriage will ALWAYS require your attention</strong>". As my pastor preached on "reclaiming the virtue of love" sometimes back, we learnt that in the bible, love always goes with service. So when I say "I LOVE you" in actuality I mean "I SERVE YOU". <strong>This is an investment that yields high returns</strong>. This will happen through three things, TREASURING, GUARDING and NURTURING.

TREASURE is considered precious and valuable. For you to have a successful marriage, you have to learn to treasure your spouse. You have to see her/him as precious and valuable in your life and in your marriage. The moment you stop treasuring, there will be an element of withdrawal. There is a great need of acceptance as to who he/she is. Loving (SERVING) him/her in in a language he/she understands rather than a language you understand. This goes far beyond feelings. Serve your spouse by treasuring him/her.

GUARD is to protect from harm. You can only guard what you treasure. <strong>Proverbs 4:23, "Keep (guard) your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life</strong>". You can guard by what comes out of your mouth. We can be together and still feel vulnerable and exposed. Wives want to feel safe and guarded in the presence of their husbands. Harsh words springing from the heart fueled by anger strips that protection a wife craves for. Wives on the other hand can guard the self-worth their husbands need. A husband's number one supporter is his wife, the moment a husband feels exposed to critical attacks rather than being guarded by encouragements, there can be withdrawal. Who else can believe in him like his wife? How often do we hear husbands thanking their wives for believing in them and encouraging them to make it? You can serve your spouse by guarding him/her

What you TREASURE and GUARD requires NURTURING. NURTURING is the ability to help grow or develop. This is investing even more as you realize that you are not bound to stay in the same place forever. A travel in this life leads to discovery every day. Dreamers who want something better therefore they look for ways and avenues to explore as they discover more. Marriage is also a daily discovery. As a gardener nurtures the growing flower, digging around it, watering it, the gardener is giving the flower a chance to unfold it's inner beauty that would not come if not nurtured. You can nurture hope, the expectation of good even in the midst of tough things. You can serve your spouse by nurturing him/her.

Treasuring, guarding and nurturing are some means of loving (serving). If married or in a relationship, ask yourself, do you treasure your spouse, marriage? Do you guard by all means? Are you nurturing each other that you may blossom even more? There is still more work to do, serve each other.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 20:3, "...God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, "Indeed you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife." </strong>

I know that what God has joined together, He takes that move seriously. He takes care of that which He has started. I wish many more people would take marriage seriously like He does. <strong>Proverbs 18:22, "He who finds a wife finds a good thing, And obtains favor from the LORD</strong>". Let's see what favor one obtains from the Lord when he or she is married.<!--more-->

The story of Abraham and his wife fascinates me. The bible talks about Abraham being 75 years old in Genesis 12 and just like women's age are not always disclosed, the bible does not give us Sarah's age and all the women said, "AMEN". We can definitely rule out that she wasn't very young as her age was not far from Abraham's. What amazes me is that even at her age which could be around 60's, she was still pretty, good looking, beautiful, a knock out. <strong>What does this mean, that which God has started, He preserves the wife of your youth</strong>. <strong>Psalms 103:5, "Who satisfies your mouth with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's</strong>". You will agree with me that there are certain people you went to school with who look aged, why? because some worry has caused them to age quickly. When you are in the Lord and you are a touched to a bless Vine, your beauty will always shine cause He will be renewing you every day for your husband.

Abraham in Genesis 12 comes to Egypt with a beautiful wife and he knows that the people of Egypt might kill him and take his wife. So he makes an agreement with her to pretend to be his sister. Pharaoh tries to take Sarah to be his wife and God brought so many plagues and calamities in Pharaoh's kingdom. <strong>Another favor, God will protect the married</strong>. I see Abraham's little weakness not being able to stand strong to defend his wife, but God goes ahead to fight for his wife. I know many feel scared that someone would pounce and hit on their wives. Scared that someone could snatch them away but I believe God will protect when husbands release their wives in God’s hands. After 15 more years, Abraham is now 90, comes to Gerar, Abimelech's territory and Sarah is still the bomb. Once again Abraham agrees with her to call her his sister. Abimelech desires to take another man's wife without knowing. Watch this, <strong>Genesis 20:3, "...God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, "Indeed you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife."</strong> When Abraham could not fight and defend his wife God did and would not allow any man to touch his wife. Someone might say, "It seems as if God is only fighting for the women, how about those men who also find themselves in situations". Abimelech launched a complaint saying that Abraham deceived him into thinking that Sarah was his sister. Had he known, he would have not desired someone's wife. I love God's response<strong>, Genesis 20:6, "And God said to him in a dream, "Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her</strong>". Wives, God will protect your husbands from sinning against God. He will bring His convictions, lead them in the right track that all his attention will be on no one but you. Even if you are not married yet Abraham, know that God is protecting your Sarah somewhere and no man will lay his hands on her for God is saving her for you. If you are Sarah, know that God will protect you from predators like Pharaoh and Abimelech keeping you safe and sound for your Abraham.

Your youth can be renewed every day because you've learned to trust God with your companion. Instead of worrying on what could happen to the one you love and who could be eyeing him or her, you got to keep praying for one another to keep you safe and sound. Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 4:32, "And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you"</strong>

Sometime back someone said something he considered a joke, he said, "when a man is in a a relationship with a special woman he plans to marry, the right time comes where he proposes and places an Engagement RING in her finger.  On the wedding day, they exchange vows topped with wedding RING, then right after according to many men suffeRING begins. <!--more-->It was funny and we laughed  however later when I sat down to think about it, I wondered, is that what most men think of marriage as  suffeRING?

I want to present us with a ring that will replace the so called suffeRING and that is the <strong>CaRING</strong> very necessary in a marriage. It is easy to try and show that you care for your spouse in the presence of everyone, however does it happen the same at home, in the absence of everyone, would you be the same out there as you are in your home? The amplified version says  in <b>Ephesians 4:3</b><strong>2, "And become useful and helpful and kind to one another, …"</strong>. Three words used "USEFUL", "HELPFUL" and "KIND", all falling under "CaRING". How can you show you care if you are not useful, helpful and kind? You will only be deceiving yourself. Being useful mean always ready for service and being advantageous to your spouse and not become a burden or liability in things you are capable doing. Helpful would be to render assistance or service as sign you care. Kind is you being considerate.

This is just a small encouragement to us in those little things we at times forget to do for each other to show that we care. Remember that you and your spouse are one. CaRING is having a tender heart and not rigid heart. A heart of flesh and not a heart of stone. Stony hearts bounce things off, tender hearts accommodates, absorbs, evaluates, is willing to change, willing to learn. Tender to me would also mean, a prepared heart already worked on. Out of this tender heart, forgiveness also flows. If you have a CaRING heart, even forgiving your spouse who has wronged you or you asking for forgiveness when you have wronged becomes easy.

In the light of CaRING, we can change the course and the direction of our marriages  because we are not looking at it as SuffeRING as some do but CaRING as God would want us to do. Our marriages are what we make it. Today, think about the last time you gave your spouse a CaRING then start to undo what you have done and start doing what you have not done. With this CaRING, I vow to...(fill in your neccessary blank), blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:13, "Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for his friends".</strong>

Remember when you would imagine growing up, schooling to have the job of your dream, marrying the woman or the man of your dream? You kind of imagined how it would be like, you played husband or wife with the toys that were given to you? Now you are in marriage, it's not like what you anticipated, you've discovered it is hard work. A lot of life adjusting styles and you have to make changes beause CHANGE IS ALWAYS A CHOICE ACCOMPANIED BY COMMITMENT. Someone said, “Marriages are made in heaven but they are perfected here on earth”. It’s a school of learning.<!--more-->

<strong>What if marriage was not created by God to make us happy but to make us holy, how would you approach it</strong>? Marriage is two best friends (a man and a woman) who have decided to be joined together in a holy matrimony by God through His chosen people. The bible says that, <strong>Mark 10:9, "Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate." </strong>This is not just people outside but even people in that marriage covenant. It's God's seal and honors the commitment. I have been married for 2½ years now and I keep praying for strength <strong>to lay my life down for the sake of the one I love. </strong>That is what marriage is, laying your life for the rest of it for the sake of someone else. Jesus taught us what marriage is like when He as the Groom laid down His life for the sake of His friends. He laid aside His majesty, giving up everything for the sake of those He loved but never forced His bride to love and follow Him. A Christian teacher said something that was breathtaking, he said “do you realize that in the bible wives are not commanded to love? Why is that, they are created to love, on the other hand, husbands are commanded to love” Wives are commanded to respect their husbands. As a husband desires respect so does the wife desires to be loved.

Marriage is based on trust, if you don't trust your best friend, you have a weak foundation. Excessive conflicts tend to put a marriage in a bad shape. Actually the enemy tends to use these for his advantage. He knows power is multiplied and not added when couples come together through prayers and reading of the word. He knows that if He can bring excessive conflicts, instead of couples joining forces to fight him, they will be fighting each other. <strong>Marriage should be a win win deal, if it's one sided, that is domination</strong>. Unrealistic expectations cripple marriages. It's not about winning an argument, you could win one but put a relationship in put in jeopardy. It's about taking time to deposit in each other's accounts. How can you withdraw what you've not deposited? Many breakups takes place because when two people came into a relationship that led into marriage, they came with their accounts full but as time go by, they withdraw from each other's accounts without depositing. When the accounts became empty, what is there in the relationship to live for?

I believe God created marriage to help His people understand His love towards the church and to help one another live a life pleasing unto the Lord as we deposit in each other with a desire to help them be better in the site of the Lord. <strong>Laying down your life would be a heavy price to give up, the payoff is personal growth and the opportunity to develop a wonderful and supportive relationship </strong>where there is the art of helping each other put God first, working and building together, forgiveness, honesty, gentleness, humility, submission, responsive, loving, affectionate etc. To love is to lay down your life.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 2:25, "And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed"</strong>

<strong>Marriage is the primary relationship and institution where in it we can most fully know the love of God</strong>. It's a place where respect for each other's thoughts and feelings can be instituted. I believe with all my heart that there are certain ministers whose ministries can never be complete without having a companion alongside them in their ministry.<!--more--> Your wife or husband is your greatest and number one ministry. If you cannot be effective in ministering to the one God has joined you to, how will you be effective outside that boundary?

So why do we have many problems in marriages today? <strong>Communication is one of the greatest developing tools in marriage</strong>. Terrified of communicating, bad communications, miscommunications, misunderstandings tends to cause problems in relationships. <strong>Most of us are afraid of revealing ourselves, showing what is truly inside our hearts and minds</strong>. I am terrible at times in communicating certain things I need to. I hate to be misunderstood or say the right thing the wrong way. <strong>Many have problem communicating because they operate on the level of assumptions about each other based on previous experiences and conversations</strong>. It's thinking and feeling that the other person knows everything you are trying to communicate without actually doing it. <strong>Deep love responds to deep sharing</strong>, <strong>being opened and not afraid of being yourself</strong>. How we communicate will result to how it will be received. You could be saying something good and true but how communicate it matters a lot. You could be yelling and screaming trying to make a point but that would not help. Nagging and constantly pinpointing and dwelling on someone's faults and weakness is not "<strong>building communication"</strong>. We are to build each other with our words and actions. The bible says, "<strong>A married woman's is concerned about the affairs of this world, how she can please her husband and the bible instructs husbands to be considerate to their wives, loving them and treating them with respect for this is pleasing to the Lord</strong>" (paraphrased)

Jesus was open in His communication to mankind. He did not withhold anything that His bride needed to know. And when they crucified Him naked, He wasn't ashamed because He was demonstrating His love towards His bride. <strong>Genesis 2:25, "And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed",</strong> I'm not talking about physical nakedness, I'm talking about being real, opened to the one you love without feeling ashamed. Knowing that the one you love will accept you for who you are, and love you unconditionally as you learn to communicate freely. Through genuine communication and companionship, the result from continued choices of behavior of both individuals in partnership will experience something more of what God means when He says He is with us. <strong>You can be the voice of God sometimes for your husband or wife in giving guidance and direction</strong>.

The relationship will grow, the love will flourish, and the marriage will reflect something more of the nature and the character of God to the world. It will affect you even at your place of work and how you relate to people why? because there is joy in honest communication and genuine companionship. <strong>We are choosing to live more fully through the acceptance of another person who knows us intimately simply because we are both naked and not ashamed</strong>.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 29:15-30, vs. 18 "Now Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, “I will serve (labor) you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.” </strong>

For those who are in love or have been in love at some point will agree that there is a level of service you do for the one you love. It's not out of obligation or guilt but out of the abundance of love flowing from within expressed. I call it the outworking of the internal. <!--more-->These are the times you find yourself doing things you would not normally do, going extra mile, constantly thinking of the one you love and wondering, how did you make it all these years without him or her? It's a good feeling but I as have learnt, love is more than feelings, it's a CHOICE. The other thing that makes it to blossom even more is when you learn the language of love your partner responds to. What you respond to might not be what your partner responds to.

I am also a firm believer of this quote of mine, "MARRIAGE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT TO BE WITH GOD'S HELP". Out of the abundance of this love one man asked, where does it go after one gets married? I have spoken to some people and it was clear, what they once had was no longer present or if it was, less attention was given to it. Let me take a principle from the story of Jacob and his two wives. Jacob was in love with Rachel, so he served her father seven years in order to marry her and what happened, he found himself with Leah in the morning, Rachel's older sister exactly the opposite of what he desired. This is where my scripture comes in, someone in a relationship or marriage is feeling like they labored for Rachel but one morning they found themselves with Leah instead. What happened to the Rachel you labored for? How did she (he) turn out to be Leah after marriage (this is for both men and women)? Are you feeling like you were tricked into to marrying Leah thinking iwas Rachel? What do you do now, get rid of Leah to find Rachel? Jacob was disappointed to have married Leah but he did not get rid of her, since he still desired to marry Rachel, he still had a chance and therefore labored another 7 more years for her. This is what I call patience laboring in good times and in bad times to bring out what is missing. So Jacob had two wives, Leah and Rachel sisters but different. Both have different qualities and are all significant and vital.

Where does this leave us? Should we be in more than one relationship because what we desired did not come forth in the other? What we labored for was not birthed and so we throw in the towel? For me I see an opportunity to labor for a Rachel within the presence of a Leah. I have heard stories about people who labored for Rachel but felt like they ended up with Leah therefore labored in their marriage for some time without giving up on Leah to be married to Rachel. <strong>Same woman, double qualities</strong>. They confessed they almost threw away the best gift from God. They just realized there was a Rachel trapped inside their Leah's they needed to labor for. They learnt that Leah had qualities Rachel did not have and vice versa. Their gifts and blessings complemented and completed each other. That is why we need to thank God for both strengths and weaknesses in our spouses.

Those who have succeeded learnt to speak the love language their mates could understand. Not their own love language they hoped their mates would understand. The more they did, the more the beauty both inside and outside was revealed to blossom. They came in as separate pieces together and began to assemble their love together, fitting each piece in its rightful place without trying to force around peg on a square hole. They learnt that it's more than being together, it's about assembly because you can be together but feel separate. Assembly requires work and skills building together. They didn't want to try to separate a Rachel and a Leah, they discovered they could assemble both together after all they came from the same womb and fitted well by God's design. <strong>Don't dismiss Leah when she is a Rachel to be discovered and yet a Leah not lost</strong>. <strong>We can have extra ordinary relationships out of the ordinary because we have learnt to maximize opportunities within what we already have to bring out what we never had</strong>. It's God's way of growing us more in holiness, patience, persistence, stronger, appreciations as we labor through relationships other people would have given up on.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 19: 5 and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? 6 So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.”</strong>

There is no relationship that God honors like the relationship between a husband and a wife. He instituted it (invented marriage), addressing it right from the book of Genesis, the book of beginnings. It's God who saw that it was not good for man to be alone therefore He made him a helpmate. <!--more-->The marital relationship was established as the first human institution. God's ideal plan for marriage is one man and woman for one lifetime. And of all the love, God made a special love expressed between husband and wife consummated in the physical. This implies their sexual completeness. One man and one woman constitute the pair to reproduce. The "one flesh" is primarily seen in the child born of that union, the one perfect result of the union of two.

Look at how God created both man and woman then joined them to become one flesh. After forming man out of the clay, God did not reach the ground again to pick clay to make the woman; he took one of Adam’s ribs and formed a woman, Eve. God performed a Divine surgery, isn’t that amazing?. <strong>Genesis 2:22, "Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. 23 And Adam said: "This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."</strong> Imagine the Lord made her and as a loving Father presented his daughter to Adam to care for her as his wife. She was called woman because she was taken out of a man. Even though our world today tries to redefine marriage, we understand God established marriage between a man and a woman and blessed it. Upon completing creating her, He brought her to Adam. Right there and then Adam recognized her as the bone of his bones and the flesh of his flesh. Special relationship, made, blessed and sealed by God.

Marriage is so unique that in marriage that 1 plus 1 does not equal two but 1 and that unity God honors and treasures, <strong>Matthew 19: 5 and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? 6 So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.” </strong>Not even those in that marriage covenant saved or unsaved have the right or ability to alter it or break it. God honors it<strong>. </strong>The relationship between children and parents cannot be compared to the relationship between a husband and wife. Look at God dealing with Job, He allowed Satan to take everything away from Job including his children but did not let Satan touch his wife. God would not let Satan separate them. Is this not telling us something about marriage? Another example, God came in a dream to King Abimelech and was going to kill him because he eyed Abraham’s wife. Until we see how God honors marriage first, we will never understand His full purpose of allowing marriages to take place. We may think we are the ones who decided to get married; well God planned it, put that desire and directed you to the person He designed for you. I believe the primary reason for God to allow marriage is to make us HOLY, to conform us to the image of Christ in that covenant. I love listening to preacher Paul Washer, this is what he says when he is asked what he does, "I'm a husband", when asked what else he says, "oh, I'm also a father, and if I have anytime left, I preach a little.” Hence, putting God first, his wife second. His philosophy last<strong>. "What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world (including ministry) and loose his wife?” Proverbs 18:22, “He who finds a wife finds a good thing, And obtains favor from the LORD.</strong> What is your thought on marriage? I pray that as we share in the next few days, the Lord will transform our view and approach towards marriage. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Songs of Solomon 2:1, "I am the Rose of Sharon, and the Lily of the valleys"</strong>

The other day I picked some flowers for my wife, I know she loves flowers and flowers melts her heart. I don't respond to flowers like she does maybe because I am a man and men respond to other things but you get the point.

Let’s begin by understanding what a flower is. According to the dictionary definition, <strong>A flower is a plant that is cultivated and appreciated for its blossoms</strong>. <strong>The first thing appreciated about it is its beauty</strong>, <!--more-->when God created the world, He looked at what He had created and concluded that it was good. You may not feel that you are beautiful both inside and outside, and you may feel you are not significant in this life, you need to be reminded our creator fearfully made you and appreciated His handiwork y<strong>ou are unique and special, there is no one else like you. You have no competition in the entire world, you are an original not a copy or duplicate of something or someone. </strong><strong>Psalm 139:14, "I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made".</strong>

Not only are the flowers beautiful, they have fragrance. I know of certain flowers when the light shines on them especially at night, they produce some nice smelling fragrance and creates a warm atmosphere when the breeze blows through them. What an opportunity to allow the light of Christ to shine through the beautiful flower He has created and allow it to blossom and bring fragrance to your family, friends and those around you. With that in mind, we can say that flowers bring life to the surrounding. Go to any home, see how if there are no flowers around, that house and its surrounding appear dull. Add a few flowers and you bring to life the surrounding. Through that life, flowers also do attract people, birds, insects, how this shows when you begin to be the flower God wants you to be, everyone even the people who don't like you will be moved and attracted by what they see in you. Let's not forget that flowers brightens and melts hearts. Ladies love flowers, I say, <strong>"the way to the heart of a woman is a flower to make the way" </strong>(hope I'm not wrong), it reminds them they are special. Flowers have a way of bringing joy and peace in someone's life. Why do they usually bring flowers to a sick person in the hospital especially ladies? not only can the medicine be a means of healing, kind thoughts and acts of love have a way of also restoring. To add to what I am talking about, flowers are delicate and tender.

For a flower to maintain all these qualities, it must be given a special attention, cared for. During spring and summer, as you drive around, you see people giving special attention to flowers, natured, watered, planted close to the house, around it decorated to make it look even beautiful, dry leaves around it are removed, fertilizer put around it to help it grow and more so, planted on well prepared soil. The Lord does the same with His children, He desires the best for them and He gives His children a special attention, providing everything that they need to bring to life what I have already shared. The Lord keeps on reaching out and inspecting the flower, spending time with it, putting it in the right spot to ensure enough sun light. You may think that the Lord has deserted you but look deep and you will see that He is taking good care of His flowers why? as Matthew Henry the commentator puts is, <em>"Christ is pleased to compare himself to; and he condescends very much in the comparison. He that is the Son of the Highest, the bright and morning star, calls and owns himself the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys, to express his presence with his people in this world, the easiness of their access to him, and the beauty and sweetness which they find in him, and to teach them to adorn themselves with him, as shepherds and shepherdesses, when they appeared gay, were decked with roses and lilies, garlands and chaplets of flowers. The rose, for beauty and fragrance, is the chief of flowers, and our Saviour prefers the clothing of the lily before that of Solomon in all his glory. </em>I too refer to Him as the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the valley. He said, "<strong>Let us make man in Our image</strong>" so here we are just like Him, a flower. <strong>He did not make something He couldn't take care of.</strong>

Words from a song I love, "<strong>Of all the flowers in the world there is none that can compare, with the rose that God designed it's beauty is so rare. With His great love, His tender care, He watches till it's grown. Then He comes to pick the Rose and He takes it for His own</strong>" Can you see yourself the way the Lord sees you? Can you say confidently that you are beautiful, have fragrance, you bring life around, you attract, you brighten, you are delicate and you get special attention? Remember, you are a flower in His garden!!!, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <title><![CDATA[Faithfulness Keeps You Safe, by Evans Olang]]></title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 3:3, "Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart"</strong>

In looking at different passages in the bible, you find that "LOVE" and "FAITHFULNESS" are joined by the word "and". "KINDNESS" and "FAITHFULNESS" also appears many times in the bible side by side, these words work together. <strong>In a relationship, there can be no faithfulness without love and love cannot continue to flourish without faithfulness</strong>. <!--more-->They depend on each other, without one, the other would be dead. <strong>Psalm 85:10, "Love and faithfulness meet together.." They are patterned and woven together into each other. They have kissed and bonded to become one.</strong>

I would not waste time talking about "love" because if we can master "faithfulness", we would have mastered "love". Let's take the word "FAITHFULNESS" and break it into two parts, "FAITH" and "FULLNESS". The bible defines faith <strong>"as the assurance (the confirmation) of the things [we] hope for, being the proof of things [we] do not see and the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses (Hebrews 11:1 AMP)</strong>. In a relationship, it's taking what you see as falling and failing and believing that it's not always bound to be the same forever therefore laboring to keep it alive and better. You don't expect to give up on it when the going gets tough, you keep seeing something good far beyond the natural and reality. The other aspect of faith is "LOYALTY", a choice made by an individual to keep a promise (a vow) he or she made. "FULLNESS" is to complete, to give it maximum attention it needs. Give faith a 100% with no doubt of mind and I would term that "FAITHFULNESS".

One of the things killing marriages today is lack of faithfulness. <strong>Faithfulness is the cornerstone of a relationship</strong>. If I was to ask couples today what they would consider the most important thing in their marriage, I bet they would tell me "FAITHFULNESS". Why not love, kindness, respect, support etc. as first? It's because all these are centered around the word "FAITHFULNESS". <strong>Faithfulness involves loving your partner in ways that meet his or her needs</strong>. You will love because you are faithful, you will support because you are faithful and you will be kind because you are faithful. Faithfulness implies duty. Faithfulness begins as a choice, the reason <strong>Proverbs 3:3</strong>, tells us not to "<strong>Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart</strong>". It's the essence of a good Godly blessed marriage (relationship). We can choose to let it leave us by our words and actions. A husband or wife can feel safe knowing their spouse is faithful<strong>. Proverbs 20:28 "Love and faithfulness keep a king (queen) safe; through love his (her) throne is made secure". </strong>Husbands are kings of their home (throne) and wives are the queens of their home (throne), their aim is to love and be faithful to each other to keep their kingdom safe and secure. If the kingdom is not safe and secure, expect intruders which leads to unfaithfulness. How many have fell on that trap because their kingdoms were not secured by love and faithfulness? Faithfulness (trustworthy) is very fragile, once broken it's hard to mend it. <strong>The best ways you demonstrate your faithfulness today will build bridges of trust for a life time</strong>. Being trustworthy is keeping your word. Don't let love and faithfulness leave you if you want your marriage (relationship) to grow and flourish. Write it on the table of your heart and remind yourself everyday to keep them. Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Chronicles 22:1-5, vs. 5,”Now David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.” So David made abundant preparations before his death”</strong>

While the world keeps getting darker and darker, raising children in our time continues to be scary. My wife and have not been blessed with kids yet but often we wonder how they will turn out if God chooses to bless us and how we will raise them. The more we think of it, the more we prepare by praying.<!--more-->

David who would have been more concerned about his legacy and drive for a longer life to continue to serve the Lord and build God’s house found the Lord had a different plan. He says in<strong> 1Chronicles 28:2, “… I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and had made preparations to build it. 3 But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for My name, because you have been a man of war and have shed blood.’ …. 6 Now He said to me, ‘It is your son Solomon who shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be My son, and I will be his Father”.</strong> David must not build, but he would do all he could to prepare for his son; he said, “<strong>Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it</strong> “. He prepared abundantly for his son before his death. The consideration of his age and growing infirmities, which showed him his death approaching, quickened him, towards his latter end, to be very diligent in making this preparation for the magnificent work ahead of him. David had learnt that God’s work must be done God’s way and by God’s Spirit if God was to bless it, he needed his son to get that and prepare the same.

<b>What David could not build in person, he would build through his son</b>. This called for a proper foundation, a foundation that would last. Though time was not on his side, he worked very diligently not only preparing materials but also preparing his son spiritually for what was to come. <strong>1Chronicles 28:9-10,</strong> <b>"9 A</b><strong>s for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a loyal heart and with a willing mind; for the Lord searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever. 10 Consider now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it.”</strong>

How are we preparing our children for God’s work tomorrow we may not live to see?, What are our great concerns, our legacy or the expansion of God’s kingdom that might not be brought about through us but through our children? If we know we might not be here tomorrow, we as David will diligently prepare our young and inexperienced children with everything both physical, material and spiritual (emphasis on spiritual) to live and work for God.

What our hands find to do for God, and our souls, and those round us, let us do it with all our might, before our death; for after death there is no device nor working. And when the Lord chose not to employ us in those services which we desired, we must not be discouraged or idle, but do what we can, though in a humbler sphere knowing the legacy continues. Those that are older and experienced (parents) should consider those that are young and tender, and provide them what help they can, that they may make the work of God as easy to them as possible.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 4:25-Romans 5, Romans 5:1, "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ"</strong>

In this difficult walk in Christ, sometimes we need to be reminded and be encouraged of the salvation made possible by the Father, accomplished by the Son, effected by the Holy Spirit and is now ours by faith.<!--more-->

A couple of years ago I witnessed to a young man who had a hard time receiving the forgiveness of God. Reflecting on his life style and his great sins, he could not understand how a just God would be kind to save him and render him righteous. I feel that way many times and the more I think about it, the more I thank God for His saving grace. We are not justified by keeping the law as many people believe, we are justified by faith through our Lord Jesus Christ. <strong>Justified means, made as though one never sinned. </strong>What a kind God He is. Imagine of all the things we did, when we repented of our sins and put on the Lord Jesus Christ for our eternal salvation, our sinful accounts was wiped out clean and He credited to our accounts righteousness. This is what is called imputed righteousness. <strong>Imputed righteousness through justification is credited righteousness not by works, and by this we have peace with God. </strong>

<strong>Christ was delivered for our offenses that we may be the righteousness of God.</strong> God the Father delivered Jesus Christ to the cross of Calvary, not as an example, but to make atonement for our sins (2Corinthians 5:21). God the Father also raised Jesus Christ again <strong>for our justification.</strong> The meaning of the resurrection for us today is that Christ Jesus died on account of our sins, and was raised from the dead in order to render us righteous in the eyes of God. Faith imputes righteousness. There is not a thing anyone can do to become clothed with God’s righteousness except have faith in Jesus Christ as his Savior from sin.

The Swiss reformer Robert Haldane said<em>, “And it is by Him (Jesus Christ) they enter into the state of grace, so by Him they stand in it, accepted before God; secured, according to His everlasting covenant, that they shall not be cast down. </em>"<strong>...Christ in you, the hope of glory", Colossians 1:27</strong>

It is the death of Christ which effects our salvation (justification); but it is the life of Christ which sustains it (sanctification). Christ died for our sins and was raised for our justification to make continual intercession for us (Hebrew 7:25). The life of Jesus Christ did not take away the penalty of our sins, His death did. But Christ ever lives to take away the dominion of sin over us (sanctification). This is how we are continually kept saved by His intercessory life.

We thank God for His righteousness imputed in us through justification by faith in Jesus Christ. On judgment day, the righteousness of God through Christ is what will cause us to enter into heaven. There will be no sin on our account because our sin account was wiped clean by His blood, and righteousness was credited to our account. This should give us unspeakable joy full of His glory. The reason we should hang on tight even when life is hard and challenging. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1kings 13:16 -17, "16 And he said, “I cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place. 17 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">For I have been told by the word of the Lord,</span> ‘You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.’ </strong>

In this story, we are told of a man of God who was sent to bring a message to wicked king Jeroboam. His message showed he was a prophet. Rather than the bible call him a prophet, the bible called him a man of God. I believe this was done deliberately because there were prophets in the land both true and false as you will see, and God wanted us to learn the difference. We are not told of who he was rather whose he was.

<!--more-->His message was simple, God will raise a child by the name of Josiah to take over, and a sign to indicate he was a true prophet sent by God, the altar shall split apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out. To even attest that this was prophet, when king Jeroboam ordered for him to be arrested, his hand became withered and had to ask for the man of God to entreat the Lord on his behalf that his hands would be restored. And to this he believed that he was sent of God. The prophets of the day received rewards for their services (miracles), it was accustom for people to give rewards because the Lord allowed it. So what does king Jeroboam do, he does the same, <b>vs. 8-9,</b> “8 <strong>But the man of God said to the king, “If you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place. 9 For so it was commanded me by the word of the Lord, saying, ‘You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you came.’</strong>” Mission accomplished. He made good choice, he listened to the Lord to bring the message and also he let go what was proper for a prophet to receive, the word of God commanded him to.

<strong>Vs. ”10 So he went another way and did not return by the way he came to Bethel</strong>”. As he journeyed back, there met him an old prophet who sent for him. And the old prophet asked him to come with him and eat bread. Again you see him choose to obey the Lord, he answered vs. <strong>16-17, “16 I cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place. 17 For I have been told by the word of the Lord, ‘You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.”</strong>

Here is where things fell apart when the man of God met this other prophet<strong>, vs. 18, “He said to him, “I too am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.’” (He was lying to him.)” 19 So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water”. </strong>He listened to him when the old prophet added a twist to his message, “<b>I am a prophet too and I speak for the Lord”</b>

This is one of the things plaguing our churches, many choose not to receive from the king, they also choose not to listen to another man until like this man who declared himself a prophet claiming to be speaking for the Lord that many believe him/her. He went in and sat down in his house and ate bread and drank water choosing to disobey God. Many believers have chosen to sit, eat and drink with that old false lying prophet, listening to another voice. While all looks good, it’s a trap, a tragedy waiting to happen.

The good prophet's weakness, in suffering himself to be thus imposed upon, he that had resolution enough to refuse the invitation of the king, who promised him a reward, but could not resist the insinuations of one that pretended to be a prophet. Choose this day whose voice you will listen to, the voice of God through His word, or the voice of the old lying prophet who claims to speak for the Lord. What is false will repackage itself in a way that is appealing. You may have said no once or a few times, however remember the old lying prophet does not give up easy and we have enough of them in the evangelical circles. To finish.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1kings 13:16-17, "16 And he said, “I cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place. 17 For I have been told by the word of the Lord, ‘You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.’"</strong>

While we talk about the old lying prophet, can God use a false prophet? Absolutely. Can a false prophet say true things biblically? absolutely. Does saying some good things make them true prophets? Absolutely NOT. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">From what I read, anytime God used a false prophet, it was NOT to bring blessings but to bring judgment.</span><!--more-->Here we see God use a false prophet to deliver a message of judgment to the man of God, vs. 20-22, “<strong>20 Now it happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back; 21 and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Thus says the Lord: ‘Because you have disobeyed the word of the Lord, and have not kept the commandment which the Lord your God commanded you, 22 but you came back, ate bread, and drank water in the place of which the Lord said to you, “Eat no bread and drink no water,” your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.” </strong>I was puzzled by this for a minute. How come the Lord is not punishing the old lying prophet and punishing the man of God who listened to him? I believe the old prophet’s time of punishment would come but for now, God was not going to let His name be tarnished because He appears to have given a contradicting message. God used a false prophet to bring doom to the man of God and I believe God is letting the false prophets/teachers in our time to be on the loose for a season as people have chosen to listen to them rather than turn to God’s word as the measuring standard for every teaching, preaching or prophecy.

God has spoken to us by His word and others have risen to challenge His word to appear to be contradicting. And God in His mercy has not left us to figure these things out ourselves but rather, He has given us His precious word to be the test to every teaching, preaching and prophesy. Therefore, God's people are more in danger of being drawn from their duty by the plausible pretenses of divinity and sanctity than by external inducements; we have therefore need to beware of false prophets, and not believe every spirit.

The man of God should have taken time to beg direction from God, and not have complied so soon. He became careless and made a costly choice that made him lose his life.

<strong>Vs. 24-25, “24 When he was gone, a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his corpse was thrown on the road, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the corpse. 25 And there, men passed by and saw the corpse thrown on the road, and the lion standing by the corpse. …”. </strong>Though the lion killed him as God planned it, the lion did not devour him. The lion also stood by the carcass as if he was the guard of it, to keep off all others from meddling with it; these circumstances are very surprising, and show the thing to be of God; for when the lion had done what he had been commissioned to do, which was to kill the prophet, he was to do no more. The lion did not kill the donkey and the donkey never ran. God was in control.

But as John Gill the commentator would ask, “<em>But why doth God punish a good man so severely for so small an offense?" His sin was not small, for it was a gross disobedience to a positive command. And it cannot seem strange if God should bring his deserved death upon him in this manner, for the accomplishment of his own glorious designs, to vindicate his own justice from the imputation of partiality; to assure the truth of his predictions, and thereby provoke Jeroboam and his idolatrous followers to repentance; and to justify himself in all his dreadful judgments which he intended to inflict upon Jeroboam's house, and the whole kingdom of Israel.”</em>

God is destined to gain glory even in the midst of choices we make, the question that is left with us, whose voice will we listen to as we make those choices? The hard road is painful and costly, therefore choose this day who you will listen to God or that old lying prophet. Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 30:1-2, "1 Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister, and said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I die!” 2 And Jacob’s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”</strong>

Envy is something we encounter from time to time in our walk with the Lord. Envy is the grieving at the good of another, a sin that is hateful to God and hurtful to our neighbors and ourselves. This is where we fail to understand that we are all wired differently and God has placed certain things in certain people he may have not placed in others. <!--more-->If anything, we ought to celebrate our differences, our uniqueness and celebrate what God is doing in us and others.

Rachel and Leah being sisters, they were very different. It was God’s doing to make them different, but instead of each celebrating their difference, they were both trying to walk in each other’s shoes. The more they did, the more they were miserable. Rachel was more beautiful than Leah, she was more loved but her womb was shut. Leah on the other hand God had opened her womb and gave her children, by this time she had 4 sons when Rachel launched a complaint. <strong>Genesis 30:1,” Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister,..”. </strong>

<strong>“… and said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I die</strong>!”. I believe where there is envy, there is a misdirected approach to things. Our judgments are clouded, how we react and act is skewed and how we approach things tend to go wrong. Rachel having seen Leah her sister have children believed it was Jacob’s fault she was not having children. She had forgotten that God is the author of good things. The one to call upon when there is a problem. How easy it is to turn our focus on man when things are not working out as we need them to work, and even blame others for the predicament we find ourselves in. <strong>Psalm 118:8-9 says, “8 It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in man. 9 It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in princes</strong>”. Instead of trusting God, she concluded that her problems were caused by her husband. Her confidence was not in her God but in her husband.

<strong>Vs. "2 And Jacob’s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” </strong>Jacob is angry, because his wife ascribes nothing to the providence of God, and, by imagining that children are the offspring of chance turned on and off as man pleases. It is probable that Jacob had been already sorrowful on account of his wife's barrenness. Jacob acknowledges God as the provider of children and uses this as an eye opener and encouragement to his confused, hurting, envious wife. He affirms that the Lord had shut her womb, he obliquely intimates that she ought to deeply to humble herself and trust God. Tragically, in vs. 3. she comes up with her own plan of giving her maid Bilhah to Jacob to have children with so as to call them her own. This is a shortcut means to blessings which is not God’s way. As Matthew Henry rightfully puts it, “<em>Had not Rachel's heart been influenced by evil passions, she would have thought her sister's children nearer to her, and more entitled to her care than Bilhah's. But children whom she had a right to rule, were more desirable to her than children she had more reason to love”</em>

There someone right now who is envious of someone who has a better job, house, children, spouse etc. and it’s killing you inside as you think that it’s not right for them to have all that and not you. Now Moses, by exhibiting this evil in Rachel, would teach us that it is inherent in all; in order that each of us, tearing it up by the roots, may vigilantly purify ourselves from it. That we may be cured of envy, put away pride and self-love; and celebrate what God has done and is doing in others who may have what we don’t and trust God for what we need. As Paul prescribes this single remedy against contentions <strong>"Let nothing be done through vain glory." (Philippians 2:3.). Blessings, Ev</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Kings 21:1-29, "And he answered, "I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord"</strong>

The more you live with yourself, the more you discover what is in you, that is the work of God’s righteousness. You don't have to live with yourself long before you see un dealt with flaws within you. You also know how people can change. People you never imagined could plan mischief against you are very much available and ready. <!--more-->This is life and if we never learn how to deal with these things, we will always live a defeated life trying to fit in with people, trying to please everyone only to find that you can only do so much. You will still find that there are people who don't like you and your blessing; and some change for reasons unknown to you and I.

Let’s learn something from King Ahab<strong>. Vs. 1, "And it came to pass after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard</strong>". King Ahab had power, he was married to the most wicked woman in history. Jezebel somehow had power over him running his life. Ahab was the type of king who was not satisfied with what he already had. He wanted to acquire more and more from even the people who had little. Naboth was a nobody compared to Ahab and had nothing apart from Vineyard. Vineyard is a plantation of vines producing grapes. Even though Ahab was the king, he was aware of his boundaries of what he could and could not do therefore he requested to purchase Naboth's land for a price, however Naboth would not sell. I am yet to meet someone who says they have acquired enough needing no more. People can be driven by jealousy to desire what already belongs to others, hoping that they will step away from it so that they can have it. Pressure can be put on people to abandon what they have simply because the other person does not want them around or want what they already have. You begin to make progress and see if everyone will be pleased.

Ahab could not take what belonged to Naboth by force. This saddened him but then, Jezebel, his wife encouraged him to go against his conscious. I am troubled by people who encourage others to do wrong things coating it with good words to make it sound not too bad. Trying to influence others to go against you because they don't want to see you blessed. <strong>Vs. 7, "Then Jezebel his wife said to him, "You now exercise authority over Israel</strong>", We need to be very careful about who speaks into our lives and encourages us to do things, a good reason for discernment. Mostly we are not influenced by the outer but the inner circles as we see with Jezebel. Pushed by pressure to do something completely wrong. First mistake, <strong>Ahab received wrong advise and took it</strong>.

<strong>vs. 8. "And she wrote letters in Ahab's name, sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naboth", </strong>Second mistake, <strong>allowing Jezebel to do things in his name</strong>. Though not acting directly, he is involved directly. If I can't do my dirty work, I will have someone do it for me. If I can't get what I want, I will show my pity to someone else that they step in and help me get it. <strong>vs. 13, "...and the scoundrels witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of people, saying, "Naboth has blasphemed God and the King"</strong>, Third mistake, <strong>they lied on Naboth</strong>. <strong>vs. 13, "...Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died</strong>", Fourth mistake, <strong>they killed Naboth</strong>. Something that started very innocently escalated to greater evil. What amazes me is that Ahab was watching all these knowing they were wrong yet said nothing, he supported it. After Naboth had been killed, he took the vineyard but God had something to say about it.

<strong>1Kings 21:20, "And he answered, "I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord</strong>". You give the enemy a room, he will want the whole house. Ahab sold himself to do evil. He yielded to that voice of Jezebel to take advantage of the situation. God did not send a message to Jezebel but to Ahab because Ahab had the power to do right and resist evil but he did not. That Jezebel spirit is causing havoc and must be silenced. Do you rejoice with those who are blessed or would you rather see them down, lie on them and speak about them to other people? Are you harboring hatred or jealousy over what they have and wishing it was yours? would you rejoice if they failed? Who do you allow to speak into your life? are they giving you good advice? Don't sell yourself to do evil. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:34, "Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us"</strong>

There are times I sit down to pray and it is a struggle of how and what pray for. Then there are those times I just don't have the strength to pray because I am in so much pain, distressed, confused, overwhelmed and the list goes on. Those are the times I need someone to pray for me. And who better pray for me than the One who sits on the right hand of God the Father making intersession for us.<!--more-->

Why do we pray and conclude "In Jesus name"? In the gospels, I see only John reporting to us of what Jesus said about His name in reference to asking (praying). <strong>John 14:13 "And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son". </strong>He then also said, <strong>John 16:23, "And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you"</strong>. Is this not an indication that we can ask Jesus directly in His name or ask the Father in His Son's name? Why would Jesus who is God be interceding when He is God to be called on and has everything?

<strong>Romans 8:34, "Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us". </strong>Jesus has the power to condemn, yet He has not. Is He risen? Yes He is, the power of God raised Him from the dead. He has ascended to heaven sitting at the right hand of God the Father, His rightful place interceding for us. While He was on earth especially before He was taken to be crucified, you can see Him interceding for mankind.

Here is what I believe the reason Jesus encouraged us to pray to the Father in His name. Who did better understand what mankind goes through than Jesus?, He was tempted, He was ridiculed, He lost His friend, attacked, betrayed, denied, rejected in His home town, His brothers doubted Him, carried heavy cross to the mountain, felt the pain of being crucified etc. So when we pray while facing some of the things He faced, He intercedes for us before Father by saying something like this, "I know how it feels to go without, to be in pain, to loose someone, to be rejected, I have been there". When I face challenge and I just can't find strength or words to pray, I say, "Jesus, please pray for me". He understands my infirmities better, He has been in my shoes. And who understands better both sides of heaven operations and earthly operations than Jesus?, <strong>1Timothy 2:5, "For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus". </strong>What are you facing today that you just don't know or have no strength to pray about it? Do you know that you can call on the greatest intercessor to intercede for you because He knows your situation better? I am facing some challenges I need Him to pray for me when I just don't know how to. Here is my cry and hope is yours too, Jesus, Please pray for me. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:31 "...If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? </strong>

Our struggle at times is not so much about God blessing us, it's about others knowing that God has blessed us. Standing boldly and demonstrating God's blessing is sometimes not received well. To some who look at you blessed feel that you are filled with pride and to some you feel it creates jealousy and therefore keep blessings to yourself. <!--more-->And there are people who don't feel that they can be blessed beyond salvation. It's their opinion or they have been deceived into thinking that God only cares about our salvation, the only reason He died for us. God's love is not just limited to salvation. Salvation is the beginning. It's what gives you a sense of belonging.

If we understand this concept, then instead of being frustrated with others being blessed, we call on God full of blessings to bestore upon us what He has. When we see other's blessed, we won't have envy or jealousy but we will bless them for when we bless them, we will be creating avenues of blessings for ourselves. <strong>Genesis 12:3 says, "I will bless those who bless you, And I will curse him who curses you". </strong>God's word is sure and strong.

In our text Romans 8:31 says if God be for us, who can be against us. I often break this into two parts, 1. "<strong>God before us</strong>" which is God going a head of us, leading us. Watch how God led the Israelites from Egypt, <strong>Exodus 13:21 "And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night</strong>". Our heavenly Father leads us every day. The second part "<strong>Go be for us</strong>" sounds a like but the letters are put in strategic places to differentiate the meanings. This I would interpret as God who though mighty yet He is concerned about our daily affairs, He has decided to be on our side. How do we know this?, well He did not spare His own Son, He delivered Him up for us all as His demonstration of love. If He was able to without withholding His very best, His only Son from us, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? I would shout right here. If someone who is rich gave let's say half of his riches freely, would you doubt his ability to do it again? If anything your faith would be built on the fact that he did it before therefore he can do it again. That is how God is to us, He showed us that there was nothing He can withhold from those that He loved.

Every believer has a way to tap into God's blessings by calling on God and blessing others. I remember a hymn we would sing, <strong>"Pass me not, O gentle Savior, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling (blessing, lifting up), Do not pass me by". </strong>We may be withholding blessings from ourselves but He is not. If I know what to do to be blessed, I will not let the enemy use what others have to create envy and jealousy. I will not let him trick me into cursing them, if anything I will bless them and say to God, "while you are blessing them, do not pass me by". Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 31 That, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord,”(1 Corinthians 1:30 – 31)</strong>

Many hold that the foolishness of God is an oxymoron. Two words that seemingly contradict each other, i.e. jumbo shrimp, honest politician, good devotional ;) etc. When I read this oxymoron, "foolishness of God," I thought, "now that is the ultimate oxymoron!" God being foolish -- that is impossible! But as you look deeper into this and think through the Bible about all the seemingly foolish ways of God, the term takes on new meaning.<!--more-->

Remember in Genesis 6-8 when Noah, built a barge and barge parked in his “driveway” for 120 years, to save 8 people. In Judges 15:16 we read about how Samson kills thousands of Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. In 1 Samuel 17 we read of the lowly shepherd boy, David, killing the giant Goliath. On and on throughout the Bible, God uses things that are foolish to the world, to shame the wise.

1. <strong>We are in Christ</strong> “<strong><em>But of him are you in Christ Jesus</em>.”</strong> If I put a sponge in a bucket of water, is the water in the sponge or is the sponge in the water? In this scenario both are true. We are in Christ Jesus, because we have confessed and repented of our sins and put our faith in Jesus Christ. If one were about to jump out of a plane, it is not enough to believe in a parachute, one must put it on. We have put on the Lord Jesus Christ and our trust is in Him alone for our salvation.

<strong>2. We have wisdom in our lives</strong>. “<strong><em>God is made unto us wisdom</em></strong>”, The Scriptures say, “<strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom…</strong>” To fear our Lord is the starting place of wisdom. How can we really claim to have anything useful as far as knowledge, if we don’t acknowledge the One in whom is life, and truth, the Creator God Himself?

<strong>3. We have [His] righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption </strong>Ro 3:22 “This <strong>righteousness</strong> from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. 1Th 5:23 “<strong>May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through…</strong>” Ps 111:9 <strong>He provided redemption for his people</strong>; he ordained his covenant forever—holy and awesome is his name.

4. <strong>We Glorify the Lord</strong> “…<strong><em>He that glories, let him glory in the Lord</em></strong>.” When one realizes that they are in Christ, when one fears God, and has God’s righteousness, sanctification, and redemption imputed upon him or her, one must acknowledge that all of these things come not from flesh and blood but from God. “This <em>is</em> the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying “<strong><em>Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.”</em></strong>

The foolishness of God impacts people by impacting people inside with His spirit, so that they will give Him the glory for what He has done, in them, with them, and through them. The clay pot is only worth something because the Potter has formed the lump of clay into something fit for the Potter’s use. Isaiah said, <em>in <strong>64:8 “Yet, O LORD, you are our Father</strong>. <strong>We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand</strong></em>.” The Potter gets the glory not the clay. In the foolishness of God, He works through us to receive glory from us. In the foolishness of God when He works in your life, who do you give the glory to? How will you give Him glory today?

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“26 For you see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: 27 But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; 28 And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: 29 That no flesh should glory in his presence. (1 Corinthians 1:26 – 29)”</strong>

God doesn’t call the qualified, He qualifies the called.<!--more-->

I love this truth. This is an old saying which Evans often reminds many of. When one reads Hebrews 11 commonly called the Hall of Faith, we read about the biblical giants. However have you ever wondered how these people became the spiritual giants that we view them as? I believe that at the time of these people’s lives, they did not consider themselves to be spiritual giants, but rather just ordinary people.

Imagine with me the following snapshots of the foolishness of God found in the Scriptures.

<strong>Joshua</strong>= Go around the wall 7’x’s, and on day 7 march 7x’s and blow your horn. Does this really sound like wise military advice? <strong>The FOOLISHNESS OF GOD</strong>

<strong>David</strong> = a small Jewish shepherd boy with one stone and a sling conquers a giant Philistine warrior armed with a sword. <strong>THE FOOLISHNESS OF GOD</strong>

<strong>Abraham</strong> = I want you to pack up and go out into the desert to a place that I will show you. Sarah is going to have a baby. You are no longer to be called Abram, but Abraham because you are going to be the father of many nations. Go to an unknown destination, have a name change and have a child while pushing 100 years old and a wife pushing 90! <strong>THE FOOLISHNESS OF GOD</strong>

<strong>Jesus </strong>= Jesus himself in John 9, walks up to a blind guy and spits on the ground, makes mud cakes, and shoves it in the guys eyes. Then he tells him, a blind buy, to go wash in the pool. How is the blind guy going to get there? The man obeys and received his sight, and still many didn’t believe. <strong>THE FOOLISHNESS OF GOD</strong>

<strong>Peter = </strong>Throw your net on the right side of the boat, even though you have been fishing all day. Peter listens to His carpenter Master Jesus, and the disciples had a huge catch in their nets, so much so that they could not pull it in. <strong>THE FOOLISHNESS OF GOD</strong>

Joshua blow your horns. David fight Goliath. Abraham Sarah is going to have a baby. Jesus stick mud in this blind guy’s eyes, so he can see, Peter throw your net on the other side of the boat. <strong>THE FOOLISHNESS OF GOD</strong>
<ol>
	<li>God did not call many wise men after the flesh – (Your name)</li>
	<li>God did not call many mighty, not many noble – (Your name)</li>
	<li>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise – (Your name)</li>
	<li>God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty – (Your name)</li>
	<li>God chose the base things of the world, and things which are despised - (Your name)</li>
	<li>God has chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nought (nullify) things that are – (Your name)</li>
	<li>God’s foolishness results in no flesh (Your name)being able to glory in his presence.</li>
</ol>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“<strong><em>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men</em></strong>.” (<strong>1 Cor.1:24</strong>)

I can understand how human beings can be foolish, because I interact with people every day. I can understand how I can be foolish because I have a long memory of many of the foolish things I’ve done. I can understand how politicians, athletes, teachers, scientists all sorts of people in this world can be foolish. <!--more-->But I cannot conceive how He, the one in whom are hidden all the wisdom, and knowledge of the universe can be foolish. Does it make sense, and if so how? How can the Creator of the Universe, be foolish or weak to any degree, and how can the Apostle Paul have the audacity to even suggest such a concept “the foolishness of God or the “weakness of God”? How then can God be foolish and how can God be weak?

I think that this concept, which cannot be taught but rather caught. And to do this I will illustrate some snapshots of the foolishness of God found in the Scriptures.

<strong>“<em>The foolishness of God is wiser than men</em></strong>.”

There was a famous song, “what if God were one of us.” He was! God chose to save the world from its sins by divinely impregnating a common Jewish woman with the savior of the World in her womb. God allows an ordinary Jewish couple to raise the Son of God. Then Jesus gathers 12 rickety disciples to himself, trains them and eventually goes to the cross to die. The Jews expected a Messiah fully armed to rule the Romans with a rod of iron, but God chose death on a cross as His divine plan. His One and only Son Jesus, was crucified upon Calvary. The King on the Cross does not seem to make sense. Does this not seem to be foolishness? Jesus was given the death penalty, capital punishment. This was later on in history done away with because it became considered inhumane. In God’s foolishness His plan was to bring life through the death of His Son.

“<strong><em>The weakness of God is stronger than men.</em>”</strong>

Christ was dead and placed in a tomb. The hope of Israel seemed to be lost. Any hope of restoration for the Jewish people was “buried” in the tomb with the Messiah which was quite dead at this time. There was Christ’s body, lifeless, hopeless, and at the time also seemingly meaningless, as this event did not live up to the expectations of a new Davidic Kingdom as was in the minds of the disciples and many others. He said that He would rise from the dead, “<strong><em>I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days</em></strong>.’ ” <strong><em>Mt 26:62 Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” Mt 26:63 But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.” Mt 26:64 “Yes, it is as you say,” Jesus replied. “But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</em></strong> The weakness of Jesus can be seen in His submitting to trial under Pilot, to be crucified and killed only to rise from the dead in power.

The foolishness and weakness of God seems like an oxymoron. The fact that God wants to use you to bring His Divine Truth to the unsaved is amazing. He fills our mouth with the foolishness of the cross, which seems to be a ridiculous plan. We preach the weakness of God in the fact that Jesus Christ defeated death, hell, and the grave. Men nailed Christ to the cross and killed Him. However, God still raised His Son from the dead for the entire world to see the foolishness and weakness of God. Preach the foolishness and weakness of God because that is what the world needs to hear in order to be saved. Use the Law to break the hard heart, and the Gospel to heal the brokenhearted.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“23 But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness; 24 But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God”. (1 Cor.1:23)</strong>

Let me ask you a question. How many hairs are on the back of a fully grown Tibetan yak? How many pieces of sand are on the combined islands of Hawaii? How many times did you turn over last night when you slept? There are many things that we don’t know.<!--more--> If we don’t know so many things as Christians, how much more do the unsaved struggle with all the questions about the things of God that they can’t figure out with their intellect nor with state of the art technology? When Christ came on the scene, it really baffled the Jews and the Greeks (Gentiles). Paul said that Christ’s crucifixion was a stumbling block to them. Why? Peter explains, “<strong><em>Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded. 7 To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed (rejected), the same is made the head of the corner, 8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed</em></strong><em>.</em>” 1Peter 2:6-8. “<strong><em>Christ “came to his own, and his own received him not</em></strong> (<strong>John 1:11</strong>).” The Jews were the builders that rejected the most important piece of building material (namely the cornerstone) Jesus Christ. They had the most important piece for the construction of the building; however instead of recognizing Christ, they foolishly tripped over the very piece they so desperately needed. David wrote, “<strong><em>Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain</em></strong> (Psalm 127:1).” The Jews were building in vain by failing to allow the Lord Jesus to be the chief cornerstone, the very foundation of the house.

In the foolishness of God, God sent the very answer the Jews had been awaiting Jesus the Messiah, but they overlooked Him instead of having their blind eyes open and believe Him. The message we preach, Christ crucified, is still a stumbling block for the Jews. Let us use their stumbling stone as our stepping stone, to bring them the truth they heavily reject. The reason that people need Jesus is because they are disobedient toward God, showing their sin nature through the breaking of His Moral Law (The Ten Commandments).

1. The Stone (Jesus) was rejected.

2. Jesus is the Cornerstone.

3. Many stumble at His Word to repent and put their faith in Him.

4. Those stumbling are the disobedient people in the world.

5. Jesus is the rock of offense; he goes against the flow of the word and tradition of man.

6. Unless the Lord builds the house it will not last.

Preach the Word in season and out of season no matter who may be offended, no matter who may stumble. He is the cornerstone of the lives of His children so let us not be ashamed to preach His Word.

Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: (1 Cor.1:20-22)</strong>

With all the wisdom the Greeks &amp; Egyptians had, with all the wisdom of all the cultures of all mankind in its totality. In the wisdom of God they NEVER found God. The late Dr. Walter Martin said, “The golden ages of Greece lead the Greeks to Plato’s philosophy, utter disaster, moral chaos, and multiple-polytheistic worship. <!--more-->They came up with a god for everything under the sun and one for the sun itself. Zeus, Athena, Aphrodite, were the gods they conceived yet they each had human characteristics, including sin, and could overcome and be overcome by humanity.” The totality of man’s wise efforts to find God, ended up in divine bankruptcy. And to rephrase Paul’s sarcastic words towards the ungodly, “In the wisdom of God the world by wisdom couldn’t get itself arrested.” It couldn’t find out anything about God.

I love the dialog in Matthew 16, where Jesus asks His twelve, “But who do you say that I am? 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God’. 17 And Jesus answered and said to him, ‘Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven’”. Although it is logical and completely reasonable to believe in God, the revelation of God does not come through flesh and blood, not through the wisdom of this world. What is the difference between the wisdom of this world and the wisdom of God? Perhaps the following illustration will shed light on this subject.

<strong><em>The Sinking Ship </em>(Taken from the Evidence Bible)</strong>

Imagine for a moment that you are standing on the seashore gazing at a large ocean liner. The sun is shining. There is no wind and the sea is calm. To your amazement, about thirty people suddenly dive off the end of the ship and cling to a lifeboat. You shake your head in disbelief at their foolishness. Then without warning, the great ocean liner strikes an iceberg and suddenly sinks, taking all on board with it. Those who <em>looked </em>like fools in abandoning the ship were actually wise, and those who seemed wise by staying on board were, in truth, fools. The world scoffs at those who abandon the ship of this world and cling to the lifeboat of the Savior. But Christians know that this great pleasure-cruiser will eventually come into contact with the immovable iceberg of the Law of God, sink into hell . . . and take all those on board with it.

1. God makes foolish the wisdom of this world.

2. The world’s wisdom does not lead to God.

3. God is pleased when His “foolish” Gospel is preached toward those that believe.

4. Some seek a sign but yet cannot see the “sign” of the Cross.

5. Some seek worldly wisdom to try to know God, but it does not lead to Him.

6. Knowing God comes through a Divine revelation.

God has given His wisdom to His children. He desires His children to appropriate that wisdom to serve Him with one’s whole heart, mind, soul, and strength. God’s wisdom is acquired through conforming to His will. What will you do to walk in His wisdom today?

Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>"The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot and stay near it." Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. "Do you understand what you are reading?" Philip asked. And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing." (Acts 8:29-30; 38-39)</strong>

During war time in the military, when a platoon is trying to find the enemy and the military leader suddenly places his hand in the air and closes his fight, all his troops immediately stop. <!--more-->Why because their eyes are on their leader, and one more step could be a landmine that could blow off their leg, or end their very life. Even towns and cities know the value of stopping which is why they have placed stop signs and stop lights to better control traffic.

There are times when God wants us to stop and not take another step forward. Perhaps one is reading God's word and a certain truth seems to bring off the page into your spirit and it stops you in your tracks. If you're like most, you stop for a moment because it's like a stop light, and then you envision a green light and you go. However, when God stops you as you are reading His word, it is because there is a truth, a warning, an encouragement, a piece of wisdom, etc... that He has for you now. In our church one member was reading the Scriptures and the words from Genesis, "Who told you that," seemed to leap off the page at them. This in turn caused her to weigh the words others said to them, or perhaps even their own thoughts that came into their mind. Have you said to yourself, "I'm a failure," or were you ever told hurtful words such as "you'll never amount to anything." Who told you that! Did God say that to you? When we are stopped in our tracks as we read God's word, there is a reason and God knows that reason, and failure to stop at that verse, passage, question, word, command will result in a consequence. A soldier failing to stop could be killed, a car failing to stop at a light may crash, a Christian failing to stop will feel the effect and it could be disastrous. Just as the military leader signals stop because he senses grave danger ahead, how much more should we as Christians stop, because when God says "STOP," He sees what is ahead for us, and failing to stop when He says stop will not turn out in our favor.

The Spirit told Philip to go and STOP at the chariot, but never gave the reason to Philip. Philip ran and STOPPED hearing the eunuch reading the Scriptures, and Phillip shared Jesus with him. Imagine if
Philip didn't STOP. Who would have explained the passage of Scripture to the eunuch? Then the newly converted eunuch gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. However when they came up out of the water the Holy Spirit had translated Philip 30 miles away to another town. This may be difficult to fathom, but if Jesus can be taken from death to life, then Philip can be taken from town to town. Imagine if they had never stopped for the baptism and at specific time the Holy Spirit was going to take Philip away, then who would have baptized the eunuch.

When God tells you to STOP it is for your own good, so that you can GO right! Is there a verse, passage of Scripture, habit, etc..., that God has said STOP? What are you moving for? Today is the day to STOP in your tracks, because the next step may be something that you can't handle without receiving what you need when you are stopped. Even a car stops for gas, can't God's people stop from Him! Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Isaiah 39:1-4, "4 ...And he said, “What have they seen in your house?” So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that <em>is</em> in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image11.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6008" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image11.jpg" alt="image" width="236" height="177" /></a></strong>

Hezekiah in the previous chapters totally depended on God anytime there was a crisis even one that would take his life. His story is also recorded in <b>2Kings 20</b>. God had sent prophet Isaiah to bring him a message to put his house in order when he was sick and would not recover. We see him humble himself before the Lord<strong>,<!--more--> Isaiah 38:2-3, “2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the Lord, 3 and said, “Remember now, O Lord, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly</strong>”. At this point, the Lord sends a message back to Hezekiah through Isaiah saying <strong>Isaiah 38:5-6, "5 ...I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; surely I will add to your days fifteen years. 6 I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.” </strong>What a great testimony, however even with a great testimony there is danger of pride. The next chapter shows what can happen even in the midst of victory.

In this chapter, the ambassadors from Babylon heard of Hezekiah’s sickness and miraculous healing. So they came to visit with him,<strong> Isaiah 39:2, "And Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his treasures—the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all his armory—all that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them”. </strong>Instead of giving God all the glory, testifying of God’s goodness and mercy to a people who worshiped idolatry, he uses this opportunity that presented itself to be prideful to display his wealth.

How easy it is when we have cried to the Lord to rescue us many times, we come to a place where we forget the one who rescued us and pride comes in to cripple us. You remember those days you spent time praying in humility trusting God to meet your needs. Now that blessings have flooded your life, yes you still pray but you come to realize that you dependence on God for healing, finances, protections have somehow taken a back sit. This was the effect of pride in Hezekiah’s life, departing from simple reliance on God.

Based on what he had done, the prophet told him that all he had shown the Babylonians will be taken by them. Not only that, he told him that they would take some of his sons into captivity. His response?, <strong>vs. 8, "So Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good!” For he said, “At least there will be peace and truth in my days.” </strong>In my judgment, he is not showing the fervency of intense prayer he had for his sons like he did when he and his people were in trouble. He was glad that at least it will not happen in his lifetime. He may have acknowledged his sin and repented of it, and owned that the sentence pronounced was but just and right; and that there was a mixture of mercy and goodness in it, however where is the cry to God to spare his sons? His other pride I conclude in this verse was that at least what was going to come escape would escape him; and not deal with them in his time was comforting to him and made him glad.

Pride is a hindrance, pride is a snare. When you think you have mastered everything, watch out, pride is crouching at your door. It’s mission is to take you off your reliance on God and make you confident in what you have (self-reliance). It’s other mission is make you comfortable in what you may be pardoned for without the regards of those who are to come so as to have a concern for them too. May we walk in humility relying on God. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 4:18, "And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. 19, And he said to his father, "My head, my head!" So he said to a servant, "Carry him to his mother." </strong>

In practical living you are either going to be part of the solution or part of the problem. Part of the problem is making things harder than they already are while part of the solution is looking for avenues, opportunities and ideas to face and tackle the present situations.<!--more--> The bible says, "<strong>one shall chase a thousand, two shall put ten thousand to flight</strong>". What a way to double forces in a situation because of what God does with two who are in agreement. Remember it's not addition but multiplication (doubling forces). "<strong>And how will two walk unless they agree</strong>" Why do you think the enemy fights unity? If he can set couples to fight against each other, he will have no one fight him. Praying together as part of the solution will do wonders. God might show your spouse something for both of you that could have not happened had you not come in agreement. One might see something the other did not see. Also you are going to be either an encourager or a discourager, the choice is yours.

<strong>Vs 23, "So he said, "Why are you going to him today? It is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath." And she said, "It is well."</strong> This was said by the Shunammite's husband. He is asking why his wife is going to find the man of God. Is he forgetting he has a dead son? Also why does she have to do it today? why not tomorrow, another day, at a specific time? Is faith based on season?. He probably did not know that he was discouraging his wife from doing something that could restore their son. After all, it's by her that they received a son and it's by her faith that THEIR son could (will) be restored. She needs a little encouragement, a little support and because she will not receive it from the man she loves, she encourages herself with this three words "IT IS WELL". Not doing it for herself (MY) but for her husband too (OUR). In the natural circumstances it is not well, Faith sees beyond the natural and negates the facts.

<strong>Vs. 26, "Please run now to meet her, and say to her, "Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?"' And she answered, "It is well."</strong> She takes a trip, her husband is not accompanying her. She has a destiny, the life of THEIR son depends on the moves she makes and finally when she is seen far off by the man of God, the man of God sends his servant to make sure everything is well and she says "it is well". How would she say it is well with her husband when she hasn't received any help from him? She had a chance to talk negative about her husband before the man of God. Remember she did not get any help, instead she chose to defend her husband. She had a chance to do her husband evil but she did not. It’s damaging to hear how some people negatively talk about their spouses. Being quick to display their weakness, this does a lot of damage. It is well with her son? he is not dead until the man of God comes and certify that he is. Not that she doesn't know the difference, she is acting by faith. Is it well with her? not really, she must be emotionally exhausted, physically drained, maybe frustrated by what is happening in her home yet she understands that it's not over until God says it's over. Practical living is when you have faith for something greater when someone else does not see it. Your approach to situations can boost the faith of the other person when they see the calmness in you and how you deal with things in a dignified manner. Being calm in the midst of the storm. You don't have things in place but you are not consumed by what is around you. Yes you may sit and cry for a while yet you reach to that point where you take action. You sail through the storm without the storm coming into you. Long story short, the boy came back to life after Elisha came and prayed to God. I believe the husband had more respect and admiration for his wife, her faith, her tenacity. His faith must have been boosted, he got his son back, he must have increased the trust of his wife's judgment and must have loved his wife even more. She was no ordinary woman, something like this could have destroyed other marriages but she sought opportunities even in hardship to make it better knowing both their strengths and their weaknesses.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 4:18, "And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. 19, And he said to his father, "My head, my head!" So he said to a servant, "Carry him to his mother." </strong>

<strong>2Kings 4:20, "When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died</strong>". What do you do when is supposed to be "OUR" responsibility turns out to be "MY" responsibility when it's broken? The Shunammite woman and her husband enjoyed the presence of their son, a son of old age, a son to pass to pass inheritance to.<!--more--> Having a son was huge therefore this husband must have been respected and for that reason things changed. The bible does not call this woman notable for nothing because even in the midst of tough situation, she can still calm herself when no one is around to calm her down. A responsible father would have taken a step to see what needs to be done, worked together as a couple to see how their son can be cured. The bible says the boy sat on her knees till noon and then died. Could it be possible that she was confused as to what to do next while the boy sat on her knees? maybe frustrated by the fact that she is left to deal with the tough situation alone. What do you do at times when those who should be there for you are not there for you? I know God has a way of cushioning you to encourage yourself. Don't stay frustrated because someone who needed to help you is not there when you really needed them the most. God may use them many times, and there are days God will use you to be your own encourager. God may show you that He reserved a tank of encouragement in you for a time like this. The timing has to be right. This is practical living knowing that your help is in the name of the Lord and that God is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. God with His help may trust you with a responsibility He would not allow your spouse or friend to have. I believe this works to your advantage therefore how you react to your spouse' weaknesses will be different. The husband had his own strengths, providing for the family, I also see a weakness in him, not knowing what to do in tough situation.

<strong>Vs. 21,”And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out. 22Then she called to her husband, and said, "Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back." </strong>We have a husband who has quit too soon, he even discourages his wife from doing something about their situation as you read the passage. On the other hand we have a wife who is very unique. A dead child on her knees, what's next? No one to comfort her at their time of loss. The miracle worker is not present, not even sure if He has the power to raise the dead. She can't even cry over what she has lost, in other words no pity party for her. What appears to be over for everybody is not over for her yet and that is why instead of burying her dead son, she places him on the bed of the man of God and takes a journey by herself to find him. She has faith when no one else does, she knows she has to do something about the situation or it will never be done. God bless the wives, they have such spirit of perseverance, they stick with it till it's done, they don't quit too early. They know how to pick themselves up and keep moving. There are husbands who will agree with me that had it not been for their wives who stood by them through thick and thin, they would have made some wrong business decisions, given up on dreams, jobs, desires, progression you name it. Some husbands almost threw in the towel but their wives believed in them to encourage them not to give up. God created help meet, God pulled her not from the head so she would rule over him or from the legs that she would be beneath him but from the side that they would be on the same page and work together. <strong>Practical living celebrates one’s strength in the midst of one’s weakness and not letting one’s weakness bring you down</strong>. You can see your spouse through the eyes of faith, if the Lord has not given up on him or her in his or her weakness, you too shouldn’t. Great lessons are learnt a lot in those times where weaknesses manifest. God uses them to refine us. To finish, Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2kings 4:18, "And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. 19, and he said to his father, "my head, my head!" so he said to a servant, "carry him to his mother." </strong>

Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor, Ecclesiastes 4:9. They say, "many hands make work light". For a responsibility to be accomplished, there has to be someone or some responsible people to accomplish it. It's good to be responsible as it eliminates a lot of aggravations.<!--more--> I don't like to fool around with irresponsible people because they are a burden. Responsible people are easy to work with, they are reliable, accountable, able to make moral or rational decisions, can be trusted, need minimum or no supervision, can make good judgments and act on them and they are sensitive.

I believe a good marriage is also based on being responsible. It's one of the ingredients to a successful lasting marriage. Working together as a team and accomplishing what needs to be accomplished together. I know of wives who hope their husbands would learn more on how to be responsible. See things they need to work on and not be told or nagged to do them, a husband who is sensitive to the needs of his wife. Knowing how and when to step in and help, many times going out of his way to do things for her that he never feels comfortable doing or he is not used to simply because he loves her. Not doing things out of obligation but out of love. I would think they are asking for too much. Imagine for a wife who works coming home after a long day at work and may be the husband got home early, got some time to relax in front of TV. I would say it will be responsible for the relaxed husband to help ease up the burden the wife has had by starting dinner, or maybe helping clean, getting her tea ready when she comes home. Let her sit and relax too. This is doing the right thing without being told. If working in the kitchen together, one doing dishes and the other cooking, talking and catching up. This makes work easy, opens doors of communication and being on the same page. I don't believe a wife needs another mama's boy who she has to tell what he should and shouldn't do. I thank God for a mom and a dad who set such a high standard for me to learn and live by. God bless them.

I would like to take this biblical story and share some practical lessons for us all. I love the story of the Shunnamite woman.They called her the notable (great) woman. Very sensitive to other people's needs. In this case to a man of God by the name of Elisha. She has a void in her life, has no child but none of that steals her character. She does everything she can and knows how, to make sure that the man of God is fed and is well cared for. Husbands, thank God for your notable wives. After sometime, she receives a gift inform of a child spoken in her life and indeed it comes to pass. Not only is she blessed but her husband is blessed too because he has a son in his old age. A son he can pass his inheritance to. As the son grew it happens that one time while working with his father, he became sick and what does the father do, he tells the servants to take him to his mother. As long as it's whole, it's our responsibility, but when it's broken, it's your responsibility. The priest of the home should be responsible, in control, doing everything he can with the help of his partner (wife) to take care of a responsibility (son). Be it broken or not, it's "our", putting thoughts together, using different abilities and skills, strengthening one another during tough time and not tearing or making it difficult for the other person. This is practical living. To continue. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 5:15-17, “15 Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, 16 making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. 17 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is”. (NIV)</strong>

We covered “<strong>walking in Love</strong>” and “<strong>walking in the light</strong>”, today, I address “<strong>Walking in wisdom</strong>”.

I tend to find it hard to distinguish between “knowledge” and “wisdom”. I find that you can have “knowledge” but little or no “wisdom”, let me qualify my statement. You can have book knowledge and have no wisdom to apply that knowledge. Moreover, if we are going to have a glorious marriage, then we need more than just knowledge, we need wisdom to apply the knowledge.<!--more-->

What is wisdom?, <strong>Good sense shown in a way of thinking, or action. The ability to make sensible decisions and judgments based on personal knowledge and experience.</strong> Wisdom discerns and directs on application. People mess things up when they are unable to discern (examine, evaluate, understand and approach with wisdom), in <strong>Proverbs 9:10,</strong> we are told,<strong> “The fearof the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding”.</strong> I am amazed at some believers that have zeal but little or no wisdom. They wreck good things because they do not know how to handle it. We are told, the fear of the Lord is the “beginning”, it is just a start to gain wisdom, and as we walk and are led of Him, we gain more wisdom that is helpful to us in life.

It is by wisdom as one of the ingredients that a marriage grows. By it we each learn our roles, our position in our God given marriage. How we treat each other, manage family affairs, finances, assets, balancing ministry and marriage among other things depend on how we apply wisdom. <strong>“Through wisdom a house is built, And by understanding it is established”, Proverbs 24:3.</strong>

Paul says, “<strong>be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise</strong>”, lack of wisdom has wrecked a number of marriages. I have heard of cases where husbands confessed how they wrecked their marriages foolishly. They had good intentions and knowledge and wanted to do good things but lacked wisdom to pull it through. We have to be very careful how we live and how we treat those we live with. I constantly pray for wisdom because I need it in my marriage.

You can say the right thing, without wisdom it may come out wrong in your tone of voice or presentation. You need to ask yourself, what you want to say, will it come out as disrespectful, demeaning or unloving? We need wisdom in communicating. Are you applying wisdom in how you spend what God gives you? Are you applying wisdom in balancing your work and marriage? You could be working hard to provide excellent living for your family and nothing wrong with that, the question is, are you out of balance, neglecting your time with your spouse? Have you fallen on this trap many believers do; <strong>too busy serving the Lord, sacrificing your marriage for the sake of your ministry? </strong>Be wise, your marriage is your number one ministry. If you are involved in ministry right now and your marriage is suffering, apply wisdom, put the ministry on hold, go and work on your marriage first. Christ did not call you to die for the church, He already did. He called you to die for your spouse.

By wisdom, you will know who your enemy is, your spouse is not your enemy. By wisdom you will defend your spouse and not put him or her down. By wisdom you will know who to hang out with knowing there are threats out there after your marriage. I call them parasites (that drain you and your marriage), the parasites could be friends or family members, you need wisdom to create boundaries. By wisdom you will not allow those little foxes to devour what is good. By wisdom as Paul says in vs. 16, you will not waste precious time destroying, instead you will build, <strong>“... making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil that is the wise thing to do.</strong>” Are you walking in wisdom? Are you wrecking your marriage right now because you lack wisdom? Seek God, read his word, obey the truth and practice what you read, <strong>James 1:5, “If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him”. </strong>

God is most glorified in our marriages when we are most satisfied in Him and with the spouse He has given us, “...<strong>for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure”, Philippians 2:13, </strong>growing and conforming us into His image for His glory<strong>. </strong>May God’s glory be displayed in each our of marriages, may He make His name great in this hard, delicate and complicated relationship that only He can bring unity in diversity. Let us <strong>Walk in love, walk in the light, walk in wisdom</strong>. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 5:8-10, “8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light 9 (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth), 10 finding out what is acceptable to the Lord”</strong>

I outlined three things I believe are key ingredients to a glorious marriage,<strong>1.Walking in love, 2. Walking in the light, and 3. Walking in wisdom.</strong> We looked at, “<strong>Walking in love</strong>”, to continue let me share on “<strong>Walking in the light”<!--more--></strong>

Have you ever tried to find your way in your house in the dark? you walked slowly, carefully, stretching your hand to feel stuff, trying to use your mind to recall where everything is then suddenly, out of nowhere, your toes finds a piece of furniture?. Ouch!!!, deep cry, movement altered, a few words mumbled, not fun right?

To have a glorious marriage is to walk in the light, I call it, “walking in the light of the gospel”. The gospel is not just for the unbelievers only, it is for us. When you graduate, you don’t throw away things you learned that brought you to the point of graduation do you? You utilize  and apply it in your life. Paul says vs. 5, “<strong>We once walked in darkness before we were redeemed</strong>,” dashing our toes’ on things of this world, wounding ourselves day by day. Not only are we now walking in the light, we are light because Christ glows in us and through us. We ought to treat our spouses as people in the light, the gospel light and not only in the presence of everyone but also in private. How many times can you recall fighting on Sunday morning or some other times and you did not feel like being nice to each other that day, you go to church fighting all the way? This hindered your worship among other things.

Read what Paul is addressing as signs of a person walking in the light of <b>vs. "9 (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all <span style="text-decoration:underline;">goodness, righteousness, and truth</span>."</b> How do you walk in the light before your spouse? show<strong> GOODNESS.</strong> Goodness here is moral excellence, benevolence in thought, word, and deed. Husbands looking at things online they should not, entertaining lustful thoughts are not walking in the light before God and their  spouses. We as husbands need pure thoughts, looking out for God’s daughters whom He gave us to care for. We will one day give an account as to how we treated His daughters. So let us thrive to walk in the light without covering things or stone walling. If you are struggling, share with your spouse, be naked and not a shamed (be real). Part of your freedom comes from being real. Let us be thoughtful in word and deed. Give each other a reason to look forward to coming home, a place where words of encouragements, helping each with responsibilities, leaving kind notes, complimenting, laying down your lives for each other is experienced. Be a light unto the young ones who are growing up, neighbors, family members, a demonstration of a glorious marriage ordained by God.

Life of<strong> RIGHTEOUSNESS</strong> is a life of moral integrity and rightness as God sees it and in relation to man. God put you in your marriage to refine you and conform you into His image. This is a learning and stretching ground, this should drive you to honor your spouse by living a life that is pleasing to God, a life of integrity, a life of character. If you were asked to do a presentation, would you not put extra effort to work hard to bring the best? How is this not different with marriage? I have a responsibility as a husband to be the best God wants me to be, I have to work hard, learn, grow because someone’s life is in my care. Will this not drive me to live righteously?

To walk in the light is to live in<strong> TRUTH</strong>. What is truth? moral reality, honesty, sincerity, and straightforwardness, as opposed to all that is false. How many times we hear couples say they do not trust each other? Insecurities, lack of confidence. Where there is no honesty, sincerity or straightforwardness, marriage suffers. Where there is no agreement how will two walk? Living a truthful life is a challenge but it brings about freedom and unity. We can have glorious marriages when we walk in the light of goodness, righteousness and truth.

Examine yourself today, where are you? Are you walking in love and light? Pray to God, let Him show you areas you have compromised in not treating your spouse in the light of the gospel.<strong> James 5:16, “Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”</strong>. Do not let your prayers be hindered for the sake of unresolved issues. To finish, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 5:1-2, "1 Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. 2 And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma”</strong>

When I was a little boy in Africa, with friends we would often play our own made up games. One of the games I remember pretty well was a game we called “cha mama”. This is where we imitated our parents on how they handled their day-to-day activities as a couple.<!--more--> We would have a boy play father, a girl play mother; the kids who were a little younger than us would play the children. We did an excellent job as we tried to imitate what we would see our parents do, how they treated each other, children, responsibilities etc The only script we had was memories of what we saw and experienced through our parents. God calls us to imitate someone concerning marriage too.

I believe one of the greatest reasons for marriages is for God to make His name great as we grow in holiness. It’s a refining ground. I still remember something before I got married Tom Readyoff an elder from my church once said from the pulpit that changed my whole approach to marriage. He said, “<em>what if God created marriage not so that we can be happy primarily but that we can be holy</em>” (paraphrased) how would that change us?

Early chapters of the book <strong>Ephesians</strong> all the way to <strong>chapter 5</strong> prepares us believers. Teaching us how we ought to live. I believe part of it prepares us to be better in our marriages. There are three things addressed in <strong>chapter 5</strong> I believe are key ingredients to a glorious marriage<strong> 1. Walking in love, 2. Walking in the light, 3. Walking in wisdom</strong>.

Today lets deal with “<strong>Walking in love</strong>”. The first thing Paul tells us in <strong>vs</strong>.<strong>1 “Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. 2 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">And walk in love</span>, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma." </strong>Unless we are daily cultivating a vertical relationship with the Father of love who teaches us how to love, how can we effectively love another person? This is why many girls who never had a father figure in the home find it hard to pick a good husband if they never saw it at home. They never had a chance of learning what it means to truly be loved, unconditional love, so the world gives them its own version of love and they accept it. The same for boys who never saw and felt what it means to be loved and in turn learn to give love. How would he do it? We are told to be imitators of God, that vertical relationship is what will drive us to better our horizontal love relationship with our spouses. In remembering how we played games imitating our parents, it later played in life on how I chose and relate to my wife.

How do we imitate God, vs. 2 tells us,<strong> "Walk in love". </strong>Walking in love means more than saying “I love you” or having warm feelings. Christ loved us and demonstrated that love by giving Himself as an offering and a sacrifice to God as a sweet aroma. This is sacrificial love. Christ did not give Himself to those who deserved it, He gave Himself because He chose to love us and He did it to the glory of God. If we view marriage as a means to an end, then we will be opened to disappointments for the person we are married to is far from perfection and need work themselves. What an atmosphere to be conformed in the image of Christ as God works in each of us to bring about unity in diversity. <strong>Each spouse has no greater calling or purpose than that of imitating Christ our Lord</strong>. Christ laid down His life for His bride even when she did not deserve it. This is the kind of love that keeps marriage strong, self-sacrificing love that goes beyond faults and weaknesses and looking at the person we are married to and saying something like this, “<em>if Christ has loved you even when you did not deserve it, I will love you because the love of Christ dwells in me, I will imitate Christ, His love compels me to</em>”

How do we strengthen this love? By protecting it from things that want to diminish in it vs. 3 tells us to put away immorality/adultery (lust), greed, filthiness, foolish talks or coarse joking, and deception but give place to thanksgiving which brings about contentment. You have limited growth trying to be the spouse God wants you to be in your marriage unless you daily commune with Him. You cannot deal and resist things that want to diminish love unless you are constantly cultivating your vertical relationship. Be in the word, be in prayer and imitate Christ in your marriage, let Him be glorified. To continue…Blessings Ev

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 32:1-35, “21 And Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?” 22 So Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord become hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil”</strong>

Deliverance from the Egyptians was the cry of the Israelites to God for 400 years. They wished to be freed from bondage, oppression, slavery and so on and so forth. And when finally God sent Moses to deliver them, God had a bigger plan for them with Him as the center of His plan. His main goal was to free them that they may serve Him starting at Mt.<!--more--> Sinai. This was more than get them to a nice place free from all trouble (land that flows with milk and honey) though that came with the deliverance. God speaking to Pharaoh through Moses and Aaron said <strong>Exodus 5: 1, “… ‘Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness”, Exodus 10:3, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me.”</strong>

At Mt. Sinai where they were to worship the true God who had brought them this far, they became impatient in the absence of Moses who was up the mountain with God for only 40 days compared to 400 years in bondage. They were anxious to get to the promise land that instead of seeking God to continue lead them there, they chose plan B, make gods who would lead them to the promise land Yahweh had promised them. And who did they turn to, Aaron who <strong>gladly gave them what they craved</strong> . We do not find that he said one word to discountenance their proposal. Aaron was a priest and was suppose to exercise his priestly duties even in the absence of Moses the type of Christ in this passage (the mediator between God and man). Aaron chose to heed to the voice of the people to give them what they wanted Moses held him accountable. Vs. “<strong>21 And Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?”. </strong>When Moses confronted him, Aaron shifted the blame to the people not taking any responsibility vs.<strong> 22 So Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord become hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil”</strong>

In our times, we have Aarons’ who have neglected their priestly duties of preaching the word so as to cater for man’s humanistic needs. A number have become men pleasers rather than God. The house of the Lord where true worship ought to rise, some have become weary and have chosen to yield to the pressure of the people to give them what they want. While that may feel good, it presents a problem of leading people outside of God’s will.<!--more-->

Our generation has forgotten the whole reason we were freed from the bondage of sin and many of our priests instead of turning us back to the true worship with Christ as the center of it, they have helped us build golden calf with what we have provided them, things we worship more than we do Yahweh. We are worshiping materialistic things, health and prosperity and all we care about is not so much freed to come and worship the true God but freed to be rushed to the promise land. And since God is not fast enough, let’s find other pragmatic ways to answer our own prayer. Turn back to the gods of the Egyptians, bring back the things we abandoned to help us in this journey. Borrow from the world and it’s ways and hope to make it. We have to remember that Egypt was successful in prosperity, military, influence etc, the Israelites wanted to tap into that success by trying to serve some of their gods. Sad but true, many churches in our generation are fashioned the Egyptian way, borrowing from Egypt to build a church and Christ is not the center of it.

We are in danger when the Aarons’ of our day will not stand, unmoved, unshaken for the sake of Christ. My prayer and I hope is yours is that God will keep our pastors (shepherds) strong and faithful and raise more leaders who are not afraid to call sin what it is whether it’s popular or not. Leaders who are bold to stand in public, media, in interviews and speak truth like it is without going in circles and can’t make a stand. <strong>Leaders who are not swayed by the voice of people but are faithful to God’s call and are pointing us all who believe to the center of our worship</strong>, <strong>“Christ and Him crucified”. </strong>Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:1&amp;2, “1 I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit"</strong>

We all have goals and time frames to accomplish them. If you have goals, you work hard to achieve them and many times within the time frame you have allocated those goals. Often times you find that in pursuit of your goal, there are some things that occur that creates setbacks or delays in what you are working hard towards.<!--more-->The setbacks can be painful and costly but they are there and have to be dealt with. Setbacks will not push you forward rather backwards if not making you stagnant. This could take days, weeks, months and even years. Do we ever wonder why at times we have setbacks in our lives?

<strong>John 15</strong> is a good chapter that paints the picture of how setbacks work. Jesus likened Himself to the True Vine and the Father as the Vinedresser. As believers we are connected to the True vine as branches. And the branches have significant roles of bearing fruit. Jesus says,<strong> "Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away</strong>". Note how He puts it, "every branch IN ME", in other words, every believer connected to Him should bear fruit and there has to be things within that believer that allows them to stay connected and be fresh to bear fruit. The branches that do not bear fruit are dead branches He takes away because they do not belong to Him. No one can take them away but Him. It is my hope that we do not fall into this category.

"...<strong>and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit</strong>". This is where many of us are, it's not that the branch is not bearing fruit, the reason for the setback. And it's not always sin that sets us back, at times it's because God wants us to bear more fruit. So He may take away a good thing that is happening in your life, of course that would create setbacks, however He knows what He is doing. We know the devil loves to whisper in our ears the reason we are going through what we are facing is because we messed up. When David was anointed to be king, for the next 17 years he was running for his life, not because he sinned but because He was being pruned to bear more fruit and so was Job, Daniel and many others in the bible. It was not even to teach them a lesson, it was to get them to bear more fruit. The pruning the Lord does is to allow His children to grow and be stronger. You may have seen yourself being married by now and nothing has happened and you wonder whether you sinned or missed God's will or you are being taught a lesson and the like.<strong> The blessing may be delayed but not denied</strong>. It could be the Lord wants to develop more of the fruit of patience, faith, self-control among others things. You may have worked hard to get a job and you did but then you lost it and it created a setback, you never know, maybe the Lord is developing your character and integrity that will sustain you when he opens greater doors. You may have desired to be in ministry and nothing has happened yet, could be the Lord is teaching you leadership, submission, humility and more. He is not saying you don’t have fruit in your life, He says<strong> "that it may bear more fruit</strong>", He wants to get more of it out of you. This could also be the grounds of testimonies that despite all that has happened, God knew what He was doing and in His right time, He made all things beautiful.

<strong>You and I can look at the setbacks as TEMPORARY situations that delay what we want to achieve</strong>. It's upon us to look at them as things the Lord is using to get more fruit out of us. We can also look at them as a means of growth. Instead of crying to the Lord asking why we have them, we can pray "Lord what can I learn and grow from this". Over the years I have seen setbacks in my life help me grow and I thank God for them. My wife and I have had major setbacks but we chose to see them as a means of growth and they have. If you want to bear more fruit, expect setbacks (Pruning). Blessings Ev

<p>The beginning of the new year has been tough for a number, we as a family have faced touugh challenges with health, finances etc as well. In our prayer time this morning, the Lord reminded us of John 15 that deals with pruning to encourage us. May I reblog this message I shared before to encourage us all who are facing great challenges.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 42:5, "Why are you cast down, O my soul? .... Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him For the help of His countenance"</strong>

There are days we feel like God is distant or He is present but not saying anything in our situations. To make it even more painful, we sometimes battle people who add more flame into the fire. They lie on you, they try to make your life difficult and you sit and wonder, how can a loving God allow such terrible things to happen to the ones He calls His own?<!--more-->

You might have heard of a story about a man who dreamt that he was at a beach somewhere walking with the Lord. He noticed two sets of foot prints, one was his and the other was the Lord's. It felt good and pleasant to have the Lord walking besides him as he could see a sign of His presence through His foot prints. When the last scene of his life flashed before him, he looked back at the footprints and noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life. This bothered him that he launched a complaint to God. <i>"What's up with you that when I need you the most that is when I don't even feel or see you at all?". </i>Have you been there when the God seemed silent in your situation and felt like you were left to walk and battle alone?

The Lord said unto him, "My precious, precious child, I love you and would never leave you. <strong>During your times of trial and tribulation, when you saw only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you</strong>". Do you see that when he thought the single foot prints were his, actually they were the Lord's? When you think about how far you have made it with all the trials and difficulties, when you thought you were making it by yourself, check again to see that the foot prints that you saw as yours making it alone were God's carrying you through. This is why the Psalmist goes back to ask why his soul is down and challenges his soul to hope in God. He wanted to remind His soul that God was carrying him through. Three times in <b>Psalm 42:5, 11, 43:5,</b> he repeats the same line to revive his soul.

Why the soul and not the heart or the kidneys or any other organ in the body? <strong>The soul is the animating and vital principle in humans, credited with the faculties of thought, action, and emotion and often conceived as an immaterial entity</strong>. <strong>This is where I believe your response affects your destiny</strong>. The soul needs to be revived to hope in God for you to progress into your destiny.

While hoping in God, the psalmist encourages his soul to praise Him for the help of His countenance, <strong>Psalm 103, "Bless the Lord oh MY SOUL and all that is within me bless His holy name”</strong>. To keep the soul revived, you have to warm it with praises, "<strong>My soul magnifies the Lord, and my Spirit rejoices in the Lord My Savior</strong>" The more you concentrate on one set of foot prints you think are yours, your soul will stay down believing that you are handling it alone. When you realize that you are not alone, a bigger hand is carrying you through without even saying a word, you will revive your soul to praise Him anyway. Paul revived his soul by saying <strong>2Timothy 1:12, "For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day</strong>". <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">You can only speak like Paul when you know that you don't have to see two sets of foot prints to know that He is present.</span></strong>

Trade your heavy heart for a heart of joy, celebrate what the Lord has done. Let His joy be your strength. May you be reminded that He is carrying you through and the footprints you see as yours are actually His, you are not making it by your own strength. Revive your soul to hope in God, our hope is built on nothing less than Jesus. When God seems silent, He is carrying you through. Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 30:5, "... Weeping may endure for a night, But joy comes in the morning"</strong>

I've been to a few graduations of course including mine. Graduations tend to be one of those happy times seeing someone graduating, surrounded by family and friends. Because it's a joyous day, you will not find anyone in such occasions sad. <!--more-->But go back to what led to this occasion and find a lot of hard work, sleepless nights working on unending projects, writing reports, researching, studying etc., There were times of feeling like giving up but still endured to make it till the end. A goal was set and had to be worked towards. One thing that strikes me out of all these,<strong> the plan did not change for things to take place; one had to gain strength and confidence to work out the plan already executed</strong>.

How often do we hope that things will change when they get hard and complicated. We even pray for the Lord to move and change them. He has set the plan that you can see at the end of the tunnel but you hope that the burden will get easier for you to make it through. I am here to let you know that the Lord will not rearrange the process because it's the process He is using to put you together.<strong> The process is the recipe to produce an end result</strong>. The Psalm I gave above says, "<strong>weeping may endure for a night</strong>", hardship at times calls for weeping and its okay to weep, however it is not okay to allow the weeping to terminate the process that will lead you to your destination. It's required to endure meaning to carry you through to continue in existence.<strong> So don't pray for the rearrangement of the process, pray for the strength to endure the process</strong>. Night can be associated with loneliness, darkness, not seeing what lies ahead and believe me, it can be long. At times when it's getting to dawn, it becomes even darker and colder, that reminds us of the students when they are about to graduate, more endurance is needed to study for the finals. It becomes hectic and hard but the student just can't give up at dawn, their joy in the morning is just around the corner when they finish the finals and pass. They may endure alone in the night, but thank God it's not forever.

The bible says in<strong> Psalm 126:5, "Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy"</strong>, how that is so true and that is why we need God every day to give us strength to go on. It is hard and we all know for sure, however we need a bigger hand not to change what we are facing but give us the strength and grace to endure through the night. The endurance has a lot of lessons you cannot learn in a classroom. You have a greater testimony when you endure so whatever you are going through today, don't ask God to change it, ask Him for strength to go on, your joy is about to come and you are about to reap too. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Timothy 2:1-13, vs. “2 ...You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ”</strong>

At the beginning of each year as I turn on Christian TV, I always hear things such as “<em>this is the year of favor”, “God has promised to do something spectacular in your life this new year</em>” among many promises. While listening, not always do all these things come to pass. <!--more-->

We are sometimes promised things Jesus never promised believers. We then come to another new year and the cycle of promises continues. With many episodes of situations we’ve experienced as a family and no doubt you’ve had your own experiences, do we ever sit and wonder whether we are fire proofed for the perilous times to come?

Jesus warned of difficult days a head, read <b>Matthew 24 </b>for instance. To our shame as servants of the Lord, we’ve prepped believers for blessings,<strong> but rarely have we taken time to prepare believers for difficult times ahead</strong>. If you’ve realized, the world is not changing for the better, it’s getting worse and worse, getting darker and scary and as believers we better get ready for those difficult times. Someone once said, “<strong><em>tough times don’t last, tough people do</em></strong>”. While the difficult times may not spare His children, God is going to require His children to shine brighter in the midst of difficult times. I believe that unless His children prepare or are prepared for those times, many will crumble.

In response to what we are facing, I came across a pamphlet that left me thinking in preparation for a snow storm. You know some of the good tips they give, they say begin by filling your cars with gasoline. This may save your life if you’re in your car and end up stuck in the snow. Keep a blanket, water, food, a little bit of sand and shovel in your car at all times, this will come in handy if you get stuck in the snow. Even if you can’t dig yourself out, the blanket, food and water will sustain you until help arrives. Charge your cell phone. You may lose home phone service during a snow storm, and you’ll need your cell phone battery charged to call for help in the event of an emergency. Go food shopping, get plenty of non-perishables ready-to-eat food, store water. You will want one gallon of water per person per day. Get plenty of firewood! You’ll need dry firewood as a heat source in the event that you loose power during the snow storm. Some winter storms – ice storms, especially – can result in power outages that last days, sometimes more than a week!.

You don’t need to prepare if there is no storm a head, but if there is, you owe it to your good senses to pay attention. To point out, these are more than good suggestions, they are preparation to make you comfortable in the storm to come (mark that I am not using the word happy). To be caught unaware and unprepared in the storm is deadly and so is being unprepared in our spiritual walk. While what I mentioned above are physical preparations, as a believer we need to be spiritually ready. We better be like the 5 wise virgins who had oil in their lamps burning even at midnight when the groom arrived. We better be ready to have our lamps burning brighter in the midst of the storm, wind etc. to continue…Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 20:1-' "vs. 1 “In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, went to him and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die, and not live.’ ” 2 Then he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,“Remember now, O Lord, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done<em> what was</em> good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly”</strong>

Hezekiah was sick and near death then there came a prophet who brought him bad news. His message from the Lord to Hezekiah was to set his house in order meaning write his will and let it be known to his family for he wasn’t going to live. <!--more-->What would your reaction be if you were to receive a similar message? The prediction sounded final, it came from the Lord, however Hezekiah knew his God was willing to hear his appeal. Instead of being angry with the Lord and His prophet, he chose to go to God directly and not through the prophet as he had received a message. The only reason he could go to the Lord directly was because of his walk with the Lord<strong>, Hebrews 4:16, "Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need".</strong>

<strong>Vs. 2,"Then he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,“Remember now, O Lord, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done what was good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly”.</strong> Reading this may suggest he went to Lord to plead for his healing, contrary. When he began to pray, you come to realize he did not ask for healing, all he did was say <strong>“remember now, my walk before you in truth, my loyal heart, done good things in Your sight</strong>”. Hezekiah was in his prime when he received this message. His number one prayer was of remembrance of his walk with the Lord. How his walk brought glory to God when some of the gone kings had done evil before God. His greater faith in God to do great things was not so much based on his faith on what God could do but rather on what God had done. As my friend Pastor Darren Adwalpalker preached sometime back, he said there are people who walk forward to the future by faith trusting in the Lord and there are people who walk into the future backwards meaning looking back (remembering), which builds their faith as they trust God.

There are three things out of this story in sequence that touched my heart<strong>. 1. Hezekiah desired healing that he would continue to walk and glorify God on earth. 2. He desired healing not so much for his sake but for the sake of his country, especially his son Manasseh who was about 12 years old. If Hezekiah died, then his young son would have no father to train him in the things of God and groom him to be the next king at young age. Another thing, his rival Senacherib would boast, robbing God the glory He would continue to enjoy. 3. He desired healing that he would live in his prime years and enjoy God’s blessings.</strong> This is <strong>God first, other’s second, you third, hence we could acronym the word JOY(J-esus first, O-thers second, Y-ou last). </strong>Hezekiah’s cry to the Lord followed the same sequence.

The question that I should be asking myself when I am sick or in need of anything else should not be primarily about receiving what I desire. If I am coming to God for healing for example, my question should be, 1. Is my primary reason for God’s glory in my sickness and healing? Our greatest aim is let God make His name great in what He does, 2. How best will the healing advance His kingdom in the life of my loved ones, my friends and people around who may under estimate the power of God to heal? 3. How will the healing affect me personally as a Christian? Will it help me grow more in Christ? etc. This is how to approach everything we pray to God about. Hezekiah prayed and God heard his prayer and added him another 15 years of life. You never know what God can do with this kind of approach as we fulfill the commandment,<strong> Mathew 22:37-39, "37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself". GOD FIRST, OTHERS SECOND, YOU THIRD. </strong>Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 2:1-3, “ … Then God blessed the seventh day and satisfied if, because in it He rested..."</strong>

In this fast-paced world in which we live, the very thing we need to do is what we often don't do: We need to simply sit still and open our heart to the counsel of God. Then we will be prepared for whatever the day brings. I'm talking about rest this morning, a struggle to many including myself. <!--more-->There is no one who understands rest like God and we see this being recorded in the book of<strong> Genesis 2:1-3, "Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, andHe rested on the seventh day... ,Then God blessed the seventh day and satisfied if, because in it He rested..."</strong> Rest is very important in one's life and should never be taken lightly.

Sometimes the most godly thing we can do for ourselves is go to sleep. Forget about what happened today and what you could have done better, take a break from what you dealt with today and shut everything out and get yourself in a position of rest. Think of this, applying emergency brakes to a fast moving car will bring the wheels to rest but the car body will still be in motion, that is enough to cause a car flip. I would say that applying the brakes gradually will not only bring the wheels at rest but also the body at the same time. Worrying about what hasn't happened or what could happen will rob you of peace and rest you desperately need. The mind needs rest, so is the body and the heart too. Troubled water never settles because of troubling winds but we thank God, He is the quiet still water soothing our souls to sleep.

Jesus comes in later and reminds His people what rest is all about, rest from the burdens of sins.. We know that there can be no true rest outside Christ and the reason is simple, if you are going to rest, you going to have to give up on what is stopping you from resting. In this case, Jesus has offered to take off our hands what we are holding on to that in turn we might have the true rest in Him. He says, "<strong>Come to Me</strong>" which is an action word meaning move from where you are to where He is,<strong> "All you who labor (weary) and are heavy laden (burdened)"</strong> this is the reason why you and I need to move,<strong>"And I will give you rest"</strong> then end result if we do what He ask of us. The main reason for this rest is rest from the burden of sin but has also benefits to the rest in our bodies. If you’ve received rest from your burden of sin, ask for rest for your weary body.

I do believe that you could rest even when working for you are not dealing with things by yourself.<strong>Mathew 11:29, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me",</strong> Though the text has a unique meaning, I could take a principle and apply it in this was, "<strong>take my advice, allow me to help you, let me give you directions and strategies and learn all these things I am teaching you</strong>". The bible says that, "<strong>The joy of the Lord is my strength</strong>" Nehemiah 8:10, and His strength will sustain you, you have a chance to come to Him for rest and energy again.<strong>"For I am gentle, and lowly (humble) of heart, and you will find rest for your souls".</strong> I love the way He says it, you could rest your body and not rest your mind but the Lord is giving the total package, He will not scream at you and He will not even put you down all He wants to do is give you the rest you need. Hide you under the shadow of His wings like a chicken that covers her chicks.<strong>Mathew 11:30, "For My yoke is easy and My burden is light".</strong> The yoke put on the oxen is used to keep them focused, moving in the same direction but with a purpose and it's heavy. The Lord is saying, I will take the yoke you are used to and I will give you mine which is easy, I will guide you, I will be on your side and the burden I have for you is very light cause I am carrying yours which is heavy. Who can resist such an offer?

Perhaps the words of the carpenter, promising rest, is so compelling because of our endless desire and quest to rest. Do you want rest? Do you know where to find rest? The Father rested and sanctified it, the Son called and offered it, will you choose to receive it? If you want to bring under control a fast paced life style, you must eliminate the unnecessary and concentrate on the necessary by wanting to be where God wants you to be. My soul is at rest, my mind is renewed, there is no greater joy than Him being present. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>James 5:16,"Confess to one another therefore your faults (your slips, your false steps, your offenses, your sins) and pray [also] for one another, that you may be healed and restored [to a spiritual tone of mind and heart]. The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working]" (Amplified)</strong>

One of the things that hinder our prayers from reaching our heavenly Father is un forgiveness. Either we've not confessed our sins to the Father that He may forgive us or we have not forgiven someone else who has wronged us or both.<!--more--> <strong>It's not that the prayers reach the Father and then He doesn't act on it, No, it’s because un forgiveness blocks the prayers from reaching the Father. </strong>

It's possible to be offended, Jesus said in <strong>Luke 17:1, "It is impossible that no offenses should come" (NKV)", </strong>we are human, we are prone to mistakes and offenses. With that in mind, I hope that I will not offend or be offended but know in the back of my mind it is possible and may happen. The question is, how do I deal with it when it comes. In my own life, I have placed my confidence in no man because I know men can fail. It's now easier for me to forgive, after all, God in Christ Jesus has forgiven me for wronging Him over and over again. Why should I have something against my brother? Why would I want to hinder my prayers from reaching the Father, because of un-forgiveness? My flesh would want to give them a dose of their own medicine, revenge, make them feel the way I have felt, get even. The only thing un-forgiveness does for me is rob me of freedom I need. <strong>When offended and cannot forgive, the un-forgiveness steals such a great strength out of you and leaves you powerless</strong>. <strong>This means the un-forgiveness has controlling power over you.</strong>

James says, confess it, deal with your un-forgiveness then take it a step further pray for the one you have forgiven. Now this is hard but I believe the key release to your blessings depends on whether you can release and pray for the one you are releasing. Didn't Jesus forgive us and sits right now at the right hand of God the Father praying for us? This is the process of healing, the more you pray for them, the more the power of un forgiveness releases you. <strong>The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working]". </strong>If un-forgiveness has stolen your power, how else can you pray with power? Joseph was put to a test where he needed to forgive his bothers. It was not easy if you read Genesis but he did, <strong>the power of forgiveness was in his hand</strong>. He took the offense and looked at it differently saying, "though you meant it for evil, God turned something good out of it" (paraphrased). <strong>Romans 8:28, "And we know that ALL (not some) things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose". </strong>In the light of His word, I can get illuminations in understanding that everything that happens in my life, good or bad works for my good because I love Him. If I'm offended, it works for my good only if I look and deal with it the way the Lord would have me. It can push me forward or backwards depending on my attitude. If I forgive, how easy my simple prayer to God can be powerful and avail much. The message today is simple, the power of forgiveness in in your hands, let it lock or release you according to the way you use it. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 1:7, "So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, that she (Peninnah) provoked her"</strong>

To understand Samuel’s story, you have to go back to how it all started. Hannah and Peninnah are married to Elkanah. Peninnah had children while Hannah was barren. Peninnah took advantage of Hannah’s barrenness and provoked her for Hannah was loved more than she was yet she had been blessed with fruit of the womb.<!--more--> It was expected that the wife who had children especially boys would be loved and respected.

God gives us diversified gifts and<strong> when we talk about gifts, they are not things worked for or earned, but things bestowed to one</strong>. Some have been blessed with looks, energy to do massive works, have the ability to love the unlovable, can teach, good listeners, good encouragers, such great wisdom to name a few. All these are gifts not everyone around us have them. The gift I have may not be the gift you have but all these gifts tie and bring us together to glorify God. We ought to celebrate diversified gifts from the Lord. In this story, instead of each celebrating each other’s gifts, Peninnah was provoking Hannah the wrong way, while Hannah was troubled by what she did not possess. In the midst of all these, God had grand opportunity to raise the un expected for His glory.

You may be mad at Peninnah for doing such horrible things to Hannah but I would pause and thank God for her. She may be a rough stone but she is significant. Your rivals put you in a better place to call on God even more. Hannah prayed more because she had a rival, She spent much time before God because of her rival. She maximized her faith, learnt how to pray effectively and learnt how to praise God more because she had a rival. When Joseph met his brothers after terrible things that happened in his life and finally God elevated him, he said, <strong>"you meant it for evil but God made it for good". </strong>We know of how God remembered Hannah and blessed her with a prophet who anointed the first king of Israel and did great things. Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Peninnah did not provoke Hannah? how about Leah who provoked Rachel day and night, she provoked her until God saw how she was being treated and opened her womb to bring forth Joseph. Have you wondered what would have happened if Joseph was not born, sold into Egypt and becomes the no. 2 man in Egypt and later saving the entire Israel?

I thank God for my rivals who provoke me by their words and some by their actions. They have caused me to believe there is more that God wants to do, they have taught me more on faith, praying by faith, praying effectively and looking to God. Whatever they are doing is working for my good. <strong>Romans 8:28, "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them that are called according to His purpose". </strong>All things (good things, bad things), they all work together for our good but mark the last part of it, it only works for those who are called according to His purpose. Someone's hate and anger could be your point of blessing. Someone's backbiting could be the means God would raise you up for all they are doing is working for your good. It doesn't just work for anyone but to those who are called. I believe that after the episode of Hannah, Rachel, and Joseph, they must have thought, ”we are glad we had revivals, yes it was painful but we have grown, God turned things around for His glory”. <strong>Psalm 119:71, "It's good for me to have been afflicted, that I might learn your statutes", Psalm 34:19, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord shall deliver him out of them all”. </strong>You might not like your rivals but guess what, they are your best friends, they will shape you into the image of Christ and what a blessing to know that someone pushed you to the next level with all their hate and anger. They actually made away for you to be used of God, helped you produce greater things the Lord always wanted to do in your life. If anything, <strong>your rival only awakened you to a greater destiny, take the hint!! Blessings Ev</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 7:1-20, "And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?"</strong>

We all want to see things happening in our lives. Most don’t want to be in the same place forever so they hunger for change, for growth, for move. In my own life, I don’t want to see my life stagnant and I hope you are too. For whatever reason, we easily miss seeing things being manifested in our lives only to hear them mentioned by someone else. <!--more-->Perhaps one reason could be, we dwell so much on what we want to see and we miss what He wants us to see. He therefore uses someone else to point it out. Has anyone ever come to you and told you of something good in your life that you either did not know about or did not see? In the process of learning these things, you wonder how the Lord would show someone else something He is doing in your life without you knowing.

<b>2Kings 7</b> introduces us to four men I love their story. I’ve shared from this passage many times and will continue because of the richness of its message to us. Four men, leprous, outcast, no signs of hope for healing, living at the entrance of the gate. Weak, no relationships, no destiny, no dreams etc. What do you do or say when all that was going well all of a sudden get crumbled because of a new development? I believe that before they had leprosy, they had good families, dreams, desires, visions and the like but with the new development, what else was there to live for? Ever heard an experience that shook everything you believed in, stood for and desired to accomplish?

While in their situation, they thought of something. Listen to their reasoning, <strong>vs. 3, "...and they said to one another, "Why are we sitting here until we die"</strong>. This is what I call the God given ability to reason that leads to change. I have been in some situations where I waited for the Lord to say a word and He did not, all I needed to do was to initiate a move having been guided by His word and He would take over and guide. When David faced Goliath, it was his move due to God given reasoning and God honored it for His glory, and so was Peter when he saw Jesus at a distance and desired to walk on water. He asked the Lord to command him to come to Him on water. To go back to these four lepers, they knew their condition but they understood that they were not condemned to die of starvation while there was a great famine in Samaria. Their move did not mean that everything was going to be well but it meant changing location, doing something different. If they stayed, they would die anyway, if they moved there was a possibility of either dying in the hands of the enemy after surrendering or being made slaves and get food.

<strong>Vs. 5, "And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians (enemy); and when they came to the outskirts of the Syrian camp, to their surprise no one was there. vs. 6, for the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and noise of horses, ... the great army so they said to another, "Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings .... to attack us, vs. 7, "Therefore they rose (Syrians) and fled at twilight</strong>", This is the core of the message, <strong>The Lord magnified the sound of the feet of these four weak, sick men that they sounded like a mighty army</strong>. <strong>When something is magnified, it does not change its size or its looks</strong>, it just allows the person looking at it to see it bigger than its usual size. Watch this, the four men's condition did not change, when they chose to move, God allowed someone else to hear them coming as an army because He had magnified them Before an army.

What I'm I saying, there are moves when you make, even when your condition does not change, God will still magnify you in the presence of other people. They will see something unique about you in your circumstance you may not see and speak of. The four men came to the camp and found no enemies only good stuff. What they may have not realized was how God had magnified the sound of their feet to sound more and greater than they were. Don't always wait until you have it in place to move, it's in the process of moving that He magnifies you for His glory. <strong>James 4:10, “Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up”</strong> Blessings Ev.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 18:35-43, "... And he cried out saying, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</strong>

In order to receive blessings, we need to be at a place where the Master can meet us. The Master has a way of meeting us in our weakest, blinded, confusing times. He knows without Him we can do nothing. It troubles me when someone or some people ask me to pray for a need in their lives they themselves are not burdened to do something about. In other words, they are not fervently, effectively praying to God themselves. I believe God wants to hear from those in need first and are in a position to do so as others rally behind them in prayers.<!--more-->

The story in the book of Luke gives us a clear picture of a blind man's life, we are not told of his name, only his condition. He was sitting by the roadside where many people passed by. This must have been his usual place for begging every day. Ever found yourself many times in one place not moving any more with things you desired God to deal with? The fact was he was blind, incapable of doing anything but beg. How many times have you felt the same, begging people to be affirmed, hoping someone will say something nice to you, begging for recognition, hoping for attention?. Jesus was on His way to Jericho when the blind man heard some noise, he began to inquire on what was going on. That’s when they told him that Jesus Christ of Nazareth was passing by. Multitudes had passed by this place but there was something about Jesus that caused him to stop and think for a minute. I believe he had heard the miracles Jesus had performed and nothing was going to stop him from seeking a miracle for himself. He turned and called on Jesus, he said, "<strong>son of David have mercy upon me"</strong>. While everyone was trying to silence him, he cried the most. Is this not the same picture of a blind sinner calling on the Savior to save him because he has heard He is passing by?. That Christ has availed Himself to those He wants to save and by His faith they call on Him. The bible says, “<strong>faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God”.</strong>

When you know your miracle is around the corner, no one can pull you down when your time to rise up and receive has come. No one will have a greater burden for your situation but you. People may fail you but not God. People, situations and opinions may try and cause you to forfeit the blessings but that is the time you need to cry the most. Seize the moment, exercise faith, call on Him, let your voice go beyond all the obstacles, stop Jesus on His tracks for a touch.

Thanks be to God, the blind man’s cry never went unnoticed despite the multitude. Jesus commanded the people who tried to keep him down to bring him over to Him. <strong>When you pray, God uses your obstacles to bring you closer to Him. Jesus asked,</strong> "<strong>What do you want me to do for you?</strong>". In as much as Jesus knows your needs, He still desires to hear you mention them to Him. The blind man said, "<strong>Lord that I may receive my sight"</strong>, he was specific, be specific in your prayers. I love the way Jesus does it, He says, <strong>"receive your sight; your faith has made you well</strong>". Have Faith in God, do not let the Master's opportunity pass you by this day, <strong>SEIZE THE MOMENT</strong>. Read the passage in Luke 18:35-43 to strengthen what I have mentioned. I could break it down line by line but that could take pages of emails. I pray that this morning you will be blessed and encouraged as you go for all that the Lord has in store for you. <strong>Mark 11:24, "Therefore I say unto you, what thingsoever you desire when you pray, believe you have them and you shall receive them"</strong> Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 7:24, “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.26But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.27 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.” (Matthew 7:24 – 27)</strong>

My great friend Joe Bukoweicki (the one we have been praying for) built houses back in the day. If you asked him what was the most important thing on a house is, he would tell you the foundation. A house is only as strong as the foundation that it is built upon.<!--more--> Jesus uses this language of foundations when he speaks in Matt 7. Jesus shares that there are two kinds of builders (people), those that have built their lives upon the solid foundation on Christ the rock, and those that have built their house upon the unstable foundation of religious sand.

Have you ever seen those incredible sculptures of sand art? Click to check it out. <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=sand+art&amp;ndsp=20&amp;svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=60&amp;sa=N">http://images.google.com/images?q=sand+art&amp;ndsp=20&amp;svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=60&amp;sa=N</a>. There is so much time that goes in the aesthetics, but it can be easily destroyed because it still is only sand. There are many that build their lives upon the shifting sands of religion, and tradition. However Jesus said of those that do this are foolish. The reason for their foolishness is because although they heard the Words of Jesus, not the words of a religious leader, but Christ, they refused to put them into practice. It is not hearing but doing that shows a true convert. The foolish man was the one who heard the sayings of Jesus, but did not obey them. It’s not the world that hears the sayings of Jesus and doesn’t obey them. Most know only the “Golden Rule” and “Judge not,” and even then their understanding is darkened. However, the Church is filled with false converts who sit among God’s people and hear His words, but don’t obey them. They build their house on sand rather than on the firm foundation of Jesus Christ and His words (Ray Comfort).”<em> A. W. Tozer</em> said, “<em>It is my opinion that tens of thousands of people, if not millions, have been brought into some kind of religious experience by accepting Christ, and they have not been saved</em>.”

The true convert builds his house upon the rock. “<em>He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he.</em> (Deut.32:4). Paul wrote “…and that rock was Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4).” <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=foundation+%2B+house&amp;svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=">http://images.google.com/images?q=foundation+%2B+house&amp;svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=</a>

The test will show the foundation! Jesus said that the rain will come down, the streams will rise, and the winds will blow and<strong> beat</strong> against that house (the sand house, and the rock house). The rain of tribulation, the streams of temptation, and the winds of persecution will beat against your life. If Christ is not your foundation, you will fall with a great crash; ultimately Hell will be the place you “crash” for eternity. Don’t build your house on religion, or tradition, Jesus has made this abundantly clear. If you do, you are playing Russian roulette with a fully loaded gun! If Christ is who you have built your house upon, His words alone, not the words of a pastor, priest, tradition, creed, or culture, then Christ will protect you. Christ protects His children, not the children of the devil. Paul wrote to church going people, “<strong>2Co 13:5 Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“<strong><em>Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 23 Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror 24 and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. 25 But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it—he will be blessed in what he does</em></strong>.” James 1:22 – 25

Do you enjoy learning about God’s word? Isn’t it great to listen to preaching that helps you to comprehend God’s Word more clearly? There are some people that just seem to be able to break down the Word of God in such a masterful way. <!--more-->I have learned many things throughout my years as a Christian from others. There are particular people in my life that have helped me to learn about a particular spiritual discipline, or a certain biblical truth or principle, etc.…. Why is it that there is so much learning of truth, but so little doing of truth? We learn very much, and appropriate so very little. We learn how to pray, but then do we actually pray? We learn how to study God’s Word, but then are too busy to study it. We learn how to share our faith, but then walk by thousands of people, never sharing God’s truth with those that are Hell-bound. James (the bother of Jesus) wrote that listening to God’s Word is not enough. James said about God’s Word:

1. “<strong>Do what it says</strong>.” If we only listen to God’s Word, whether listening to a preacher or listening to God Himself and we don’t do it we deceive ourselves. Do you know that failing to do God’s Word after you have heard it shows that you are deceiving yourself.

<strong>2. Don’t forget what you look like</strong>. James uses the illustration of one that stands in front of a mirror and looks at oneself, but then walks away and forgets what one looks like. Imagine if one checked oneself in the mirror and was on their way to an interview, this person had all kinds of stains on their clothing, but off to the interview he went. This person saw what he looked like in the mirror, but then seemed to forget what he looked like, because he didn’t do anything (clean his stain, or change his clothing) to make a change. Yet so many do this with God’s Word, looking into it as a mirror, seeing the change that needs to take place, and going on without making the change.

<strong>3. The blessing comes to those that are doers of His Word</strong>. James says that the one that looks into the Word of God intently (carefully, with purpose) and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it – he will be blessed in what he does. Are you deceived, have you forgotten what you look like (what His Word says), or are you doing what God is speaking to you. What is God speaking to you? Write it down, and then do it. If you need help appropriating speak to a mature believer, or a spiritual leader. You can always write Evans and I for help, and we would be glad to help if we can. Christianity today has much learning, but little application. Be the type of Christian that Jesus wants you to be, one that does His Word.

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Job 29:12, "because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and <em>the fatherless who had none to assist him</em>.”</strong>

<strong>Job 31:21, “if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court, Job 31:22 then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint. Job 31:23 For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.” (Job 31:21 – 23) </strong>

Fatherlessness is area of deep concern for God. God’s heart is to be a father to the fatherless as the Psalmist wrote in <strong>Psalm 68:5</strong> “<strong><em>A father to the fatherless… is God in his holy dwelling</em></strong>.” <!--more-->Job seemed to have God’s heartbeat for the fatherless. Many people, especially young boys, walk with a limp like Jacob (Gen. 32:25), because they have grown up without a father. They are left to wrestle through life without a father in their corner imparting into their lives. However, what choice does the fatherless have? It therefore becomes the responsibility of the church to care for the orphan, the fatherless. We live in the most fatherless generation ever and statistics tell the grave testimony of fatherlessness.

<strong>Job rescued the fatherless</strong>. “<strong>I rescued</strong> the …<strong><em>the fatherless who had none to assist him</em></strong>.” Job didn’t merely talk about the need to help fatherless children, he did something about it. What did he do, I am not exactly sure, but in any case, he did something that merited rescuing them from their situation as Isaiah wrote, <strong>“Defend the cause of the fatherless (1:17)</strong>.” There are many needs in the world today. What can you do to make a difference in the life of one fatherless child?

<strong>Job felt the pain of the fatherless. “…<em>let my arm fall from the shoulder</em></strong>, <strong><em>let it be broken off at the joint</em></strong>.” Mr. <em>Good</em>, as a medical man, is at home in the translation of this verse:- "May my shoulder-bone be shivered at the blade, And mine arm be broken off at the socket." Let judgment fall particularly on those parts which have either done wrong, <strong>or refused to do right when in their power</strong>.” Solomon wrote, “<strong><em>Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to act</em></strong> <strong>(Prov 3:27).</strong>” Job seemed to see a means of helping the need at some level. I imagine that he felt that if he failed to meet the need that he saw, he deserved the consequence of his arm falling off from his shoulder blade and breaking once it hit the ground. WOW, that is a vivid picture of caring! God gave Job an arm to reach out to meet the need, and it would have been purposeless for Job to have an arm, if he would not extend it to meet the need toward the fatherless.

<strong>It’s the Job (occupation) of the church to be like Job (the person)</strong>. We are one body with many parts as the body of Christ. One part of that body is the arms to reach out as God’s arms extended. If we don’t reach out as the body of Christ, then should not our arm fall off and break as well if we fail to use it in the manner in which God intended?. Of course there are many needs to reach out to meet; perhaps that is why the body has two arms showing that this is an endeavor which we should be doubly diligent in. If Job’s arm failed to bring healing to the broken heart of the fatherless, then he felt that his arm should feel the brokenness that their hearts feel, a constant throbbing pain that does go away by placing a “band aid” on it. There are many without a physical father, and of course many without a heavenly Father.

<strong>Application</strong>: This devotion is a very different one for me. Perhaps your life has been directly influenced by this issue. Perhaps you had a wonderful father. Perhaps you are personally connected with this need. There are those that you know as well without a relationship with the Heavenly Father. Pray and ask God the Father what He would have you to do and then trust and obey.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“<strong>If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land</strong>.” (2 Chronicles 7:14)

Can you imagine what the Garden of Eden must have been like? Before sin entered into the world, all things were perfect. However, when we look at our land now, it can easily be seen how sin has left its ugly stain. In America there are 95% to 97% that profess to believe in God. <!--more-->Despite this belief abortion continues to rise, homosexuality and fornication increases, death and destruction appear to have no end in sight as the moral decay of the nation continues to spiral downward. What is God’s remedy to the problem of moral decay in a nation? It is not through politicians, it is not through new programs, manipulative speeches, education, or financial growth. God points for His people to repent! Why do God’s people need to repent?

<strong>There is a lack of humility</strong>. “<strong>Shall humble themselves</strong>”. Many of God’s people do not read His word, nor submit to it. God is calling for His people to humble themselves. Why, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. If we don’t humble ourselves God will do it for us! Remember Jonah running away from his evangelistic responsibility, God humbled him. Will you humble yourself? God’s promise for those that humble themselves is that he will lift you up. In God’s economy, God will resist the proud hearted and welcome the humble hearted. Perhaps that is why the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

<strong>There is a lack of pray “Humble themselves and pray”. </strong>When God’s people don’t pray, what they are saying is that they don’t need God. One normally doesn’t talk to people what he does not know, and the reverse is true. Sometime back a professing believer shared that he did not see the efficacy of prayer. Jesus prayed and He was the Son of God, the Apostles prayed and they walked with the Master, what is your excuse if you have a prayer less life?

<strong>There is a lack of seeking God</strong>. “<strong>seek my face</strong>”. I’ve heard it well said that many seek the hand of God but Jesus sought God’s face. Jesus sought His Father many early mornings, when everyone was sleeping, he was seeking. Mark writes, “<strong>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place</strong>.” Jesus spoke with His Father. I picture that Jesus not only prayed, He listened to his Father’s voice, early in the morning, late at night, and sometimes all night he sought the Father. Like a thirsty traveler crawling through a desert seeking water, Jesus went alone to a solitary place. When one seeks God, one seeks His face, and upon seeing His face one seeks His will. Seeking God will result in seeking to do His will.

<strong>There is a lack of seeking the lost. “and turn from their wicked ways”</strong> What could be a more heinous crime for God’s people than to fail to warn the unsaved about Judgment Day and the horrors of Hell and then watch them go to Hell? Most of the church has taken a vow of silence and do not speak to lost people about the things of eternity, the truth of Jesus Christ. We must turn from our wicked ways.

<strong>There is a Condition. “then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land</strong>.” There are two types of promises, one’s that is unconditional, and the other that is conditional. The IF…THEN…is the conditional one, which God speaks at the end of the above verse. If we humble ourselves, pray, seek His face, and turn from our wicked ways, then God will bestow forgiveness and healing upon our land. If we don’t do it, God will not grant forgiveness and healing.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 16:25 “And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.</strong>

During the times that all the prison doors were opened and all the chains fell off the prisoners, there was one prisoner that was still bound. The jailer was bound by sin, but the Lord regenerated him and Paul preached the Gospel to him, and then his prison doors, and his sinful chains fell off too...him and his whole household. <!--more-->The jailer that was bound, was set free. What a glorious Gospel picture! Oh that those we speak to that are bound by sin would too have the Gospel preached to them. Realize that God places us in seemingly horrible situations (they were beaten and placed in jail) and then will use his servants to boldly proclaim the Gospel. You may have a difficult time wrapping your brain around the fact that God would put his servants through pain, jail, and stocks (MacArthur shares, concerning -<strong><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts%2016.24">Acts 16:24</a>- inner prison…in the stocks. </strong>The most secure part of the prison. The jailer took further precautions by putting their feet “in the stocks.” This particular security measure was designed to produce painful cramping so the prisoner’s legs were spread as far apart as possible.). If the Lord beat His very own Son, Jesus Christ, on behalf of our sin, are we above the Christ? Certainly not! God planned and used the situation of Paul and Silas being in prison to glorify Himself and to promote His Son! Look at what Paul and Silas said, "<strong>Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household."</strong> Then look what took place! <strong>32 "And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. 33 And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family. 34 Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God."</strong> God establish this whole scene from the beatings and jailing of Paul and Silas, having His servants praise Him, causing an earthquake to release those jailed in that prison, and this leading to the proclamation of His Son (saving a family bound in sin). It is just like God to reveal the truth here, the jailer was the one that was bound and shackled in sin and needed to be set free. He who the Son sets free is free indeed.

Preach the Gospel no matter what situation you are in...when you feel like it and when you don't. Isn't the Son of God worth more than gold. He must be the greatest treasure in your life and mine. There are families RIGHT NOW that need the Gospel because they are bound in sin. Imagine if the Gospel was brought to Hitler's family, Stalin, and others. The whole world needs that Gospel. The US President, Barak Obama needs that Gospel. This is why he supports abortion (murder of children) and can't figure out that marriage was instituted by God (as one man one women) not government. <strong>Mark 16:15, "Preach the Gospel to every creature"!</strong>

Until the nets are filled...

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 16:25 “And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.</strong>

Are you one that enjoys praising God? Most people associate praise with being in a church building on a Sunday morning. Perhaps when you speak with another believer you affirm one another by saying, “Amen” or “Praise God!”.<!--more--> It’s much easier to praise God when things are going well, but do you put equal effort into praising God when things are not looking so promising. Paul and Silas praised God while they were sitting in prison. There are times when you and I feel like we are trapped in some sort of prison. Perhaps our problem or situation seems so big that we feel imprisoned by it. I have felt that way at times. At those times in our lives, if there was such a thing as a “praise-o-meter” with 0 being little praise and 10 being total praise, how does our praise to the Lord measure at those times? Paul and Silas were thrown in prison for preaching the Gospel. Perhaps there are times, as I have experienced, when the Gospel has “gotten you in trouble,” but you were being obedient to the Lord. Perhaps you were asked to do something unethical, deceptive, or even immoral and because you stood for the Lord, your boss fired you, a relationship was broken, etc…. However it was during the time when it was “most difficult” to praise God that Paul and Silas praised God together. It wasn’t just Paul and it wasn’t just Silas, they partnered in praise. Perhaps many of us would have been praying for deliverance from the prison, but God used this praise to bring about great things. Don’t forget that God is not the only one that hears our praises, but others do as well. We don’t praise God aloud so show off, but simply because we love Him. This following illustration will display the power of praise.

Ira Sankey, before he became D. L. Moody’s famous song leader (and a powerful preacher himself), was assigned to night duty in the American Civil War. While he was on duty, he lifted his eyes toward heaven and began to sing, praising the Lord while he was alone. At least, he thought he was alone.

Years later, after the war had ended, Sankey was on a ship traveling across the Atlantic Ocean. Since he was now a famous singer, a crowd of people approached him and asked him to sing. He lifted his eyes toward heaven and sang a beautiful hymn. After his song, a man from the crowd asked him if, on a certain night during the Civil War, he had performed night duty for a certain infantry unit. “Yes, I did,” was his reply. The man continued, “I was on the opposite side of the war, and I was hiding in a bush near your camp. With my rifle aimed at your head, I was about to shoot you when you looked toward heaven and began to sing. I thought, ‘Well, I like music, and this guy has a nice voice. I’ll sit here, let him sing the song, . . . and then shoot him. He’s not going anywhere.’ But then I realized what you were singing. It was the same hymn my mother used to sing at my bedside when I was a child. And it’s the same hymn you sang tonight! I tried, but that night during the Civil War, I was powerless to shoot you.”

Ira Sankey pointed that man to Christ. He and thousands of others were saved under Sankey’s ministry. All this stemmed from the fact that Sankey praised the Lord at all times.

Whatever you are going through today, even if you feel like you are in a prison, praise Him.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>"Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. " (Acts 17:11)</strong>

A while back History Channel had been advertising a new show titled “Digging for the Truth”. I saw a huge sign on the highway that read this which made me think of the power of that statement.<!--more--> The program endeavors to offer a fresh and engaging approach to archaeology, and to dig for the truth and go to extremes to do it-whether it's trekking through Ethiopia in search of the lost ark of the covenant, tackling the jungles of the Amazon while searching for the hidden treasures of the Incas, or descending into the volcano Vesuvius to solve the puzzles of Pompeii. WOW! In thinking of the concept digging for truth, what comes to your mind? Perhaps trying to get the real story from a child, teenager on what really happened. Perhaps a court room scene comes into mind like Law and Order, or CSI perhaps.

When archeologists dig for artifacts, they only discover what is beneath the surface of the land. As a Christian approaches God's Word he or she should go with the same mindset as the archeologist,
which is digging for truth. As you dig into God's truth, the Holy Spirit will illuminate words, phrases, passages, chapters, etc...to you. His job is to lead you into all truth, because He is the Spirit of truth (John 16:13). When an archeologist finds a bone during a dig, he doesn't think, "that's nice," and walk away. No way, he digs, and tries to see if there are others treasures around that same area. When you hear a truth that someone has dug up, from a Pastor, Teacher, Evangelist, a book, radio, TV, etc..., from the Word of God, do you walk away or do you return to the site (passage, verse, story, etc...) and start digging for truth?

When we go to God's Word, we should go as students desiring to learn from the Heart of the Master. The Bereans were avid students and "archeologists" of God's Word. They examined the Scriptures as if they were going to find gold. Here are some tips we can learn from the notable Berean Church.

1. Be Zealous for God's Word "<strong>they received the message with great eagerness</strong>..." Do you crave God's Word, are you zealous for His truth in your life.

2. Be consistent in God's Word. <strong>"... [they] examined the Scriptures every day</strong>”. The Bereans not only read daily, but examined it daily. They put God's Word under a microscope truly desiring not just to know what it said, but also what it meant, and how they could live God's Word. Do you read God's Word today, what about yesterday? Do you read EVERY DAY? If not, why not? Isn't God's Word valuable enough to dig into daily to you?

3. Be purposeful with God's Word. "...[<b>They] examined...to see if what Paul said was true." The Bereans went into the Word of God for a purpose not just religious duty. They were seeing if Paul's Word's were accurate according to God's Word. Knowing God's Word this way gives one discernment, as one can gain the ability to filter what is preached, through God's to see if what "Reverend" is speaking truth. If you are a truth digger, then you will know when a counterfeit is spoken, because God's Word is the truth standard. Be zealous for God's Word, consistent in God's Word, and purposeful with God's Word. Until the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;</b>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“<strong><em>And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day</em></strong>.” (Acts 23:1)

“It’s said that a very primitive tribe in Africa has a unique way of dealing out justice to guilty parties. If there’s been a murder in the tribe, what they do is line up the suspects, and the guy who can’t spit is put to death as the guilty party. <!--more-->And the reasoning is this: The human conscience is so strong – that knowledge of when we do wrong – and what happens is when you line a guy up, his conscience accuses him of his guilt; the guilt produces a fear and the fear makes his mouth go dry so he spits less and hence dies for the crime. Conscience is a very powerful thing. Let me illustrate further.

An old drunk was once walking home, staggering on the sidewalk, when his dog came out and watched him coming toward him. The dog loved his master. The drunk walked up his pathway. The dog snuggled up behind him, and followed him into the house. The drunk collapsed on the floor, and the dog snuggled up to his hand and waited for that moment when his master would awaken, so he could lick him and have fellowship with him, because he so loved his master. Around midnight, the dog began to bark and bark. The drunk awoke and thought, “Man, the last thing I feel like hearing is a barking dog.” He reached down and grabbed a wooden chair and threw it at the dog, and then collapsed on the floor. In the morning, however, when the drunk awoke, he opened his eyes and saw a sight he could hardly believe. Everything was taken from his house. During the night, thieves had broken in and stolen all his possessions. Only two things were left in the house. One was a broken chair, and the other was a dead dog.

The dog had heard the thieves breaking into the drunk’s home, and tried to warn his master, and his master had killed his very best friend – the one that was trying to warn him of the thieves breaking into his home.”

Your conscience is like that. It’s a barking dog. It isn’t pleasant when it barks at you, but realize that your conscience is your friend not your enemy. The Apostle Paul was standing before a council of Pharisees and Sadducees as one stands on trial. Now the purpose of a trial is to determine if one is innocent or guilty. Paul’s’ accusers had been in great abundance, but when Paul did a check in his conscience, his conscience did not accuse him, it did not bark, he was not spit less. Why? Paul knew according to the Scriptures, his conscience was in good standing with God until this day! Up to this day Paul was in good standing with God.

Therefore, having this assurance he was able to stand with courage and confidence being ready to deal with whatever came his way. Because of Paul’s relationship with God, the enemy couldn’t seem to throw a curve ball at Paul and fool him, because Paul’s God knew all things and therefore knew all the scheming pitches of the enemy before they were thrown. After Paul stood his ground, the council was divided in disagreement among themselves some siding with Paul and some against him.

Listen to your conscience now that God gave you. Is it barking or quiet? Can you stand before your boss, your spouse, your friends, your God and say with Paul “<strong>I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day?</strong>” If not, don’t throw a chair trying to silence your conscience, let it awaken you to action.

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“<strong><em>He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me. Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward. 42 And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward</em></strong>.” (Matthew 10:40-42)

In part one of Marks of a Disciple; we examined the new commandment Jesus gave to His disciples, to love one another as He has loved them. In light of that, Jesus speaks again about another mark being His disciple. Jesus starts off by talking about receiving Him.<!--more-->

1. <strong>Whoever receives a disciple receives Christ</strong>. Those who treat His disciples bad, treat Jesus bad. Remember when the Apostle Paul, formally called Saul, was persecuting Christians? Jesus showed up on the road to Damascus, knocked him down and said, “<strong>Saul, Saul we do you persecute Me [Jesus]</strong>.” It was clear from the lips of Christ that those who come against Christ’s disciples are coming against Him, and those that receive His disciples, welcome Christ.

<strong>2. Whoever receives Jesus receives God</strong>. God was the One that sent Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. Many Jewish people and others as well, want to reject Jesus but receive God. This simply can’t take place because Jesus is God. “<strong>Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” John 14:9 Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.</strong>” Jesus also said to the Pharisees, “<strong>’I tell you the truth,’ Jesus answered, ‘before Abraham was born, I am!’ At this, they picked up stones to stone him</strong>,”

<strong>3. Whoever gives a cup of cold water to the little ones is Christ’s disciple</strong>. Jesus is the living water that brings satisfaction to the thirsty. He said, “<strong>Everyone who drinks this water [natural physical water] will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst, and “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. Vs. 38 Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.”</strong> In context of the prophet’s reward, and the righteous man’s rewards, there is the disciples’ reward here. Those that refresh Christ’s disciples will not lose their reward. Disciples of course have the living water in them, but even they need to be refreshed. The reason Jesus said that those who drink of the living water will NEVER thirst again is because the source will never run dry. Abraham’s well could run dry (John 4), but Christ’s well can never run dry, because His well has always been full to overflowing with eternal life sustaining water. Will you share that water with another disciple today and so refresh their spirit. Please pray, encourage, and minister to at least one before the day is through. As God uses you to bring His living water to others, He will make sure you too are filled. Receive His disciples, receive Christ and therefore God Himself, and give some refreshing water of refreshment to one that is thirsty today.

<strong>Until the nets are filled</strong>…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“<strong><em>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free</em></strong>.” (John 8:31 – 32)

I often hear that all one needs to do when it comes to salvation is to simply believe. Some take it a step further and use Romans 10:9 which Paul writes, <strong><em>“That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved”.<!--more--></em> </strong>If one quoted this verse alone as the means of salvation, then it sounds like Paul is saying all one must do is to confess sin, believe Jesus and salvation is bestowed. However the key in this whole thing, Jesus is Lord. This confession was made publicly among other disciples. Then this new convert was disciple into Christian maturity.

When the Apostle Paul was on his way to kill Christians Christ met him on the road to Damascus and “…<strong><em>suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 4And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 5And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 6And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</em></strong> Did Paul confess Jesus as Lord? yes. Did he believe in his heart?, yes. Did he tremble with conviction of his sin? yes. Jesus confronted him with the Law, the sixth commandment, “thou shall not murder,” for that in fact was what Paul was doing to Christians. After this conversion took place Paul said to Jesus, “<strong><em>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do</em></strong>.” Paul seemed to instantly know that he must now be a doer of God’s word and not simply one that hears, believes and confesses Jesus as Lord. Now he would have to live under the Lordship of Jesus Christ from this day forward.

The problem in many churches today is that preaching takes place, the pastor has people close their eyes and repeat a prayer of confession for sin after him. Then many times the person’s life does not change, and many times the person doesn’t return to the church even for a second visit. We call this type of person a false convert, because they have made stake to claims of salvation unto Jesus, but they wanted a Savior but not Lord. However the two cannot be separated, Jesus is Savior and Lord of my life.

In light of this, in the above key Scripture verse, Jesus spoke to the Jews who had believed Him. Therefore belief in Jesus was already present. Jesus then went on to say, “<strong><em>If you hold to my teaching, then you are my disciples indeed</em></strong>.” This is called a conditional statement because it uses “IF” and “THEN”, meaning IF you do this, THEN this will be the result. However IF one does not do this, THEN one will not get the same result. Jesus said one must continue in His word. The Expositors Bible Commentary says, “<em>Receiving his teaching would mark them as genuine disciples and would lead them into a deeper experience of truth</em>.” This learned truth then would liberate from legalism, superstition, and dead works of tradition which had developed over the years. Jesus felt the necessity of making perfectly clear the conditions of discipleship.

Are you reading the Scriptures daily (continuing in His Word)? Are you obeying what you reading and showing Him to be Lord over your life? If you are then you are His disciple, you know the truth and have been set free, therefore REJOICE! If not then repent quickly, today, right now, and make the change that Jesus is calling you to make. If you are lord then He is not, but if He is Lord then you are not. Choose the latter. <strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“<strong><em>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</em>”</strong>(John 13:34 – 35)

How can one tell is someone is a fan of a particular sports team? Perhaps is one wears a team’s clothing, jersey, hat, etc…. However if I put on a NY Yankee jersey does that mean that I am on the NY Yankees? Of course not! How then can one know if one is a disciple of Christ? <!--more-->Well one way to know Jesus said is that His disciples would have love one to another. This sounds very quaint, loving, caring, and mushy. Love as many have said is perhaps the most abused word in language. Jesus spoke to His disciples and gave them a new commandment, and that was to love one another as Jesus had loved them. Many feel that the love Jesus was speaking of here, is the demonstration of love that Jesus had shown them up to this point He was speaking to them. Jesus had shown them love, but He did not display His greatest act of love at the time He was instructing them to love on another. That display would be shown at the cross. Jesus would die for His twelve and for the whole world. This was the love that He was commanding them to love one another with. He said a new command, not a new idea, suggestion, or option I give you, but a new command. Jesus further said, “<strong><em>Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends</em></strong>.” Jesus was calling them to lay their lives down for one another. What is the reason that Jesus wanted His disciples to love one another as He had loved them?

1. <strong>Christ’s Love is pure</strong>. John wrote, “<strong><em>How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God</em></strong>!” God is the source of love, and He lavishes that love upon His children as a mother lavishes love upon her child. His pure love, not love as the world gives, needed to be in their hearts if they were going to be Christ-like.

<strong>2. Christ’s Love is demonstrative</strong>. The world sits in condemnation and judgment. The world is guilty of breaking God’s Law, they love darkness and hate the light. Jesus said that when His disciples shine their love toward one another, that the world would see it and know who Christ’s disciples are. The world can only see this kind of love if Christians step out of the four walls of the church building and live it out among all men. Many non-Christians have seen televangelists manipulate people for their money. Christ didn’t die in a church, He died in plain view of the people, in the sight of all men. Oh that we would die to ourselves that He would live in us, and we would be His feet and hands extended. I laugh when people say I love God, it’s the church I have a problem with. That is like saying I love you but I hate your husband or wife. Husbands and wives are one, and so is Christ and His body. His body must love one another, the church needs that love to flourish, and the world needs to see it as a living tangible witness.

<strong>3. Christ’s Love is evidential evidence</strong>. Jesus said “…by this all men will know that you are my disciples….” When you live his love out loud, it shows that Jesus is real. Why would you go out of your way to help, give, bless, provide, even sacrifice for another brother or sister in Christ, because Christ is real. Why would you display the fruit of the spirit, bless those who persecute you, love your enemies? Practical Christian lives points to the reality that Christ is real, and the Savior of the world. Demonstrate His pure love today as evidence that Jesus is Savior, Lord, and soon and coming King!

<strong>Until the nets are filled</strong>…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jeremiah 33:3, “Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know”</strong>

Not too long ago I was watching a DVD entitled “extreme engineering”. It was a DVD about how some mega structures have been built. One mega structure that caught my attention was one about building a railroad. They surveyed the area by which the rail would pass. There were different obstacles, one major being a mountain in front of them.<!--more--> Instead of going around it which was impossible, they chose to make a way through the mountain however hard it was going to be. Attempting the impossible with what they had. With the mountain before them, they had to bring in the right machinery for break through to the other side. They used explosives because explosives used correctly, breaks through hard rocks to create a path. They used GPS to make sure they were on track to avoid costly mistakes.

We too are building roads to our futures and there are obstacles everyday both small and big. We have mountains standing in the way, the question is, what do we do about them? Without prayers as your explosive device, there is no way you will breakthrough. There is something about prayers that should not be taken lightly. Prayers pave a way for God to move. Prayer works because God works through prayers. There are things God wills and then waits for His children to call on Him. It shows we trust Him with what we are facing; it’s bringing the right tools into your situation. When we pray, we are bringing God into our situations for we know we can do nothing without Him. He is like the explosive that breaks through obstacles and making way for us<strong>. Psalm 18:32, “It is God who arms me with strength, And makes my way perfect”, 2 Samuel 22:33, “God is my strength and power, And He makes my way perfect”</strong>.

Prayer affects three different Spheres of existence as E.M. Bounds puts it, “<strong>The Divine, the angelic and the human. It puts God to work, it puts the angels to work and it puts people to work.” </strong>Prayer put’s everyone to work. <strong>Prayer is simply faith resting in, acting with, leaning on and obeying God. </strong>Those who know their God will value prayers, their life fully depends on it.

In our tough economic times and other things happening, who would you rather put your trust in, in God or the government, stocks and bond or faith in God?. The bible says<strong>, Psalm 20:7, “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God”, Psalm 118:8, “It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in man”. </strong>How will you and I show the Lord we trust Him if we don’t call upon Him in our prayers to answer us?

This quote continues to bless my heart, it’s the heart of prayers by great missionary<strong> Hudson Taylor, </strong>who said<strong>,</strong> "<strong>The prayer power has never been tried to its full capacity. If we want to see Divine power wrought in the place of weakness, failure, and disappointment, let us answer God's standing challenge</strong>, “<strong>Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know”. </strong>The Lord says, we bring Him into the picture by praying and He will do great and mighty things we cannot do. Arise O God, demonstrate your power. With what is happening, we need God now more than ever; we need to pray like we’ve never done before. The more we pray, the more we show God we are not depending on ourselves, we are depending on Him. He is our explosive through the obstacles of life. He is the way maker.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 16:1-16, "4 ...When she knew that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress"(NIV)</strong>

<strong></strong>Today there are people who quit their jobs, ministries because of mistreatments. At one point they could take it when it was bearable, they hoped and prayed it would get better. I have talked to people especially Christians who have been mistreated to the point of thinking of quitting. That was Hagar's situation, <b>Genesis 16:6, "Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her. </b>Let’s see if the Lord takes notice of the victims of mistreatment.

<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 7, "The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert...vs. 8, And he said, "Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" </strong>This verse is an encouragement. Right in the midst of discouragement, quitting and running a way, an Angel of the Lord visited just at the right time. I don't know if she ever had an experience where someone came to her rescue but here came an Angel. Abram could not defend her, he couldn’t even intervene when his wife Sarai was mistreating Hagar. Don't you love it when you are going through things that drive you to run away and then here comes an angel and not just any angel but the Angel of God (often identified in the old testament as the pre-incarnate Christ)?

The Angel did not refer to Hagar as Abram's wife, He referred to her as Sarai's servant in other words, He reminded her of her days of humble beginnings, what she had missed. Jesus said, <strong>Mark 9:35, "...If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all." </strong>Pride or ego might have come in but just like Jesus said, "<strong>be a servant of all</strong>". She was also being reminded of the order of things. Sarai was her leader in this sense.

You would think the Angel would say, "<i>wait here I will put in a good word for you or deal with Sarai or make a new way". </i>Angel said to her, <strong>vs. 9"..."Go back to your mistress and SUBMIT to her</strong>". This is a word that is hard  to receive because it requires humility. I know not of anyone who can bend who are not humble. Hagar was told to RETURN and SUBMIT. Some situations are not meant to be ran away from, you and I just need to learn to rearrange the order of things and do what the Lord requires of us, go back and submit. This is a good reason to trace back the roots that led to the current situation and revisit. You do an evaluation to understand the cause. <strong>You can try and run away from it but the key to your release depends on if you are willing to deal with submission</strong>. It is hard to submit when you feel or know you have more than the person you should submit to or more right. Hagar was young, had more attention now and she was expecting a son (highly valued), why would she submit? <strong>Her blessing would come from yielding and surrendering to Sarai's authority</strong>. <strong>There can be no submission without humility</strong>. <strong>How can one bow if they are not humbled</strong>?

To quote Pastor Gregg Johnson, "<strong>Humility is not a sign of weakness, it’s strength under control</strong>". Jesus humbled Himself and became obedient even unto the death of the cross. Was He weak? of course not, He said, "<strong>No man takes my life, I lay it down</strong>", submission is <strong>A CHOICE NOT A CONDITION</strong>. He bowed because He was humbled and after it was said and done, He received the crown, dominion and a sit at the right hand of God the Father. The bible says, in <strong>Philippians 2:9-11, "9 Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father" </strong>In Hagar’s case, her humility would choke out her pride and arrogance that was within her.

Do you see again that a situation (fire) brought out the viper within her an Sarai. She had an opportunity to throw it back into the fire as the Angel of the Lord helped her deal with it and God blessed her more after.

We thank God for situations He continues to allow in our as fires to bring about the vipers our lives not yet consumed by His fire. This also reminds us we have not arrived yet and continue to put our confidence in God to deal with us through the Power of the Holy Spirit. In situations like this, God is growing us in character, integrity, in holiness, the fruit of the Spirit. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 16:1-15, vs. 4 "...When she knew that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress"(NIV)</strong>

Situations can bring about junk in us we may have never thought to be there. In <b>Acts 28:3, </b>while Paul was gathering sticks for fire to keep themselves warm, the heat forced a viper jump out of  fire , and fastening itself around his wrist. <!--more-->That is what the situations out of the ordinary do, they are like fire that generates heat causing the vipers inside of us to jump out and fasten on us. Paul saw the viper fastened around his wrist and dealt with the situation, he threw it back into the fire to be consumed.

This is the same way the Lord deals with us, at times He allows fire to come to force the viper in us to jump out. Then we have an opportunity to deal with them by throwing them back into the fire for Him to consume it. This is where we cast our cares (our shortcomings) to the Lord and we say Lord consume what You have revealed. I thank God for some of those situations that reveal the junk in my life I need to deal with. These situations pushes stuff to he surface leaving you with an option to either embrace it or deal with it.

<b>Genesis 16 </b>tells of a story of that revealed what was inside. Sarai and Hagar might have not known what was in them till this situation presented itself. Abram (Abraham) was old so was Sarai (Sarah) and they had no child. Sarai had a maid that had been loyal to her all these years, she is beneath her and everything looked fine and peaceful. Sarai later came up with an idea she will later regret and that was to give Abram Hagar her maid servant to wife so that Sarai would obtain children by her. All attention had always been given to Sarai but with Hagar present as a wife (not as a maid servant) brought a divided attention. After some time, Hagar conceived and trouble  Began between these two women. The bible says, "<strong>Hagar began to despise Sarai". </strong>Remember any person whom you might have helped climb a ladder of success in an area and once they got there, they began to despise you? You took them in, cared for them, provided for them but when things started turning around for them, their demeanor towards you changed? To give another example, has someone ever helped you get up there and you began to despise them, forgot about them, tried to make their lives miserable? It happens even in the Christian circles. Hagar might have not known that the despising spirit was in her until a situation like this brought that viper out.

<strong>Genesis 16:5, "Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me"(NIV). </strong>Sarai on the other hand is battling jealousy because Abram was going to have a son by Hagar. Who would Abram want to spend more time with, Sarai who is old and childless or Hagar who I believe was young and was going to have his baby? That might have been Sarai’s thought, not getting all the attention she used to get and what was harbored inside is revealed through this situation I would call fire. Have you ever helped someone climb the ladder then you had a problem with it later? They were prospering and you were still in the same place they left you? You used to get all the attention, now it has shifted. The thought of it is killing you inside. <strong>Sarai began to mistreat Hagar</strong>. She may have not known that she had the spirit of mistreatment inside her until a situation arose. Here is another thing that was revealed, Sarai shifting blame to Abram, she says "<strong>You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering".</strong> Instead of taking part of the responsibility of advising, she throws all the blame on Abram. I would blame Abram too because as the priest of his own home, there are certain decisions that he should have not made to avoid all these. Anyway one woman is despising, the other is mistreating. Sounds very familiar in our time but I thank God for them. The Lord searches the heart and tries the mind and if there is a root not of Him inside of us, little fire will cause them to jump out and fasten around our lives and that is good. Like Paul when it’s revealed, let’s cast them upon the Lord that He may consume them. He is a consuming fire remember that.

Someone said "<strong>Be good to people on your way up the ladder because you will meet them on your way down the ladder again</strong>". The bible says, <b>"Do not despise the days of humble beginnings"</b> (paraphrased). Remembering small beginnings should humble you not to despise those who have not made it as far as you have.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 3:20, "Now unto Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or imagine according to the power that works in us"</strong>

I remember a song I learnt many years ago which goes like this, "<strong>He is able, more than able, to accomplish what concerns me today, He is able more than able, He can handle anything that comes my way, He is able more than able, to do much more than I could ever dream, He is able more than able, to make me what want He wants me to be"<!--more--></strong>

Our God is able, more than able, just because we have prayed and things have not come to pass yet does not make Him less than able. He is complete within Himself lacking nothing. If He was able then, He is still able. If He did it then, He can do it again. He is the God of now, the bible calls Him Jehovah Shammah to which in other words is Jehovah present.<strong> Psalm 46:1, "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble". </strong>He is present in your situation today and He is more than able. Nothing in realty intimidates God, though situations and circumstances may be getting worse and you may feel like He is delaying, know that He is in control.<strong> 2Timothy 1:12, "For the which cause I also suffer this things, but I am not a shamed for I know whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day"</strong>. Whether we choose to believe it or not He is able and the least time we expect Him to be there and help, that is the time He will show up. I cannot only believe Him for the future, I can believe Him for now (current). Remember Lazarus sister’s only believed Christ to raise their brother in the last day, Jesus came to disable the present situation and make it able, He came to make Lazarus live.

<strong>Jude 1:24, "Now unto Him who is able to keep you from falling, and present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy"</strong>. The opposite of the word able is disable and we know that anyone who is disabled cannot function fully depending on their disability. We also know that when we use the word disable it can also mean disconnect. Our God is not in a dysfunctional mode so stop putting Him in that mode. He has not disconnected Himself from His children so stop putting Him in a box. God is able by Himself to keep each of us from falling and failing, then present us faultless before His presence with exceeding joy.

The message is simple, God is able and more than able. I’ve repeated the word "able" more times to drive it into our hearts. Everything that concerns you and I today can be brought to the able hands of God. I’ve said this before, “<strong>I don't pray because God will, I pray because God can (able) the ability to believe that He can produces faith to believe He will”</strong>. Change the way you pray and believe God regardless of whether it comes or not. Daniel prayed and an answer did not come immediately but he kept praying for he knew God was able. <strong>Romans 4:3, "Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness". Nick Vujicic, </strong>a young man without arms and legs says<strong>, “when you feel -DISABLE, add GO- at the beginning to make it sound “GO-DISABLE” making it complete GOD IS ABLE”. </strong>Nick is one man who has proved this truth, he’s life statement, “<strong>No arms, no legs, no worries</strong>” exactly what his life is but his trust in his disability is that God is able.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Joshua 7:10, “So the Lord said to Joshua: “Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face? 11 Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. For they have even taken some of the accursed things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff.”</strong>

Temptations in our time are on the loose running wild; God’s standard has not and will never will be lowered. We have to get on with His program and it’s only through Him can we overcome. <strong>Romans 13:14, “But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts</strong>.” <!--more-->The age of grace is tougher if you think about it. Living for God is much harder than dying for God in my judgement. When you think you’ve mastered Christianity, like Isaiah you are confronted with the Holiness of God that reduces you to nothing. And with one voice you cry to God,<strong> “be merciful to me a sinner”</strong>

In conclusion, Achan and his family with his belongings were stoned. You may ask, why destroy others who do not appear to have sinned? I think they participated in hiding the accursed things. It started with Achan who brought his family into it and brought about destruction. Not too long ago I was told of a believer who promised to leave his wife if she wouldn’t abort her baby. And because she did not want to be abandoned, she aborted, taking a life. Oh how we would not take accursed things and lead others to be part of what we may do and destroy their lives too. It’s not easy to go down alone but we have to be careful not to destroy other people’s lives especially those whom we love. This puts more fear in me to walk a walk worthy of God.

Achan’s personal sin in taking of the accursed thing brought about the deaths of thirty-six innocent Israelite soldiers and his family. Perhaps the most terrifying thing about sin is that there is no such thing as private sin. All sin affects others; the personal sin of Achan kindled the anger of God against Israel. The personal sin of believers always affects the church at large. Every sin involves society; and since each of us makes up society, every sin affects us.

<strong>Vs. 25, “Then Joshua said to Achan, “Why have you brought trouble on us? The Lord will now bring trouble on you</strong>.” By one man’s sin, God was made to look bad, Joshua questioned God’s promises, victory was delayed, men’s lives (husbands, sons) were lost in battle, he caused his family to be destroyed, he troubled Israel.

Living righteously consistently is the only acceptable life-style. Let’s glean some truths to help us in this journey, in <strong>James 1:12-25 “12 Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. 14 But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. 15 Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death. 16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning. 18 Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first fruits of His creatures… 21 Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, WHICH IS ABLE TO SAVE YOUR SOULS. 22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. 23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; 24 for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 25 BUT HE WHO LOOKS INTO THE PERFECT LAW OF LIBERTY AND CONTINUES IN IT, AND IS NOT A FORGETFUL HEARER BUT A DOER OF THE WORK, THIS ONE WILL BE BLESSED IN WHAT HE DOES. </strong>Accursed things are pleasures for a season. The end result? trouble for a long time. May the Lord help us live faithfully for Him in the midst of trials and temptations. Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Joshua 7:10, “So the Lord said to Joshua: “Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face?11 Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them.For they have even taken some of the accursed things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff.”</strong>

We have a threefold enemy we battle, <strong>the world, the flesh and the devil</strong>. They bring about, <strong>1 John 2:16, “…the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life”, </strong>This is what brought about the downfall of Achan.<!--more-->

We finally get to Achan to find out what he did and how what he did is relevant to us today,<strong> Joshua 7:19, "Now Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I beg you, give glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession to Him, and tell me now what you have done; do not hide <em>it</em> from me.”</strong> I pondered on this line, how do you give glory to God in your sin? By coming clean. The bible says, <strong>“let God be true and every man a liar”, Romans 3:4 </strong>. This was the time to prove to everyone that indeed there was sin in the camp and God was not looking for an excuse not to bless the Israelites or punish them for nothing. God delights in those who come clean, a broken heart and a contrite spirit, such He will not deny <strong>(Psalm 51)</strong>. God’s glory will only be reflected back to Him when the life of God’s servant is cleared of guilt. Bishop Patrick (not sure of his last name) quotes the Samaritan chronicle, making Joshua to say here to Achan, “<strong>Lift up thy eyes to the king of heaven and earth, and acknowledge that nothing can be hidden from Him who knoweth the greatest secrets”</strong>

<strong>Vs. 20, “And Achan answered Joshua and said, “Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and this is what I have done: 21 When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And there they are, hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.”, </strong>it’s what he saw that he desired, the desire turned into covetousness and that prompted him to act. Doesn’t this sound familiar with Eve in the garden of Eden and David when he saw Bathsheba? And many other stories in the Bible of the same. They all boil down to, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life.

Sin begins with innocent sight, degenerates into lustful desire or covetousness, and falls from there into participation. Temptations are not sins by definition, we are afraid they can lead to sin. And if our Savior was tempted in all manner, there is no way we will escape temptations. He overcame it, and calls us to overcome by the power of the Holy Ghost. The enemy wants us to forfeit the blessings, he wants us to be delayed. I love what David Wilkerson said, he said, “some people say the devil is attacking them, his question for them, “who let him in?” You give him and inch, he will take the whole ruler and hit you with it.

How should a believer be an over comer ofthe world, the flesh and the devil? <strong>be crucified to the world, be mortified to the things, to the affairs and enticements, of it, simply, dead to the world. </strong>I constantly pray to die to self and be alive unto Christ<strong>. The flesh wants to take over, I need to bring it into captivity under the obedience of Christ. 2Corinthians 10:5</strong>. Feed the Spirit more and starve the flesh<strong>. Romans 6:12, “Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.” Galatians 5:1, “I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. </strong>Strive to be alive unto Christ and dead to the world. To finish, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Joshua 7:10, “So the Lord said to Joshua: “Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face? 11 Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. For they have even taken some of the accursed things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff</strong>

He whom the Lord loves, He corrects lest He let him run wild. When I look back at the corrections my parents gave me, I’m glad they did not leave me to do whatever I wanted, disobey and dishonor their name.<!--more--> Were the chastening painful? of course, were they good for me? Absolutely. David says in <strong>Psalm 119:71, “It is good for me that I have been afflicted, That I may learn Your statutes”. </strong>He that chastened him taught him. The rod and reproof give wisdom. When our heavenly Father chasten us, He grants us mercies despite our deliberate disobedience, and we stand in AWE.

<strong>Job 5:17, “Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects; Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty”, Proverbs 3:11, “My son, do not despise the chastening of the LORD, Nor detest His correction; Hebrews 12:7, “7 If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten? 8 But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons”</strong>.

In the midst of chastening, Joshua came to God in a state of humility and God was gracious to hear his prayer to accomplish what He had begun. He says to <strong>Joshua vs. 10</strong>, <strong>“Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face? 11 Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them</strong>.” It’s one thing to pray to know what your sin is, it’s another thing to get up and deal with it. Repent and TURN from it. Many times believers cry to God under conviction for forgiveness, and right after, they go back and fall on the same sins again because there is no desire to change. To Paraphrase <strong>Carter Conlon, “You can’t write off a conviction with a prayer, you must come with a lifestyle of bending your knee to God with a desire to change” . </strong>It calls for prayers to know what the sin is and strength to get rid of sin and what is causing you to sin<strong>. </strong>Hezekiah in 2Kings 18, Asa in 2Chronicles 14, and Gideon in Judges 6 among others destroyed the accursed things, idols. Anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God is sin and must be destroyed if victory is to be restored.

What a tremendous lesson for any Christian who experiences defeat. God was fully aware of what had happened<strong>. Vs. 11</strong> “<strong>Israel have sinned … for they have even taken some of the accursed thing … they have also put it among their own stuff”.</strong> God was not looking for excuses, nor a sociological assessment of what caused Israel to sin. God was interested in repentance, confession of sin, and restoration to fellowship. He was fully aware that Israel <strong>turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed.</strong> There was no hiding the problem. If something was not done, the divine response would be devastating: <strong>vs. 12,</strong> “…<strong>neither will I be with you any more, unless you destroy the accursed from among you” </strong>and who wants to make it alone without the presence of God?

The call to sanctify the people is reminiscent of <strong>Joshua 3:5 “And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you</strong>” God never moves in unclean vessels. If Israel was to be used of God, she had to be purged of her sins. You want to be anointed and used of God, repent, turn from your sins and hide God’s word in your heart, <strong>Psalm 119:9-11, “9 How can a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your word. 10 With my whole heart I have sought You; Oh, let me not wander from Your commandments! 11 Your word I have hidden in my heart That I might not sin against You”, </strong>Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Joshua 7:10, “So the Lord said to Joshua: “Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face? 11 Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. For they have even taken some of the accursed things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff”</strong>

I think there are people who blame God for not keeping His promises when in actuality, it’s not God’s fault<strong>.</strong> If anything, we are the ones who make God look bad to the world when we don’t get our acts together. <!--more-->We slow His work because we have sin to deal with<strong>. Isaiah 59:1, “1 Behold, the LORD’s hand is not shortened, That it cannot save; Nor His ear heavy, That it cannot hear. 2 But your iniquities have separated you from your God; And your sins have hidden His face from you, So that He will not hear". 2Peter 3:9, “The Lord is not slack concerning His promise…”</strong>

In the midst of defeat, we do not see Joshua blaming God but asking questions concerning His promises to know<strong> vs. 7 And Joshua said, “Alas, Lord God, why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all—to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh, that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!” </strong>Don’t you think that it may have run through the mind of the people that God had failed them despite the fact that it was the people, Achan to be specific?

After the initial shock of Israel’s defeat at Ai, Joshua immediately turned his face toward the Lord. His prayer, vs. 8<strong> O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turns its back before its enemies? 9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear <em>it,</em> and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?”, </strong>without knowing what had happened, he did not turn to blame the soldiers for not fighting hard or the spies for not giving him helpful information. He turned to God knowing that what had happened was way bigger than men. But watch this, his concern was not so much that the men of Ai had evened his record of victories and defeats, <strong>he was concerned for the sake of God’s great name</strong>. This I believe should be the greatest driving factor to live a holy, righteous life, that we do it for His name sake, in <strong>Ezekiel 36:21-23, </strong>God is speaking, He says<strong>, vs.21 But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations wherever they went. 22 “…, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “I do not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name’s sake, which you have profaned among the nations wherever you went. 23 And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD,” says the Lord GOD, “when I am hallowed in you before their eyes” </strong>

<strong>It’s for God’s great name we should desire to live a righteous life, desire victory, blessings, healing etc</strong>. My greatest desire and I hope is yours too is to live a righteous life for His name’s sake. I do not want people to blaspheme His name because of how I live. Don’t we see even today how God’s name is blasphemed because of how believers behave (by their lifestyle and they have no fruit to accompany their claim). David says in <strong>Psalm 23:3</strong>, “<strong>He restores my soul</strong>; <strong>He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name’s sake</strong>. Yes there are blessings that come with living a righteous life, such as escape from future punishment, life may become a little easy, there can be victories that come because of it , but as I mentioned, we want our righteous living to be for His name’s sake, for His glory. We pray “<strong>Lead us in the paths of righteousness for Your name sake”. </strong>We want to want to stay away from the accursed things for His Holy name’s sake and if we have them present, we want to get rid of them for His name sake. And in my defeat, the greatest prayer would not be about me and how the Lord should make me succeed, but my greatest concern will be for God’s great name and how He should be glorified in my life. All the rest are secondary to this desire.

Right in your struggle, in failure, in lack, in sickness etc., is the Lord’s great name your biggest reason to want to live in victory, or getting out of it is your biggest desire? blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Joshua 7:10, “So the Lord said to Joshua: “Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face? 11Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. For they have even taken some of the accursed things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff”</strong>

If there is one person who had great assurance from God about life, Joshua was that person. Look at God’s promises to him, <strong>Joshua 1:3, "vs. 3 every place that sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, as I said to Moses, ...vs. 5. No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you. vs. 6 be strong and of good courage,... vs. 13 the Lord your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land”.<!--more--> </strong>What an assurance. He was now ready to lead God’s people who assured him to follow God’s commands given to them under his leadership. Earlier it was the people that drove Moses to sin; he was tired of their complaint which led him to disobey God. An episode like this was bound to repeat itself under the leadership of Joshua if he was not careful. You can either be living in sin and miss being in God’s will or have people drive you to sin as they did with Moses, ultimately, you are still the one who is affected.

Here we find that although it was Achan who took the accursed things, the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel. As Paul regards the Corinthian church to have been polluted by the presence of one single offender <strong>1Corinthians 5:2, 6, 7</strong>, so all of Israel was polluted by the offense of one named Achan. Could it be possible that if we know that someone is living in sin and we keep quiet and do not confront them, we are enabling their sin while disabling God’s blessings upon us? For example people taking the name of the Lord in vain, even using it as a cuss word but we say nothing. If someone used my wife’s name as a cuss word, I would not be quiet, how much more should I be vocal when people take the name of the Lord my God in vain.

Look at what happened, right after victory in Jericho, the Israelites move to Ai which was a small city with few people. Those who spied Ai said <strong>vs. 3 “Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai”.</strong> They had strategy; God was on their side as they hoped and if God was for and with them, who could be against them <strong> Romans 8:31</strong>. If they were going to gain victory, God would have to go before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as pillar of fire. But because of the sin in the camp, God did not accompany them. And here we see how a small city defeated the Israelites. The Israelite forces must have been in shock. Their hearts melted, not because of cowardice, but because the strong hand of the Lord, upon which they relied, had apparently been removed from them. Sometimes you are not aware that the presence of the Lord has departed until you find yourself living in defeat. Remember Samson?

This is a very valuable lesson to learn, when you find yourself living in defeat, you want to ask yourself, has the presence of the Lord departed? And if so, is there sin currently present in your life that you have not dealt with or sin in the camp that has not been dealt with. We can be tempted in the midst of victory but to live in victory, <strong>1John 5:4</strong> says, <strong>“For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world our faith</strong>”. Christ in us is the victory we need. As long as He is present we are overcomers. Our plans and strategies without him will fail miserably and sin disables His presence and hands upon us. To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Joshua 7:10-11, "10 So the Lord said to Joshua: “Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face? 11 Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. For they have even taken some of the accursed things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff”</strong>

In the early chapters of the book of Joshua, God encourages Joshua with these words, “<strong>As I was with Moses, so shall I be with you</strong>”, we see him gain his first huge victory over Jericho. After dreaming of the promised land for 40 years and tasting victory in Jericho, Israel faces a stunning defeat at Ai which brings Joshua to ask questions. We will find out why they were defeated when they should have been gaining victory after victory.<!--more-->

While they were destroying Jericho, a special instructions went out to the people from the Lord,<strong> Joshua 6:18, “And you, by all means abstain from the accursed things, lest you become accursed when you take of the accursed things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it</strong>”. Look at the word used “accursed” which is different from “cursed”. The Hebrew word translated “accursed” means to “ban” or “devote". To make the verse clear, Israel was not to take anything from the city of Jericho, for it had been banned by God; and its destruction was devoted as a monument to the omnipotence of Jehovah, the God of Israel. There were exceptions for a reason to that ban reflected in <strong>vs. 19, “…all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated to the Lord; they shall come into the treasury of the Lord</strong>.” To go against the instructions was a serious violation. Greater victory depended on their obedience to God’s instructions. The beginning of chapter 7 tells us of a man by the name of Achan who took accursed things and the anger of the Lord burned against Israel.

In a number of messages I will share, we will see how this story unfolds showing us how when the things of God are violated, it brings about the anger of the Lord. Our prayer always ought to be, “Lord teach us to fear You more”, the bible says in<strong> Proverbs 9:10, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom”.</strong> Where there is no fear of the Lord, people take those things that God has banned and they store it in their lives (tents) while hoping that God will continue to bless and keep them. I believe there are people who are sick right now because they have welcomed things accursed by God in their lives and are unwilling to deal with them. Hatred, rage, unforgiveness, resentments, jealousies, covetousness among other things.<strong> Matthew 6:14-15, “14 For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses”</strong>. Living lifestyles accursed by the Lord insisting to keep living that way while hoping and praying the Lord would overlook it and bless you anyway. It could also be something you are into secretly you hope no one finds out. Yes, you are praying and even have people praying for you like crazy but there is no victory in your life for you have harbored accursed things. Not only is the thing affecting you, it is affecting those around you (family, friends, church). A husband may be praying for victory but not gaining it because he has accursed attitude toward his wife. He has refused to honor his wife God’s way, listen to<strong> 1Peter 3:7, “Husbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered</strong>”

Paul gives unexhausted list of accursed things that makes people miss God’s kingdom and God’s blessings,<strong> Galatians 5:19-21, “19 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 21 envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.”, </strong>What are you trusting God for? Have you examined whether you have accursed things you are practicing in your life hindering God's move in your life. Check out Paul's list and see if any of the things among others I described above are in your life. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“…take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. (Mark 14:33-36)</strong>

As I mentioned in Take it Away Part 1, I found the trilogy the Lord of the Rings by J.R. Tolkien to have a great parallel to Christ in the Garden. Just as the character Frodo Baggins was given a burden to carry that no other could carry for him, Jesus could not ultimately give to another to carry out for Him.<!--more--> Not my will but thy will be done was the prayer of Jesus. Not only did Jesus ask three times for something to be taken away from Him, but so did His servant The Apostle Paul.

Paul writes in <strong>2 Cor. 12, “And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. 8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. 9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.” </strong>God knew that Satan was going to buffet Paul and allowed it to occur anyway. This buffeting means to beat black and blue, to smite so as to cause bruises and livid spots. This is like a boxer that buffets his body, handles it roughly, discipline it by hardships. As metaphor it to give one intolerable annoyance to beat one out, or wear one out (<em>The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible)</em>.

We read here that Paul prayed and Christ responded by reminding Paul that the grace that Christ gave to Paul was to sustain him when the messenger of Satan beat on him. Many have a wrapped understanding of what grace truly is. Grace is God’s unmerited favor, which Paul had been given because Paul was called by God for such a time as this to accomplish God’s will amidst a time when preaching Christ was punishable by physical torture. Recall Paul’s conversion on the road to Damascus, Paul too was on his way to be the thorn in the flesh to many Christians. Then Jesus converted His heart reminding Paul that it is hard to kick against the pricks. He was telling Paul, the more that you kick against Me the more you are like a stupid ox that kicks against its wagon in its stubbornness only to actually be kicking the huge nail that sticks out from the wagon. The more Paul kicked the more that he was hurting himself. Now the more Paul is experiencing the thorn in the flesh, the attack of Satan, the more Christ is supplying the grace that Paul needs to endure. Life is certainly not easy, dare I say most of the time. There is actually a purpose to our trials, but we focus on the beating that we feel, rather than look to the beating that Christ endured to supply grace to us in or time of need.

We forget that we see through a glass darkly <strong>(1 Cor. 13:12) </strong>Paul writes, “<strong>For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal (2 Corinthians 4:17-18 NIV).” </strong>

When Paul prayed take it away, Christ answered take my grace which is sufficient to use on the very thing you want taken away. Christ uses our pains to show Himself strong in our lives. Think of Joseph in prison, Daniel in the lion’s den, and countless others. What will be your story as you experience your thorn in the flesh? Will you look to the grace of Christ, or focus on the beating that you feel?

Until the nets are filled…

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“…take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. (Mark 14:33-36)</strong>

As I mentioned in Take it Away Part 1, I found the trilogy the Lord of the Rings by J.R. Tolkien to have a great parallel to Christ in the Garden. Just as the character Frodo Baggins was given a burden to carry that no other could carry for him, Jesus could not ultimately give to another to carry out for Him. Not my will but thy will be done was the prayer of Jesus.<!--more-->WHOSE WILL, WILL YOU FOLLOW?

Back in the Garden of Eden by his actions, Adam said not thy will but mine be done. Adam’s focus was that the will of man was more important than the will of God. God speaks through the prophet Isaiah and tells us, <strong>“For My thoughts <em>are</em> not your thoughts, Nor <em>are</em> your ways My ways,” says the Lord. For <em>as</em> the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts.”</strong> This is why Jesus prayed, “t<strong>ake away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.”</strong> In looking to the Scriptures it appears that God calls each one of us to have a Garden of Gethsemane experience where we make the decision and pray, <strong>“…not my will, but Thy will be done.” </strong>Once again in His humanity, Jesus’ will was not to go to the cross, which was not the will of His Father. Think of what is popularly called the Lord’s Prayer, <strong>“…Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done.”</strong> When you have your Garden of Gethsemane experience and pray Thy will be done, you are also saying my will be gone! When Jesus said “…take this cup” he expressed His will, when God would not take it away, that was God’s will. Have you ever asked God if He wanted you to carry your burden instead of asking Him to just take it away? Have you ever asked Him to show you perhaps how He is using the burden in your life to prefect Christ like character in you? What is the process of having my mindset altered in this regards? How is this done?

CONFORMING TO HIS WILL

Paul penned the words, <strong>“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, <em>which is</em> your reasonable service. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what <em>is</em> that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</strong>” We are to present our bodies, our lives to the Lord as a LIVING SACRIFICE. In the Old Testament, the sacrifice was killed, however here we are called to be a living sacrifice. We are to volitionally lay down our lives for our Lord. At times that will mean carrying that burden that is placed upon us, the very burden we desire God to take away. Paul tells us the key is not to be conformed to the world, but to be transformed by renewing our minds. If marriage is tough, the world says take it away, end the relationship, but God says stay in their, hang on, work it out because you made a promise. When Christ was born, Herod wanted him killed (taken away), God wanted His Son to live and one day die for our sins. God’s will is revealed in His Word. Do you read God’s Word daily? You may have said, “God take away some of my responsibilities so I can spend more time with you.” This is a noble prayer, but perhaps you see, God has not removed your responsibilities, and still desires time with you! Allow God’s Word to change the very way in which you think and process. Then you may pray, “Take it away,” knowing that God may leave it in your hands until your mission is accomplished. Be encouraged in the Lord today; seek His will and His way and not your own. Share your faith with an unsaved person today!

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“…take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. (Mark 14:33-36)</strong>

Have you ever wanted something in your life, a problem, a situation, a burden, etc… to be taken away from you? I have certainly felt deep heart anguish in desiring that God would just take something away from me that I did not want. What do you want God to take away from you?<!--more-->

Our Savior was in the Garden of Gethsemane as he was waiting to go to the cross. In this Garden Jesus cried out three times to God to take something away from Him. Jesus desired that “this cup” be taken from Him. Recall when Christ was at the Lord’s Supper with His twelve, and he proclaimed that the cup was the cup of His blood, the cup of the New Covenant. In His humanity, He did not want to go through with the cross. Did God take the cup from His only Son at the request of Jesus? No he did not. Why does God not take that thing from us at times that we so desire Him to take from us? What is God showing us?

First, THERE IS A MISSION TO ACCOMPLISH. Jesus had a mission to accomplish, and if God were to take away the cup, then Jesus would have not fulfilled His mission. God has given a mission to each one of His children to accomplish. However you may want God to take away the “cup” from you, whatever your cup is. If God were to take it away how would you accomplish the mission that God set out for you? Do you know the mission that He has called you to? If your desire is to please the One that has called you, then you may ask Him to remove something from you, but His desire is for you to fulfill your mission, and somehow that thing that perhaps you may despise may be the very thing that God needs to use to fulfill His will in you.

Secondly, A SORROWFUL SOUL HONORS GOD. I’ve heard it said that the soul is described as the mind, will and the emotions. There are two types of sorrow, godly sorrow and worldly sorrow. Jesus’ soul possessed a sorrowful at having to drink from the cup that He desired to be taken from Him. Although your soul may be sorrowful, God knows that He is not giving you too much that you can’t handle with His hand upon your life. The Scriptures says that Jesus sweat great drops of blood, as He was under such tremendous pressure to do the Will of His Father.

Thirdly, YOU HAVE CLOSE FRIENDS, BUT THE CUP (BURDEN) IS YOURS. Jesus had his three inner circle, Peter, James, and John nearby. Although they meant well, and were even in the Garden with Him, Jesus went through the heart anguish alone, with His Father. There may be those that mean well, there may be those that are close, but you find them sleeping as you are struggling. I believe that the three meant to stay awake and pray for Jesus, but their strength couldn’t carry themselves let alone Jesus Christ. Have you ever experienced those closest to you perhaps desired to help, they were there for you, they journeyed with you into places and at times others would not dare go with you? These are the ones that if they knew how to take “the cup” from you, probably would, but God would not dare allow them to take it. I am reminded of Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as He struggled with the mission of destroying the ring of evil. Jesus struggled to eradicate sin and redeem humanity from the curse of the Law and the power of Satan. Do you desire others to take the cup from you? Realize that your closest loved ones can’t take it, because it is not theirs to take, God gave it to you. To be continued

Until the nets are filled…

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship<em>.</em>” (Rom 12:1)</strong>

The ultimate offering is when Jesus Christ sacrificed His life on the cross to pay the penalty for our sin(s). <strong>1 Peter 3:18</strong> reads “<strong>For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit</strong>:” <strong>Galatians 3:13</strong> reads, <strong>“Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree.”</strong> <!--more-->There is no sacrificial offering like the sacrifice of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. If Christ did not die in our place we would forever be stained and saturated in our sin and transgression.

Paul’s urging is for you and I to offer ourselves as an offering completely to the Lord and His service. Before a priest in Israel could minister on behalf of others, he was obliged to present himself in a consecrated condition and the sacrifices he offered were to be without blemish (Mal 1:8-13). The priest offered God a dead sacrifice, while we are called to be a living sacrifice. A living sacrifice can crawl off the altar of obedience. Again Samuel wrote, <strong><em>To obey is better than sacrifice</em>, and to heed is better than the fat of rams” (1 Sam 15:22).</strong> We are to offer our lives, our whole lives to the Lord as an offering to Him. What else can we really offer to the One that founded the entire world? Let me close with this illustration.

I recall a true story of a nine year old boy who lived in a rural town in Tennessee. His house was in a poor area of the community. A local church had a bus ministry that came knocking on his door one Saturday afternoon. The kid came to answer the door and greeted the bus pastor. The bus pastor asked the little boy if he and his parents ever went to church. The boy replied no. The bus pastor shared his faith with the young boy whose heart melted at the gospel story. The boy then went to church with the bus pastor. While at the church the little boy just sat there, clue-less of what was going on. A few minutes into the service these tall unhappy guys walked down to the front and picked up some wooden plates. One of the men prayed and the kid with utter fascination watched them walk up and down the aisles. He still didn't know what was going on.

All of a sudden like a bolt of lightning it hit the kid what was taking place. These people must be giving money to Jesus. He then reflected on the free gift of life he had received just twenty-four hours earlier. He immediately searched his pockets, front and back, and couldn't find a thing to give Jesus. By this time the offering plate was being passed down his aisle with a broken heart he just grabbed the plate and held on to it. He finally let go and watched it pass on down the aisle.

He turned around to see it passed down the aisle behind him. And then his eyes remained glued on the plate as it was passed back and forth, back and forth all the way to the rear of the sanctuary. Then he had an idea. This little nine year old boy, in front of God and everybody, got up out of his seat. He walked about eight rows back, grabbed the usher by the coat and asked to hold the plate one more time. Then he did the most astounding thing I have ever heard of. He took the plate, put it on the carpeted church floor and stepped into the center of it. As he stood there, he lifted his little head up and said, "Jesus, I don't have anything to give you today, but just me. I give you me!"

We are to become the offering unto the Lord through our obedience. When you offer yourself fully to the Lord in your time (the way you spend your time), talents (the manner that you use the gifts God bestowed upon you), and treasures (your finances and material blessings), you become the living sacrifice that God desires of you. How are you spending you time; does your schedule reflect His Lordship? How do you use your talents for Him, the ones that He has given you? Does your check book, credit card statement, and spending, reflect that Jesus Christ is Lord of you? May you be an offering worth offering unto the One you call Lord.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“But the king (David) replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” 2 Samuel 24:24</strong>

Most people enjoy getting something for free. A while back my students asked me why everything can’t be for free. I responded by saying everything costs somebody something. Araunah the Jebusite attempted to give David a free offering so that David would have an offering to give to the Lord. <!--more-->David responded by saying, “<strong>No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them”.</strong>

The Spirit Filled Life Bible points out “The threshing floor of Araunah was on Mount Moriah where Abraham offered Isaac (Gen. 22:2). Abraham was told by God “<strong><em>Take your son , your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah… Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering</em></strong>.” Abraham offered that which was precious to him, his son. However, before Abraham brought down the knife upon his son, “the angel of the Lord called to him out of the heavens and said, ‘<strong><em>Abraham, Abraham…lay not a hand upon the lad…now I know that you fear God seeing you did not withhold your son, your only son from me</em></strong>.”

How could David stand on the same plot of land that Abraham stood upon and not bring a costly offering. Abraham was asked by God to offer his son as an act of obedience to God. The Prophet Samuel said, Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? <strong><em>To obey is better than sacrifice</em></strong>, and to heed is better than the fat of rams” (1 Sam 15:22). When David brought the offering to the Lord there was a plague in Israel. 2 Samuel 24:25 states, “<strong><em>David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the LORD answered prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped</em></strong>.” David’s focus was upon the healing of others.

Had you ever had a Garden of Gethsemane experience? “<em>It was in a garden where Adam first said, “Not your will but mine be done,” and it was in a garden where Jesus fell to His knees and prayed, “Not my will but Yours be done.” At the time, His disciples were asleep; so when it comes to being obedient to God, and sharing the gospel of truth with the unsaved, don’t be discouraged. Simply get on your knees and pray Father, I desire to be obedient to you, and the thought of sharing my faith with others makes me sweat great drops of blood in fear. Yet not my will, but Yours be done</em> (Ray Comfort).” God is still looking for those that would give an offering worth offering, an obedient life to Him. Obedience is challenging, but if you’re like me, at the times that I don’t obey the Lord, it only makes things worse off. There are so many people that are dying without Christ, because so many Christians are not being obedient to share their faith. The late Bill Bright in his book, The Coming Revival, wrote that only 2 percent of Christians regularly share their faith with others.

Are you being obedient to the voice of the Lord in your life? Are you sharing your faith with others?

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD. But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor.” (Genesis 4:3 – 5)</strong>

In part one, we saw that an offering worth offering to God is one that is accurate (hits his heart) and one that is authentic (given out of our love of putting Him first).<!--more-->

<strong>God respects when we bring the best of what we have to offer</strong>. Cain was a farmer that “<em>brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord</em>.” He brought an offering to God, it was not the best; it was second hand, leftovers. God supplied the seed, the hydration, and the sunlight to grow the fruit. God supplied the best environment that was needed to grow the fruit. Abel brought the best to the Lord. Abel was an animal keeper, most likely a shepherd that “<em>brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock</em>.” God supplied the initial animals, because unknown to Evolutionists, “the chicken did come before the egg.” God also supplied the food, water, etc… that the animals needed to grow and be healthy. I picture Abel looking at his sheep and thinking which one would God be pleased with to receive as an offering. Abel chose the top of the flock, and offered them to the Lord.

<strong>God respects when we bring our offering by faith</strong>. Hebrews 11:4 gives further insight about these two brothers as it read, “<strong><em>By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead</em></strong>.” If Abel gave God his best, then how would Abel breed more healthy sheep? Abel seemed to apply wisdom in not letting his left hand know what his right hand was doing. When Abel gave his best sheep, he saw his best leaving and not being replaced immediately. Abel gave by faith, not by sight. God supplies all our needs, and I believe that as God respected Abel’s offering, God supplied a healthy vibrant flock for him. Jesus said, “<strong><em>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it</em></strong>.” In the same regards in God’s economy when we lose it (give it unto the Lord) we gain. When we try to keep it (holding back from the Lord) we lose. This was not so with Cain, who seemed to keep the best and give God the second best.

<strong>God accepts offerings from those that belong to Him. </strong>Jesus spoke about false coverts (people that think that they are saved when they are not). Jesus told many parables about this including the parable of the sower, the foolish virgins (false) and the wise virgins (genuine), the good fish (genuine) and bad fish (false), the wheat (genuine) and tares (false), the sheep (genuine) and the goats (false). It seems that Cain foreshadowed the false while Abel foreshadowed the genuine. God accepted Abel’s offering, but rejected Cain’s. A father probably wouldn’t hang another child’s drawing on his refrigerator? However, he would proudly display his own child’s drawing on it? Cain’s heart did not submit to God’s heart, even though he approached God and gave God an offering. God accepted the offering from Abel as Abel’s heart did submit to God’s heart. A son wants to please his father, and does whatever is necessary to “win” his dads approval. Perhaps we can liken Cain and Abel to Judas (false) and Peter (genuine). Both were called to lay down their lives for Jesus, but only one did. Are you bringing God your best as an offering by faith because you genuinely belong to Him? Are you bringing an offering worth offering? To be continued…

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD. But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor.” (Genesis 4:3 – 5)</strong>

Back when I was in Bible College God taught me a very humbling lesson. I was serving on the homeless outreach team that brought food, blankets, and clothing to the homeless on the streets of Philadelphia. It was winter time and there was a thin layer of snow on the ground. <!--more-->This night I was speaking to a man that asked if I had a pair of gloves for him. I looked proudly at my brand new warm leather gloves that I was wearing and thought there is no way that I am giving my gloves to this man. I looked down and saw a glove frozen into the snow. I picked it up, dusted it off and offered it to the man. With disappointment he turned and walked away from me.

Later that evening while in my dorm room God severely convicted me of my pride and greed. God reminded me that I wore the gloves that He provided for me. The glove I offered to the cold man, God did not respect. I blew it bad because of my pride. I believe that something of this sort happened to Cain when he offered his offering to God in Genesis 4.

Cain and Abel both approached God, both brought an offering to God, both offerings were examined by God, but only one was respected by God. What made Abel’s offering to please the Lord? The writer of Hebrews gives us further insight. <strong>Hebrews 11:4</strong> reads, <strong>“By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead”</strong>

<strong>God respects an accurate offering “<em>The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering</em></strong>” One must hit the bulls-eye when it comes to pleasing God. One can’t just throw anything God’s way and expect Him to honor it. In this case the bulls-eye is the heart of God. Abel hit God in the heart with his offering. Abel seemed to know what God would desire to receive from that which he blessed Abel with. Cain was angry with God, but did not offer an accurate offering. He wanted God to accept whatever he threw toward God. What has God blessed you with? Many unfortunately chock on their blessings, rather than bless the Lord with that which He has given. God’s heart is about His glory and blessing others. How accurate of offering are you bringing to God? Is it connecting to His heart?

<strong>God respects an authentic offering </strong>“<strong><em>The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering.” </em></strong>God looked with favor upon Abel. Abel desired to give God his very best. I believe Abel loved God with all his heart, mind, soul and strength. Abel was genuine toward God, he put God first. Abel placed God’s glory before his own, because Abel was authentic. Cain’s offering was not out of his love for God, he did not put God first. God didn’t look with favor on Cain nor his offering. I believe Cain’s offering was not genuine in the sense that it was given as though it were Cain’s best, but God knew otherwise. Perhaps this is one of the reasons after Cain killed his brother that God said to Cain, “<strong>If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it</strong>.” One can’t bring an offering with an unrighteous heart before God. Are you authentic with God in your offering, or phony like Cain? To be continued…

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 33:17-18, “17 So the LORD said to Moses, “I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found grace in My sight, and I know you by name.” 18 And he said, “Please, show me Your glory."</strong>

The other day I was reading some comments posted online in response to a certain article about Christianity. Most of the comments were hard to read, God is hated out here. I remember back in the day where even if people did not serve God, at least they had a little reverence for Him. Today we have God haters.

<!--more-->

We have a generation that has lost the fear of God, and we can see by what people are embracing and making it seem like the Almighty God is fine with their sin. Its been made to appear that God’s main job is to make man happy. God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.  Jesus came on the face of the earth to die to make man happy. If that is the case, why not embrace the sin we love the most as long as we are happy and God will indeed bless us? Is God is a means to an end? No fear of God because most have not had a glimpse of the glory of God. I would categorize this group as God accommodators.

When God was leading the Israelites to the Promised Land, in the previous chapter, they made idols for themselves to worship and even concluded that that their golden calf was their deliverer from Egypt. In <b>Exodus 33:3,</b> God tells Moses to go and tell the Israelites that they are stiff necked people because of their rebellion, stubbornness, complaints (sin). Today Moses would be labeled judgmental, cruel, unloving, unkind, and insensitive.

God even said, “I will let you go to the promise land but without my presence going with you” some would have been happy with that, and so are people who want to go to heaven today, they want to be partakers of God’s blessings but don’t want God. As Paul Washer always says, “<em>These are people who want to go to heaven; they just hope God is not there when they get there.”</em>

God called Israelites stiff necked people. Moses may have wondered, “<i>how are they stiff-necked people, yes they complained, but they were not that bad”</i> and if anything, God shouldn’t get worked up because these are His people He brought out of Egypt by the hand of Moses, but God knew them better. Are we not in the same state today that even some Christians find it hard or don’t believe that man is wretched, stiff necked? Again it boils down to, loss of fear of God because people have not had a glimpse of God’s glory.

God would have brought them under the yoke of His law, and into the bond of His covenant, but their necks were too stiff to bow to them. God would have cured them of their corrupt and crooked dispositions, and have set them straight; but they were willful and obstinate, and hated to be reformed, and would not have God to reign over them.

<strong>However, Vs. 4 “When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments” </strong>NIV. Those whom God pardons, must be made to know what their sin is, and what they deserve. God calls sin as it is, that is why we must preach the law to the lost, it magnifies God. <strong>God reveals Himself in the spirituality of His law</strong>. <strong>That is where His righteousness and perfect purity of character are revealed for men to learn it there. </strong>The beauty of God’s holiness will not allow Him to gloss over sin. His law magnifies Him, and for sinners, “<em>Having thus removed the mask and shown the desperate case of the sin</em><i>ner, the relentless law causes the offence to abound yet more by bringing home the sentence of condemnation. It mounts the judgment seat, puts on the black cap, and pronounces the sentence of death. With a harsh unpitying voice, it solemnly thunders forth the words, "Condemned already." It bids the soul prepare its defense, knowing well that all apologies have been taken away by its former work of conviction. The sinner is therefore, speechless, and the law, with frowning looks, lifts up the veil of hell, and gives the man a glimpse of torment. The soul feels that the sentence is just, that the punishment is not too severe, and that mercy it has no right to expect; it stands quivering, trembling, fainting, and intoxicated with dismay, until it falls to prostrate in utter despair. The sinner puts the rope around his own neck, arrays himself in the attire of the condemned, and throws himself at the foot of the King's throne, with but one thought, "I am vile"; and with one prayer, "God be merciful to me a sinner</i><i>.” </i>Charles Spurgeon.

Man must have knowledge of self as stiff necked people; otherwise he will never bow before the just and holy God. Only God’s glory displayed through the law can bring him to that state, and thereafter God haters become God lovers, and God accommodators get done with themselves, dethrone themselves and submit to God’s righteousness, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>E</b><strong>xodus 33:17-18, “17 So the LORD said to Moses, “I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found grace in My sight, and I know you by name.” 18 And he said, “Please, show me Your glory.”</strong>

The very famous verse quoted in reaching the lost,<strong> Romans 3:23, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God</strong>”. Have you ever wondered how short we have fallen? Also the verse does not say, <b>“...fall short of God’s moral standard” This verse has no weight and loses its meaning if you don't first read and understand Romans 1,2&amp;3. </b>Now think about <strong>Isaiah 6:3, “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; The whole earth is full of His glory!”,</strong> it does not finish with what it started. If it started with “holy” repeated three times, you would expect Isaiah to conclude by saying, “<strong>the whole earth is full of His holiness</strong>” instead he says, “<strong>The whole earth is full of His glory</strong>”. There is something about “HIS GLORY”; I hope we can get a little glimpse of this word “glory”, the revelation of God.

<!--more-->

“<strong>The Glory of God”</strong> is an important theme in the book of exodus, and it is the first time I see it introduced in the books of the bible. It appears in relation to the deliverance and wandering in the wilderness, the ratification of the covenant and the tabernacle. It could be concluded that a discussion on this theme should be related to a discussion on the being and attributes of God. In the OT, however, “glory” is the visible and supernatural manifestation of the supreme and incomparable majesty of God. According to the commentary I read, the Hebrew word for “glory” is (kabod), which means “weight” or “substance” and comes to mean the honor stemming from the manifestation of the sum total of God’s attributes, and also from the AWE which such a revelation inspires those who behold it. Pastor John Piper describes it this way, “<em>The glory of God is the manifestation of His holiness. God’s holiness is the incomparable perfection and greatness of His divine nature; His glory is the display of that holiness. His glory is the open revelation of the secret of His holiness. When God shows Himself to be holy, what we see is His glory—the beauty of holiness. The holiness of God is His concealed glory. The glory of God is His revealed holiness.” In summary, “The glory of God is the infinite beauty and greatness of His manifold perfections”</em>, John Piper

And here we see that Moses is asking God, “<strong>Please, show me Your glory</strong>”, the glory we all fall short of. Having a little bit described the “glory of God”; I can understand why in preaching the gospel we need to start with the glory of God. Imagine you are told of a very important person you are going to meet. You may have despised his name when you heard it. You have heard of bad things that have happened while he was in leadership, and you came up with every thought you could imagine about this person as being such a bad person compared to you. But as they continue to describe this important person you have to stand before, his qualities, his attributes, his likes, his preference, what has been concealed to you is being revealed and displayed. Would that not drive you to start thinking of how unworthy you are to stand before such an important person? You look at who you are, where you’ve been, what you’ve done etc and everything good you thought about yourself falls short having heard a description of this important person? That was Isaiah’s experience in <b>Isaiah 6</b>, no one told Isaiah of his sins, he saw the holiness of God, His righteousness, His majesty, how great He is, how marvelous, how powerful, His omnipotence, His sovereignty etc, all summed up in two words, “HIS GLORY”. I can imagine him saying, <i>“how can I stand in a glory like that in my state? I'm unworthy”</i>. <i>He is not like me, He deserves more than this, I’ve fallen short of His requirement to stand before Him. Isaiah did not start with himself as the measuring standard (sinners do), He started with God in His glory, “please, show me Your glory”.</i>

Then these questions as posted by Voddie Baucham comes to us 1. Who am I? answer, the crowning glory of the creation of God, 2. Why I’m I here?, “to bring glory and honor to the Lord Jesus Christ”, 3. What is wrong with the world?, ME. Why? I don’t do what I was meant to do, <strong>Romans 1:21, “…although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened” </strong>We glorify God because we have seen Him in His glory and His glory has revealed to us our unworthiness and how in our state we would not stand before Him. We have seen the beauty of His holiness revealing to us that in our life we are not bringing him the glory and honor He deserves and only Christ can redeem us, restore us and clothe us in His righteousness. Now our only motivation, our drive, our desire, our passion is, “BE THOU GLORIFIED”. Thank you Lord for showing me Your glory. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 25, vs. 4, “Show me your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths vs. 5, Lead me in Your truth and teach me”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image14.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6223" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image14.jpg?w=285" alt="image" width="285" height="300" /></a></strong>

Solving math equation was a challenge to me in my school years and so were others. To try and pass, many times we had RIGHT ANSWERS but no method to lead to those right answers, and we could not explain to the teacher how we exactly arrived at those answers because we mostly copied them from other smart kids or from the back of the book. <!--more-->Most of the math questions required several steps some taking at least a half a page to solve one question step by step. The valuable lesson I ever learnt was that the teacher was not so much impressed with the right answers, he was interested in how I got there. He needed me to show him step by step and gave points to each step that was correct. I found I got more points for the steps than for the answers.

<strong>Road less traveled are roads that require steps and often times we crave for answers and hope there are no steps to the process</strong>. It’s like saying, “<i>I want to graduate without studying or sitting for an exam”, “I want to have an answer to a math problem without steps to lead me there”</i>. The psalmist in this text begins with a plea for deliverance in vs. 1, and deliverance calls for an answers but look at how he goes about it. He is not seeking for an end result to which he will get to at some point, he is seeking for a process, a very rare thing people ask. He is not seeking to be "<strong>brought out</strong>" but "<strong>brought through</strong>". V<strong>s. 4, says “Show me your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths vs. 5, Lead me in your truth and teach me”. </strong>Three important things he asks for “SHOW ME”, “TEACH ME”, “LEAD ME”, looking at these closely, I can see that there are no shortcuts. All these three calls for complete submission to the Lord. “Show me” says to the Lord, “<i>I’m lost and blind, open my eyes and show me, not my ways but Your ways”. “Show me what you have planned and purposed for my life, show me what you require of me”. </i>“Teach me” calls for the Lord to instruct, but you can only instruct someone you have their full corporation (their ears and their heart) with great eagerness to learn. It’s like saying, “<i>I want to learn everything I need to learn in Your path because there must be a good reason you let me be distressed</i>”. “Lead me” is the Lord having to hold my hands as He guides me in His truth while bringing me to what He purposed when He allowed the distress to come my way.

When you compare Moses' life and the Israelites, God gave the Israelites answers but to Moses He showed him His way (process). Moses learnt a lot in the process. There is something about the process that shapes and molds you in the "Show me”, “Teach me” and “Lead me”. It brings about fulfillment and growth in ways you could never imagine or think. <strong>Romans 5:3-5, “3 and not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing tribulations produces perseverance  4, and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us”. </strong>Paul had it rough but he counted it joy to have been a student in God’s class “Road less traveled”<strong>. </strong>These are the same things the psalmist would have not wanted to miss in the Lord’s class when faced with the impossible. He wanted things that build perseverance (patience), establishes character (experience), increases faith (hope), teaches humility and surrender (self-denial) and testimony.

It was like the psalmist, David was saying, “<i>sign me up for this class </i>“Road less traveled”. It will not be fun but it will be vital. It will be nice to have answers but I will benefit more by taking the class. It’s a shaping class. He wasn’t signing up in good times, he was signing up in distressing times, he says in <strong>Psalm 86:11, “Teach me Your way, O Lord; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name”, </strong>his desire, “His truth” and “fear of God”. How best can you learn these without taking the class? Many have been trying to avoid the class by crying “<strong>give me an answer</strong>” and yes sometimes you have been given an answer but you have missed the dynamics that comes about in taking the class where you are totally committed because you are craving for more. <strong>I believe God is MORE present in the process than He is in the answer, </strong>take a look at some men in the bible and you will see it. The process is the “road less traveled” and that is why we find that even in reaching the lost, we want to give them answers and avoid the process. If they cannot withstand the process, the answer will not be of help. The road less traveled is narrow, very few find it.

What is your prayer when you are in distress “BRING ME OUT?” or “BRING ME THROUGH?”, stay on this road. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Philippians 4:13, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"</strong>

This verse has been quoted by many people in reference to accomplishing stuff. Evander Holyfield a former World Undisputed Champion boxer had this verse as his theme verse for boxing. While this verse has been used by Evander and vast majority as theme verse to get stuff, a few verses that lead to verse 13 paints a different picture. <!--more-->It leads us to understand it's proper application if we are to use it. It’s a verse for the weak, the sick, hurting folks, grieving folks. It’s a verse for those desiring to endure in need of strength.

A popular message, “God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life” is echoed by many but pause for a minute and discover God’s wonderful plan for Paul and see if it fits what we would call “wonderful plan”. The first thing Jesus said of the Apostle Paul (who wrote most of the New Testament) was that He would show him great things he must suffer for (His) name's sake. Three times Paul was beaten with rods, once stoned, three times he suffered shipwreck, a night and a day he spent in the sea. He was imprisoned. There were times when Paul was so unhappy, he wanted to die, but God... Never did he doubt God’s love for him because the cross always reminded him of this truth.

In Philippians 4: vs. 11-13 we see Paul’s contentment (a word rare in our time) in every state. He says, <strong>"Not that I speak in regards to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need,</strong>” The apostle seemed to boast of his own ability, his resume, but that’s not the case, he transfers all the praise to Christ when he says “<strong>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me".</strong>

If you look at this scripture carefully you see a lot of learning and surviving that causes Paul to be victorious in the end. He looks at all he had been through and was still standing and he knew it had nothing to do with him but Christ. <strong>His confidence was not in his ability, but rather in whose he was</strong>. He gives us a glimpse of a life lived for Christ as life lived by Christ through Paul.

<strong>Galatians 2:20, “ I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me”, </strong>In this verse you ask, who is doing the living, Paul or Christ? By faith Paul was crucified at his conversion, crucified in the flesh, died to the old life. Now he lives, or rather, Christ lives in him. The old life is laid aside, and the new life is a Christlike life, due to the spirit of Christ. He is now merged in Christ. <strong>Faith is the bond that binds him to Christ and enables him to live the new life even when it seems hard, confusing and painful</strong>.

I believe that the greater thing you can do through Christ who strengthens you is what you’ve lived through. That it appears to the world you are the one doing the living when in actuality, its Christ living in you giving you strength to live His own life of trials and hardship and giving you grace to hold on. <strong>I believe greater testimony comes from what you have survived through Christ who strengthens you, and not what you have achieved.</strong> What you have survived has a lot to teach compared to what you have achieved. I am more grateful for the things I have survived for they were eye opening. They brought out greater faith and confidence in God that if I can go through this and come out victoriously, I can go through something else and again be victorious because God gives me strength to live for Him.

Paul’s final word to his young son in the faith Timothy and to us is this<strong>, 2Timothy 3:10,” But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, 11 persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me. 12 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. … 14 But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.” </strong>

You and I can stand on this promise,” <strong>I can do (go through) all things through Christ who strengthens me”</strong> and live a legacy like Paul did<strong>. Blessings Ev</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 11:23, "When he (Barnabas) came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord" </strong>

Luke writing the book of Acts introduces Barnabas as a generous man who sold his land to support the growing church. Unlike Paul and Peter, Barnabas had a very unique ministry. I am yet to come across where he ministered alone, performed miracles and the like. <!--more-->You don't hear much about him, there is no book dedicated to him. He only appears mostly in the book of Acts and then mentioned by Paul and Peter in the other epistles, but Barnabas is special.

Who was Barnabas anyway? First, the name Barnabas means <strong>"son of encouragement</strong>". He is not so much on the fore front but one who is always on the side encouraging. I would say that he must have been the one who discipled Paul when Paul was converted, why? <strong>Acts 9:27, "But Barnabas took him and brought him (Paul) to the apostles... </strong>". He was the type of an individual who was easy going, forgave easily and saw far beyond what natural eyes could see. If you remember, Saul now known as Paul was persecuting Christians. Even after his conversion, Christians still had a hard time accepting him and Barnabas played a very important role in encouraging brethren to rally around Paul for he was now a brother in the Lord. God had graciously done something in Paul’s life to which I believe the disciples may have prayed earnestly for his salvation. Barnabas became like a leader unto Paul for a while. If you read more in the book of Acts, Luke constantly introduces them as “Barnabas and Paul”, look at the order (Acts 11:30). Barnabas first, then Paul second. Around Acts 13:43, the introduction changes to “Paul and Barnabas” revealing to us that now Paul was mature enough to be a leader and Barnabas as usual became a supporting minister. I love Barnabas, a man of sweet spirit, a very meek individual who knows that his position is important. Yes he is not so much known but his ministry of encouragement was necessarily needed. Paul benefited from it so was John Mark when Paul did not want to take him with him to another mission. Barnabas encouraged Paul to take John Mark but he would not, later you hear Paul calling for John Mark in 2Timothy 4 to come and help him minister. John Mark’s ministry was vital to Paul and may have amended their differences. Barnabas was a patient man, seeing far beyond faults knowing that with time, there will be growth.

<strong>Acts 11:23, "When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord</strong>". What a blessing to know that the ministry of encouragements is vastly needed in our lives today. Barnabas went about encouraging believers to continue with Lord. There must have been those who were discouraged, weak, loosing hope but he was there to encourage them. I have seen people who lost hope and direction yet little encouragement awakened the desire to keep standing strong. A little encouragement allowed them to blossom again. When was the last time you were a Barnabas to someone? You might not have a ministry like Paul but don't forget that there was a Barnabas in the background encouraging him and others around him. You never know how the one you encourage today could turn out to be. Your little encouragement could save someone who was fed up with life and was ready to end it. A little encouragement could save one from making bad decisions. I am already a Barnabas but want to be more, are you a Barnabas? Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:7 "If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. 8 By this My Father is glorified, that you bear MUCH fruit; so you will be My disciples"</strong>

I am a firm believer of being in the Father's business. This is where I cease to live for myself, meaning having passed from death to life and that's it. I want to live a life that is pleasing to the Lord by dying daily (crucifying the flesh) and be challenged to do things my flesh does not crave at all but are good for my growth.<!--more--> I die to self so as to be alive in and unto Christ. <strong>Galatians 2:20, "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. </strong>I want to know His will for my life and there are two things that are definitely God's will for every believer and that is <strong>Prayer</strong> (intercession) and <strong>Evangelism </strong>(reaching the lost). Yet these two are the ones easily put aside from my experience.

This is my personal conviction, you cannot grow MUCH in the Lord without Prayers and Evangelism. I believe these two are the wings that stabilizes our Christian walk like a plane that needs two wings to fly and balance. Wings provide a balance and stability. They work together, hand in hand. Prayers shows our total dependency on God, Evangelism is our response to His last command. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prayer is talking to God about men, evangelism is talking to men about God</span></b>. Prayer changes and conforms us to be Christ like and so is the gospel. If you are praying and not evangelizing, you are a Christian with one wing and so is evangelizing and not praying. One cannot work effectively without the other. <strong>I pray that I may evangelize and I evangelize that I may pray</strong>. A good analogy to make this point clear, <strong>God requires us to push rocks (pray and witness to the unsaved) but He doesn't expect us to move the rocks (save them). In the process of us being obedient to push the rocks (pray for them and share with them), He steps in to move the rocks (save them) and He gets all the credit (glory).</strong> The gospel of Christ is the POWER of God to SALVATION, <b>Romans 1:16</b>. In the Great Commission (as it is frequently labeled; <b>Matthew 28:19</b>), Jesus commanded His disciples to “<strong>Go… and make disciples</strong>.” The objective was not that they attract their own disciples, but that they win new followers of Jesus. Acts tells the story of how the Spirit-filled apostles obeyed that command. If we were to pray for our Father's will and if we were to lay our heads on the Father's breast so to speak, I believe we would feel His heart for the lost according to <strong>Matthew 18:14</strong>, which says, "<strong>Even so it is not the WILL of your Father who is in heaven that ONE of these little ones should PERISH"</strong>. We may not be too concerned but He is and the moment we get a glimpse, a taste of what He requires of us, we will make His last call our priority. How can we make a last call our priority unless we have prayed the will of the Father to be our burden and then <strong>we put legs to our prayers and respond to the call as God’s answered prayer for us.</strong>

<strong>John 15:7, "If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you" </strong>this may appear as a blank check but not so, look again at how the verse begins, "<strong>If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you</strong>.." the more we abide, the more we learn and experience what the Lord requires of us. It shapes and molds how we pray and what we pray for. All our selfish motives about how we pray for melts before His presence as we become consumed by His desire for His name sake. How will He get more glory if we do not go about His business of sharing with the lost?, The bible continues to say, <strong>8 By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples". </strong>A disciple is a follower of Christ, and what did Christ do with His disciples? He made them fishers of men. This is the "prime product", the blessings of other things are the "by products" of being obedient<strong>. </strong>Read the book of Acts and see how they grew MUCH while doing the Lord's work, <strong>Acts 6:4, "but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” </strong>Not that other ministries were less important, these two helped them grow much.

These two things have been instrumental in growing me much in the Lord, they shape every aspect of your walk. To evangelize, you need to dig deep into the word. To understand the word you need to pray; to preach the word, you need the boldness acquired through prayers. While you share, the power to save is in God’s hands driving you again to pray. When you share, you are preaching the gospel to others and to yourself. The gospel never gets old. Do you have your two wings? Ask the Lord to day. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:1-8, vs. 2, "...and every branch that bears fruit He PRUNES, that it may bear MORE fruit"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image10.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5963" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image10.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong>

I cannot think of anything that causes more and faster growth like adversities. In the light of things going backwards or getting less or dying or eliminated has potential of causing greater growth in ways we could never imagine or fathom. You would think that in cutting back should create less opportunity for growth, not until you understand why a plant needs pruning (cutting back).<!--more-->

Jesus defines Himself as the true Vine in vs. 1 and God the Father as the vine dresser (Gardner) and the believers are the branches. Those who abide in Christ, the branches are inspected by the Father (the vine dresser) and vs. <strong>2, “Every branch in Me (Christ) that does not bear fruit He takes away;". </strong>God the gardener is not looking for leaves, He is looking for fruit. You may be trying to please the Lord with your  leaves and how green they are, how big and healthy they are. The Lord is not impressed with leaves, He is looking for fruit, a sign of growth in your life. There are many who call themselves Christians who have more leaves than fruits and they are excited that they have leaves but again, it's not the leaves that the Lord inspects, it's the fruit. So the branch on the vine that does not bear fruit, He takes it way.

<strong>Vs. 2, "...and every branch that bears fruit He PRUNES, that it may bear MORE fruit</strong>". Here is where many Christians are, they are excited that they have fruit, little fruit and that's it. Why desire more when you have something to cling to? Then here comes the Lord who takes the branch that bears fruit and prunes it. What is pruning? Pruning is the practice of removing diseased, non-productive, or otherwise unwanted portions from a plant. The purpose of pruning is to shape the plant by controlling or directing plant growth, to maintain the health of the plant and increase the yield or quality of fruits. Pruning requires cutting back, cleaning, removing dead leaves for a reason. You may be facing some setbacks right now in your own life and you may be wondering why go through all these when you are bearing fruit as a believer. You may never know if the Lord has set your life for pruning so as to move you from bearing fruit to bearing MORE fruit. Maybe the Lord wants to grow more faith in you, more patience, more love, more joy, more peace, more grace, more prayer in your life, more reading of His word, more reaching the lost and so cutting back propels you to grow more and more under what you call adversities. That there have been things hindering you from growing some more, therefore he cuts them back. The key word is MORE.

Cutting back does not mean destruction, it means the branch through the vine has potentials to grow more if pruned. How can we abide on the true vine and remain the same? Now Proper pruning is as much a skill as it is an art, since badly pruned plants can become diseased or grow in undesirable ways but the Lord is the Master in pruning. He knows how best to prune each of us so as to bear more fruit. He knows what kind of pruning and how much of it He has to do to make a difference in our lives. <strong>Setbacks are temporary results brought about by pruning, the end result is more growth that brings about more fruit bearing desperately needed in your life</strong>. David says, <strong>Psalm 119:71, "It is good for me that I have been afflicted (pruned), That I may learn (grow) Your statutes". </strong>Pruning can either make you or break you, you make the choice. Tough times don't last, tough people do. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Peter 1:1-8, "For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ"<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image13.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6044" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image13.jpg" alt="image" width="300" height="273" /></a></strong>

In the next three devotions, I will share some thoughts from the bible that can help you, Grow in the Lord, Grow MORE in the Lord and Grow MUCH in the Lord. These have been instrumental in my growth. Let’s start with “To grow in the Lord…”<!--more-->

While the life of a Christian is not about working a right formula or right ingredients, the thought of ingredients has some good concepts applicable in our lives to bear fruit.

In the book of Peter we are given ingredients for fruitful growth in the faith, <strong>2Peter 1:3, "as His divine power has given to us all things pertaining to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue". </strong>We can see that God has bestowed upon each of us the ingredients for our growth (recipe). This has come to us through promises that we may be partakers of the divine nature. Why do some lives turn out worse than others when we have been given the same ingredients? simple, if you do not follow instructions as to how to utilize the ingredients, you will end up with something else. One can do away with one, two or three ingredients and say, "I don't need them" or put less or more of one thing and with that you lose what the recipe book had in mind to produce.

Here are things we are advised to do, <strong>vs. 5, "But also for this very reason, giving all diligence" </strong>we must strive if we will enter in at the strait gate, <b>Luke 13:24</b><strong>.</strong> Being persistent, steadfast unmovable in the things of God. Vs. 5 "…<strong>Add to your faith virtue</strong>", virtue is moral excellence, in other words, in your foundation in Christ, add virtue for people to see what you stand for. I believe people see the faith in you more when virtue is present (the outworking of the internal). Vs. 5 "…<strong>To virtue knowledge</strong>", <strong>Proverbs 1:7, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge</strong>" which is understanding through experience or training. Knowledge can lead to truth if channeled in the right direction. <strong>vs. 6, "To knowledge self-control</strong>", Self-control is denying yourself things that bring destruction and distraction that you may maintain what you have received. When you have knowledge, it will show you which areas you need to employ self-control. Vs. 6 "…<strong>To self-control perseverance (patience</strong>)", tough one but vital. You may love a cheerful giver, the Lord loves a faithful enduerer. Vs. 6<strong>"…To perseverance (patience) godliness</strong>", endurance produces godliness in you for it reminds you and I that if God can be patient with sinners like us, how much more should we be with people and situations. Patience is a thorn in the flesh, but it is an ingredient in this recipe for growth. <strong>vs. 7 "To godliness brotherly kindness</strong>", kindness is the quality of being warm hearted and considerate, sympathetic and forgiving.<strong> Ephesians 4:32, "Be kind to one another, tender hearted forgiving each other even as Christ as forgiven you</strong>" (paraphrased). Vs. 7"…<strong>and to brotherly kindness love</strong>", without kindness, love will not blossom for kindness prepares the heart to love. Kindness is what opens the door to see far beyond someone's faults and love them anyway. It's the crown and the heartbeat of this recipe. Looking at this recipe, you can see how it's set up systematically and flows. All the ingredients work hand in hand. They fit in well.

Without a strong foundation where virtue, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, kindness are ingredients in your life, I believe your growth and mine will be hindered.

<strong>1Peter 1:8, "For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ". </strong>We have what it takes to be fruitful<strong> (grow) </strong>without adding what is not on it or taking away one or more of the ingredients. We shouldn’t get rid of what we think is hard, there is a reason it’s there. Who wants to be barren? and who does not want to grow and bear fruit? May we seek the Lord to show us areas in our lives that are stagnant and barren and may we get back to growing in the Lord. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Philippians 4:13, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"</strong>

This verse has been quoted by many people in reference to doing the impossible they wanted to accomplish. A few verses that lead to verse 13 paints a different picture, and leads us to understand it's proper application if we were to use it. <!--more-->Listen to Paul’s words <strong>vs. 11-13, "Not that I speak in regards to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need,</strong> <strong>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me".</strong> If you look at this scripture carefully you see a lot of learning and surviving that causes Paul to be victorious in the end. He looks at all he had been through and was still standing and he knows it has nothing to do with him but Christ, he confidently says,<strong> "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"</strong> His confidence was not in his ability, but God's.

I believe that the greater thing you can do through Christ who strengthens you is what you can survive. When you can be content with the little and trust God right where you are, be calm while others are freaking out; learn to be full and be hungry, learn to keep your coolness under frustrations, learning to share the little you have, learning to let go of things others struggle to hold on to. In short being able to deal, to stand, and be comfortable right where you are and not allow the challenges to destroy you because of Him who strengthens you. You and I can stand on this promise, <strong>I can do (go through) all things through Christ who strengthens me</strong>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Greater testimony comes from what you have survived, not what you have achieved.</strong></span> What you have survived has a lot to teach compared to what you have achieved. I am more grateful for the things I have survived for they were eye opening and they brought out the best in me cause I realized that if I can go through this and come out victoriously, I can go through something else because that same God who was with me when I went through it, is the same God who will be with me when I go through this. Patience, character, integrity among others are best learnt in trying times.

I know we quote this scripture many times based on what we want to do; I would like to quote it based on what we can withstand through Him. I can imagine Paul writing this line because of what he had survived and will survive.

How I pray that just like Paul we will learn how to deal with different situations and circumstances that we may confidently quote <strong>Phil 4:13</strong>. Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 34:1, " I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth 2 My soul shall make its boast in the LORD; ..."</strong>

There was a fellowship my parents would go to in the early 90's, by then I was not saved. This fellowship always sent a team to the missions field to preach the gospel. In happened that one day as the team was coming back from missions, they had an accident and some lives were lost. <!--more-->It was hard with the fact that they had just come from a weekend of victory. In this particular team, there was a gentleman called Simon, his fiancée and his brother. Simon lost both his brother and fiancée people found it hard to go to his hospital bed and break the news to him about the death of his fiancée and brother. But when they gathered courage to break the sad news expecting the news to crush him, he said something that up to day still speaks to my heart. He said, "<strong>We don't praise God for what He does for us (blessings), WE PRAISE HIM FOR WHO HE IS".</strong> Is this something or what? Let me repeat it,<strong>We don't praise God for what He does for us (blessings), WE PRAISE HIM FOR WHO HE IS".</strong> Our primary reason for praising God is for who He is.

I came across a song yesterday, the lyrics had the many blessings the Lord had done for the song writer then he concludes with this line, "that is the reason I praise Him", does this mean that if the blessings of the Lord were missing, there would be no praise?, David opens Psalm 34:1, with a declaration, "<strong>I will bless the Lord at ALL times, His Praise SHALL continually be in my mouth</strong>", if you know the story of David, David had one of the most hard times in life as a shepherd boy, as a king without a throne and as a king with a throne. You would expect David to only speak those words with all going well for him but that is not the case. When He spoke this Psalm, it was a time David pretended madness before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. Right in the midst of it all he made a declaration to bless the Lord at all times in every situation and persuaded himself to continually praise in his mouth.

It's easy to want to curse God than bless God in bad times. When we learn the main reason we praise God, we can pick ourselves up even in tough times and bless the Lord anyway for it's not about us but about Him. Everything happens to His glory whether we believe it or not. Of course no one wants to go through bad times (I would a void it if I can) but can I stand to bless Him anyway?

To strengthen his attitude, he says<strong>"My soul shall make its boast in the Lord…",</strong> this makes the devil so mad and confused because he is expecting us to be broken and miserable and perhaps curse God, instead, we brag in and on the Lord. Job was presented with the opportunity to curse God in his hard times but he would not<strong>Job 1:21, "And he said: “ Naked I came from my mother’s womb, And naked shall I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; Blessed be the name of the LORD.</strong>"

One thing I believe these men Simon, David, and Job would not speak these boldly by themselves, the moment they declared to speak those words of praise, is the same moment God gave them grace and strength to endure and brought them out of their situations<strong>. Psalm 34:19, says, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, But the LORD delivers him out of them all". </strong>

Lord help us to praise You for Who You are. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“Be still (rest) before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. (Psalm 37:7)</strong>

In this series, we have looked at trusting in the LORD, delighting in the LORD and committing to the Lord. Now David moves to resting in the Lord. Rest, does that sound like good news to you. Perhaps like me, by the time you are reading this devotion you are at work, but oh, how wonderful it would be to wake up late and rest at this time. David instructs us about rest in the Lord.<!--more-->

<strong>First, rest in the Lord</strong>. Rest began literally with God. Genesis 2:2 – 3 reads, “<strong>By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. 3 And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.”</strong> Now if the Creator rests, why can’t creation rest? Physical rest is crucial to our development. Isn’t it interesting that newborns sleep up to 16 hours a day. If physically rest is essential for our physical growth, then spiritual rest is needed for our spirit.

<strong>Secondly, wait patiently for Him [God]. Have you ever prayed for patience? God often allows situations to come into our lives that cause us to have the opportunity to respond with patience. Perhaps it’s on these days that you get stuck at numerous red lights while driving. We live in a world of instant gratification, where patience is not popular. Do you recall when Jesus was sleeping in the boat as the disciples were frantic over the storm? This has to be such a picture of patience. Christ knew his faith and power would calm the storm, which is why He was initially able to sleep during it</strong><strong>. </strong>

Patience is one of the fruit of the Spirit. God does things in His time, not ours, while perhaps many get impatient with God. The problem is that we are “rushed” and God is not, as He exists in the realm of eternity and we are bound at this time by time. Solomon said<strong>, “A man’s wisdom gives him patience…”</strong> Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and patience is better than pride. James wrote <strong>“Let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing</strong>.”

<strong>Thirdly, don’t fret</strong>. We do not fret when [wicked] men succeed in their ways. Remember their ways are not God’s ways. Just because someone may have worldly success doesn’t mean that one has godly approval and righteousness. The issue is not one of happiness, but one of righteousness. Wise living deals first with negative emotions—especially anger, fretting, and jealousy. If not dealt with these emotions may lead to sin against God, self, or other humans. God will take care of wickedness. Paul implores us to, “<strong>Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesu</strong>s.” Jesus said, “<strong>Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?”</strong>

Rest in Him, wait patiently for Him, and don’t fret because it’s really not worth it.

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><em>“</em></strong><strong>Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass. 6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday (Psalm 37:5)</strong>

The Scriptures refer to us as sheep, which are not the smartest animals. <strong>Isaiah 53:6</strong> says, “<strong>All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned everyone to his own way, and the Lord has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all</strong>.” Proverbs further reminds us that “<strong>There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end thereof is death.” <!--more--></strong>

We all have a way, a manner that we go about doing life. No matter what your way is, your way is no comparison to God’s Way! God is the author of life, and Jesus said, <strong>“I am the Way…,”</strong> because His way always leads to the Father. David implored that we do make two definite and uncompromising decisions.

<strong>First, “<em>Commit your Way to the Lord</em></strong>.” Why should one commit his or her own way to the Lord? God surely knows what is best for our lives. His plan is for us to commit our plans to His Divine authority. Solomon wrote, “<strong>Many are the plans of a man’s heart, but the Lord orders his steps</strong>.” Have you yet committed you way to the Lord? If you have not is there really any sensible reason why you choose your will over His? Jesus said, Not my will but thy will be done.” You may need a Garden of Gethsemane experience in prayer, where you too lay down your life.

<strong>Secondly, “…<em>Trust Him also</em></strong>.” Once you commit your way to Him then trust Him as you walk in that commitment. I think some people are afraid that God may call them to something that is new or requires a change. Remember when God called Abram to go to a place that God would show him (out there somewhere)? How many of us would be comfortable to hear God tell us to go somewhere, yet not be implicit as to our final destination? Would you have gone like Abram, if God called you to go toward a destination, trusting Him to work out the details along the way?

<strong><em>The result is that God “… he shall bring it to pass. 6 And he shall bring forth…</em></strong>” What is it that God will bring to pass? God desires that we commit our way to Him, resulting in His Way! our righteousness will be brought forth as the light. When Christ’s righteousness is in us, it will shine forth from our lives, emanating His righteousness to the world. He shall bring forth thy judgment as the noonday. The noonday is when the sun is its climax from sunup to sundown, and it is also the hottest at this point as well. God’s will is that our judgment would shine as the noonday. Overall no one likes the word judgment, but God loves this word, because it is part of His Word! May our judgment be lined up with God’s judgment, not being politically correct, but biblically correct? The liberal graduate school in NYC that I attended is a place where many hate to feel judged by God’s standards, but love to judge Christians as narrow minded Bigots. However, when our ways are committed to the Lord we will speak about His Judgment and be used of God to seek and save the lost like Jesus did. Jesus committed His Way to the Lord and trusted in His Father. Let’s follow in the footsteps of the Master, and our righteousness and judgment will shine forth like Christ’s. Psalm 103:6 says, “<strong>The LORD executes righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed</strong>.”

<strong>Commit you way to Him, trust Him, and let Him cause your righteousness and judgment to shine as the noonday as you seek and save the lost.</strong>

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><em><strong>Psalm 37:4, "</strong>Delight Yourself in the Lord and He shall give you the desires of your heart"</em>
</strong>

What are our desires? What do we most want in life? Do we desire above all things to have a better paying job, a bigger house, thicker carpet, an expensive car and more money? Are we controlled by the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes and the pride of life? Or have been transformed from the way of this world by the renewing of our mind that that we may prove what is that good, acceptable, and perfect will of God. <b>Romans 12:1-2,</b> Are our desires in line with God’s desires?<!--more-->

Desires are those things we will go after and are willing to pay the cost to obtain. Intentions are those things we would like to do or obtain if it is convenient to do so. David tells us about desires:

1. <strong>Delight Yourself in The Lord</strong>: Do you enjoy time with God? Do you like Mary, love just sitting with Him and being in his presence? We all delight ourselves in certain foods, movies, people, music, but do you delight in God above all?. David wrote in <strong>psalm 40:8,</strong> “I<strong> delight to do your will O my God: Yes Your Law within my heart. I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: Lo I have not reframed my lips O Lord you know</strong>.” Notice David didn’t say I have to do your will, but rather, “<strong>I delight to do your will</strong>.” This is a direct reference to the Messiah <b>(Hebrews 10:7) </b>Jesus delighted in the presence of His Father, and preached righteous because God’s law was in His mouth, and <strong>“He delighted to do His Fathers will</strong>.” Do you like Christ and David preach righteousness which is of the law (<b>Romans 10:5</b>) This will show the lost they need a savior (<b>Romans 3:19-20)</b>

<strong>2. Receive Your Desires: </strong>Are you controlled by the lust of the flush, lust of the eyes, and the pride of life? Or have you been transformed by the renewing of your mind (Rom12:2), that you could prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of God? Are your desires in line with God’s desires? Are your desires focuses only on you or are others included? Are we above all things “ <strong>Not willing that any should perish , but that all come to repentance “ (2 peter 3:9)? </strong>

Many may delight themselves in religious practices, but that in and of itself does not delight the heart of God. Delight should start with a heart like David and Jesus. If we delight ourselves in the Lord, the desires our heart will match His and those desires He will grant.

Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><em>“</em>Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land, and verily you shall be fed.”</strong>

We all want certain things in life. What are the things you dream most of obtaining in this life? Are your dreams material things or immaterial things? Do they fulfill a need or greed in your life? Are they only about yourself, or are your desires centered on providing for or helping others? Is your dreams family oriented and godly centered?<!--more-->

David tells us in Psalm 37:3 that one of the first steps to receiving your desires is to “<strong>Trust in the Lord and do good</strong>.” <strong>The Trust Factor</strong> is something everyone exhibits on a daily basis. There are surely those that are less trusting, but I don’t believe that there are any that are non – trusting. Are you sitting down as you read this devotion? If so then you are trusting in a chair to hold your weight up. Did you drink coffee, tea, orange juice or some other beverage this morning? If so then you trusted that those who made your beverage didn’t poison it. Thank God! To trust God is like sitting in a chair, believing that the chair manufacturer made the chair with a promise to hold you up as you sit it. The Promises of my Life’s Manufacturer, the Lord Himself, are 100% true. Now I have seen people sit on chairs and the chairs have broken in the process. However, I have never seen any one of my Heavenly Fathers Promises broken. Why, because He who promised is true. How is your trust level, do you trust God?

<strong>Secondly, David tells us</strong> “<strong>do good</strong>.” Doing good are doing those things that please the God you trust in. We shouldn’t just pray for a job, we need to also fill out applications. One shouldn’t only pray to know God’s will, but also read His Word where His Will is revealed. God doesn’t throw worms in the mouths (beaks) of birds, but as they are searching He makes sure they find them. Not everything you deem as good will God merit as good and His perspective is always true. What good are you doing at this time in your life?

<strong>Thirdly, “Be fed.”</strong> As you trust in the Lord and do good, God promises, “<strong><em>You shall be fed.” </em></strong>Fed what? God will meet your needs according to His great and precious promises. God will feed you with the substance of His Word as you do good to read it. Jesus said, “<strong><em>… man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.”</em></strong> He Promises to also fill us with His Holy Spirit as we stay away from being filled by ungodly things. <strong>Everything God makes God fills.</strong> He made the waters and filled is with marine life; He made the earth and filled it with plant life, animals and humanity. He fed Elijah by ravens, and He will feed you by His good Hand as well. Only go Him for your daily bread and everlasting water.

Trust Him today, do good as you are trusting, and be fed by the Hand of the Master. To be continued…

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Numbers 20:8, “Speak to the rock. Though God told Moses to take his rod with which He had performed many wonders in the past (Ex. 4:1–5; 7:19– 21; 14:16; 17:5, 6), he was only to speak to the rock for it to yield water. Numbers 20:10 you rebels. Instead of speaking to the rock, Moses spoke to the people, accusing them of being rebels against God"</strong>

<strong>By his actions, Moses joined the people in rebellion against God (see 27:14)."</strong>

In the book of Numbers chapter 20, MacArthur comments on Moses' actions in the following: Moses was therefore kept out of the Promised Land because of his rebellion<!--more-->. Perhaps you are thinking that is not fair, because after all Moses did, how could God do such a thing? God is holy and has high standards for those who He calls to lead in His name. Earlier in Moses life, God set out to kill Moses for failing to circumcise his son in <strong>Exodus 4:24–26, 24, “At a lodging place on the way the Lord met him and sought to put him to death. 25 Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’ feet with it and said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!” 26 So he let him alone. It was then that she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision”</strong>

The Hard Sayings of the Bible states, "The link between verses 24–26 and the material before and after it is important. It is not that God was seeking Moses’ life, as Pharaoh had. There are two key themes. First, there is the matter of the sons. Pharaoh’s “firstborn” (Ex 4:23) and Moses’ son (perhaps his firstborn) are involved in a crucial contest that involves God’s call to Israel, his “firstborn” (Ex 4:22). The contrasts are deliberate, and they manifest the grace of God and a call for response to the word of God.

The second issue is the preparation of God’s commissioned servant. God had prepared the nation of Israel, by virtue of their groaning, and He had prepared Moses in leadership skills; yet there was still a small but important matter of preparation of the family. Moses had failed to have his son circumcised, either as a concession to his wife’s scruples or because of his own relaxation of standards. As a result, he almost lost the opportunity to do what he had been prepared all his life to do—and he almost lost his life as well.

Obviously, Zipporah was moved to act quickly on her own. Without a word of instruction, she suddenly seized a flint knife (or stone) and circumcised her son. Usually this would be a ceremony performed by the head of the house. Zipporah’s action shows that she instinctively connected her husband’s malady with the failure to place their son under God’s covenant through circumcision (Gen 17:10–14). Moses may well have been too ill to act on his own; therefore Zipporah took the initiative."

God expects godly leaders to look after their own lives and families. Voddie Baucham states speaking about the two sides of his life. He states, "<em>There two sides to my life. One is personal, the other professional. On the one hand I am a preacher, a writer, an elder in the local church, and a professor. It is easy to get caught up in the professional side of my life. However there is another side of me, a far more important side. The most important side of my life is the one where I bear my most cherished titles - husband and father. There is nothing in the world that means more to me than the fact that I am Bridget's husband and Asher, Jasmine, Trey, and Elijah's father. Whenever I say that, I can almost hear people thinking, "Shouldn't your relationship with Christ mean more to you than your family life? I guess in an ultimate sense that is the case. However, my family is the primary place where my walk with Christ takes on flesh. It is my relationship with my wife and children that gives my walk with Christ legitimacy</em>."

Quoting Matthew 22:34-40, he states, if my wife doesn't qualify as my closet neighbor than who is? 1Timothy 3 lists Qualifications for Overseers vs. <strong>1 “The saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task. 2 Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self- controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 3 not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 4 He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive, 5 for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God’s church?”</strong>

Also Qualifications for Deacons, <strong>“8 Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain. 9 They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 10 And let them also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless. 11 Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things. 12 Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. 13 For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus</strong>”

To close, as leaders in the church let us start in the harder more important place, in our homes, and then let it flow out to the Church of God, this is the order Scripturally. Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong></strong><strong>Proverbs 27:5-6, "B</strong>etter is open rebuke them hidden love. Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses"

Have you ever been in a situation where someone you know has sinned and you felt you needed to confront them on it? Perhaps right now you are thinking not me, I’m no better than they are, I sin too, and I don’t want someone confronting me, that won’t help matters. <!--more-->The area of accountability, confrontation, confession, and church discipline is an area that is very weak in today’s church. Why, perhaps because we live in such a rebellious society nowadays. A rebellious son refusing to mend his ways in the OT was stoned to death. God wants holy people, and holy people cannot live like the world who feels that ultimately they will answer to no one. Remember at the Last Supper Jesus secretly confronted Judas with His statement about dipping bread, but Judas’ return was as an enemy (in the Garden of Gethsemane) that gave kisses, the kiss of selfishness and death.

Look at the following two accounts of confrontation in the Scriptures.

In <b>John 4 </b>we see how Jesus confronts a non-believer over their sin. <strong>John 4:16-18, “16 He told her, "Go, call your husband and come back." 17, "I have no husband," she replied. Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband. 18 The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true</strong>." Jesus used God’s law (the 7th commandment) in His confrontation to bring conviction.

Jesus confronted her sin, by asking her to call her husband. After her confession, Jesus pressed the issue of her sin further. Now before anyone can say that it’s God’s job to confront sin, what do we do with this passage <strong>from 2 Samuel 12:1-7? “The LORD sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, "There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor. The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him. "Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him." David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, "As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die! He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity." Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man</strong>!...”

Sinners and Saints are both confronted. God desires sinners to be confronted over their sin to be convicted and be converted to Christ, and for saints to be confronted and convicted over their sin because they are converted and represent God Himself who is sinless. Now pray for wisdom in both instances, but when the Lord directs you, obey quickly, if not that person may ruin their lives, or die in their sin. Remember “<strong>The wages of sin is death. </strong>The Scriptures give us a model of how to confront someone. “<strong>If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that `every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector </strong><b>(Matthew 18:15-17</b>). Our job is to confront, the Holy Spirit’s job is to convict.

Application: Is there someone that comes to mind to confront. Pray for wisdom, but obey the Lord, you may save their life. But do so in a spirit of humility seeking to win them over, not to hang manipulation over their head. Remember “<strong>Better is open rebuke than hidden love</strong>.” Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>"Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame", Song of Songs 8:6</strong>

The lover speaks passionately of her desire toward the one whom she is deeply committed to. The lover desires to be set as a seal which would have shown sole possession. An engraved stone or metal seal was a mark of ownership in the ancient world. Possession of another's seal indicated mutual access and possession. <!--more-->The lover desired to be as a seal on his arm for all to see, and on his heart as the most intimate place in his life. She desired to be distinctly his, for no one else. Exclusivity was her chief desire toward him, as is recited in wedding vows, “forsaking all others, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, in good times and hard times, till death separates”. She yearns for their mutual possession of each other to be as lasting as life itself.

How can love be as strong as death? Love is about living, togetherness, partnership, joy, friendship, while death is about dying, aloneness, loss of friendship, pain, grief, and sadness. There is a strong gut level heart pounding emotion when it comes to both love and death. I can remember crying tears of sadness at the death of loved ones, while tears of joy on the day my wife and I became one flesh in Holy matrimony. Even the physiology of our makeup shows the power of love and death. Tears of sadness have one substance which is present at the loss of love, while tears of joy during the passion of loving and being loved have another substance which is present even though they are both tears and are both wet.

Many have killed for love. I think of the classic play Romeo and Juliet where love was as strong as death. Romeo upon being convinced that his love Juliet was dead, killed himself for he could not bear to live without her. The most glorious display of love being as strong as death is displayed perfectly at the crucifixion, where God’s love was expressed in death. <strong>“But God commends His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” Ephesian 5:25, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her"</strong>. Christ’s love for His bride (the church) caused him to jump in front of a bullet for her. <strong>1 Cor 15:22, “For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.</strong>

<strong>Proverbs 6:34-35</strong> refers to the rage of a man because of jealousy rising up within him upon discovering the man who committed adultery with his wife, “…when he takes revenge. He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse the bribe, however great it is. The revenge he desires will most likely be the other man’s death. The emotion of his love toward his wife after this, though she be alive he feels the deep sting of death struck to his heart.

Even though it was “our decision” in the Garden to “cheat” on God with another, He hates the devil for his deception upon humanity because the devil corrupted our purity and left the stain of sin through “spiritual adultery.” Because God was jealous for our hearts to be pure again with the stain of sin removed He sent the only cleaning agent to do the job, Himself, His Son Jesus. <strong>Duet. 6:24</strong> read “<strong>For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. </strong>“…jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.” It would be better to die than to experience the failure of love that produces jealousy. Love's demands are all consuming. <strong>Songs of songs 8:7</strong> says “<strong>many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away</strong>.” External forces cannot quench or drown it. Its value is greater than all the possessions one might ever possess.

<strong>Application: Do you love your wife, your children, your friends, the body of Christ and your God that way? Make sure to keep the most important relationships alive and vibrant. For when death separates you from them only your love for them will remain. Pray for them and spend time with them. If they are unsaved share your heart with them of the truth that you desire to see them with you in glory (heaven). Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing",John 15:5</strong>

When looking in the Old Testament, God often portrayed and compared Israel to a vineyard. This can be seen in passages such as Isa. 5:7, and in Jer. 2 whereby God rebukes Israel, which Jesus uses indeed as a backdrop here in John 15. <!--more-->Christ is just about to go to the cross, and is giving some final instructions to His disciples. Therefore what did Christ emphasize to His eleven disciples, because recall there was one of them that was not present at this proclamation of Christ, hence Judas. Having this backdrop can now allow us to get to what Christ was actually getting at in this passage. The various persons represented in the illustration, the aspects of relationships, the whole reality of what fruit bearing is, and the timing of this passage is things which must be looked at in order to really unpack passage.

<strong>First</strong> let’s look at Who’s who. God is the vinedresser who is responsible to protect, water, prune the fruit bearing branches and remove the unfruitful branches. The vine represented Christ Himself who gives life to the branches that are connected to the vine. The branches are those disciples and the fruit was the result of that which would come from the branches connected to the life giving vine.

<strong>Secondly realize there were eleven fruit bearing disciples, and one non-fruit bearing disciple</strong>. When looking at the lives of the disciples and Apostles from Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, one can clearly see that those that followed Christ as His disciples produced fruit, the fruit of the Spirit which produced Christ likeness but ultimately to the fruit of other disciples. In his book The Secrets of the Vine by Bruce Wilkerson focused on the fruit. He shared that there were four baskets beneath the vine and that each basket had a certain amount of fruit in each. Basket one had no fruit (v. 2a,6) , basket two had some fruit (v. 2b,4), basket three held more fruit (v. 7) and finally the fourth basket contained much fruit (v. 26). The problem that the author gets wrong deals with the fruitless branch, believing that God lifts up the fruitless branch so that it becomes fruitful. However, that is not what the passage states; it states that the vinedresser does something very different. John MacArthur states, “The picture is of the vinedresser (i.e., the Father) getting rid of dead wood so that the living, fruit bearing branches may be sharply distinguished. This is a picture of apostate Christians who never genuinely believed and will be taken away in judgment (v. 6; Matt. 7:16; Eph. 2:10); the transforming life of Christ has never pulsated within them (8:31, 32; cf. Matt. 13:18–23; 24:12; Heb. 3:14–19; 6:4–8; 10:27–31; 1 John 2:19; 2 John 9).” The unfruitful branch Christ is speaking of is none other than Judas! There are many false converts (Judas’) that sit among the people of God, they may look like branches, but God is the fruit inspector and when He looks at them He sees them in truth, and unless they repent and put their faith in Christ, will cut them off and see that they are burned (end up in Hell)! Does this sound like God is a mean cruel and judgmental God to you? God is certainly judgmental (He is the perfect Just Judge of the universe) but He is certainly kind, so kind as to save His people from their sin Hence upon removing the dead branches, he also prunes His children, which are bearing fruit, so they might bear more fruit for His glory. The purpose for bearing fruit is that God is glorified, and true disciples will bear fruit because the power and life is in the vine and will flow through to the branches.

<strong>Thirdly, what does God use to both punish the unfruitful and prune the fruitful? </strong>He uses a Blade which is His Word (Heb 4:12; 2 Tim 3:16), the Handle of His Sword is the affliction and persecution He allows to come upon His children to make them more Christ like (Mark 4, Matt. 13; 2 Tim 3:12), and he uses His Church to spur one another (Heb 10:24-25, Prov. 27:17; Gal 2:11). He uses His pure unadulterated Word to condemn, punish and cut off the ungodly (Exo. 20; Rom 7, Gal 3:24, John 3:10-21). Yes this is a picture of judgment. In contrasting Peter verse Judas both that were chosen by Christ, one can see that Peter denied Christ, and Judas betrayed Him. Christ pruned Peter (Luke 22:31-34; John 21:15-17) and condemned Judas (Mark 14:17-21).

The branches give nothing to the vine, but by it’s fruit it glorifies the vine. What must a branch do to produce fruit, it must ABIDE! The relationship in Christ must be cultivated; it must stay dependent upon Christ, and must stand in total reliance upon Christ for apart for Christ His children can do nothing.

<strong>Application (based on 2 Tim 3:16): If you are connected to Christ, how has your abiding been lately? </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Teaching. What did I learn?</li>
	<li>Reproof. Where do I fall short? Why do I fall short?</li>
	<li>Correction. What will I do about it?</li>
	<li>Training in righteousness. How can I make this principle a consistent part of my life? Blessings Pastor Phil</li>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Philippians 2:9-11, "9Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father"</strong>

It's been known that the name Mohammed (also spelled in different ways) is the most given name than any other name in the world and not John though popular. I also think that the name Jesus is the most HATED name in America if not in the world. Think about it, which name is frequently used as a cuss word or used to express disgust?, Jesus Christ.<!--more-->Which name would people most likely eliminate from anything? Once again it’s Jesus. Campus Crusade for Christ recently changed their name to eliminate crusade and Christ because they are offensive. There are many who are offended by this name; then there are those people who accommodate it; then there are people who pretend to love this name; and then there are us, Christians who love the name Jesus. We don't love the name because it sounds good, we love it because of who He is and the power in His name. It's more than just a name as we will see in the scriptures.

A while back I came across "American Idol give back". On this episode, they were raising money to support poor children in Africa and other parts of the world. The contestants stood to sing a well-known song "<strong>Shout to the Lord</strong>" and I was like, wow, they are going to sing about Jesus on national TV with over 30million people watching. To my surprise the song which begins with "<strong>My JESUS, My SAVIOR, LORD there is NONE like You</strong>", this line was ELIMINATED COMPLETELY and they began from "<strong>my shepherd, my comfort</strong>". The name "Jesus" is in the song, the song is about Him and for Him. He is the whole reason for the song yet they left His name out it. How many of the events have pastors been told to pray in the name of God (not sure which one) but not in the name of Jesus our God?

Oh I love His name, it sounds sweet on my lips, <strong>Proverbs 18:10, "the name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and they are safe", 2Samuel 22:4, "I will call upon the (name of the) LORD, who is worthy to be praised; So shall I be saved from my enemies”. Acts 4:12, "Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” </strong>I remember about 10 years ago, on a snowy night, coming from school and down the hill my car lost control got off the road and headed towards the trees by the road side. The name I could think of was none other than the name of Jesus who could save me. I shouted out His highly exalted name, the name above every name, the name JESUS. The car missed two trees head on and landed in between them with no scratch or injuries. Calling on that name saved me that day. And how many times have I called on that name and I believe you too have done the same. I hate to take that name casually or use it loosely, I pray in that name. People get saved through that name. We get healed through that name. Demons tremble at the mention of that name. If you are used to using “OMG” in excitement, in shock or whatever the case, I urge you to quit it. His name is not to be used lightly, “<b>The name of the Lord shall not be used in vain</b>”. If you are around people who misuse His name and you say nothing, I would be curious to know if you would be quiet if someone was using your wife’s or husband or child’s name as a punch line for a joke or as a cuss word. There is something about that name.

God the Father gave His faithful Son who was obedient even unto the death of the cross by first exalting Him which means He highly elevated His rank and then gave Him "THE" not "A" name above EVERY name, vs.<strong>10 “that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father".</strong> God the Father did not take the name of His Son Jesus lightly neither can I. God the Father has promised His Son that every knee will bow to Him, either in repentance and faith or on judgment day. One way or another, every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. "<strong>No other name but the name of Jesus, No other name but the name of the Lord, He is worthy of GLORY and worthy of HONOR and worthy of POWER and of PRAISE". </strong>Oh that people fear the name of the Lord, cherish and Revere his name. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Philippians 2:12-13, “12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image19.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-6257 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image19.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>In reading a few writings by Paul, I find it fascinating how he encourages believers to do something and then he says that it’s God who works in you to do it, then tells you again to do it. <b>Galatians 2:20</b> is a great example, another one is <b>Philippians 4:11-13.</b>And the reason is simple, he mentions himself as the one who lives but then he shows us the One by the reason he lives. In other words, Paul always wanted to bring to light whose he was so that all glory and honor may be of Christ alone. He says in <strong>1Corinthians 4:7, “we have this treasure oin the earthen vessels that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us”,</strong> the fact that we have the treasure in us is the reason we can stand, it’s the driving factor.<!--more--></p>
We now come to the verse above when he says, <strong>vs. "12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, …</strong>”. Even though it’s the Lord who keeps us from falling and present us faultless in His presence with exceeding joy (<b>Jude 1:24), </b>this does not mean that we have no part to play. Paul says the Philippians obeyed and should continue even in Paul’s absence, Paul knowing that only through Christ they could obey.

But then he adds this element which is mind boggling, “<strong>work out your own salvation with fear and trembling</strong>”. Of course this does not mean to work to be saved which is justification but rather be open to God’s work in us for sanctification, day by day being made Christ like. This is not human achievable, it’s only through the power of the Holy Ghost can a man live a sanctified life, daily going deeper and deeper in the things of God. This is about employing ourselves to the things which accompany salvation, bearing fruit, more fruit, and much fruit because you are abiding in the true vine, (<b>John 15</b>). Jesus told the woman at the well in <b>John 4 </b>that those who worship God must worship Him in spirit and in truth. The spirit here is not the Holy Spirit but rather, the human spirit, the desire, the passion, the zeal but the outcome of truth is of God. All our working depends upon His working in us. While Christ is our Savior, and the author of our salvation, we must accept Him and work together with Him.

<strong>Vs. “13 for it is God who works in you both to will ….”</strong> works in the converted person by His word and Spirit. His Spirit is a helper. He does not destroy our free will, for we may resist it (<b>1Thessalonians 5:19</b>). The will (desire) and the how to is His doing. God shows His will by His Word and Spirit and work in us. We ought to heed it. We can work in harmony with the divine will, or we may reject to our damnation. “...<strong>and to do for <em>His</em> good pleasure</strong>”, which means as seem best to Him, <strong>“looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith…”, Hebrews 12:2</strong>

For, “ <strong>being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;..”</strong> <strong>Philippians 1:6</strong>, …<strong>Ephesians 2:10, “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them”, …2Timothy 2:20-21,”20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor. 21 Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work” …2Timothy 3:16-17, “16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work”</strong>

We are unable to bear good works on our own strength, that is why God is at work in us. In your prayer time, what is your biggest cry? For God’s blessings or for Him to work in you…, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 32:24-26, "25 Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him. 26 And He said, “Let Me go, for the day breaks.” But he said, “I will not let You go unless You bless me!”</strong>

There is a constant wrestle that takes place in our lives. I realize that the wrestling does not happen much with everyone around but when you are left alone in your quiet time. Many have sleepless nights due to wrestling with ideas, thoughts, opinions, decisions to make, or moves to make; weighing different options and trying to evaluate whether it is the right thing to do or not.

<!--more-->The thing about wrestling, only one can win. Wrestling is basically a struggle where strength, moves and strategies are applied with an aim to win. Wrestling to know if something is of God or just your flesh. Are you wrestling with something even right now? In all I am facing, I would rather wrestle in prayers. One man had an encounter with God when he was left alone. Alone in his own world, in thoughts. God spoke to him to move back to his home having been mistreated by Laban. If you remember the story correctly, the reason Jacob was at Laban's was to flee from his brother Esau whom he had cheated off of his inheritance. He had been at peace at Laban’s so far, married his two daughters, had children, and possessions. Going back was tough because he had to deal with his past; Esau, someone he ran from a long time ago and situations he ran away from he was going to face. He would have not liked to confront but he had to.

God was going to raise him to new heights and so He brings him to confront what he ran away from so as to deal with it, push through and concur. At times, you will need to be left alone to wrestle through. You might have had people surround you wrestle for you and fight your battles and that is okay but if God is going to make you something bigger, He will bring you to a place alone with a lot of confrontations. Times of fear should be times of prayer: whatever causes fear should drive us to our knees to pray to our God. <strong>"And a Man wrestled with him until the breaking of day". </strong>God wrestled with Jacob that day, how often do you wrestle with God? He says something according to His word and you ask how it can be. He tries to show you, but you bring in what has happened and what could have happened and the wrestling continues. All night you are wrestling yet you are not prevailing. Here is what got me, vs. <strong>25, "Now when He (God) saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hips". </strong>Does this mean God failed to pin Jacob? <strong>I believe, "<i>the divine adversary was also the electing saving Lord who strengthened Jacob with grace to wrestle on against Himself lest he be overcome and condemned. </i></strong><i>However tried or discouraged, we shall prevail; and prevailing with Him in prayer, we shall prevail against all enemies that strive with u</i>s", Matthew Henry). It's like God saying, "<i>we both wrestled each other but none of us prevailed because My strength is in you",</i> <strong>vs. 26, "And He said, "Let Me go, for the day breaks" But he said, "I will not let You go unless You bless me!". </strong>

Someone who has wrestled all night wakes up tired and exhausted and we see with Jacob who wrestles and now does not want to let go because his life depends on who he's been wrestling with. He wants to be on the same page with Him and he says, <strong>"I will not let you go unless you bless me</strong>". I have wrestled in my thoughts, decisions and ideas I should have wrestled in prayers. I will not let Him go unless He has blessed me, showed me His way, strengthened me, provided for me, taught me how to go about it. <strong>1Peter 5:7, "Casting all your cares upon Him; for He cares for you". </strong>Jacob knew God cared for him otherwise he would have died that day. Anyone who encountered with God like he did in the OT would not live unless God let him. He was spared and because of that, he did cast his care for a blessing from God who cared for him. Where are you today? Are you wrestling in prayers? There are blessings stored for wrestlers. Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 1:45-51, "</strong><strong>45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” 46 And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"</strong>

I am constantly battling to see good things come out of me and my surrounding. The bible already says, “<strong>There is nothing good in us (that is in ourselves)…",</strong> you may find yourself in this dilemma too sometimes. When you have waited for so long, labored hard, did all you could but still wonder if anything good can come out of you? <!--more-->You might have a habit you have been trying to get rid of for years, it has left you crippled in some way and you are constantly thinking, "Can any good thing come out of me even in this situation?" At times you want to rip off what is standing on the way of your victory because you can feel it, sense it, see it but you can't seem to find a way to get it.

I have not studied the history of Nazareth but by listening to what Nathanael had to say, there was something about it that couldn't allow him to see anything good coming out of it. Maybe the sins in that city were great and if we look at the records, we see Jesus having a hard time in Nazareth where He grew up. Many were offended and wanted to cast Him out, the bible says that twice He was expelled from the city, there was unbelief among other things wrong with this city. From the book of Genesis to the book of Malachi, there were prophesies of birth of Jesus mentioned and how He would become the King, Messiah, Emanuel, Lord, born of a virgin in Bethlehem. If a baby like that would be born today, they would find the best city, hospital, in other words, the best place to have him. It will be all over news. Jesus wasn't like that, yet, He had all the titles born in a very simple life. So when Phillip approached Nathanael to give him the good news of having met Christ, the one they had all been waiting for, it did not make sense to him. To make it worse, <strong>Phillip referred to Him as Jesus of Nazareth</strong>. Who wants to be identified with a mess, broken things, broken city? Don’t we all want good things to come out of good places? We can put our focus on that good place and fail to understand that God’s ways are not our ways. <strong>1Corinthians 1:27, "God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are might</strong>". While we tend to program ourselves as to how God will move and if He does not move as expected and anticipated, we get frustrated, God is God and He will do what is best for Him through His children. <strong>Don't focus on how He moves, focus on this thought, HE MOVES</strong>.

<strong>John 1:46, "... Can anything good come out of Nazareth?". </strong>Can anything good come out of your position at work; in your marriage you think is not amounting to anything; a child that is just out of place, giving you a hard time, or been sick for years or trying to stop a habit and nothing is happening? You may be like Nathanael who could not see beyond the sins and failures in Nazareth,. <strong>People who cannot see beyond their weakness and failures are always left wondering whether there is anything good left reserved for such people in spite of who they are</strong>. We praise God for the great things He is doing even in the midst of all the things we do not see Him use to bring that which is good. Christ began a good work in us and He will be faithful to complete it even when we cannot see boldness, courage, strength, joy, peace, healing, victories etc. in the radar. It's not a matter of how we feel and what we think we know, it's a matter of who comes out of the city that matters.

Christ came out of Nazareth in spite of Nathanael’s thought. Jesus revealed Himself at that point,<strong> John 1:49, "Then Nathanael declared, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel. vs. 50, " Jesus said, .... You shall see greater things than that"</strong>. Praise God because we will see Him do things, and greater things than this shall we see. Jesus makes disappointments into appointments, junks into assets, mess into order, and doubt into faith. Next time you see something or someone or in yourself that nothing good could come out of you, may you be reminded that it can because of Him, Christ in you, the hope of glory. Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Thessalonians 5:17&amp;18, "Pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you"</strong>

A tool given by God to us and most needed and mostly neglected is prayers. We like the disciples would love the Mount of Transfiguration experience and even stay awake there but fall asleep in the Garden of Gethsemane. We would get bored easily. David Wilkerson said, “<em>we love the supper room more than we love the upper room</em>”. <!--more-->The enemy does not mind us doing anything else as long as we are not praying.

<strong>Acts 12:1-3, "Now about that time Herod the king stretched his hand to harass some from the church. Then killed James the brother of John with the sword. And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also".</strong> Before Jesus Ascended into heaven, He told His disciples of what was to come ahead<strong>, John 16:33, "These things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace, in the world you will have tribulations, but be of good cheer I have overcome the world</strong>". It was a preparation accompanied with a promise. We then we see the disciples experiencing the same things Jesus had prepared them for. Jesus reminded His disciples of what was to come in His absence at the same time He also gave them assurance of how He would be there to stand with them. Soon after His departure, tribulation started, Stephen was stoned to death, James is killed and Peter was next.

Here is my question, why is it easy to wait for something to happen before we do something about it? we wait until we are in a jam before we act. Now that might not have been the case with Peter since we don’t have all the details, all we know is that when Peter was arrested, the home church went to work, <strong>Acts 12:5, "Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for Him by the church". In another version says "but prayer was made without ceasing".</strong> This is what we call intercession, someone standing in the gap on behalf of someone else. Prayer warriors are like the attorneys in the courts of law fighting for those who cannot fight for themselves. They understand the law well (God's word) and the promises in His word. We don’t know if the church stood in the gap on behalf of James like they did with Peter. Perhaps they did and it was God’s will to take James. In spite of what happened to James, that did not stop the believers from crying out to God for Peter. What happened to James did not discourage their faith in God, if anything, it intensified their prayers.

Peter had several attorneys standing in the gap, pleading with God to spare his life and so they prayed without ceasing, continuously, fervently, purposefully, earnestly, and diligently. Praying without ceasing is not praying without stopping but praying without giving up that is the difference. I could pray for something today for half an hour and stop but that does not mean I have given up, I will pray again tomorrow for it and the days to come. That is praying without ceasing<strong>. 1Thes 5:17&amp;18, "Pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you". </strong>We understand what it means “<strong>praying without ceasing”,</strong> but do we explain, "<strong>in everything give thanks for this is the will of God</strong>"? does that mean for my problems I should give thanks and also in my afflictions and frustrations? should I give thanks for this is His will?. No, the will of God is to praise and give Him thanks even in the midst of the situation, giving Him thanks IN IT and not FOR IT. Giving thanks is a sign of "I have faith that you will bring me out of it", I don't see it now but I know you will. Giving thanks is appreciating what He is doing even at that given moment. Giving thanks is choosing to believe His report over what you heard, know or what you are in. Giving thanks is knowing that He already had an escape plan for you even before you got into it. I believe that the church that was praying for Peter was giving thanks in advance, pouring their hearts to God.

We all need someone to confide in when it comes to praying for there are times when will be overwhelmed that you will need someone to cover you in prayers. I'm talking about prayer partners, Peter being weary, tired and in pain bound between two guards may have found it tough to pray but thank God for the church, the saints who prayed for him. The prayer of the saints kept him comfortable in prison, he slept through it. The end of the story, God intervened and Peter was released from prison by an angel. You can be comfortable in a storm because someone is standing in the gap pleading your case. Like Peter, do you have those interceding with and for you without ceasing? Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Leviticus 25:55, "For the children of Israel are servants to Me; they are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God"</strong>

Difficult people to lead are those who come to a place with their own agenda. We come for us, we come to receive and if we don't get it as expected, frustrations may rise. Some have been so much affected that they left because they were not satisfied by what they received. <!--more-->Do we ever stop and say, "What is required of me as a form of service?" in other words, I have always come to receive, but now it is time to give. No one teaches what service and giving is all about like Jesus, <strong>John 13:4</strong>, <strong>"(Jesus)</strong> <strong>rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded"</strong>. The King of kings laid aside His Kingship garments (robe) and guarded Himself with a towel to serve those who called Him their Teacher and Master. It's easy to wash someone's hair, they do it many times and mostly at a fee, but washing someone's feet? I mean going down on your knees to wash dusty, unattractive smelly feet? You have to be humbled to do that. A number would do it for money, Jesus was doing it out of love. I’ve seen programs like "fear factor" on TV of how low people would go for money. They risk their lives, doing weird things just to get money.

We love titles like son, daughter, royal priesthood, because it makes us feel important but to be called a servant sounds like an insult. Degrading position in human eyes yet we are called servants by God. Look at how God calls these men <strong>Genesis 26:24, "...I will bless you and multiply your descendants for My servant Abraham's sake.", Numbers 12:7, "Not so with My servant Moses; He is faithful in all My house". Numbers 14:24, "But My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me fully", 2 Samuel 7:5, "Go and tell My servant David</strong>". What is so common about these men, they were great leaders yet they humbled themselves as servants and they served faithfully. God does not call them great, big, mighty names, He calls them MY SERVANTS. They served people primarily for the Lord. What did Jesus say to the disciples who were disputing as to who is the greatest in the kingdom, <strong>Mark 9:35, "And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, "If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.</strong>" It's not about titles, it's about service. It's about seeing what God has equipped you with and rolling your sleeves to do it faithfully without complaining. Many pastor’s today want to lead like CEO’s rather than lead as a shepherd; a servant God has called them to be. And many want to be in the receiving end without serving.

God says in <strong>Leviticus 25:55, "For the children of Israel are servants to Me...",</strong> called to fulfill tasks granted by God. Called to work and fight under the guidance and supervision of the Lord. When they were told about a land flowing with milk and honey, maybe they thought they would just walk in and take it not knowing that there was work involved, (stooping down as a servants and working hard to get to that destination). See the flesh does not like the idea of stooping low and serving. This is the reason why I never pray, "LET ME BE A SERVANT", I pray "MAKE ME (mold me) A SERVANT”. What will the rest of the people think about us if we call ourselves servants? We shouldn’t care about titles and positions, I would rather have the titles and positions define the office we are serving in and not what we are. All we should care about is serving in any capacity because He has made us servants. On that day I will not be introduced as thy good and faithful preacher, intercessor etc, I will be introduced as <strong>Matthew 25:2</strong> puts it<strong>, "…, "Well done, good and faithful servant</strong>". Are you a servant at your job, in church, in your community? I'm not talking about titles, titles come and go, I am talking about service for His glory. Let’s continue to make this our prayer, “Lord MAKE ME a servant humble and meek”. Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 5:10-11 “10…And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.” 11 So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him</strong>”

Peter was one of the most ordinary people in the bible any of us can identify with. He wasn't the sharpest pencil in the box yet he was one of the closest disciples to Jesus. His calling was remarkable having been taken from his fully understood occupation of fishing fish to a new occupation of fishing men.<!--more--> <strong>Acts 4:13</strong> describe him and John as uneducated and untrained men. You have to understand that Peter was a professional fisherman; this is what he knew to do but even his professionalism was limited to things beyond his control.

We see in this passage how Peter and 3 others had toiled all night fishing catching nothing, and were now somewhere washing their nets. Jesus then requests to use Peter’s boat to teach the crowd and then turns to him and says, in vs. <strong>4, “Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.” 5 But Simon answered and said to Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net</strong>.” They took Jesus at His word and had a great catch, bigger than what they could imagine or think. Did that make Peter to go home happy? No, it made him to drop on his knees and repent of his sins.

The Lord takes a disadvantage and turns it into an advantage. Only God could do this spectacular thing. Jesus then says to him,<strong> vs. 10, “Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.” 11 So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him”. </strong>I can see that the miracle was not for advancing his business but for greater calling.

Jesus could have called fish into the boat, or make them float. We see that Jesus used Peter’s skills to net out what He Himself had already provided. He then tells him that he will be fishers of men using the same concept of fishing to lead people to Himself. Jesus allows you to catch fish He has already provided, take the Lord at His word. Expect to catch fish where you least expect it. The Lord was going to use his fishing skills for a different purpose. How do we sometimes lose what we have when we get saved instead of turning it and letting the Lord use it. God can use your personality, sales skills, creative ideas, singing, poetry, writing, etc. to accomplish His will in reaching the lost. God will have us to be diligent, purely in duty to His command and dependent upon His goodness, rather than with an assurance of worldly success.

In the day of Pentecost, Peter lowered the net of the gospel and caught 3,000 people the Lord had provided. In <b>(Acts 4)</b> he lowered the nets of the gospel again and caught about 5,000. What does this tell us?, God can use anything in our hands for His glory if we let Him. God does not call the qualified, He qualifies those whom He has called. We now have to take the gifts He has given us, the gifts we used to serve the devil and turn them around and use them to serve His purposes. Do you have a net you have not let down for a catch? This is the time. Do something, do something, do something. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 5:27-29, “27 After these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, “Follow Me.” 28 So he left all, rose up, and followed Him.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> 29 Then Levi gave Him a great feast in his own house. And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them"</span></strong>

If each one of us sat down and evaluated our lives, we would be humbled by the fact that there was nothing attractive about us that would have caused Christ to draw Himself to us. With that said, I look at Levi considered by most scholars as Matthew the tax collector. <!--more-->Tax collectors were widely despised, not only because they served the oppressors of the Jews the Romans, but also because they made a profit by adding their own charges to the established levies. They were classified as unclean publicans and sinners, thieves and traitors.

While Levi (Matthew) was in his office working, Jesus came to meet him, a picture of Christ reaching sinners, calling them to Himself. <strong>vs. “28 So he left all, rose up, and followed Him</strong>”, a new life, set free from the bondage of sin. What he did next is what majority who get saved neglect to do. He did not receive the gift and move on, he turned into an evangelist using something that once condemned him, his office as an opportunity to introduce his once upon a time friends and workmates to Jesus. He used what was within his reach, a rod in his hands just like Moses to free others.

<strong>Vs. 29 “Then Levi gave Him a great feast in his own house. And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them”. </strong>A great feast for the Master was also used as opportunity to invite others. Levi met a Jew who was willing to call him as an outcast and spend time with him. With no words of his own to share, he did something within his reach and capability that brought about the Savior to meet with his friends who were also outcasts.

We don’t know how many of Matthew’s friends became followers of Jesus as a result of his efforts. Maybe some did and maybe none did. But that’s not really the issue, what’s important is that something happened to Matthew that drove him to act. <strong>He became an evangelist in a way that was appropriate to his personality and the situation</strong>, He did what he must have known how to do best and that was throw a party with Jesus as the center of the gathering, then pointed everyone to the Savior who had the perfect saving story, His story.

There was nothing special about Matthew. He was a lot like us, an average ordinary 9-5 working guy. All he had was a life transforming experience with Christ, a heart for his lost friends and the guts to try to reach them. And that allowed God to use him in an extraordinary way just as God will use ordinary people like us if we’ll let him. What do you know how to do best that you can use to bring others to Christ? If you are like Matthew who couldn’t speak, create an atmosphere where you can have people come in and have someone point them to Christ. Whatever it takes, Do something, do something, do something.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 4:1-2, "1 Then Moses answered and said, “But suppose they will not believe me or listen to my voice; suppose they say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’” 2 So the LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A rod.”</strong>

If there was a person who had enough to work with even when it did not seem like anything it was Moses. I think many times we have enough excuses for not doing what God requires us to do. We hope for bigger things before we can start accomplishing God’s work while neglecting to utilize what God has granted us because it appears small in our eyes. We forget that God has given us enough to get us started. The Lord will always refer to what he has placed in our hands.<!--more-->

In response to God’s call to deliver the Israelites from the land of Egypt, Moses concludes that no one will listen, believe him or take him seriously. Then we see God not giving him an army or even latest weapons, only a rod of a shepherd in his hands he used to take care of Jethro’s flocks in the desert. A once upon a time ordinary rod used to lead sheep, God was going to use is it while in Moses hands to demonstrate His power and free the Israelites. It was now referred to as the rod of God, <b>Exodus 4:2.</b>

You and I can dismiss doing God’s work because the rod we have in our hands appear insignificant but God wants to use what’s in your hand. What you have access to, what is at your fingertips. When was the last time you prayed, “Lord you have blessed me beyond measure, what do you require of me as a service to you with the rod in my hands?” One of my prayers for young people is that they waste not their youth doing nothing for the Lord.

When I got saved, I immediately knew there was a rod in my hands, God’s word. I Did not know how well to use it to reach others but used I it anyway. God was faithful, His word does not return void. A while back I spoke to my childhood best friend who I had not been in contact with for 14 years, couldn’t find him anywhere. I remember witnessing to him while I was a baby Christian the best I knew how and God later saved him. He is now serving in ministry, working with the youths and evangelizing. I thank God I did not wait for bigger things before I could start doing God’s work, reaching others. You start with little, the Lord gives increase.

It was the prince of preachers Charles Spurgeon who said, <strong>“brethren, do something, do something, do something</strong>”. He knew God had placed in the brethren’s hands a rod to free the lost from Egypt. We are used mightily in our weak state, when we yield to Him for His glory. Anyone who is saved has a rod in his or her hand to do something with it. Yes we battle fear but as someone used the word “FEAR” as an acronym, <strong>F</strong>alse <strong>E</strong>vidence <strong>A</strong>ppearing <strong>R</strong>eal, we got to love God more to overcome fear. <strong>1John 4:18, “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, ..”</strong>. will you let fear paralyze you not to do something?, read this, "<strong>Have you no wish for others to be saved? Then you're not saved yourself, be sure of that!"</strong> Charles Spurgeon.

A rod in your hand is God’s rod to be used for His glory. Be creative, write a gospel message, email to family and friends, record a gospel presentation, post it on your face book, website; order gospel tracts, leave them in bathrooms, kitchens, give them to cashiers as gifts, send them out with your bills to be paid, leave them in shopping carts, public seats.

God used the rod in Moses hands, will you let Him use yours? I did a gospel video presentation that was used this summer on a missions trip in Africa at a free medical clinic, I thought a video could reach more people than I could physically, over 3000 people watched it and was well received. I did one as a tribute to my late cousin which was watched by over 800 people on face book. I knew video was a rod in my hands God could use. We’ve ministered to more people in the world by email devotions, this was another rod in my hands. We take the gospel on the streets, that’s another rod. None of these have a wow factor behind them but God is faithful to use what we give to Him.

You are welcome to check out the video on my face book page and you are welcome to share it with your friends and loved ones. This could be a rod in your hands among others to reach them. Once again, do something, do something, do something. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Corinthians 4:1, "Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart (We faint not)"</strong>

There are times in life where you have more questions than answers. The more you live it the more you discover your purpose so as to live it fully. Many stop living either through terminating their lives before time or they are just there with no purpose in life. <strong>This is living a defeated life</strong>.<!--more--> Why live miserable life when we see so many avenues to live? I see so many opportunities God has given each of us to live this life to the fullest. <strong>It’s a God given life, why waste it?</strong> As long as the doors are opened, we ought to walk through them. If the doors are shut as you try to walk through them, praise God and move on to the next opened door, what is not of Him and His plan for your life He will shut. <strong>It is interesting to see some Christians waste their lives waiting for God to say something He already revealed to them</strong>. They sit frustrated and defeated because they missed seeing the opportunities God had displayed.

You can stop trying because someone said you are not good enough. If anything to say “not good enough” ought to be a compliment, we will never be good enough. It is God who works in you to become. Read what Paul writes, <strong>Philippians 3:13, "Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead</strong>", Paul did not consider himself as someone who had arrived, he therefore wouldn’t stop living despite the many challenges he faced in his life as a servant of the Lord. As long as God gave him breath, he would live to serve Him till the end. He was taking another opportunity to forget those things behind and press on wards. <strong>Whether other people forget your failures or not should not be an issue, you are the one who has to forget those things, put them behind and move forward</strong>. I have to keep fighting my way through oppositions, persecutions, frustrations and defeats for <strong>my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus</strong>. God does not evaluate our worth and victory based on people's opinions and ours, He bases it on what He has done.

We all long to have a meaningful life worth fighting for. God our creator has given us such a purpose. If we graced even 10% of the significance of His purpose, it will give our lives a deeper meaning, high motivation and sense of worth, in other words a reason to live. <strong>2Corinthians 4:1, "Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart (We faint not)”,</strong> I have my family, ministry etc., what God has provided through His grace and mercy. I earned none of it yet He has bestowed them in my life. I have no reason to loose heart or faint, God has provided that which gives me a purpose for living. Yes there are days I am down and times I feel like throwing in the towel and calling it quits yet I pick myself up and keep on moving. Paul had those days but listen to what he says<strong>, 2Corinthians 4:8, "We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 9, persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed-- 10, always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. 11, For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh</strong>". What away to say no retreat, no surrender. Things will stand in the way but none can terminate what God is not done with. Jesus lived His life to fullest here on earth; His ultimate goal was to die on the cross. All the beating could not kill him because He had a destiny. <strong>This is a will to live till the end</strong>. That was Paul's desire and that is my desire to allow the life of Christ be manifested in my mortal body, the life that did not retreat or surrender till the end and this goes with prayer too. <strong>“There is no weapon formed against prayer that can neutralize it. Some things can delay answers to prayer, but nothing can stop the full purpose of God. "Though it tarry, wait for it.", Leonard Ravenhill</strong>. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 9:37-38, “Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.” </strong>

It was truly an embarrassing moment when I drove down a one-way street the wrong way. Somehow I failed to see the sign, and therefore the oncoming traffic served as a clear and visible sign that I was heading in the wrong direction, and that I needed to flow with the traffic not against it. <!--more-->Perhaps you’ve not had an experience like this in the natural, but it seems that some believers manifest going the wrong way when it comes to “driving” their prayers up a one-way street against the flow of God’s will. Many are praying for revival, instead of praying in line with God’s will.

In this passage Jesus is looking out among the multitude of people, and compassion begins to well up within Him for they harassed, helpless, confused, aimless, like sheep without a Shepherd. Furthermore they were bullied, oppressed; and in the face of such problems, they are "helpless," unable to rescue themselves or escape their tormentors. This scene that Jesus looked at broke His heart, as He was burdened for these people. The crux of the problem wasn’t the condition of the shepherd-less sheep, but the scarcity of laborers. Even sheep that have a shepherd have problems, but they have a shepherd present to help them deal with their problems. Christians have the Shepherd in their lives, but the unsaved are like sheep without a Shepherd to save their soul on Judgment Day from Hell.

Jesus’ focus was on the harvest as His metaphor then changed from sheep farming to harvest (v. 37), as Jesus sought to awaken similar compassion in His disciples. He wanted their eyes to see what he saw, for their hearts to feel what he felt, and for their minds to come to the conclusion that His mind came to. Jesus called for a prayer rally on this issue. He wanted harmony on this prayer point (Mt. 18:20), hence all praying for this. This prayer issue needs the resolve of the persistent widow (Luke 8), showing us that we should pray and never give up, especially praying for what Christ told us to pray for. The judge in that story was reluctant to answer the widows persistent request, <strong>but God doesn’t deal with us in this manner, but delights to hear His bride, His chosen ones, His body, His church cry day and night unto Him</strong> (Luke 18:7). People are God’s love language. How does the church get a heart for the lost, and God’s will (heart) for laborers?

Who do you know that isn’t saved, family member, friend, co-worker, etc…. Now imagine them in the Lake of Fire for all eternity. To think of their fate should cause your heart to feel what Jesus felt looking at those people. He knew that He was the Divine Shepherd they needed and without Him they would perish on the Day of Judgment. Laborers would need to go to them for the crop will be plentiful; many people will be ready to be "reaped" into the kingdom. Luke (10:3) writes of this account but adds that Jesus said, “<strong>Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.</strong>” He told them not only to pray, but also to GO thus beginning to answer the very prayer they were to pray. “We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.” A.W. Pink said, “<strong><em>It is true that [many] are praying for worldwide revival. But it would be more timely, and more scriptural, for prayer to be made to the Lord of the harvest, that He would raise up and trust forth laborers who would fearlessly and faithfully preach those truths which are calculated to bring about a revival</em></strong>.”

<strong>Application</strong>: <strong>Look at the shepherd-less (the unsaved) both those you know and the stranger and see them through Christ’s eyes. By compassion PRAY and GO, they need you NOW!</strong> Blessings Pastor Phil

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 21:14-16, “14The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. 15 But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant. "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read,” `From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise' ", “…Because of your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger. (Psalm 8:2)</strong>

Sometime back on a Father’s Day, I had the wonderful opportunity to see both of my dads. Since I’ve blessed by a beautiful wife, I have gained another father as well, and he has gained a son. <!--more-->When I saw my biological dad we were with my sister-in-laws side of the family as well. One little girl was there named Naomi (which means pleasant or sweet) , and her mom was also present to see her dad, but this little girl’s dad was not present for he left this world because of cancer, and was celebrating Father’s Day with our Heavenly Father. I suppose this little girl was very sad without her dad present, and then I noticed a dog that looked sickly and bloated. When I asked what was wrong with the dog I was told it had cancer and only a month to live. I thought wow this girl has loved her dad and he died, she loves her dog, and it will soon die, and I found out two other family members of hers died to cancer as well. This could produce a very bitter and angry child toward the things of God. However one of the most amazing things I have ever seen took place as I walked into the living room where I found this 7 year old playing her guitar singing praises to Jesus. She wrote her own songs as she blessed everyone listening as she played, “Heal me before I go,” and “We all fall down,” and “Jesus I love you so much.” I wish I could show you a video tape of this wonderful experience. I can picture Jesus calling all the saints over, Naomi’s dad, and Father God too and saying “Do you hear what this child is singing?" They that are listening have read, but now they see, ‘<strong>from the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise</strong>.’” Naomi’s names fits her well as her praise was both pleasant and sweet to the ears of Heaven. I cannot begin to describe the testimony I saw in this girl who understands pain, loss, suffering, and death. Her mom shared that this little girl by the things she says brings conviction at times even to her. No wonder Jesus said, <strong>"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these</strong>." When He had placed His hands on them, He went on from there <b>Matthew 19:14-15.</b>” Jesus surely places His almighty hand on children today. Having at some point been a Children’s Pastor for four years, I have seen God’s hand on the lives of many kids. I have seen them praise Him in tears and reverence.

Creation seems to be silenced by the praise of children. Regardless of how the wicked assert themselves, they cannot outdo the evidence of God's glory on earth and in heaven. It is all around us (see <b>Romans 1:20</b>). The sound of children is concrete evidence of God's fortress on earth. The sound of opposition is silenced by the babbling and chatter of children. What a contrast! What a King!

In the verse above the children's "Hosannas" are not being directed to God but to the Son of David, the Messiah. Jesus is therefore not only acknowledging His Messiahship but justifying the praise of the children by applying to Himself a passage of Scripture applicable only to God. He ordained praise from children, and even though Jesus’ enemies said He was not the Messiah, the children could not be silenced from crying out the truth!

<strong>Application: See the good gifts in the lives of children, teach them the ways of God, and allow them to be the blessing that they can be, and hinder them not from coming to Jesus and expressing themselves to Him. </strong>Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <title><![CDATA[Above And Beyond The Call Of Duty, Pastor Phil Sessa]]></title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Samuel 23:20- 23, “Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men. He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard”</strong>

Benaiah was a valiant fighter, and certainly excelled greatly in his duty. He performed GREAT exploits, as they are listed.<!--more--> He took on fierce opponents, a lion, and even with only having a club, disarmed an Egyptian warrior and killed the man with his own spear. He became as famous as the three mighty men, held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but not included among the Three, even though David promoted him by placing him in charge of his bodyguard. What did the Three do that Benaiah didn’t do? Well let’s look at their story.

David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!" So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD. <strong>"Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!" he said. "Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?" And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.2 Sam 23:15-17</strong>

David was the King that had a desire, water. He didn’t give a command, he didn’t make his request part of his men’s job description, and he didn’t have an expectation that these three men should take up the task of his “craving” for water from Bethlehem. King David was in the line of Jesus Christ as reads in<strong> Matt 1:1 “A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham:”</strong>
<h1><strong>Three mighty men</strong></h1>
Out of loyal to David these men went well beyond “the call of duty.” They were brave and courageous with only three of them breaking through the host of the Philistine army after their twelve mile journey to get there. These men had to break through enemy lines, the Philistine garrison (outpost) in Bethlehem, retrieved the water, and brought it back to David. These men were not commissioned to do this task. They sacrificed their very lives not to gain clout or merit, not to be in the Israeli hall of fame, and not even to advance the victory for their army. Note, these men had one thing on their minds, to bring some water for their king! Why, because this is what would please the King. With loyalty and honor they risked their lives, “counting their lives worth nothing,” just to please the King to which they longed to do, even putting themselves in “death’s way,”. <strong>Haggai 1:8 </strong>reads, “<strong>Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored," says the LORD”. God is our King and desires me to please Him!</strong>

While Benaiah certainly excelled in his duty, and was promoted as such, the Three went above and beyond the call of duty just to please their King.

Application: Are you excelling for God, or are you going above and beyond your call of duty? What is your call of duty you ask? “<strong>He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God” (Mic 6:8</strong>). Be that loyal husband, devoted father, committed ministry leader. Work hard at your job and be faithful and diligent in reaching the lost. Blessings Pastor Phil

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Colossians 2:6,8,9,"As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And you are complete in Him"</strong>

The title of this devotion almost doesn't make sense. How can you have Christianity without Christ. That is like having the sun without light. Yet listen to the words of General William Booth Founder Salvation Army as he stated "The chief danger of the 20th century will be...<!--more-->

...<strong>Religion without the Holy Spirit; Christianity without Christ; Salvation without regeneration</strong>

<strong>Forgiveness without Repentance; Politics without God; and Heaven without Hell." </strong>

Does this not sound like our nation and world today?

<i>"As we first received the Lord Jesus, so we continue to walk in the Lord Jesus. Receiving Christ is the Gate, but walking in Him as we have received Him is the Path. The Gate is an event, while the Path is a process. The Gate is for entering, while the Path is for walking.” </i>Chip Brogden. Why do we need to make sure that Christ is kept in Christianity, see the following reasons.

We are called by God Himself to have a love relationship with Christ! <strong>Deuteronomy 6:4-5 says, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength."</strong>

Mankind has fallen into sin by breaking God’s Law and out of relationship with God.<strong> Romans 3:10-11 says, "There is none righteous, no, not one; There is none who understands; There is none who seeks after God. They have all turned aside; They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one"</strong>

Many Christians have moved from an intimate love relationship with God to a platonic relationship. (no intimacy) A relationship based upon intellect and lacking in love. <strong>Matthew 24:12, "Jesus said that at the ‘end of the age’ that lawlessness will abound, and the love of many will grow cold"</strong>

The church of Ephesus was rebuked for losing their love and blinded to the truth of their spiritual own condition. They were sick and didn’t know it. In<strong> Revelation 2:4, "Jesus said, "Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love. Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and remove your lamp stand from its place-unless you repent"</strong>

The 21st century church needs to take warning and guard against becoming a “loveless” church. We must be careful that we don’t live a “Christ-less Christianity”.

Application: If God had a meter of how much you loved Him based on <b>John 14:21</b> how well do you feel that you will do?

Blessings, Pastor Phil and Pastor Dave]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Corinthians 13:11,”When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.”</strong>

I can remember very clearly what my prayer life was like when I first became a Christian. My prayers in the beginning were all about one subject, and one person alone, and God was neither that subject nor that person. Who was this person that I prayed for, well myself of course. <!--more-->The Apostle Paul mentioned that when he was a child he did childish things, he talked, thought, and reasoned like a child. Well I prayed like a child. When one thinks of growth in the natural sense it makes sense. When babies cry at 2 am who are they concerned about? They certainly are not concerned about mommy or daddy who has to wake up and care for the child. No, the cry is all about the child.

When I used to pray, all my prayer requests were centered on me. So what did God do, He answered them. The very first time I prayed I can remember saying out loud, even though I was alone, “Let me try this prayer thing.” I had looked in the shed for a half an hour for my bike chain and couldn’t find it. So I got on my knees, no one was around, and I prayed, “<em>God I believe you see all things, and you see where my bike chain is, please direct my eyes to it</em>.” As soon as I opened my eyes, it was hanging on the wall right in front of my eyes. “It worked, God answered my prayer, I said. I said “thank you God,” and left. Oh, that was just a coincidence, you may be thinking. Well things like that began to happen often to me, mostly when I lost something. Even though I was new born babe in Christ (<strong>1Peter 2:2</strong>), God honored my prayers so I would learn to trust Him in prayer. Ones prayer life has to have a beginning, and often it’s a baby beginning.

As the Lord was slowly building me up in prayer, He was also building me up in faith, trusting Him. <b>Matthew 18:2-4</b> reads, “<strong>2</strong> <strong>He called a little child and had him stand among them. 3 And he said: “I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven</strong>.” God loves the faith that we have as newborn children of God first trusting in His ability to answer prayers. God starts us here, because He is helping us to gain confidence in Him. John wrote <strong>“I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of His name (1John 2:12).”</strong> God desires at some point that we begin to look outward in our prayer and focus on others, we ought to at some point begin to grow up in our prayer life, just like in the natural we grow from children to adults.

The writer of Hebrews writes in this context seemingly in frustration “<strong>by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God’s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! 13 Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. 14 But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil (Hebrews 5)</strong> There is a time to grow up, and become mature in prayer. Paul said there was a time when he became a man and put childish things behind him. I no longer pray like a child, and I have prayed and see God do miraculous things, life changing things, in myself and others, but my relationship with Him had to deepen which in turn caused my prayer to deepen. I too had to put childish things behind me, not just focused on myself, but on others, and more than anything on my relationship with Him, just talking to and hearing from my heavenly Father.

<strong>Application: Read about prayer in God’s Word, and may you too grow in your prayer life. Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1 Samuel 28:3 ,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land" </strong>

In this passage Prophet Samuel, who represented God’s voice, was dead. Saul had no communication with God because of his disobedience which will be seen shortly. It was similar to a soldier losing radio contact with their commanding officer at headquarters during a war. <!--more-->Everyone mourned over Samuel’s death as he was a great man of God, having served the Lord so faithfully since he was a young boy. I would hope to make such an impact for my God should He tarry that people would mourn over my death because I faithfully and unashamedly carried the truth of God’s Word to all.

Look what Saul had done, he put away (cleansed) the mediums, and spiritists (witches) out of the land. The Message Bible says "<strong>Saul had long since cleansed out all those who held séances with the dead</strong>" Good job Saul. But Saul was quickly about to face a battle against the Philistines that when "<strong>Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart" </strong>This king was terrified, what did he do, he sought the King of Kings, God.

Verse 5 shows the result which reads, "<strong>He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets</strong>" God didn’t answer Saul, why? Verse 17-19 tells of the reason, and the bottom line again was his disobedience. God had ripped the kingdom off Saul’s hand and had given it to David. How did Saul find this out, through consulting Samuel? What? I thought Samuel was dead. Oh yes, but Saul contacted the dead through one who contacted the dead regularly, named the Witch of Endor.

The very thing that Saul did away with, expelling the mediums and spiritists from the land, was the very thing he ran to when the battle came. He turned to the Devil’s servant and the Devil’s ways for the answer. Does that sound familiar to you? I feel like there has been times that I’ve thrown something away spiritually, only to go "<strong>digging through the garbage</strong>" to find it again. It could be pride, bitterness, lust, greed, envy, Unforgiveness, etc. The bottom line was it was in the garbage because it belonged there! Spiritually it is like <strong>Proverbs 26:11 </strong>states, "<strong>As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly</strong>" I have at times unfortunately turned to ungodly things as if that was going to help me in a battle. It only made things worse, and ungodly things can NEVER produce godly results and victory. If God turned a deaf ear to me because of sin, I need to repent and let the Holy Spirit break me, humble me, and mold me into putty in the hands of God. Whether I am a prince or a pauper I need God’s favor and communication with my Father. Many times we can throw out the paraphernalia of sin such as ungodly books, magazines, CD’s, notes, pictures, etc., but it needs to be removed from the place that it is hidden most, in our minds and hearts. <b>Romans 12:2, </b>speaks about being "<strong>transformed by the renewing of your mind</strong>,” and that is what we need"

<strong>Application: Lord, help me not be a garbage picker or a dog that returns to its vomit. When I face life’s battles let me turn to You and Your Word which is truth as ammunition to fight against the enemy. Keep my life humble before you and may I sense at any time when my sweet communion with You is melting away. Keep me humble for You resist the proud but give grace to the humble. Amen. </strong>Blessings Pastor Phil

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 21:4-6, “Jn 4 Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. Jn 21:5 He called out to them, “Friends, haven’t you any fish?” “No,” they answered. Jn 21:6 He said, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.” When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish”</strong> Anyone can do a job or task for a little while, but to do it daily and consistently now there’s a challenge. When Jesus first started to call his disciples he interrupted their lives and he called the two sets of brothers and would make them fishers of men.<!--more--> In John 21, Jesus was standing on the shore, his disciples not realizing it was Him, and called out to them “<strong>Friends, haven’t you any fish?” “No,” they answered. Jn 21:6 He said, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.</strong>” The result was the following, “When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. They did it Jesus’ way and it yielded fish, because of their obedience. Again in Luke 5 we read another fish story account. Jesus told these men who were fishing all night, “<strong>Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.” Simon Peter replied by saying, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets</strong>.” Simon could have argued with the notion that Jesus knew nothing about fishing since He Himself was a carpenter. But Peter obeyed because it was Jesus speaking. The outcome of that obedience was that ”<strong>When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.” They caught fish because they did it Jesus’ way, not theirs.”</strong> Again they obeyed and caught fish. “<strong>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” 9 For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, 10 and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will catch men.” 11 So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him. We know that Jesus said 19 “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men</strong>.” Jesus wants His fishers of men to fish His way. <strong>Hab 1:14 says, “You have made men like fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler.” Hos 4:3 states, “…Hos 4:3 …the fish of the sea are dying.” Isa 50:2 When I came, why was there no one?</strong> When I called, why was there no one to answer? Was my arm too short to ransom you? Do I lack the strength to rescue you? By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert; their fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst. The fish need to be fished for and be caught if they are to be saved. Yet we are fishing for men (people), and with that mandate seems to bring fear and possible disillusionment. Yet “<strong>We are called to be fishers of men (Matt. 4:19</strong>). “<strong>Program your mind into the mode that the fish God wants you to catch are upstream. To get them you will have to go against the current of self-will. Waves of fear and discouragement will thrust against you, but use the muscle the Spirit of God has put within you to fight against the tide.”</strong> (Ray Comfort) <strong>Application</strong>: 1. Know where the fish are. 2. Go to where the fish are; don’t expect them to jump into the boat. 3. Use appropriate bait - speak the Word of God in ways they can understand, yet never water it down because fish have enough water. 4. GO fishing today for men (people) and don’t wait another day 5. Always listen to Jesus being sensitive to the voice of the Holy Spirit, and obey instantly Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Philippians 3:20, “But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,” </strong>

The US Department of Education has made educators aware of a new educational development called educating for citizenship. Most people spend one-third of their lives as children and two-thirds of their lives as adults. Educators are being instructed to educate children in respect to being not just adults, but furthermore viable and model citizens that serve their country well. <!--more-->According to the dictionary, a citizen is a person owing loyalty to and entitled by birth or naturalization to the protection of a state or nation. Another definition reads that a citizen is a resident of a city or town especially one entitled to vote and enjoy other privileges there.

<strong>The following is from the US Department of Ed. Website: Citizenship and Patriotism</strong>

<strong><em>Citizenship </em></strong>requires doing our share for our community and our country. Being a good citizen means caring about the good of society and participating actively to make things better. Research reveals that participating in community service programs and learning about the importance and value of serving others can be a powerful influence on positive character development. <em>Patriotism</em> is an important part of good citizenship.

<strong><em>Patriotism</em></strong> is love of and loyalty to our country. It involves honoring the democratic ideals on which the country is based and expecting elected officials to do the same, respecting and obeying its laws and honoring its flag and other symbols. It also involves accepting the responsibilities of good citizenship, such as keeping informed about national issues, voting, volunteering

Christians have dual citizenship. That is to say they are a citizen of their country, USA, India, China, etc…, as well as a citizen in heaven. And just as most people will spend more time on the other side, the adult side of their lives as citizens so we too as Christians will spend more time on the other side, eternity! WOW, I was awed talking with a friend about the incredible parallel spiritual truth that we discovered while talking about education America can call themselves an American because some are aliens, outsiders, so not all that call themselves Christians are citizens of God’s Kingdom of heaven. There is such a thing as a false convert, but I will save that topic for another day. Spring boarding off definition of citizen, Christians have been born again and owe loyalty to their country (heaven), because they have been bought with a price (1 Cor. 6:20). The Apostle Paul reminds us that we have citizenship in heaven, and thus are entitled to the protection, rights, and privileges of that country. All I can think of is healing, salvation, power in the Holy Spirit, wisdom, spiritual gifts. The old cliché says of some that <b>“some are so heavenly minded that they are no earthly good.” God sent us the perfect model citizen that was so heavenly minded and extremely earthly good simultaneously, and His name is JESUS</b> (John. 13:15). Peter tells us, "<b>Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us (1 Peter. 2:11-12)</b>.”

Are you living as a citizen of your earthly country and your Heavenly home? Remember where you will spend not two - thirds of your life, but you are living your eternal life right now, just waiting for the day He takes us home

<strong>Application: Ask yourself, the Lord and other Christians if they feel you are living as a good citizen of heaven. Allow them to tell you what you need to hear not just what you want to hear. Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Corinthians 4:7, “But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.”</strong>

If you needed the greatest treasure you owned, transported to a group of people that you destined to receive it that who would you entrust with it? Would you give it to the fierce warrior, or perhaps the brilliant scientist? Maybe the military soldiers should be charged with so great a treasure.<!--more-->

Look at the ones that God entrusted to carry His great treasure. He chose those who were frail, weak, fallible, and liable to sickness, persecution, and death. One blow could put an end to those picked by God just as any other man. Without the strength of the military bearing arms before them, they faithfully carry the gospel with the armor of God upon their lives, and the treasure within their lives. Yes God uses mere man to accomplish His great work, entrusting him with His great treasure, the gospel.

The Jars of Clay (earthen vessels) are ordinary people that serve an extraordinary God. God is the One that empowers the jars of clay. What can a jar of clay do, in and of itself? It can only contain that which is placed inside. And the only One that can place something inside is the One who formed the vessel of clay, the Potter. Remember the account of Jeremiah with at the potter’s house?

<strong>Jeremiah 18:1, "This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 2 "Go down to the potter's house, and there I will give you my message." 3 So I went down to the potter's house, and I saw him working at the wheel. 4 But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.JER 18:5 Then the word of the LORD came to me: 6 "O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does?" declares the LORD. "Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. </strong>

The Potter was intent on forming the pot and fashioning it to His liking. He had in mind a purpose for the pot. For everything God forms is for God’s purpose and everything God forms He fills. When the earth was without form, God formed it and filled it with light, water, and life. God formed the ark (Noah just followed the blueprints) and filled it with the animals and Noah’s family. God formed the tabernacle and the temple and filled them with furniture and His presence. God’s desire is that He can do with us as ordinary clay pots and fill us with the all-surpassing power of the everlasting gospel.

In the children’s story the Tale of Three Trees each tree had a purpose for itself. The first tree boasted that it's lumber would be used to make a great and beautiful treasure chest. The chest would be decorated with bright golden hinges and polished to a fine and shiny finish. Inside it would hold great riches, jewels which were the colors of the rainbow and gold and silver coins. Now the first tree that had dreamed of being a beautiful treasure chest was instead made into a manger. It was sold to a farmer who used it in his cave where he kept and fed his animals. From this manger the animals of the farm ate the hay that lay in it. Until one night a young woman and her husband came to the cave looking for shelter for themselves and their newborn baby. In that manger, they laid their infant son. It was at that moment that the tree knew that it held the greatest treasure in the world, God's gift to mankind. And as the child lay sleeping in the manger, the angels sang and the stars shone brightly in the sky. See the full inspiring short story - <a href="http://www.theologic.com/oflweb/forkids/3trees.htm">http://www.theologic.com/oflweb/forkids/3trees.htm</a>&gt;

<strong>Application: But we have this treasure (the gospel) in jars of clay (our lives) to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.” What are you doing with the power in you to reach others for Christ?</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Daniel 1:8, “But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.”</strong>

As a Christian we certainly want to live in victory, but as you have found out there are times of temptations which test your resolve in the Lord. From the moment Daniel and his friends are taken captive and exiled, they are required to immerse themselves in the language and literature of the Babylonians (1:4), with its focus on sorcery, astrology and polytheism. <!--more-->This was an alien atmosphere and culture to these displaced Hebrew boys.

Although they were in an ungodly, foreign land, this ungodly land was not in them. They were in Babylon but not of it. Daniel and his friends had their hearts resolved in Yahweh; therefore they refused to compromise with their actions. Before a public victory comes, a private victory must take place within the heart. This can clearly be seen in the life of these Hebrews as “Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat….” Daniels heart was set on Yahweh, his friends followed him in this desire as well, but now this desire certainly needed to be appropriated or fleshed out. Daniel didn’t just intend to keep himself pure for the Lord, he desired it.

In his book A Heart Ablaze, John Bevere points out the difference between an intention and a desire, showing they are not the same thing. <strong>Many have good and godly intentions, but when it comes time to implement that intention they don’t follow through, because it may not have been their true desire</strong>. He says, “Desire is the path that a person will take, no matter how good his intentions may be.” <strong>James 1:14 reads, “But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust (desire), and enticed</strong>.” This verse speaks about desire on the negative side. Psalm 37:4 shows us the positive side, “<strong>Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</strong>” Both verses show the power of desire. Our intentions are what we will do when it is convenient at the time, but our desires are what will drive us even when it’s not convenient.

Daniel’s true desire was stated when the Scripture reads, “<strong>But Daniel purposed [desired] in his heart…,”</strong> because he acted upon that desire in a time that was inconvenient for him. He made the request to the prince of the Eunuchs that he and his friends to be allowed to eat vegetables and water, and not be defiled by eating the king’s meat. Well at first the Eunuch didn’t go along with it because if the king saw the Hebrews looking worse (downtrodden) than the other young men their age, then the king would have had the Eunuchs head. However Daniel in his wisdom asked if perhaps the eunuch might allow them a test for only ten days to which it was agreed upon. Daniel true desire was to please not the king of Babylon but the King of Kings, the Lord.

<strong>Application: May you have your private victory today, to face the public challenge when tempted to sin. Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2 Samuel 6:11, "The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months. And the LORD blessed Obed-Edom and all his household"</strong>

The ark that Noah built with direction from God saved a family of 8 humans, Noah and his wife with their three sons and their wives. Noah's ark was a big ark that had it's work for a season, when you talk about the Ark of God, though it appears small in size, it supersedes Noah's ark by far that saved only 8 souls. God's ark, the Ark of the Covenant saved and blessed the Israelites.<!--more-->

<strong>The Ark of the Covenant had such a great significance, it was the center of Israel's worship and Elohim (the strong Creator) performed many miracles by Ark of the Covenant</strong>. The purpose for the Ark of the Covenant was to symbolize Yahweh Elohim’s visible throne on earth. The covenant was God's promise to human race, a promise He would not break simply because He is God. Because people would not approach God directly then, I believe the Ark of the Covenant was to always remind the Israelites of God's presence amongst them. To bring hope and strength as they faced many challenges especially their enemies. As already said, the ark did not just symbolize the presence of God, by it God also performed miracles. Victories over the enemies were obtained through it, people were blessed through it. This really troubled their enemies especially the Philistines that they decided to capture the ark. Instead of gaining blessings and victories through it like the Israelites did, the ark brought about curses to them. The Ark of the Covenant could not also be handled carelessly and by anyone. The way it ended in Obed-Edom's house, Uzzah reached to support the Ark when it stumbled and God killed him for doing that. Not sure why but maybe he thought he could help God, or he thought his hands were clean enough to handle the ark. We know the main reason was a proper process of handling the ark did not take place. The Levites were the elected ones to handle the ark; they were consecrated for that purpose.

What turned out to be Uzzah’s and the Philistines’ curse became Obed-Edom's blessing. I don't think Obed-Edom did anything special for God to bless his house while the ark remained there. Ordinary guy letting God be God in his house. Worshipping and yet feeling unworthy to have the ark in his house but still glad that God chose to bless him in spite of. His spiritual life must have been blessed and increased, his marriage, his children, his business were blessed because God had his hands over his household. For three good months he was blessed, I don't think after those three months he would have wanted the ark to leave. <strong>Just one touch from God is enough to change your life completely, the very reason we don't want to let go of God</strong>. When you sought to have the presence of God, the first thing, the enemy can't stand it, second your life is defined by the presence of God, you see yourself a whole lot clearly in the light of His glory and you are changed in His presence. <strong>1John 3:2, "Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is". </strong>You are reminded of his covenant to mankind, His promises he made to His children and all you can desire is His presence and His blessing. Obed-Edom might have been an ordinary guy but that did not stop God from reaching out to him. This is to let us know that it's not just pastors, evangelists, key leaders who can have or experience the presence of God, anyone can. Allow the Ark of the Covenant to rest always in your life, in your family, business, in everything and everywhere you go. You too can be an ordinary person with an extra ordinary blessing.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 11:4,” By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks”</strong>

Theologians, scholars, teachers, pastors have tried exhaustive ways to figure out who wrote the book of Hebrews. Based on the style, vocabulary, the message some have suggested Paul among others, still many would disagree. God is the Author of all the books, the only thing we are not sure who He used to write Hebrews.<!--more-->I am amazed by the in depth richness of the book of Hebrews. Take chapter 11 for example paints a picture of ordinary people with real faith. If you read the background of these people, you learn that the Bible does not hide the scars of our heroes. What we also learn, while the Bible mentions their scars, it does not dwell on them. It highlights and dwells on their faith in God which is crucial and key.

In talking of the heroes of faith, the writer of Hebrews bypasses Adam and Eve and begins with Abel. Abel is one of the first saints, and the first martyr for religion of all the sons of Adam. He is one who lived by faith, and died for it, and therefore a fit pattern for the Hebrews to imitate. Observe this; the writer highlights Abel’s faith though we have very little account of his life in <b>Genesis 4 </b>and later in the NT. The conversation the Lord had with Cain after He rejected his sacrifice suggests that God had given Abel and Cain very clear instructions of what to do. Only Abel followed through what was required of them. Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice, the firstlings of his flock, implying both a confession of what his own sins deserved, and a desire of sharing in the great atonement. <strong>He offered in obedience by faith, giving the Lord what He required</strong>, a sacrifice. God caused fire to fall upon his sacrifice as a sign of acceptance. This would then rise in smoke as a sweet essence, a fragrance, aroma the Lord would receive. It was also a picture of the Lamb of God who would be slain for sinful mankind and give life to those who repent and have faith in Him.

What legacy did he leave<strong>” … and through it he being dead still speaks” </strong>Good men die, and some of them die a violent death, as did Abel, yet he speaks in the Scriptures. He is the first one to teach us that a man is justified by faith alone apart from works. It’s not the sacrifice that he is commended for, it’s his obedient faith. <strong>His faith was evidenced by works</strong>. Through faith, he left a testimony to all succeeding generations that a person comes to God by faith alone to receive righteousness.

What do we learn from Abel? Let me draw from Matthew Henry’s commentary, <em>“ (1.) Witness that he was righteous, a justified, sanctified, and accepted person; this, very probably, was attested by fire from heaven, kindling and consuming his sacrifice. (2.) God gave witness to the righteousness of his person, by testifying his acceptance of his gifts. When the fire consumed the offering, it was a sign that the mercy of God accepted the offerer for the sake of the great sacrifice. (3.) By it he, being dead, yet speaks. <strong>He had the honor to leave behind him an instructive speaking case</strong>; and what does it speak to us? What should we learn from it? [1.] That fallen man has leave to go in to worship God, with hope of acceptance. [2.] That, if our persons and offerings be accepted, it must be through faith in the Messiah. [3.] That acceptance with God is a peculiar and distinguishing favor. [4.] That those who obtain this favor from God must expect the envy and malice of the world. [5.] That God will not suffer the injuries done to his people to remain unpunished, nor their sufferings unrewarded. These are very good and useful instructions, and yet the blood of sprinkling speaketh better things than that of Abel. [6.] <strong>That God would not suffer Abel's faith to die with him, but would raise up others, who should obtain like precious faith; and so he did in a little time;"</strong></em>

Ask yourself, what will be written of you when you leave this world? What legacy, what testimony will you leave behind? Would you still speak while you are gone? Besides that, if we were to ask everyone around you, would they say Jesus is primarily precious to you because you constantly speak of Him? The One whom you love you talk about a lot everywhere. And what we leave behind?, we loved the Lord, we lived by faith, and we testified of it. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 11:5-6, "5 By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, “and was not found, because God had taken him”; for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him”</strong>

To continue with <b>Hebrews 11,</b> we read of a moving account of faithful OT saints and given such titles as, “The Saint’s Hall of Fame”, ”The Honor Roll of OT Saints”, and “Heroes of Faith”. They attest to the value of living by faith. <!--more-->They compose <strong>“A cloud of witnesses…”, Hebrews 12:1 </strong>who give powerful testimony to the Hebrews that they should come to faith in God’s truth in Christ.

Who qualifies to be a saint? Is it a believer who has been dead for a long long time? No, a saint is anyone who has repented and trusted Christ alone for their eternal salvation, and it’s evidenced with their daily living. Enoch was one of the old saints in the beginning. It’s interesting that in <b>Genesis 5,</b> as Adam’s genealogy is recorded, very little is told of each person. You read of their names, how long they lived, who they begat. In vs. 21, we are introduced to Enoch, however, Moses pauses to talk a little bit more of Enoch. The bible says in <strong>vs. 22, “…, Enoch walked with God three hundred years…</strong>”. Twice in the same chapter it’s stressed that he walked with God. He is the first saint who never tasted death, <strong>vs. 24, “And Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him</strong>” to continue his walk in heaven with God. We are then told of this hall a famer in <strong>Hebrews 11:5</strong>, that “…<strong>for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God</strong>”. What a testimony.

How did he please God, <strong>Hebrews 11:6</strong>, tells us “<strong>But without faith it is IMPOSSIBLE to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him”, </strong>He had faith and that faith propelled him to be a seeker of God, for that reason God rewarded him, gave him eternal life<strong>. </strong>To walk with God, he had intimate relationship, he pursued after God, and he lived for one purpose, the glory of God, making His name great in this world. And because of his walk with God, he did not see death, he was translated. This is so with saints of today, Jesus said, “<strong>And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die”, John 11:26</strong>. To know God, to please God is to be in His word, to feed on the bread of life and live eternally, <strong>John 6:51, “I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world</strong>.”

Enoch had the evidence of it in his own conscience, and the Spirit of God witnessed with his spirit. Those who by faith walk with God in a sinful world are pleasing to him, and He will give them marks of His favor, and put honor upon them. <strong>1Corinthians 15:22, “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive”, Romans 6:11, “Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord”. </strong>

How is your walk with the Lord today? Is it on and off? Here is a man for 300 years, not 300 days, or 300 months, for 300 years he walked with God (pleased God) by his lifestyle (word, thought and deeds), this is the testimony he left with us. This is for us to grasp and be challenged to die to sin and be alive in Christ, living this life by faith in order to please the Lord. <strong>Hebrews 10:38, “Now the just shall live by faith; But if anyone draws back, My soul has no pleasure in him</strong>.” In other words, he who by faith is righteous shall live, he is the one that pleases the Lord.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 11:8-12, Vs. 8, “By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going”</strong>

The journey of faith is simply taking God at His word even when it does not make sense. Its awaiting God’s timing without doubting His love. It’s pushing a rock you’ve been asked to push knowing you could never move it but taking comfort that a bigger hand will move it so you push anyway. And here we find the faith of Abraham, the friend of God, and father of the faithful with a series of events and times that required taking God at His word.<!--more-->This journey of faith begins with Abraham then flowing to Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Abraham's faith is celebrated for his obedience to the divine call, quitting the country where he was, and going where he knew not. Leaving a land he knew his way around, surrounded by people he knew to a new land he knew no one only trusting God to lead him. This was an effectual call, by which he was converted from the idolatry of his father's house, <b>Genesis 12:1</b>. This call was renewed after his father's death.

<b>Hebrews 11:8.</b> Highlights Sarah's faith which lay in receiving strength through it to conceive, bear, and bring forth a child past age of child bearing which was, founded upon the faithfulness of a promising God; hence from Abraham, by her, through promised son Isaac sprung a large posterity, like the stars of the sky, and the sand on the sea shore.

Going back to Abraham, he was told to leave his land to a land God would show him. By God’s promise at an old age, he received a son Isaac again taking God at His word. Not only that, by faith he was willing to sacrifice his son at God’s command knowing that God would raise his son. Some of the things he had to deal with were pretty hard to receive but He did. Even some of the promises given to him, he would not live to see but he embraced them by faith at a distance. Sojourning in the promised land, as in a strange one, in which Isaac and Jacob dwelt with him in tents. Looking by faith for the heavenly city built by the Lord.

What do we learn from Abraham, the father of faith? Faith can lay hold of blessings at a great distance, can make them present, can love them and rejoice in them, though strangers; as saints, whose home is heaven; as pilgrims, travelling toward their home.

God calls His people to an inheritance: by His effectual call He makes them children, and so heirs. This inheritance is not immediately possessed by them; they must wait some time for it: but the promise is sure, and shall have its seasonable accomplishment. Also to mention something profound, the faith of parents often procures blessings for their posterity. Have faith in God, have faith in God for your children. Take God at His word, go where He sends you, birth what He has promised in His time, duplicate your faith in others especially your immediate loved ones if you have kids, be faithful till the end.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 11:23-29, “24 By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 25 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26 esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward."</strong>

Hebrews 11 has been rich for me as I learn from our faith heroes. Today let’s look at Moses. Moses was born at a time Pharaoh was determined to kill newborn boys of the Israelites. And <strong>Hebrew</strong>s <strong>11:23, says “By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s command</strong>”.<!--more--> Moses parents Amram and Jochebed by faith saw something unique about him and entrusted him in the hands of the Lord in the midst of life threatening situations. <strong>This was not Moses’ faith but his parent’s faith that would influence him down the road.</strong> However hard they tried to hide him, the third month proved a challenge and they set him in a basket around the enemies’ territory trusting God to take care of him, what a faith!. This reminds us of the Son of God who when He was born, His life as an infant was already a threat to Herod for He was a king. Could it be possible in Moses case that Pharaoh already sensed that there would be a deliverer to be born the reason he killed young boys? Perhaps.

This is a picture of the threat the enemy senses when a child is born in a Christian family and the parents dedicate him/her to the Lord for his service. By all means, his mission is to destroy that life from the start. I believe abortion has been one if not the greatest means he has used to accomplish his mission. Parents ought to be diligent in protecting their children by God given wisdom and strength, at the same time and most importantly, entrust them in the hands of the Lord to keep them through the dangers of life with the aid of prayers. As some parents may have a different goal for their children to be successful in Egypt (in this life), Christian parents should have a different desire and that is to lead their children in God’s way and trust God to one day save them and use them for His glory. <strong>Children are treasures from the Lord and one day each parent will give an account what they did with the treasure God gave them.</strong>

The first faith was the faith of Moses’ parents for him. The next faith would be Moses' personal faith in God. <strong>Every child that becomes of age, age of understanding, age of accountability must have faith in God for themselves to be saved and not live on the faith of the parents</strong>. And this is a duty each parent must instill in their children on how to personally have faith in God (salvation). Moses was discovered by Pharaoh’s daughter however raised by Moses’ mother at the suggestion of Miriam his sister. There is no indication that Pharaoh’s daughter knew that Jochebed was Moses’ mother. Moses was being raised by his parents mostly likely not knowing that these were his real parents. He was taught what was right, taught of the God of the Israelites, taught faith, how to please Him, hope for the future deliverance, faithfulness, self-denial, sacrificial living, hard work, fighting for your brothers etc. which fulfills, <strong>Proverbs 22:6, “Train up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not depart from it”. </strong>

The mission was to raise him to be a prince in Pharaoh’s kingdom, his parents raised him different. The task ahead of parents is huge and scary. Can God who has given parents children be entrusted with them while living in the Egypt (this world)? Having faith in God for your children, trusting God to give you wisdom, courage, ability to provide for your children while raising them for the sake of His call. And when they become of age they would be ready to carry on with the faith the decision being theirs. Have faith for your treasure. To finish, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 11:23-29, “24 By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 25 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26 esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward"</strong>

Yesterday we looked at the faith of Moses’ parents for him, today we look at Moses’ faith for himself. In other words, his faith in God. Vs. 24-25 says, "<strong>24 By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 25 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin”. What age was this, the age of awareness, the age of accountability”. <!--more--></strong>He may have begun to evaluate things, realizing that something was not right with the setup; a glamorous life (not putting God first), idolatry. Based on what he was taught, he was able to distinguish right from wrong. To make this point clear, let’s read what Paul tells Timothy a young man, his son in faith, <strong>2Timothy 3:15, “..and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus”. </strong>What he was taught did not save him; it prepared him for the Savior. It instructed him to the One who would save him. Here we see that the instructions Moses received made him wise unto salvation.

There are parents who encourage and even push their children to be successful in life but minimally or neglect to instruct their children on the things of God which is crucial to make them wise for salvation. With this I mean, they would rather have their children succeed academically, financially etc but do very little to instill Godly values in their lives that they would one day come under conviction and abandon Egypt and it’s pride and embrace Christ and His cross. <strong>They can be successful and they should but their call to follow Christ is priority</strong>. <strong>Everything else centers on that call</strong>. When they become of age, they become accountable for the life they live and for that reason; their faith in God is what will save them not their parent’s faith. I see parents whose children are saved and serving the Lord beam. I also say this with tenderness, there are kids who are not walking with the Lord which is a great indication they are not saved and their parents find it hard to call them unbelievers. They may have prayed a salvation prayer at some point but how they live today ought to drive the parents on their knees crying out to God for their salvation. One thing I thank God for is that even though I grew up in a Christian home and may have said the sinner’s prayer, when my parents saw that I wasn’t walking the walk concluded I wasn’t saved and went into prayers crying out to God to save me. A tree is known by its fruit and if your child is not walking, don’t be naïve and say he is Christian who is not walking. You should be concerned for them and battle on your knees for them.

Paul pursued things in life but upon his conversion his primary desires changed, he later says <strong>Philippians 3:7-8, ” 7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ”</strong>

Moses was partly raised in a palace as prince only to be used in the desert as a shepherd. We tend to expect that someone would start in the desert and make it to the palace, not with Moses. He had a call in his life, he separated himself for that call.

The writer of Hebrews adds this line vs. <strong>26 “esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward</strong>”. To quote B. W. Johnson's Bible Commentary, “<em>Any reproach endured through faith in the promises of which Christ was the center and sum, was called the reproach of Christ. This reproach, though men might shrink from it, was really of more value permanently than the treasures of Egypt, because he looked forward to the recompense, the heavenly blessings. 27. By faith he forsook Egypt. The Exodus was all an achievement of faith. It was faith that made Moses disdain the king's wrath. He endured, as seeing him who is invisible. The unseen God was present with him by faith and his support gave strength to endure all</em>”.

For the sake of the call may we have faith for our children to be saved, teach them Holy Scriptures, teach them priorities and when they become of age, they will be candidates for grace. If you have a child who has made a profession of faith but he or she is not walking, ask the Lord to give you a burden to pray them into the kingdom. For the sake of the call, we pray and hope they turn to Christ by faith, trust and live for Him. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1John 5:4, “For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world-our faith”</strong>

Believers born of God are candidates for victory, God has wired us for it. If you look at the building you are working in, or living in, you will discover they are wired, there are hidden electrical cords, telephone cords among other wiring.<!--more--> This gives an indication they are already wired to bring power, light into the building. If the lights do not come on due to lack of power, they do not rewire the building again do they? no, they look for ways to understand why the power is not flowing and correct it. Maybe it is turned off and need to be turned on.

This is no different from the believer born of God, wired to overcome the world. The question is, is the power of God turned on in your life that brings about victory or are you looking for ways to rewire your life. What is the world in this case?, the world is anything that goes against the knowledge of God. Anything that pulls you in the direction the Lord has not designed for you. Things that make you grievous while others may not feel anything wrong with them, I call that the world.

<strong>1Corinthians 10:13, “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it</strong>”. What is temptation? I love how Paris Reidhead defines temptation, he says, ” <em>temptation is the proposition made to the mind to satisfy a good appetite in a bad (forbidden) way, and sin is the decision of the will to satisfy a good appetite in a bad way</em>”. Temptation by itself is not sin, but we are afraid that by it we might sin and we need victory over it. The world presents us with temptation, and this verse tells us how common temptation is, “<strong>No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man</strong>”. And the verse does not leave us hanging, it also tells us that we are wired to overcome it “<strong>but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able</strong>”. It then tells us that there is a way to escape and gain victory “<strong>with the temptation will also make the way of escape</strong>”. One little problem, this verse does not tell us how.

How do we gain victory then if we are born of God? <strong>1John 5:4, “For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world-our faith</strong>”, Jesus is the victory that has overcome the world and our faith in Him alone is the power to overcome the world. We become more victorious when we eat of Him as the bread of life, and drink of Him as the drink indeed until His nature becomes our nature, and His thoughts becomes our thoughts, His bones becomes our bones. Our faith in Him is the power we need to turn on. The question is where is the switch? <strong>Romans 13:14, “But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts</strong>”, <strong>Acts 17:28, “for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring.’ Colossians 3:3-4, "3 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 4 When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.</strong>

The power you turn on the most is the one that wins. <strong>Ephesians 5:14, “Therefore He says: ” Awake, you who sleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ will give you light.” Isaiah 60:1-2, “1 Arise, shine; For your light has come! And the glory of the LORD is risen upon you. 2 For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, And deep darkness the people; But the LORD will arise over you, And His glory will be seen upon you</strong>”. Where are you today? Do you realize you have been wired for victory? Would you stand today on the promises of God and turn on the power?. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 30:1, "Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister, and said to Jacob, "Give me a child, or else I die"</strong>

If at all I was to ask different people how they think of themselves, I will have a long list for sure. You may have something about that you don't like. If God was to give you a chance to design who you would like to be, most likely you may have a completely different picture of the new you.<!--more--> Every time you look in the mirror, is there a part of you you wished you could change? Humans tend to concentrate more on what they don't have or what someone else has that they forget to appreciate what they have. We at times feel that we have nothing to offer and even feel that there is nothing in our lives that other people can admire. We therefore belittle ourselves because of what we think of ourselves. <strong>Psalm 139:14, "I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are thy works; and my soul knoweth right well". </strong>You are skillfully, wonderfully and uniquely designed to fit in this world. You are not in this world by accident. The potter took time to make you in an image that no one else in the world is like you. There may be people who look and sound like you but there is absolutely no one like you. In other words, <strong>you have no competition</strong>; no one can beat you being you. The design on your thumb is unique no one in the world has the same design as yours. You are unique, with unique qualities, unique design.

We are told in Genesis about Rachel and Leah, blood sisters married to one man. Both women are from the same womb but are very different. They are unique in their looks, personalities, age etc. The husband appreciates each of them differently. I want us to understand that we can belong to God but be very different. The difference is what brings about our individuality and uniqueness that we ourselves can appreciate God for. Leah was the hated one, she was not as pretty as Rachel, she did not get all the attention she desired. On the other hand, she had been blessed with the fruit of the womb, she is was the oldest and that entitled her to get first service, she had children to attend to her and she was respected because of the fruits of her womb. When you talk about Rachel, she was the young one therefore she was served last, remember Jacob worked seven years for Rachel but ended up with Leah. Rachel had to wait 14 years before her dream was fulfilled. She had not been favored to have children and with that she was not getting the same respect as Leah did. She had no children to send, or call her own and be proud of. Looking at what she did not have, I see on the other hand she was beautiful and loved more than Leah, she was given the best gifts, she received the best attention from her husband and yet with all these she was not happy. I saw this with Hannah and Penninah. And because of what Rachel saw in Leah, she envied her, jealousy crept in and began to cripple her. I don't know what to say but I think the same must have happened to Leah, for this reason she tried to have more children to try and cover up the pain of rejection inside of her.

You don't have to agree with me on this but I would say that it is very hard to be happy for someone when you think that what they have should have been with you instead. I also believe that it is very hard to fully appreciate the good things in someone's life when you don't see what has been invested in you. Concentrating so much on what someone else has and neglecting to see what you have will always have a tendency of crippling you stealing contentment in your life. Rachel could have looked at the different areas that she had been favored and say something like this, "Even if I don't have this and that, God has favored me in other areas where Leah lacks".

What is my point?, look at how God designed you to know that you are unique and have no competition. As you might admire what someone else has, remember that they could be admiring what you have dismissed in your life. Understanding what you have will make you appreciate the gifting and the uniqueness in you that in turn someone else’s gifting and uniqueness will not be a threat to you but rather you will rejoice with them over the blessings from the Lord. Instead of envying them and being jealous, pray that God will bless them even more. As you bless them, ask the Lord to bless you too

<strong>Genesis 30:1, "...Give me a child, or else I die"</strong>. What a tragedy to look to someone to perfect you instead of going back to the One who made you. Rachel made a big mistake by thinking that it might have been Jacob's fault that she wasn't having children and this was Jacob’s response, "<strong>Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb</strong>?” only God can do what no man can do, He made us and He will fulfill His will in our lives as we trust Him and not looking to others.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 23:5, “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-shepherd-sermon4.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6468" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-shepherd-sermon4.jpg?w=300" alt="The-Shepherd-sermon" width="277" height="190" /></a></strong>

Where there is good be sure evil will be present too. There is always the opposing side. Our Savior was opposed and rejected, we are not in anyway better than our Savior to escape them. We too will face opposition because a righteous man has enemies. He would not be like his Lord if did not face some of the things the Lord faced.

If we were without enemies we might fear that we were not the friends of God, for the friendship of the world is enmity to God.

Our blessed Savior is not intimidated by what is happening in the world, He still prepares the good unto His people and set’s it right in the presence of their enemies. We are not to be afraid to enjoy the abundant blessings He bestows upon us. <!--more--><strong>Romans 8:31, “What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?”</strong> <b>T</b><strong>he enemy may frustrate God’s plan in a believer’s life, but to abort the plan,</strong> he has no chance. He cannot hinder the work of God in our lives. This is the other reason we take to heart <strong>Romans 8:28, “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose</strong>”. What is meant for evil, God turns it for good for His glory. It may look like the enemy is in charge but take a close look and see the Divine Shepherd’s work in preparing all the good He has planned for you in the midst of all your enemies fighting against you. <strong>James 1:17, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning”</strong>

<strong>“…You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over”. </strong>The sign of the anointing is when you can take less and do much with it. This is where we constantly need the filling of the Holy Spirit in order to live a Spirit filled life. At the time of Salvation, the Lord gives us Holy Spirit as down payment, daily we seek the filling, the out pouring. Immersed in what we are filled with. “<em>May we live in the daily enjoyment of this blessing, receiving a fresh anointing for every day's duties. Every Christian is a priest, but he cannot execute the priestly office without unction, and hence we must go day by day to God the Holy Ghost, that we may have our heads anointed with oil</em>.”, Charles Spurgeon. We are completely dry and helpless without the anointing. “<em>In the East the people frequently anoint their visitors with some very fragrant perfume; and give them a cup or glass of some choice wine, which they are careful to fill till it runs over. The first was designed to show their love and respect; the latter to imply that while they remained there, they should have an abundance of everything. To something of this kind the psalmist probably alludes in this passage</em>.”, Samuel Burder

<strong>2Timothy 1:14, “That good thing which was committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us” </strong>which mostly are, "oil of gladness" and the "joy of the Holy Ghost.". What we have received, let us not only keep it to ourselves, may we trust God to touch other lives through what He has given to us. As John Trapp says, “<em>He had not only a fullness of abundance, but of redundancies. Those that have this happiness must carry their cup upright, and see that it overflows into their poor brethren's emptier vessels”</em>.  blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 23:4, “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-shepherd-sermon3.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6466" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-shepherd-sermon3.jpg?w=300" alt="The-Shepherd-sermon" width="256" height="195" /></a></strong>

This journey of life calls for nomadic type of people. Nomads are communities of people who move from one place to another, rather than settling permanently in one location. We talk about “<strong>walking with the Lord</strong>”, it calls us to be nomads because the Lord is not stagnant or stationed in one place, neither should we.

In this walk we constantly draw strength from Him. In this journey like the Psalmist, we may “<strong>walk through the valley of the shadow of death</strong>”. Mark that it does not say “walk in” but “walk through” that is, though you may be in peril of death, in the midst of danger, deep as a valley, dark as a shadow, and dreadful; though you are under the arrest of death, and have received the sentence of death within yourself, and have all the reason in the world to look upon yourself as a dying person yet you are at ease fearing no evil for He is with you right where you are. <!--more-->This is one of the greatest comfort a believer can have in the valley of the shadow of death as he goes through it. God spoke to Joshua after the death of Moses saying, <strong>“5 No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you., ...9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go”, Joshua 1:5,9. </strong>If you look at the life of Joshua, it was not a stagnant life, he would have his own experiences in the valley of the shadow of death, he needed God’s assurance.

<strong>The shadow may be the terror of the enemy by night, but Someone has said that when there is a shadow there must be light somewhere, </strong>Amen. The presence of the Lord (the light) is realized when shadow presents itself. That ought to be our comfort that we have enough proof of His presence. <strong>Psalm 94:19, “In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul”</strong>

God took away the sting of death when Christ died on the cross and resurrected. <strong>1Corinthians 15:54-55, "54...written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”55 “ O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?”, 1 John 5:12, “He who has the Son has life</strong>” even in the valley. This is not a temporary life for believers. Charles Spurgeon said, <i>“Nobody is afraid of a shadow, for a shadow cannot stop a man's pathway even for a moment. The shadow of a dog cannot bite; the shadow of a sword cannot kill; the shadow of death cannot destroy us.”</i>

<strong>“…Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me”.</strong> A great reminder of who is in charge; the one with the rod and staff in His hands. It may not look like it’s much to battle and bring victory. <strong>It is not the rod that matters, it is in whose hands it is in that matters</strong>. It is not the rod that delivered the Israelites from Egypt, it is God represented in that rod that did. They called it<strong>, “…the rod of God in his hand”, Exodus 4:20</strong>. Matthew Henry, “<em>The gospel is called the rod of Christ's strength (Ps. 110:2), and there is enough in that to comfort the saints when they come to die, and underneath them are the everlasting arms</em>.”

The Divine Shepherd is in control right even in the valley. He is everywhere, <strong>Psalm 139:1-12, “1 O LORD, You have searched me and known me. 2 You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought afar off. 3 You comprehend my path and my lying down, And are acquainted with all my ways.4 For there is not a word on my tongue, But behold, O LORD, You know it altogether. 5 You have hedged me behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me. 6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain it. 7 Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? 8 If I ascend into heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there. 9 If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, 10 Even there Your hand shall lead me, And Your right hand shall hold me. 11 If I say, “Surely the darkness shall fall on me,” Even the night shall be light about me; 12 Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You, But the night shines as the day; The darkness and the light are both alike to You</strong>”, where there is a shadow, be sure light is around the corner. blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 23:3, “He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name’s sake"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-shepherd-sermon2.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6464" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-shepherd-sermon2.jpg?w=300" alt="The-Shepherd-sermon" width="255" height="173" /></a></strong>

A believer has three stages of life, <b>Justification, Sanctification and Glorification. </b>Justification and Glorification are <strong>God does for us</strong>, Sanctification is what <strong>God does in us. </strong>Justification means being saved from the <strong>Penalty </strong>of sin, from the demands of the law (God’s wrath). While sanctification is being saved from the <strong>Power</strong> of sin. Glorification is being saved from the <strong>Presence </strong>of sin.
Believers are currently in the stage of sanctification (purification), where God is working in us. It’s the pruning process and the <b>Jeremiah 18</b> experience in the potter’s house.<!--more-->

Sanctification level sometimes calls for restoration. The bible says, whom the Lord loves, He corrects, <b>Proverbs 3:12, Hebrews 12:6.</b> He corrects the one who goes astray because He loves Him. If you are a parent and you discipline your children for what they have done wrong, it is not an indication that you hate them. You love them to want to restore value, dignity, respect etc., that is what restores is all about. <strong>Psalm 23:3, “He restores my soul; …</strong>” <b>Restoration is t</b><strong>o bring back to a former, original, or normal condition.</strong> Sometimes you will go through dry periods, change of things, if you belong to Him, He will restore you because He loves you. Restoration may be painful but vital. <strong>Isaiah 40:29-31, “29 He gives power to the weak, And to those who have no might He increases strength. 30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, And the young men shall utterly fall, 31 But those who wait on the LORD Shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint”</strong>.

No creature will lose itself sooner than a sheep, easy for it to go astray and loose its way back. The best saints are sensible of their proneness to go astray like lost sheep (<b>Psalm 119:176</b>); they miss their way, and turn aside into by-paths; but when God shows them their error, gives them repentance, and brings them back to their duty again, He restores their soul. If He does not do so, they would wander endlessly and be undone. In <strong>Jeremiah 18:4</strong>, says, “<strong>And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make</strong>.” We sometimes get marred in the hands of the Potter, broken, we lose direction, focus, and effectiveness. The potter cannot be blamed for the injury. Here is the part I love, <strong>“…so he made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make</strong>.” The Potter did not throw away the marred clay, He restored the clay to what He had in mind; a vessel. And no one makes a vessel if he has nothing to put in it. This is the reason none of us are in this world by accident regardless of how we may have been conceived. The Lord is not intimidated with the scars of the clay. <strong>He knows that the difference between what it is and what it shall be is His hands</strong>. Only He can bring it back. He recovers you when you are sick, and revives you when you faint, and restores your soul which is ready to depart. Many are the times we should have fainted but we did not because we believed; and it was the good Shepherd that kept us from fainting.

<strong>“…He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name’s sake”,</strong> what is the purpose of restoration? To keep us walking the sanctified life for His glory. It is more than feel good; it is about living to honor His name, the desire and strength to live that life all comes from Him. Our prayer ought to be, “Lord we want to be vessels of honor, living and representing You as Your ambassadors in this world. Lead us in the path of righteousness, the righteousness we desperately need and the righteousness the world desperately needs for Your glory and honor”. “<i>For His name's sake. Seeing He hath taken upon Him the name of a "Good Shepherd”, He will discharge His part, whatever His sheep be. It is not their being bad sheep that can make Him leave being a "Good Shepherd", but He will be "good", and maintain the credit of "His name" in spite of all their badness; and though no benefit come to them of it, yet there shall glory accrue to Him by it, and "His name" shall nevertheless be magnified and extolled.</i>” Sir Richard Baker. blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 23:2, “He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-shepherd-sermon1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6461" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-shepherd-sermon1.jpg?w=300" alt="The-Shepherd-sermon" width="234" height="234" /></a></strong>

We take comfort in knowing that as believers we are cared for. Even in those times when it seems all hell is breaking loose, we <strong>“being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;” Philippians 1:6
</strong> We see this clearly stated in the 2nd verse of <strong>Psalm 23, “He makes me to lie down in green pastures;…</strong>” Remember the Israelites had what they needed right in the desert where nothing grows. God provided for them, God sustained them. We have the supports and comforts of this life from God's good hand, our daily bread from Him as our Father. Of course there is more to it than our physical needs. If anything, His daily Word ought to be the green pasture we should focus on, to feed on and to rest on His promises.<!--more-->

A section of the Lord’s prayer reads, “<strong>give us this day our daily bread</strong>”, this is in line with God’s provision, and what better provision would we desire primarily but His word. Everything else ties to the priority of His Word. We love fresh produce, they have nutrients, satisfying, appetizing, good to look at etc., I pray that God’s Word will be all these to us. God's ordinances are the green pastures in which food is provided for all believers; the word of life is the nourishment of the new man. It is milk for babes, pasture for sheep, never barren, never eaten bare, never parched, but always a green pasture for faith to feed in. God makes his saints to lie down; He gives them quiet and contentment in their own minds, whatever their lot is; their souls dwell at ease in Him, and that makes every pasture green. God’s grace is sufficient, in other words, it is more than enough (green). God’s mercies are ever new every morning, (ever fresh).

<strong>“…He leads me beside the still waters”, </strong>notice that the Divine Shepherd does not order or give instructions and let the sheep decide, no, He leads. He is a head guiding His sheep in the right place at the right time. Matthew Henry says, “<em>Those that feed on God's goodness must follow His direction; He leads them by His providence, by His word, by His Spirit, disposes of their affairs for the best, according to His counsel, disposes their affections and actions according to His command, directs their eye, their way, and their heart, into his love</em>”. He does not lead us in the path of hurricane, flood or anything that brings about destruction, He leads us by still waters for He is gentle and meek. Matthew Henry, <em>“The consolations of God, the joys of the Holy Ghost, are these still waters, by which the saints are led, streams which flow from the fountain of living waters and make glad the city of our God. God leads His people, not to the standing waters which corrupt and gather filth, not to the troubled sea, nor to the rapid rolling floods, but to the silent purling waters; for the still but running waters agree best with those spirits that flow out towards God and yet do it silently”</em> Those who are His sheep He will make and Lead them for they are humble and in submission to Him. They totally trust and depend on Him for everything they need<strong>. Psalm 34, “1 Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good; Blessed is the man who trusts in Him!" Vs. "9 Oh, fear the LORD, you His saints! There is no want to those who fear Him. 10 The young lions lack and suffer hunger; But those who seek the LORD shall not lack any good thing", Psalm 46:1, "God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble”, </strong>Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

<b>Psalm 23</b> is one of the most quoted Psalm especially in difficult times. Many of David's psalms are full of complaints, but this is full of comforts, and the expressions of delight in God's great goodness and dependence upon Him. In this Psalm, David pictures the Lord not as a doctor or lawyer or employer, he pictures the Lord as a Shepherd, something he was once. He draws from his experience in tending to the sheep where he would do anything for his sheep and in this reality trusting the Lord to be to him what he was to his sheep, a shepherd.<!--more-->

A shepherd is a person who tends, feeds or guards flocks of sheep. A shepherd deals with a lot if you think about it. As you can see, he tends to the sheep, he feeds, he guards, he protects, he inspects, he knows if there is something wrong with his sheep, he is loving, caring, faithful, hardworking, skillful. If one is missing, he leaves the rest to look for the missing one. Other occupations if I may say may have limitations of what they can and cannot do, a shepherd is a well-rounded job.

If the Lord was to be David’s shepherd, that would default David to be a sheep. For the sake of the Lord, I would take this position every day of the week and twice on Sunday.  Sheep cannot take care of themselves, they need a shepherd so do we. I do not know how people can live their lives without a shepherd. King David needed one, what about us? He who has a shepherd shall not be in want because the shepherd provides what He needs. Which sheep do you see worried when the shepherd is present? Yet sometimes we worry and live in fear as though we have no Shepherd.

Jesus calls Himself the good shepherd. I highlight 4 areas He mentions in <b>John 10</b> that makes Him stand tall and unique above all. 1.He is the door of the sheep, <strong>John 10:7, “Then Jesus said to them again, “Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. </strong>2. He gives life for His sheep<strong>, John 10:11, “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.” </strong>3. He knows His sheep and He teaches them to know Him, <strong>John 10:3, "the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. Vs. 14, “I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep, and am known by My own". </strong>4. He gives His life to His sheep, <strong>John 10:15, "As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep".</strong>

From very comfortable promises in this Psalm, David draws three very comfortable conclusions, and teaches us to do so too. 1. We are saved by hope, and that hope will not make us ashamed, because it is well grounded. 2. It is the duty of Christians to encourage themselves in the Lord their God; and 3.We are here directed to take that encouragement both from the relation wherein He stands to us and from the experience we have had of His goodness according to that relation.

The Lord is to us what no man can ever be to us, the Divine Good Shepherd. blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 23:6, “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days of my life; And I will dwell in the house of the LORD Forever” </strong>

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-shepherd-sermon6.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6471" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-shepherd-sermon6.jpg?w=300" alt="Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. Psalm 23:6 KJV" width="300" height="200" /></a>

Anyone can start a journey, it matters a lot how you finish. I notice the way David begins strong and finishes strong. We see his hopes rise, and his faith is strengthened, by being exercised. Observe what he promises himself, “goodness and mercy”.

All the streams of mercy flowing from the fountain, pardoning mercy, protecting mercy, sustaining mercy, supplying mercy will follow him as he lives in obedience according to the One who has called him. He knows his total dependency is on God of host. There is nothing he can do of himself but trust and obey.<!--more-->

In talking about goodness, I find this hymn "<em>Trust and obey" </em>beautifully fitting with what David encourages us with.<em> “When we walk with the Lord in the light of His word, what a glory He sheds on our way! While we do His good will, He abides with us still, and with all who will trust and obey. Chorus, Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey</em>”, You trust and obey, goodness and mercy shall follow you. At our 2010 leadership retreat, my pastor Gregg  Johnson shared something powerful, he said, “God leads, we obey, He supplies”(paraphrased)”, not the other way round.

Goodness supplies our needs, and mercy blots out our sins.<strong> Exodus 33:19, “And the LORD said, "I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion". Psalm 33:5, “He loves righteousness and justice; The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD”, Romans 2:4, “…knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?”</strong>

<strong>“….And I will dwell in the house of the LORD Forever</strong>”. In his conclusion, he talks about dwelling in the house of the Lord. This means not stopping by or passing by but rather living in the house of the Lord. It even has a deeper meaning, it is dwelling IN the Lord. We are housed in the Lord everywhere we go. He is the foundation and the builder on His foundation, we dwell in what He has built. Listen to David in<strong> Psalm 84:1-12, “1 How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD Almighty! 2 My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. 3 Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young a place near your altar, O LORD Almighty, my King and my God. 4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you. 5 Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on pilgrimage. 6 As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools. 7 They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion. 8 Hear my prayer, O LORD God Almighty; listen to me, O God of Jacob. 9 Look upon our shield, O God; look with favor on your anointed one. 10 Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked. 11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless. 12 O LORD Almighty, blessed is the man who trusts in you”.</strong> In the Divine Shepherd we trust, He is all we need, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. Luke 8:20 Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.” Luke 8:21 He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice.” (Luke 8:19-21</strong>

Isn’t it interesting that you can grow up with your family members, but in the long run some of our friends are closer to us in relationship than our own family? In the church world this would be labeled as a having a kindred spirit.<!--more--> This is where you and your friend (perhaps your best friend) seem to be so closely connected, you trust one another deeply there for one another faithfully and sacrificially, that it supersedes your relationship to your family. It’s been said that blood is thicker than water. This is to say that family relationship is to be a stronger than a friendship one because of the family bloodline. Perhaps this saying was made up by someone that saw the closeness of two friends as being greater than the closeness of one of their family members and them, this statement was born out of jealousy. Even though the saying blood is thicker than water is believed by many, perhaps spirit is thicker than blood, or better yet the blood and spirit of Jesus is thicker than anything.

Jesus’ mother Mary came to see Him along with His brothers. Jesus was inside ministering or at least being with people. There was enough of a crowd gathered there to keep His family from getting near to Him. Upon hearing that His own mother that gave birth to Him, and nurtured Him growing up, and His own brothers that He had grown up with desired to see Him, He answers to the surprise of many with unexpected words. Knowing His family came to see Him, Jesus says “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice.” Now talk about throwing someone off. Jesus seems to make no exception to have His family members outside come to see Him, and He rolls no red carpet out to them. On the contrary if there had been a “red carpet” it appears that He would pull it away. By the very statement given to Jesus, one would expect a much different response, especially in a society where honoring your father and mother was highly esteemed. Yet Jesus gave no more honor to His mom and brothers than the rest of humanity. As blessed as Mary was for being chosen by God to be the mother of Christ, she and His brothers were to submit to the family as Jesus defined it, as He said <strong>“My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice</strong>.” “Jesus says that the way to be close to him-even as close as His own family-is through being receptive to ("hearing") God's word and then doing it. Hours of praying and reading the Bible will not bring disobedient Christians as close to the Lord as doing His truth brings even the simplest believer (EBC).”

Later on in the book of Luke, a woman in the crowd called out, “Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.” He replied, “<strong>Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it (Luke 11:27-28</strong>).” He is looking for obedience to define His family. This is really nothing new as Jesus is consistent even from His boyhood. Remember at the age twelve Mary and Joseph accidentally left Jesus in Jerusalem, and upon their return being very anxious, His mother said to him, “<strong>Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.” Why were you searching for me?” He asked. “Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house (NIV), [“…dealing with the things of my father” - the message Bible] (Luke 2:48-49)?”</strong> Later Luke shows the place family must take in the life of one who desires to be Jesus' disciple (14:25-26). Jesus states, “<strong>If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters-yes, even his own life-he cannot be my disciple.”</strong> He is to be at the top of your “love list” shown through obedience. Even Jesus’ half-brother James who did not believe until after Jesus’ death stated, “<strong>But be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves</strong>.” James 1:22, He too recognized that those who call themselves followers of Christ must manifest the words through their obedience to His Words. Apart from obedience growing up in a Christian home, going to church, and practicing spiritual disciplines can never outweigh the simplicity of obedience, which is what He wants from His Church, His Body, and His bride.

<strong>Application: If you were placed on trial for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you? Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 15:22-23, "22 But Samuel replied: “Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. 23 For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry”</strong>

In <strong>Luke 6:46</strong>, Jesus asks this question, “<strong>Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?</strong> He is trying to show some common sense in this passage. <!--more-->He asks in the first part of his question, “W<b>hy do you call me Lord,</b>” of your life and yet you don’t obey me as Lord? Doesn’t Lord have some clout to it, showing a place of supreme importance? In Hebrew the word Lord means “supreme in authority, controller, (as respectful title) God, Lord, master, sir". Seeing this definition gives credence to his question. Think of a building land lord. He is the lord of that land. If the land lord says you can live here or you can’t live here, they are the lord of the land (building) and therefore their word goes. In the second aspect of His question notice he doesn’t say “You don’t hear the things I say,” but rather you “…do not do what I say.” The Message Bible says it like this, “Why are you so polite with me, always saying ‘Yes, sir,’ and ‘That’s right, sir,’ but never doing a thing I tell you?” Jesus is trying to show the inconsistency that He sees, with calling the person in charge, Jesus, Lord, yet disobeying His will. You can’t call Jesus Christ Lord and yet still live completely contrary to His Word. If you do, it only proves that He is not really your Lord.

<b>Matthew 7:6-8</b> illustrates this beautifully as Jesus says, He replied, <strong>“Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: “These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.’</strong> <strong>You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.” </strong>Notice the words near and far. These people Jesus is speaking of had lips that were near calling Him Lord, yet their heart of obedience was far from His heart and will. Jesus doesn’t want mere lip service, but a surrendered heart service.<b> The position of your heart, near or far, will determine the position of your obedience.</b>

Hear the words of doctor Luke as he wrote Jesus’ analogy on the wise and foolish builders. <b>Luke 6:47-49</b> reads, “<strong>I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice. He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete</strong>.”

Jesus is showing that there is no way your life is going to crash by the weather patterns of life when you are obedient to His word, but the disobedient life will have a complete collapse and total destruction. The testing ground will determine if the kind of person you profess to be, an obedience follower, is what you really are.

Consider the words of the Apostle Paul, In <b>1Corinthians 1</b>3 known as the “love chapter.” “<strong>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.”</strong> I personally don’t promote this movie however a friend of mine used to utter these words from the movie Billy Madison when he said, “I see your lips moving but I can’t hear your words.” Jesus sees many lips moving but He wants those moving lips to translate into obedient words shown by a tested life which displays faithful obedience to the Lord.

<strong>Application: Do you call Him Lord, and if so where is you obedience? Where is your heart today near or far? Read Psalm 139:24 – 25, </strong>Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 15:22-23, “But Samuel replied: “Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. 1Samuel 15:23 For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry”</strong>

TV preachers, videos, magazines, radio, books, seminars, conventions, websites, and local church preachers all give us information. As a matter of fact we are in an age where information is in abundance. There are so many avenues by which we can “hear” information.<!--more--> And when it comes to hearing godly things this too is not scarce. However, despite all of this hearing, how much of it do we actually apply to our lives? Jesus made a definite distinction between hearing and listening or better yet obeying. I once heard it said, hearing is what we do with our ears, listening is what we do between them. Jesus gives an analogy of two lives. In <strong>Matthew 7:24-27</strong> 24 He says, “<strong>Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.” </strong>

He stressed that life issues will beat our lives. There are many issues such as relationships, family, finances, employment, and health, to name a few. And like weather patterns, the floods, rains, and winds of life will attack our lives without favoritism. It’s interesting that Jesus likened the two houses to two lives, both of which had heard His everlasting words yet only one of the houses remains intact after the storms of life hit. And it was only the house that stood the test of time that Jesus commended. In fact He called this house the wise man. Why, because this was the one that applied or obeyed His words and did more than simply hear His words. Jesus gives no second place, no silver medal to the life of a mere hearer, or to say plainly the disobedient life. 

Hearing is the starting place, but listening is running to the finishing line! Jesus was illustrating that you are either convinced by the Spirit of God of my teaching and it becomes the very foundation of rock to sustain your life or you truly are in doubt because although you hear, you show outwardly by the failure to apply my Words to your life. That you chose to build your life as a sandcastle rather than a strong tower. This life Jesus called a foolish one. You see Jesus was never at a loss for crowds, but He wasn’t after crowds for the sake of just having a crowd. He gathered crowds from the beginning of His earthly ministry all the way to His crucifixion and beyond, no, He desired the crowd to become obedient followers of Him. If there is an area that needs improvement in our Christian lives it surely this whole issue of obedience. Now who among us can say that we display perfect obedience? I imagine that no one would raise their hand to proclaim their perfection based on their actions. Yet this is precisely what Jesus is and has been calling for, obedience. There is a clear distinction, either your house is built on the rock or on the sand. Even a child can kick over a sandcastle, no matter how ornate the builder may have made it. God only builds with rock. People will either have their lives built on the shifting sands of this world, by only hearing and thus failing to apply the words of Christ, or they will know that God is the builder of their house because they apply His words to their lives<strong>. Psalm 127:1 reads, “Unless the LORD builds the house, its builder’s labor in vain</strong>.” In speaking of the faith of Abraham <strong>Hebrew 11:10</strong> states, “<strong>For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</strong>” God builds on obedience, for then our lives are pliable for Him to make, mold, and build us in the way He knows best. He is the diving carpenter; will His hands find an obedient and humble life or a prideful and foolish one?

<strong>Application: In what area do you find it most difficult to obey God and why? What are you going to do about it? Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 12:1-7, “Then Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. 3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which should betray him, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying has she kept this. For the poor always you have with you; but me you have not always”</strong>

Jesus was getting closer toward the end when he would go to the cross. The relationships he made during his time would now begin to show their true colors, and some would be as precious oil, while others would be as abrasive sandpaper.<!--more-->

In this passage fiver names, which represent four relationships are mentioned which are Lazarus, Martha, Mary and Judas. How did each relationship form, and where is the relationship at this point leading up to His final days, as oil or sandpaper?

Fist, <strong>Lazarus</strong> we know was the man that Jesus loved and raised from the dead. Lazarus had been in a tomb. All his dreams, goals, aspirations, and relationship were dead with him. He was wrapped up like a Christmas present, but he didn’t look pretty. He was in this tomb four days which was significant because after three days all hope of resuscitation from a coma would be abandoned; and in the hot Palestinian climate, decay would have begun. Jesus said to a worrying Martha that was helpless with her abilities in this situation, “Your brother will rise again.” Misunderstanding Him, she thought on the Pharisaic belief in an ultimate resurrection for the just (Acts 23:7). However Jesus walked up to the tomb, called for the stone to be removed and cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come forth.” The words of Jesus cut through the icy grip of death like a white-hot blade through soft powdered snow. Death’s stinger is removed, and its grip relinquished as Lazarus walked out of tomb, alive again. Now here he is sitting with Jesus the one that gave him back his life, restored his dreams, and his relationships. He was closely following the one that saved his life. I believe that he is being like oil to Jesus by being with him. How closely are you following the Lord that called you from death unto life?

Secondly, <strong>Martha</strong> was serving doing what she is known for. In times past when Jesus had been to Martha’s home, she ran around doing for Jesus stuff, but never stopped to just spend time with Jesus. When Mary sat with Jesus he said that Mary had chosen the better. It seems at this time that not much had changed. She was still a busybody for Jesus, and even though I’m sure Jesus appreciated her efforts on one hand, He had wanted her to sit and be with Him. I believe she acted as a little oil to Christ, as she was still serving him, but she could have been more like soothing oil if she would slow down and just be with him. Are you so busy for Jesus that you never slow down just to be with Jesus? If the Devil can’t tempt us to sin, he can just keep us busy instead. Where is your level of busyness at verses your level of intimacy with Christ?

<strong>Application: Are you more like Lazarus being with Christ or more like Martha busy for Christ? Make the change today that needs to be made. Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 42: 1-7, “I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy. I pour out my complaint before him; before him I tell my trouble. When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who know my way. In the path where I walk men have hidden a snare for me. Look to my right and see; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life. I cry to you, O LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living." Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me"</strong>

Here is David, alone, tired, exhausted, confused, on the run and alone in a cave (before the 400 men gathered to him). <!--more-->He had taken his food from the fields, slept on trees, hid in ditches, and crawled through mud as he ran. For days he ran. Here he was filthy, and lonely. Perhaps the mothers had told their children that they should behave or else they would end up like the town drunk. Now kids were being told to be good or else they would end up like the giant killer, David. David was misunderstood by others. This cave was now his castle.

<strong>I. Lament (heart cry) of the individual (verses 1 -2). </strong>David unreservedly cries out with full emotion ALOUD to the Lord. Hey if people can scream over their sport’s team we should be able to cry out LOUD to our King. He called out for mercy which is not getting what we do deserve. I deserved Hell because I broke God’s Law, but I didn’t get Hell, I got Heaven instead, thank God! He pours out his complaint to the Lord, not just simply throwing up a whimsical prayer. His spirit was growing faint (beyond tiredness). These phrases illustrate the tension between anguish of soul and dependence on the Lord. Have you ever felt so broken and cried out to the Lord? This is the prayer of a broken man.

<strong>II. Loneliness in Suffering (142:3-7a)</strong> My spirit grows faint. His adversary and his prayers had brought David to the place of total exhaustion. He shares that it is the Lord alone that knows his way (life). He shares that men have hidden a snare for me, people were after David for no good reason! No one is concerned for me, no one cares about my life he thought. I have no refuge, there are no places of rest for me. No one cared for my life, I am all alone in this thing. He feels even the Lord is not at his "right" hand. The "right" signifies the place where one's witness or legal counsel stood. He had no one to defend him against his adversaries, and his words could not penetrate the hatred in Saul’s heart toward him. He says of the Lord "<strong>You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living</strong>." God became his refuge, his safe haven, his only protection. Only the Lord could rescue David at this point. This is the prayer of a desperate man.

<strong>IV. Public Thanksgiving (142:7b)</strong> David moves from despair to thanksgiving believing this feels like the end, but it’s not over for me. I am not going to stay in this cave of "Death Valley" I will have the righteous community to crowd around me and listen to my thanksgiving for the great acts of God's deliverance. This is the prayer of a broken, desperate man that can hope in the Lord and have his heart brought to a place of thanksgiving.

<strong>Application:</strong> Will you turn away from God or to God during you lowest times? Will you move from despair to thanks no matter how alone and broken you are? Can you hope in the Lord as your refuge, and give up and decide to live in "Death Valley?!?!". Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 25:2-42, "Then David said to Abigail: "Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself"</strong>

As we have seen already, God knew this virtuous woman’s her dilemma and would not leave her in it forever.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 39, "...And David sent and proposed to Abigail, to take her as his wife...vs. 42, ...she followed the messengers of David, and became his wife". </strong>This is what we would call, "<strong>double for your trouble</strong>". In her life, she was more than building her life. Everything she did, she had other people in mind. Selfishness was not in her vocabulary. Ambitious drive to build a name for herself was far from her mind. She lived according to what her name means “Father rejoices” only through God’s help. God watches motives and the intents of the heart.

And now we see Abigail who comes from being a wife of a junkie to being a wife of the next king, double for trouble. God did not have a problem establishing her and taking her to new levels but also look at how David was now blessed with a virtuous woman, intelligent woman, decisive, hardworking, respectful, patient and one cares for other people's needs. Listen to a king talking about a virtuous woman in<strong> Proverbs 31:10, "Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies. 11, "The heart of her husband safely trusts her; So he will have no lack of gain". 12, "She does him good and not evil All the days of her life". </strong>As you remember we said Abigail means Father rejoices, can we say her heavenly Father rejoiced over her? <strong>Proverbs 31:25, " Strength and honor are her clothing</strong>; <strong>She shall rejoice in time to come</strong>. <strong>26, "She opens her mouth with wisdom, And on her tongue is the law of kindness". </strong>Abigail rejoiced in the time when it came for God to establish her in due time. Here is the final piece of that<strong> Proverbs 31, 29"Many daughters have done well, But you excel them all." 30, "Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised. 31, "Give her of the fruit of her hands, And let her own works praise her in the gates". </strong>David praised her, God established her and her story is still touching lives.

My prayer is, God raises Abigail’s of today who will shine brighter in tough times. Abigail’s who learn they are blessed will in spite of. To know that character goes a long way. To be reminded that heavenly Father rejoices over them because they are faithful at all times. That they will trust God to establish them and maintain their qualities and values in every season. One sided beauty is not enough. Many have the outer beauty but missing the inner beauty. Trials will either refine or break you. Proverbs 31 defines what a virtuous woman is, it sets a standard that all women should strive for but remember, "<strong>Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised". </strong>Abigail, blessed are you. Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 25:2-42, "Then David said to Abigail: "Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself"</strong>

It’s interesting to note that God used this woman at a time she needed help the most. Have you realized how sometimes the Lord sends people your way who need your encouragement at the time you are very discouraged and need encouragement yourself? <!--more-->That when you have almost nothing, He sends someone not to add but for you give away the little you have. That when you need your spouse the most, it may turn out that they need you the most.

<strong>1Samuel 25:32, "Then David said to Abigail: "Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself"</strong>. David believed God sent her to him so he blessed the Lord, blessed her advice and called her blessed. She may have never been called "a blessed woman" or she may have never seen herself as blessed. Question, how can she be called blessed when her current situation does not suggest any blessings? simple, <strong>she is not blessed when she has it all together</strong>, <strong>she is blessed because she is in God’s will demonstrated in her character</strong>. She is better than her current situation but doesn't act like she is. Just as she knows there are things that only God can fight for a person, she knows she is in the right hand. You may be facing challenges like Abigail and may even have an opportunity to do your spouse evil, this is the time to shine even more brighter in the midst of darkness. Defend, bless and pray for your companion, God is in control. He knows where you are and where you are going. Be faithful to your covenant and trust God with the rest. Along those lines, think about a difficult person you've worked with or a boss who frustrated you, instead of praying evil would befall them, let your light shine. Instead of trying to do things to make them quit, leave them in the hands of God.

I have come to learn that there are times you don't need to fight for yourself, God will. I see this strengthened in <strong>2Chronicles 20:20, "...believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be established...". </strong>The word establish means, to bring about, to place or settle in a secure position and condition. It also means to be recognized and accepted. God establishes His people by fulfilling all these in their lives. You will agree with me of the times God fought for you when you couldn't fight for yourself.

<strong>1Samuel 25:35, "So David received from her hand what she had brought to him, and said to her, "Go in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your voice and respected your person</strong>". Abigail has had an experience of a life time, found favor before David, gave good advice, called blessed but where is she going? back to her evil husband. Even David knows she is better than this but what he has spoken in her life, God will not leave her in the same condition for long. Back home as a good wife, she waited for the right time when Nabal was sober to share what she had done and how God through her had spared her household. With wisdom, one of her qualities, she gives her testimony of doing the right thing. <strong>Instead of Nabal rejoicing over what God had done, his heart died over what he lost</strong>. <strong>vs. 38, "Then it happened, after about ten days, that the Lord struck Nabal, and he died"</strong>. No one was seeking harm on Nabal or get rid of him. His destiny was in God’s hands. God gave him several chances to see His goodness through David and Abigail but his attitude clouded his way. God is gracious, slow to anger. God fought for Abigail and David within days. Don't be frustrated because God is not doing what you want Him to do or He is not doing it fast enough, <strong>He can either change the situation making it well by getting rid of old man (Nabal) spirit within and raise the spirit of David, a man after God’s heart may rise</strong>. He may also move something or someone and establish you without your help. All He requires is for you to be faithful till the end (not talking about faithfulness where there is abuse). <strong>The blessings is on faithfulness</strong>. God is more than able to accomplish what concerns us today, how He will do it? We don’t know, that is not for us to figure out, we just have to trust God who is in control. Our cares are in His ABLE hands. If no one calls you blessed, call yourself blessed right where you are. blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 25:2-42, "Then David said to Abigail: "Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself"</strong>

What do you do when someone else mistakes is destined to affect you? Should you sit and wait for it or do something when there is still an opportunity? I’ve learned as I hope you too have learned, It's not over until it's over. <!--more-->When Abigail heard from one of the servants of how Nabal her husband treated David and his men and perishing awaited them, she knew it's was not over until it's over. She made good food, sent it ahead of her while coming behind to plead her case (response and words) to David. She is teaching us something that no matter how tough situation are and no matter what judgment has been passed, before it becomes effective, there is still an opportunity to do something, intercede. If the door is still open, you have an opportunity to walk through it. Esther risked her life to go to the king though she understood that she could perish. For the sake of her people, she said I will go, if I perish, let me perish but at least I made a move. Abigail was not too quick to throw in the towel, what a quality.

<strong>vs. 23, "Now when Abigail saw David, she dismounted quickly from the donkey, fell on her face before David, and bowed down to the ground",</strong> I wonder how some women would have handled themselves, some would have started a quarrel, yelling abuses, screaming, call him names but we see humility in her part. <strong>vs. 24, "So she fell at his feet and said: "On me, my lord, on me let this iniquity be...Please, let not my lord regard this scoundrel Nabal</strong>". She had a chance to smear her husband because of who he is. She had done nothing wrong yet willing to take the blame for the sake of her household. She had every stone in her hands to throw at her husband, she chose to throw none. She says, "It's me who has sinned but don't hold anything against him for that is his nature". She is not seeking opportunities to leave him but seeking opportunities to protect him. She has a chance to do him evil, her character shines beyond that. <strong>Trials reveal your true character</strong>. How many would look for reasons to leave their spouses during trials? One Christian woman told me how she wished her husband would cheat on her so that she can have a reason to divorce him because they were in a trial.

This is what Paul says in <strong>1Corinthians 7:13&amp;14, "And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife</strong>," if you are already married to the unsaved, you never know your act of kindness could one day be a reason for him to be saved<strong>.</strong> To add to it, who knows if it were not for your presence in his life, his condition could be worse than the current. He has a covering because you are there. You may not see it but God does. Abigail was willing to sanctify for the sake of her household even if it meant not having her way but the Lord knew she was better than what she was dealing with at home with her husband.

<strong>Read Vs. 25-31 </strong>and see her reasoning and advise<strong>, vs. 29, “ Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; and the lives of your enemies He shall sling out, as from the pocket of a sling”.</strong> Her advice stopped David from doing harm not just to her family but also to himself. Saul was pursuing David to kill him, and while David had opportunities to kill Saul, he left him in the hands of God. He knew he was next king but the timing was in God’s hands and anything stupid he would have done would be outside God’s will would only jeopardize his destiny. So if the Lord was handling all his enemies, could he not trust the Lord enough with Nabal's case? Instead of stepping in to get rid of Nabal, he lives him in the hands of God an advice Abigail gave him. She was also letting him know that his blessings were not coming through what he does with his hands but how obedient he is to God. David was being reminded that what the Lord has started, He will accomplish it without the enemy terminating it. I would say,<strong> behind every successful man, there is a virtuous woman encouraging him to do good, bringing out his strengths and qualities, and giving him godly advises because she desires for him to succeed</strong>. I found out that under pressure or anger, men are quick to retaliate, causing more harm or making a situation even worse. Thank God for our wives who calm us down. Through Abigail, God constrained David from killing Nabal because just like he had an opportunity to kill Saul, he respected his position instead. I think it's good at times to be reminded of what you stand for when overwhelming situations want you to do things that are contrary to your life style (character).

Is Abigail blessed? I believe she is from reading her story. She may not know or feel blessed but she is. I can picture God rejoicing, (the meaning of her name) over her daughter standing strong in the midst of situations that have destroyed other women and using her to save lives. You may be dealing with tough situations like Abigail and feeling crushed under the weight situations, can you pause for a second and draw strength to recognize you are blessed in spite of?

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 25:2-42, "Then David said to Abigail: "Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself"</strong>

A question often asked, "Why do bad things happen to good people?" (of course there is no one good by biblical definition). I have one of my own, "Why do some nice people find themselves in what I would call bad marriages?". <!--more-->Ever asked yourself that question? I have many times. A precious woman ending up with a very, I mean very wrong husband in my opinion or the other way round. This is my conviction, however bad someone is, there are certain people who have the grace to live and endure with them that no one else can. You couldn't take it because you don't have that kind of grace. Such people have been prepared for such people to take that responsibility. What could be your mess, by God's grace could be someone else’ blessing.

Look at these two women in the bible, Job's wife and Jezebel, King Ahab's wife. Job's wife under pressure gave Job wrong advice but he never took it, Jezebel who is an evil woman gave her husband a wrong advise and he headed to it. Let me talk about a different woman by the name of Abigail who also gave a good advice and that advice was taken by someone she wasn't married to at the time.

Abigail is one of those women in the bible who blesses my heart. About the whole chapter is dedicated to her story. First of all, <strong>Abigail means Father rejoices</strong>. Her name does not seem to be working in her favor but God knows her dilemma. We are told of her character in <strong>1Samuel 25:3, "...And she is a woman of good understanding and beautiful appearance</strong>". By reading her story, I gathered some of her qualities, she is a very intelligent woman, decisive, hardworking, respectful, patient and cares for people. She reminds me of what a virtuous woman as described in proverbs 31. She is married to a man by the name of Nabal who is harsh, evil, arrogant, stingy, lover of himself etc. I know that opposites attract but there is something wrong with this picture. How could a woman of all these qualities be married to a man like this? It seems that a lot of what she needs to know is not conveyed to her. She is not cherished as I gather from what I have read. Her qualities are left to go down the drain because she is not even appreciated for what she does. Her words, opinions, works are criticized by the person who should cherish them the most. How did she end up in a marriage like this? Who is she in this marriage? what is the purpose of her life? we will find out.

David and his men are in Carmel. A while back in Carmel, we are told that he and his man protected Nabal's life, his family, servants and all his properties. None of the things did they lose, now David is asking for a small favor from Nabal. He is not asking for reward, wealth, partnership in Nabal's business, all he desired of Nabal was hospitality which is denied to him. Nabal had so much that he forgot the men who helped him, he is asking who David is. <strong>vs. 11, "Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, to give it to men when I do not know where they are from?". </strong>The verse has a lot of "I" and "MY" to which means, he was taking all the credit for what had happened. <strong>Do not be full and forget who you are, where you came from, those who helped you, by what means things came about</strong>.<strong> Pride goes before a fall we know that</strong>. Nabal is really walking on thin ice, this will not only affect him but the people who are close to him. Nabal the rich man insulted David and his men and David was very angry and wroth that he rose with his four hundred men heading towards Nabal's territory to destroy him and all that belonged to him but then here comes Abigail.

I wanted to lay a ground work on who Abigail and Nabal are and then tomorrow I will share more on Abigail's qualities. Though her situation is tough and complicated, her beauty from within and outside is shining brighter and brighter as you will see. <strong>IT'S NOT WHAT YOU GO THROUGH THAT DEFINES YOU, IT'S WHO YOU ARE</strong>, what a virtuous woman. What you go through may refine you or break you, the choice is yours. She doesn't look blessed in her situation but she is blessed, check out what her name means and see her character. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 7:10-13, "10 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as the LORD commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 11 But Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers; so the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 12 For every man threw down his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods" </strong>

In the bible, we see God taking ordinary things to do extraordinary things to show that the power is not in the thing but on whose hands that things is in. And while he takes the ordinary and uses them extraordinarily, we see on the other hand we see the devil at work displaying his magic tricks. <!--more-->The enemy has power no doubt however, God is never intimidated or moved by the tricks of the enemy. The interesting thing is that when God does something, the devil tries to do the same or even top it and God may allow him to display what he can do, the ultimate outcome is what God will go to crash the head of the serpent the devil. God always tops it.

God demonstrated to Moses and Aaron that the rod that they had in their hands by God's command if thrown down would turn into a serpent. He then sends them to Egypt to perform that miracle. Of course God knew the Egyptian magicians and sorcerers who represent the devil here would also have the power to turn their rods into serpents. And when every man threw down their rod, they became serpents as the bible tells us. All sounded equal and God let the enemy feel good about his power for a second then something happened, Aaron's rod turned into a serpent which was God's ordained rod swallowed the magician and sorcerers rods turned into serpents. God had destined to harden Pharaoh’s heart that He would demonstrate His power before him.

What does this tell us, in the process of God demonstrating miracles in your life, don't be surprised to see the enemy try to top what God is doing. He will play his magical tricks and many of them may be scary and appear true but don't be intimidated by what the enemy does because not long after that, God's miracle will swallow the devils little magic tricks. His word says, "<strong>2 Chronicles 16:9, "For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself STRONG on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him</strong>". God showed himself strong on behalf of Moses and Aaron when He showed everyone who is GOD. <strong>1 John 4:4, "You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world"</strong>. <strong>Isaiah 59:19, "When the enemy comes in like a flood, The Spirit of the LORD will lift up a standard against him".</strong>

What is the devil demonstrating in your life right now that is scary and intimidating?, submit to God, resist the devil and he will flee. Cast the written word of God (2Chr 16:9, 1John4:4 and Isa 59:19) and see God’s word come alive in your situation then watch His word swallow everything the devil has demonstrated. <strong>Hebrews 4:12, “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart</strong>. <strong>Psalm 68:1, "Let God arise, Let His enemies be scattered". </strong>Christ paid the price, he defeated the enemy, He is in charge.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 18:46, "The Lord lives! Blessed be my rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted"</strong>

While most of the devotions I share pertains to preparation, knowing God’s truth and God’s ways which is crucial, I have been prompted to encourage those who feel wounded and left by the road side wondering where is God when you need Him. While I don’t desire for us to be consumed with the acts of God like the Israelites that went by feeling, I hope you are encouraged as these few devotions come to you as reminders.<!--more-->

In the verse above, we see David personalizing his relationship with the Lord. While this may be opened to abuse, I want us to look at it differently. Have you been in a huge crowd, or gone somewhere say a church where you felt you just did not belong? You wondered if anyone even took notice of your presence? I have, and in the midst of all these you wondered whether the Lord takes notice of you. Now I am not talking about taking notice of you because you deserve it, no, taking notice of you because you are His child?

David learnt the secret of personalizing God in every situation he found himself in and over and over we hear him say MY fortress, MY shield, MY comfort, MY salvation, MY horn, MY strength. Sounds selfish but not quite. When God looks at all His people, yes He does see people collectively but right in the midst of it, He can see you exactly where you are. He is concerned about your needs and problems as an individual. The bible says that He has curved us in the palm of His hands, He knows our down sitting and our uprising. He is familiar with our ways. <strong>Mathew 10:30, "But the very hairs in your head are all numbered</strong>", this sums up everything that God knows about us. I can't even tell when I lose a hair, He does. I can't even count them but He does and knows how many they are, <strong>He has numbered them</strong>. That is the God we serve, the God who knows everything about us from day one to the last day of our lives. He is the same God who has set up a destiny for each of us. Can you imagine someone who has already set up a place in history for you to fit in? From the day He thought about bring you into the world before anyone thought about it, He already set up a plan and a purpose for everyone not as a group but as individuals?

Because He knows us and we know Him, we can Join men like Paul, David, Job in saying “MY” , <strong>Philippians 4:19, "But MY God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus</strong>". <strong>Psalm 3:3, "For thou oh Lord are a shield for ME, the glory and the lifter of MY head</strong>". <strong>Psalm 46:1, "God is MY refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble</strong>". <strong>Job 19:25, "I know MY Redeemer lives</strong>",<strong> O Lord MY God, In You I put MY trust</strong>". <strong>Psalm 16:5, "O Lord, You are the portion of MY inheritance and MY cup; You maintain MY lot"</strong>. God is for us. Everything we need He has and the relationship we have with Him reminds that what He is to us, He is to someone else. He may be YOUR healer this morning because you need healing, to me, He may be MY peace because I need peace.

<strong>Psalm 46:18, "The Lord lives! Blessed be my rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted</strong>". I love the way this verse starts, <strong>"The Lord Lives (TLL</strong>)", this is powerful, God is not dead, I spoke with Him this morning. He cares, He has compassion, He has feelings. "<strong>Blessed be my rock", </strong>David might have been dealing with something that He did not require healing or joy or confidence. All he needed at this particular time was for God to be his rock, he therefore personalized it "<strong>MY ROCK</strong>". His rock could prevent wind from sweeping him, needed a place to hide and take refuge, the rock that crushes the enemy's head, the rock that cannot be moved or shaken. David needed all these so He called His Lord MY ROCK. What are you dealing with today that you will want the Lord to be for you? call on Him!!. David called him a blessed Rock knowing God is in control. <strong>"Let the God of MY salvation be exalted</strong>", meanwhile while He is to me what I am dealing with, Let Him be exalted. Who will exalt Him but the person in the situation. The bible says that if we don't praise Him, the rocks will cry out in our place. The rocks don't need Him. For David in return was to exalt the Lord, <strong>Psalm 34:1, "I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in MY mouth</strong>". Can you see that because He personalized the Lord in His situation, when it came to time of praise Him, He didn't have to wait for a crowd to show up to help Him praise Him, he did it himself. I conclude with M.Y. as an acronym for "<strong>ME, YOU (LORD)". LET HIM BE YOUR.... </strong>blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jonah 1:17, "Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights"</strong>

Not too long ago while doing some work on my laptop, as it does sometimes, it started acting up, doing weird things, freezing up. I tried to play around with it hoping that it would come back to life without shutting it down without successful. Had I not known that there was a button called RESET, I would have thrown the thing out the window because I would have concluded it was broken and there was nothing that could be done to bring it back to life.<!--more-->

In our Christian walk there are times when we face things that bring our lives to a freeze point, finding ourselves acting up weird. Not performing to the fullest like we should and instead of God throwing us out and saying we are broken, messed up and dead, He reaches out to us and hits reset button.

Jonah in this case committed sin, he disobeyed God like we all do. God sent him to preach to Nineveh, instead of responding to the call, he chose to go a different direction, Tarshish. He was not responding to the call God had for his life. While on the ship to Tarshish, first God interrupted Jonah’s plan. Later we read that he was thrown into the sea. Instead of the Lord letting him drown because of his foolishness, the bible says, "...<strong>the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah". </strong>Someone said, <strong>"in the midst of our foolishness, God still remains faithful"</strong>. I would take this and say, <strong>God has a way of resetting (repositioning) our lives even when we sin and make mistakes</strong>. You may feel for you married the wrong person for example and you may have received the right counsel not to go with that person but you chose to go against the wise counsel and go with your own desires. Should you throw that person out now? Of course not, all you need to know is that God can take what was wrong and reset it (forgiving you and giving you a new start). You may have made wrong business decision, wrong turn in life etc, whatever the case might be. God can reset you again if you are willing. It may require patience, prayers and faithfulness for it to happen. I love to hear that God's hand is on it rather than the devil's. In Jonah's case, God prepared a great fish. You might say, “that is still terrible”, well it may be but not compared to trying to swim in the sea not knowing what other sea creatures would do to him. I thank God that even though it may still seam bad, the truth of the matter is, it could be worse compared to what could be awaiting for me out there in the sea of life. With that thought in mind, it’s not so bad being in the belly of a great fish, it’s only for a season.

Here is what gets me about God resetting a life. In the process, what would consume others has no effect on you and that is because God's hand is on what He is resetting. Watch this, “<strong>And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights”, </strong>think about it, three days and three night and the fish could not digest Jonah why? Because it was God's prepared fish, a temporary learning chamber, a place of reset. It's was the work of God, a preparation chamber for greater things. Remember it was Jonah who messed up, it was Jonah who wanted to drown himself but it was God who looked at the life of Jonah and would have said something like this,<i>"though he messed up, and though he deserves to die, I will hit a reset button in his life for I am not done with him". He has not lived to the fullest of what I created him for, he has sinned but I Am the God of restoration".</i>

Are you like Jonah who has gone astray?, decided to be involved in what you now know you cannot back out of?, faced by different challenges and even tried to terminate your dreams and desires because you felt you messed things up so bad?, I am here to tell you, God can reset you again. You can be restored again like Jonah for His glory and Honor. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ruth 1:15-17, “15 And she said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” 16 But Ruth said: “ Entreat me not to leave you, Or to turn back from following after you; For wherever you go, I will go; And wherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people, And your God, my God. 17 Where you die, I will die, And there will I be buried. The LORD do so to me, and more also, If anything but death parts you and me.”</strong>

I find Ruth to represent a new believer or a believer who has been awakened to God’s call. Ruth was in no better situation to that of Naomi and Orpah, however, we see a different spirit in her. <!--more-->Her attitude towards life was not based on where she came from, or what happened to her, or even what her future held. Her attitude was based on the fact that she was getting to learn about this amazing Lord she had come to know through Naomi and she couldn’t wait to see where it all started. Naomi tried to discourage her to go back to her gods, to her people, go back to her old ways. Nothing could sway or discourage her to go back, if anything, Naomi a wounded woman of faith, needed another woman of faith. I have seen new believers who were vibrant in their walk with the Lord than some who have served for a while.

Ruth clave unto her; hung about her, would not part from her, but cleaved unto her in body and mind; forsaking her own people, and her father's house; neither the thought of them, nor of her native country, nor of not having an husband, or any likelihood of it, nor of poverty and distress, had any manner of influence upon her, but determined (resolved) she was to go and abide with her.

What drove Ruth to want to hang on at crossroads? from Naomi's character she concludes certainly that her great Nation was a wise and an understanding people. She judges them all by her good mother who wherever she went, was credit to her country (as all those should study to be who profess relation to the better country, that is, the heavenly), and therefore she will think herself happy if she may be reckoned one of them. <strong>Psalm 34:8, “Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good; Blessed is the man who trusts in Him”</strong>

Are you seeing the true picture of life of a Christian here who come to serve God because He is worthy and not because of what God can do for them? Jesus said , “Come Follow Me! Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, take my yoke upon you”. The call is to yoke yourselves to the sovereign will and purpose of Christ. Now, therefore His people are people that have heard His call, it's been a call from something, to something. It's been a call from self-will, from ruling one’s own life, from living to please one’s self to gratify one’s self. Living under the government and direction of one’s own whim and fancy, to an entirely new government; no longer I but thy, not my will but thy will be done. This is a life that has resolved to come and follow. This is a life of one who has come not for personal gain.

At crossroads, Ruth resolved to go wherever Naomi would go. She resolved to lodge wherever Naomi would lodge. She resolved that Naomi’s people will be her people; She resolved that Naomi’s God will be her God; she resolved that where Naomi would die, there shall she also die, and she resolved that where Naomi would be buried, there shall she also be buried. Now that is the kind of commitment the Lord is looking for from those whom He has called to follow Him. Jesus said in <strong>Luke 9:62, “… “No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”</strong>

<em>“A soul that is truly brought to Christ affectionately loves Him, and heartily cleaves unto him, resolves in the strength of divine grace to follow him, the Lamb, whithersoever he goes or directs; and is desirous to have communion with none but him, and that he also would not be as a wayfaring man, that tarries but a night; his people are the excellent of the earth, whom to converse with is all his delight and pleasure; and Christ's God is his God, and his Father is his Father: and, in a word, he determines to have no other Saviour but him, and to walk in all his commands and ordinances”</em> John Gill`

<strong>Romans 8:35-39,” 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 As it is written: “For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.”37 Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. 38 For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, 39 nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord”, </strong>At crossroads like Ruth, would we resolve <b>Romans 8:35-39?</b> Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ruth 1:11-13, “11 But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Are there still sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 12 Turn back, my daughters, go—for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons, 13 would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me!” </strong>

Naomi represents in my judgment wounded believers due to one or more tragedies and struggles in life wondering where is God in all these. As you read the story of Naomi, you come to learn that she was caught in between where she came from which reminded her of famine and where she was which reminded her of the loss of her husband and two sons.<!--more-->She had no husband to care and provide for her, and now no sons to do the same. No grandchildren, no one to carry the name of her husband and her children, no land to claim her own. A classic example of people who think they are forgotten by God .

In the midst of all these, she is left with two daughters in law who treated her kindly. Naomi showed them kindness which flowed from the out working of the internal, the God of her life. Though the daughters in law retained an affection for the gods of Moab (v. 15), Naomi was still faithful to the God of Israel, yet that was no hindrance to either side from love and kindness, and all the good offices that the relationship required. She had nothing to offer these two young women who had stuck by her side. Their husbands were dead, there was nothing to hold them together, they were free by law to either go back to their own mothers or remarry. They had a place to fall back on but not with Naomi. At crossroads she was about to lose another relationship forever, that of Orpah.

The greatest grievance of that poor condition to which she was reduced was that she was not in a capacity to do for them as she would have loved to, she says, “<strong>It grieves me more for your sakes than for my own that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me</strong>”. But she would have them first consider upon what terms, lest having set their hand to the plow, they should look back.

Would we say the Lord’s hand was against her? I wouldn’t say so unless I did not understand God’s providential will even in what appears to be a mess, tragic and painful. The Israelites rejoiced when God moved, however when there was a challenge ahead of them, they became paralyzed, wounded and lost, even thinking that God brought them out to destroy them. Nevertheless, there was something about Moses, he rejoiced in God’s ways. When you know the ways of someone especially trustworthy, faithful person and you expect them to come to your aid when you need them, if they don’t come as expected, you conclude there must be a good explanation behind the action. It’s not that they don’t care and are not coming through for you, it’s that there is something beyond what you know and think until he explains to you. There are things God allows that we have no clue what they are and even if He explained, we would not understand. When we know His ways, we take comfort knowing there is more to my pain. At the crossroad, I will have to decide to keep trusting that He is at work for something greater and grander for His glory with my life being a means by which He will use. Read David’s prayer in <strong>Psalm 25: ”4 Show me Your ways, O LORD; Teach me Your paths. 5 Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation; On You I wait all the day… 9 The humble He guides in justice, And the humble He teaches His way. 10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, To such as keep His covenant and His testimonies. 12 Who is the man that fears the LORD? Him shall He teach in the way He chooses. 13 He himself shall dwell in prosperity, And his descendants shall inherit the earth. 14 The secret of the LORD is with those who fear Him, And He will show them His covenant. 15 My eyes are ever toward the LORD, For He shall pluck my feet out of the net.. 21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for You...”. </strong>The story of Naomi and Ruth is a clear picture of God’s providential will far greater than their needs. God has a bigger picture, let us consider His ways. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

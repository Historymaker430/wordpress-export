              "<strong>Luke 15:25-32, “…&quot;The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, `Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!' `My son,' the father said, `you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”</strong>\n\nLook at the perspective, and attitude the older brother had, which is similar to the attitude most of the modern church has today. The late Bill Bright reports in his book “The Coming Revival” that 98% of Christians don’t try and actively reach the lost and only 2% of Christians are doing their job. <!--more-->\nThe rest are like the taxi cabs that drive around “off duty”. In NYC I see tons of yellow taxi cabs, taxiing people to various destinations. I can’t imagine if only 2% of the taxi cabs drove around on duty, while 98% of them had their sign light up reading “off duty.” That would be ludicrous because why would they be calling themselves taxi cab drivers if they never try and pick people up to taxi around? They might as well get another job.\n\nThe vast majority are driving around in the nice atmosphere of worship, prayer, and praise (each necessary and important), but neglecting the sober task God has given to us to seek and save the lost. Oswald J. Smith said, &quot;<em>Oh my friends we are loaded down with countless church activities, while the real work of the Church, that of evangelizing the world and winning the lost is almost entirely neglected</em>.“\n\nThe “faithful son” wasn’t concerned about his lost brother, but focused on himself. He was similar to the Pharisee who compared himself to the tax collector (Luke 18). The Pharisee and the older son shared the same spirit, and we see their attitude in the following: Both focused on themselves, compared themselves with the one they thought less of, and had no concern for the lost. The “lost” tax-collector was calling out to God, and the lost son came home to the father, yet neither of the two men cared about the lost. The prodigal’s dad had a heart for his lost son, and rejoiced when the lost now found. The father pleaded with his older son’s, tried to deal with his anger even persuading him to change his perspective, but the older son’s stubborn ways would not be moved. I can see that grieving the father’s heart, just as that attitude grieves Father God’s heart. Imagine if God were a Fire Chief and his firefighters were polishing their fire engine outside a burning building. If they were consumed with the truck’s beauty then they wouldn’t hear the cries of help from terrified people trapped at a top floor window. There's nothing wrong with cleaning their truck, but not while people are trapped in a burning building! What would the Fire Chief think and feel about his firefighter?.\n\nApplication: We are called to rescue people from a greater fire that is why <strong>Revelation 19:15</strong> reads, “<strong>If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire</strong>”. As a firefighter on God’s force, where is your focus?, on polishing your engine of worship, prayer, and praise, or running into the burning buildings with the full armor of God, especially the gospel boots of peace to seek and to save the lost? We are to preach the gospel only two times, “<strong>in season and out of season</strong>” As a Christian you are always to be “on duty,” concerned for the lost, showing the lost their need for the Savior so Heaven can be a constant party place, as all of heaven rejoices. Be a taxi cab driver that always is on duty to taxi people to Christ. Charles Spurgeon &quot;<em>Have you no wish for others to be saved? Then you are not saved yourself. Be sure of that.</em>&quot; Just imagine, being in heaven with all those you’ve shared the gospel with, and brought to Christ, both knowingly and unknowingly. There is going to be a major Party in heaven called the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, which I believe will be a culmination of all that have been called by God and been active, if they were able, in bringing people to Christ. Get busy and have attitude like the Father for the lost, you won’t want to miss out of Heaven’s Ultimate Party with the Captain of the Host! Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Exodus 31:6-11, “I have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have commanded you : the Tent of Meeting,the Ark of the Testimony with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent-.They are to make them just as I have commanded you” </strong>\n\nWhen God puts us on any task or assignment, He has already equipped/furnished us with ALL the necessary element or ingredients to complete/finish that particular task. <!--more-->\nNow our success depends to how best we use the same in order to accomplish the task…There are many Christians and Non-Christians who still grumble that they do not have any talent or ability or expertise. But the above verse says that He had given skill to<strong>ALL</strong> the craftsmen to make everything He had commanded…If we try to do some tasks which are assigned or allotted to someone else, then definitely we find something lacking…But God has called us for something different. He has a specific plan for each of us…He has called some to be apostles, some teachers, some evangelists and so on .Our God is just and is not partial and does not show favoritism …His love and justice is exhibited by the very fact that the sun is the same for everyone and gives equal light to all, irrespective of whether he admires God or not and whether He understands Him or not…Though there are people who worship the creation instead of the Creator (Worshippers of Sun or Worshippers of Trees ,whom I met) ,God still demonstrates His patience by sending rain on all the people equally…It is never like a good rain for a believers field and complete drought for a wicked person…The very Creation speaks of His accommodative nature…So He has given ALL the people talents ..\n\nWe read of Noah, a blameless and a righteous person among the people of his time who were so wicked and they grieved/pained God’s heart …But in view of the planned terrible destruction through floodwaters on the earth, God commanded him to “<strong>Make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out, This is how you are to build it :The Ark 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high</strong>” …It had to made with three decks\n\nThere was never rain till then, on the entire earth. Imagining ourselves in place of Noah, how difficult it is to obey God’s command in the midst of people who were making fun of him, scorning this very idea, ridiculing that there was never a rain but he was building an ark for the floodwaters …He never had our authentic or dependable Bible, which could always give some previous references of such tough situations or examples or illustrations of such wonders performed by the Almighty….The only basis or the foundation for this gigantic/colossal task of building an ark was God’s voice...and nothing else…How much time/money /efforts must Noah have invested in this venture ??? Not knowing the result finally. All because of his strong faith /trust in his Creator…Whatever be the opposition or whatever may be the cost involved, he was ready to do it and the final result as mentioned in<strong>Genesis 6:22 “Noah did everything just as God commanded him</strong>” This also proves that God had given the skill to do everything He had commanded.. Yes, these heroes of faith have proved to entire humanity and all the coming generations that God’s word is trustworthy….…God sent the rain ,as He had promised in the six hundredth year of his life and thus he was safeguarded from the destruction by the same ark, though everything else had perished… to continue"

              "<strong>Exodus 31:6 -11, “I have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have commanded you : the Tent of Meeting ,the Ark of the Testimony with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent-.They are to make them just as I have commanded you” </strong>\n\nNow what is this “tent of meeting” which the Lord had commanded about above ..Exodus 33 clearly describes it ” <strong>7 Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of meeting. <!--more-->\nAnd it came to pass that everyone who sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of meeting which was outside the camp. 8 So it was, whenever Moses went out to the tabernacle, that all the people rose, and each man stood at his tent door and watched Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle. 9 And it came to pass, when Moses entered the tabernacle, that the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses. 10 All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tabernacle door, and all the people rose and worshiped, each man in his tent door. 11 So the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he would return to the camp, but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tabernacle”</strong>\n\nLiterally we may not be asked to build an ark or pitch a tent but we have to spiritually build our bodies for becoming a meeting place with God<strong>…”Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you ,whom you have received from God?” 1Corinthians 6:19</strong> ..So we need to build our body as the “<strong>Tent of Meeting</strong>”-a place where God’s presence can dwell …Yes, God needs to dwell there…/reside/inhabit or settle comfortably….The world cannot see Jesus Christ, rather we need to exhibit Him….God has given us the skill …He has set the conscience within us –rather the sense of right and wrong /principles/ethics … Question, are we building our bodies to become a meeting place with Almighty or with Satan ? We are indeed a temple in which the Spirit of God dwells…”<strong>Therefore I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God-this is your spiritual act of worship”, Romans 12:1. </strong>\n\nNoah struggled but built the ark , which became a blessing to many…If we also build our bodies as “the tent of meeting” in which God dwells, then we will be a blessing and refuge for many perishing souls. No one can escape with an idea they are not given the necessary skill /talent …The parable of talents in <strong>Mathew 25:15</strong> says<strong>” To one he gave five talents of money, to another, two talents and to another one, one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey</strong> …Yes, God has entrusted/delegated certain tasks for which we are accountable, each according to our ability.. <strong>”Just and true are your ways”</strong>. There are so many, in dire poverty but why did God bless us like this ? How are we using our skills? There are many ways of livelihood/employment etc. but how are we balancing our priorities ? Since I had to spend almost three hours in traveling for work, I had asked God ”Oh Lord, you ensure that I have a job very close to my house, so that I will save time and spend time in your mighty ministry”. So He answered ”You cannot lay down conditions for me, rather obey me…In whatever time you are left with, be faithful and involve in your work…I will answer your prayers”. Though it was quite tough to obey His voice, after a tiring day, but by His grace took some time to work in His vineyard…Though it is very less, God values everything we do…May be our human authorities do not appreciate or recognize our effort/exertion, God does…”<strong>The Lord works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed “ Psalms 103:6.</strong> Soon, God taught me how to manage the work, which I used to take 11 hours earlier , now in less than 8 hours. Yes, He is the storehouse of wisdom and knowledge, He is an ever present help in times of trouble …Though my colleagues stay late, God enables me to complete my work in time, which was nothing less than a miracle ……“ <strong>4 For You, LORD, have made me glad through Your work; I will triumph in the works of Your hands.” Psalms 92:4 to finish, Sarah Susan</strong>"

              "<strong>Exodus 31:6 -11, “I have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have commanded you : the Tent of Meeting ,the Ark of the Testimony with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent-.They are to make them just as I have commanded you” </strong>\n\nTo complete these series, there was a Notification by the Government regarding very few posts in APGENCO (Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation ) and my qualification was just suitable…<!--more-->\nThough many had gone for coaching to pass through the Written Examination, my God had been helping me get the right study materials ( when there were so many advisers, so many books and so on) and was indeed my Tutor to solve my doubts, Mentor to lift me in case of any fears…”Just as Mary addresses him in<strong>John 20: 16 “She turned to him and cried out in Aramaic “Rabboni “(which means Teacher ) “I will instruct you and teach you the in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you.” Psalms 32:8</strong> Yes, with experience,\n\nI can confidently say that we need ask for His promises and He will guide us in the right path…Today, there are so many people who are unable to know God’s will….If we have a close friend, will we not share our secrets and tell them our ways, If that is the case, why will God not reveal His will in our lives…Why are there so much confusion/chaos –in families/ work spots/ churches. Because we do not find time to hear God’s voice …There is a saying, ”<strong>If Satan cannot make you bad, he will make you busy</strong>” Yes, this is happening everywhere.. People do not find time for God…Work is definitely not worship for a believer,… With God’s help, we can manage our work well within the specified time targets, and that too with accuracy…Even if some error creeps in, He will enable us to overcome it…As His name suggests, He is Wonderful …Isaiah prophesies even before Jesus was born that He is the “<strong>Wonderful Counselor, Everlasting Father, Mighty God and the Prince of Peace</strong> ” God enabled me to score 82 out of 100, by which I was among the toppers and He fought the battle for me, thus helping me to perform well in the interview and group discussion. But the results were not announced. We heard that there were also attempts to bribe and buy the post (because of the benefits in the job) and also there were severe/acute political pressures and hence there was indefinite delay…through which I had to move more close to the Lord. So when I looked to Him, He answered me through <strong>Psalms 34“How great is your goodness which you have stored up for those who fear you ,which you bestow in the sight of men on those who take refuge in you. In the shelter of your presence you hide them from the intrigues of men”. </strong>God had comforted me that any conspiracy or plots of wicked men will not prosper since He is fighting on our behalf “The battle is the Lord’s. Without a single recommendation or influence, God enabled to me to secure the government job , with 50% hike in the salary ,with lesser time at work spot ( now 5 hours instead of 8 hours)..\n\nYes, with confidence ,I can reassure, God gives everything required to do the task He has assigned to each one of us because what God does is by the divine building plan that only comes from Him and accomplished by Him. What a faithful God He is.\n\nWhat are you looking to God for today, what is the motive behind the request? Do you desire for it to be built by God’s divine plan? Is what you desire more about having more time to serve Him?\n\nPraise the Lord for His unfailing faithfulness…. Blessings Sarah Susan"

              "<strong>Matthew 11:28, &quot;Come to me, all ye, heavy laden and I will give you rest&quot;</strong>\n\nIn today's scenario, no one likes to meet any person, who is heavy laden or to help any such person or spend time with people who are very tensed, depressed or anxious for various reasons. But our dear Lord invites such people who have heavy burdens, whatever the reason may be. <!--more-->\nNot only, it is an invitation of warm welcome followed by the assurance of PERFECT REST. <strong>1Peter 5:7, says &quot;Cast your burden on the Lord because He cares for you</strong>&quot; Yes God is bearing our burden and that too, gladly... For instance, a young child getting back from school with a very heavy bag , unable to carry it.. His/her mother or father will immediately run to the child and definitely take the heavy bag and give the child some relief ..Why ? The primary reason is love ...Yes, the love of the parents towards their children ...This is a shadow of God's love. Compared to the AGAPE love which is of God, even our earthly fathers falls short of His love.\n\nOne time I woke up only to remember the pressures I was to face during one particular day at office. I had auditors visiting and God strengthened me with this verse <strong>&quot;Praise be to the Lord, to God, our SAVIOR , who daily bears our burdens</strong>&quot; ..I immediately gathered courage for the day, miraculously witnessed God bring me out of this particular situation and every other. I praised God further for strengthening my faith to believe that He loves me and gladly bears my daily burdens...\n\nWhat a blessing it is to be with the Lord who bears our burdens, who loves to listen to us, and also gives us rest despite attacks from Satan /enemies /troubles/ fears/ shocks/day today worries or whatever it is\n\n<strong>Psalms 91 says &quot;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will REST in the shadow of the Almighty&quot;</strong> . What is this dwelling place? it’s a place where one lives/stays/resides/abides. Any person on earth goes home after the days' work ...generally ,a person loves to get back to his house/dwelling as often as possible , as early as possible.. Now let us meditate on God Himself being our dwelling ..\n\nIf we love our earthly dwelling, which is quite temporary, then how much more are we to love our heavenly, permanent dwelling -our temple Himself ? Do we love to stay in Him, reside in Him, abide in Him consistently and continuously? Not just for a season, or time period for a gain or a favor but forever and ever ...If we are inclined to spend time with Him, then we can be assured of His rest.. David states that He loves to stay in the temple of the Lord forever and ever. Yes, let us love to abide in Him and continue in Him so that we can enjoy the rest in His bosom for ever and ever... Let us all eagerly wait for the day when we , all will be in His loving fold, God Himself wiping our tears from our eyes, and providing us REST for eternity... , Sarah Susan"

              "Why should we give thanks to God? King David sings in <strong>Psalm 103</strong> regarding some of the major reasons why one should praise God\n\n<strong>“Praise God O My soul all my inmost being, praise His holy name –who forgives all your sins”</strong>A person very dear to us may somehow manage to forgive some sins but the important aspect in forgiving is “to forget”, which a mere human being cannot do…”Love keeps no record of wrongs” as per <strong>1Corinthians 13</strong> .<!--more-->\nIf God starts recording our wrongs/sins, then we cannot stand in His holy presence. The precious blood of Jesus is the ever ready solution for our trespasses so that immediately on confession, sins are washed out and we are justified to appear in His presence. He forgives “ALL OUR SINS” Sometimes people find it easy to forgive some sins but not all sins…We need to thank God for being so gracious for forgiving all sins, irrespective of the type or seriousness involved.\n\nHe heals all our diseases, yes God is a healer. There is no disease greater than God …”<strong>1John 4:4 says ”The one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world”</strong> So God is greater than any disease or any sickness we face. Disease may not exactly be physical but also mental…Nowadays everywhere we see people suffering with depression/stress which are also classified as diseases. As we can see in the Bible, He can cure any disease, do any surgery (As He did in Genesis 2:21 ,where God did a surgery to Adam , in His sleep )..What a wonderful God we serve.\n\nHe redeems our lives from the pit ..There are occasions where people find themselves fallen/oppressed/downtrodden ..They are in a pit …Usually people in the pit are not even noticed…They are not only fallen on the ground but they are thrown /forced into a hole in the ground ???” King David narrates “Unless the Lord has been my help, I would have soon dwelt in the silence of death. When I said ”My foot is slipping” your love O Lord supported me. When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul” Psalms 94:18,19 Really there are times when we are in a pit of anxieties/tensions/worries but His love is our only support…”\n\nHe crowns us with His love and compassion…The unchanging God is God of compassion ….2 Corinthians 1:3 says He is a God of ALL COMFORT …People may definitely comfort us for a season but they may lose hope on us at times…God is a God of all comfort in all our troubles …Today people are crowned with problems and tensions, but we are so privileged to be crowned with love from God. Satan does not allow us to give thanks, he reminds us of some difficulties instead of counting the number of blessings showered on us… The crowns in this world are temporary…Today a person may be in very high authority /position but this would not last…He cannot enjoy it throughout his life…One day or the other, he has to retire from the post…\n\nHe satisfies our desires with good things…Our God always satisfies our desires when they are right of course …Whatever it may be, whether a job or a life partner or a house ..and so on. He is mindful of the smallest desire of each person …Really we have a wonderful God who caters to all our needs though He has many people to take care of he never makes mistakes in this process of supplying/providing ..That is why the saints sing in<strong>Revelation 15:3 ”Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty, Just and true are your ways ,King of the Ages”\n\n</strong>So that our youth is renewed like the eagle’s he satisfies our desires with good things so that we are renewed…It is not that He satisfies our desires today and not tomorrow. His supply is consistent and continuous…since He has everything in abundance…His supply will never run dry\n\nSo let us all resolve to praise Him at all times in all circumstances with all our mind and strength and soul. Amen!\n\nRegards\n\nSarah Susan"

For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus. But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he served with me in the gospel”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe all love to work with reliable, trustworthy people, those who keep their word. As my friend Pastor Phil once wrote “<em>At one time in American history there was a saying that a man’s word was his bond</em>”, that has somehow changed over the years. I think this is why we want things written down (contracts, rules and regulations) discussed and agreed upon because man has a tendency of not following through what he has vowed to accomplish and needs to be kept accountable.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTo count on someone is to have traits, patterns, testimony of who they are. And the thing I believe is the measuring stick is the word “consistency”. Consistency by definition is the state or quality of holding or sticking together and retaining shape. People who are consistent are not easily swayed by what is around. Some thinker penned these words <em>“Consistency is better than rare great moments. It is not perfection; it is simply refusing to give up</em>”. <strong>If you are persistent you will get it, if you are consistent, you will keep it.</strong>\r\n\r\nPaul in writing to churches always talked about the state of some believers he worked with. You read either commendations (those he talks highly of) and/or those he discredits. Here we find that he had a soft spot for Timothy because for Timothy had demonstrated consistency in his faithfulness and reliability, and Paul could count on him. He writes <strong>Philippians 2:20</strong>, “<strong>For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state. For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus”. </strong>Timothy would be a true reflection on Paul the reason he entrusted him with this journey<strong>. </strong>Timothy had learned to think and act like Paul having taken to heart Paul’s words to the <strong>Corinthians</strong>,<strong> “Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ.” 1Corinthians 11:1. </strong>A few folks like Demas and John Mark had not demonstrated their consistency at some point therefore Paul would hesitate to send them to certain churches. Paul had confidence in Timothy something we want our bosses, pastors, leaders to think of us, however this is not a gift, this is developed over time.\r\n\r\nWe can understand how consistency is important; it allows others to provide us with seal of approval. We need to be regarded trustworthy for a cause. The last thing any man may want to do is give their word and not follow through. Often I hear children or wives says something like this, “<em>you promised to do this or take me somewhere but now you are changing your mind</em>” this comes about after changing the original plans to cater to other commitments that should not take priority over their word. Men need be counted on to be there when they say they will and set that example to others. We need to be men that work under minimum or no supervision to accomplish tasks for we have given our word. Men that can be trusted because the person assigning or involving us has considered us like minded as seen in our consistency. On our own we are unable, ask Peter who had good intentions of not denying Christ only to find his words fell short and could not be consistent with his actions.\r\n\r\nSuppose you were one of the men that walked with Paul, would he consider you like minded entrusting you to a mission? Perhaps you will say no because you notice inconsistency in who you are and what you do.\r\n\r\nLet’s us pray and ask the Lord to pray for us like He did for Peter that we be steadfast, immovable, always, continually, consistently doing the work of the Lord, knowing our labor is not in vain. Let us be men of our word. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>James 1:2-8, “…a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways</strong>.,\"<a id=\"set-post-thumbnail\" class=\"thickbox\" title=\"Set featured image\" href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-admin/media-upload.php?post_id=5679&amp;type=image&amp;TB_iframe=1\"><img class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2a497106249d2950116dfb3b0a6d0bf01.jpg?w=183&amp;h=275&amp;crop=1\" alt=\"2a497106249d2950116dfb3b0a6d0bf0\" width=\"140\" height=\"210\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn continuing to deal with the word consistency, faith is another aspect that requires consistency. The disciples in a number of times lacked consistency to the point you read of the Lord asking them, “<strong>where is your faith</strong>”, <strong>Luke 8:25.</strong> Several instances he called them “<strong>O you of little faith</strong>”, <strong>Matthew 6:30, 8:26,14:31, 16:8, Luke 12:28</strong>. Unique challenges and length of time posed a threat to their faith often throwing them to doubting mode.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJames encourages brethren who face various trials that challenge their faith to count it all joy, why, vs. “<strong>3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience</strong>”. Peter a disciples of Jesus who earlier on struggled with his faith penned these words <strong>1Peter 1</strong>:<strong>6-7, “6 In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials,7 </strong><strong style=\"line-height:1.5;\">that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ”. </strong><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Both men uses the word joy (rejoice), testing of faith, patience (endurance). </span><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">The testing of faith teaches men how to profit through trials instead of taking exits and trying other things.</span>\r\n\r\nKnowing what faith needs to go through, James in some way is telling us not to rush it or be unwise. Not to ask to be brought out but rather to be brought through. And his charge<strong>, vs4. “but let patience have it’s perfect work…” </strong>and if you lack wisdom<strong> vs. 5, </strong>Ask God who gives to all liberally. He further writes that all these to be asked in faith expecting to receive otherwise such a person he considers a double-minded which is to also say unstable not in some but all his ways. He says of the doubting person that he is “<strong>like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind</strong>”\r\n\r\nA doubter is a double-minded person. Jesus had in mind such a person when He spoke of the one who tries to serve two masters (<strong>Matthew 6:24</strong>). As such, he is “unstable,” which comes from a Greek word meaning “<em>unsteady, wavering, in both his character and feelings</em>.” A double-minded person is restless and confused in his thoughts, his actions, and his behavior. He lacks maturity in the testing of his faith. Behind him is a trail of inconsistency having missed or exited the furnace where faith is tested and tried.\r\n\r\nBiblical manhood calls for men to be steadfast in their faith, in other words be firm in purpose, in resolution. The testing of faith matures men to stand firm in the doctrine of Christ lest they stumble, <strong>Ephesians 4:13-15, “<del></del>13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, 15 but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ</strong>”\r\n\r\nThe testing of faith teaches men to be loyal to the faith, <strong>2Timothy 1:12-13, “12 For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day. 13 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus</strong>”\r\n\r\nAll these among others are impossible without God, therefore Peter says in <strong>1Peter 1:5</strong> that we are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation. <strong>Matthew 24:13, reads “But he who endures to the end shall be saved”. </strong>This is the perseverance of the saints or as RC Sproul calls it the preservation of the saints<strong>. </strong>Only God has the power of preserving our faith until the end even when it feels like the heat is so hot and we may feel like breaking. With this thought, we must cast our eyes upon Him alone to preserve us. Blessings Ev"

Matthew mentions pray (prayer, prayed, praying) at least 19 times, Mark 13 times, John 8 times but Luke 27 times (in the book of Acts by Luke 32 times). Of the 161 mentions of prayers in the NT, 36% (59) times are mentioned by Luke either in reference to Jesus or the apostles. I believe Luke wanted us to see how effective, fervent, consistent prayer of a righteous man avails much.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI find it interesting that both Matthew and Mark note in the above passage that Jesus came to the garden of Gethsemane to pray, Luke adds the word \"<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">accustomed\".</span></strong> Luke lets us know that this was a frequent place Jesus came to pray. This was a regular pattern as Luke notes when he highlights significant times Jesus prayed at baptism, <strong>Luke 3:21</strong>, before He appointed the disciples, <strong>Luke 6:12, </strong>on the mount of transfiguration<strong>, Luke 9:18-29, </strong>as the disciples found Him praying and asked Him to teach them to pray, <strong>Luke 11</strong>.\r\n\r\nTo have the mind of Christ, imitate Him and be conformed to His image, we must learn what He considered priority and be drawn to that. Prayer was His life, when they turned temple into a business place, He turned the tables and reminded those who were there that His house was a house of prayer.\r\n\r\nOn the day of His betrayal, under pressure, in agony, travailing, in anguish, He still prayed as He was accustomed to. Nothing deterred Him in good times or in bad times. Even as the disciples who should have stood with Him to pray fell asleep after He warned them to watch and pray, they were not burdened as He was. Their state did not discourage Him from praying. Jesus would face the temptation of forfeiting the cross, yet He prayed earnestly, consistently for the will of God to be done. The bible then says angels who are made lower than Him came and ministered to Him.\r\n\r\nAs the disciples walked with Jesus, having seen and experienced what it meant to have a consistent prayer life, they learnt a valuable lesson. And while they slept and fell into temptation, they would not repeat the same once the commission was given and empowered by the Holy Spirit. They did not even think that now that they were filled with the Holy Spirit they should not pray. If anything that fueled them to pray earnestly and we see that consistency throughout the book of Acts. <strong>Acts 2:42 “And they <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">continued steadfastly</span> in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers</strong>, <strong>Acts 6:4, “but we will give <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">ourselves continually</span> to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”</strong> Read the accounts of Peter in Acts, he was praying everywhere.\r\n\r\nPrayers calls for persistence and consistence. When we work we work, when we pray God works <strong>“For bodily exercise profits a little…”, 1Timothy 4:8</strong>, BUT “…<strong>The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”, James 5:16</strong>. One profits a little, the other avails much.\r\n\r\nA man driving His family to a destination must stay awake, alert and effective on the wheels. The moment he falls asleep, he has exposed both himself and his family to danger. This is the tragedy of not being steadfast, sober and vigilant as biblical men in prayers. The enemy takes advantage of that and we must not fall asleep on the prayer wheel.  <strong>1Timothy 2:8, “I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting;”. </strong>On our own again we can’t, that is why we must come to the Lord everyday and say, <strong>“Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.”, Luke 11:1. </strong>Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>John 9:1-41, “25 He answered and said, “Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.”<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5895\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image3.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"236\" height=\"236\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThe story of a man born blind in <strong>John 9</strong> is one of my favorite healing stories in the bible. John dedicates a whole chapter to address the healing of this man and the response from both those who saw him healed and his own testimony. While this is a notable miracle, the emphasis here is not the miracle but the purpose of the miracle. This is a picture of salvation, the testimony that lasts. This is a picture of He who initiates the salvation process and completes it. This is a picture of being born of water and the Spirit (washing and believing)<!--more-->\r\n\r\nVs. 1 says, “<strong>Now as Jesus passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth”. </strong>It’s Jesus who saw him, it’s Jesus who corrected the disciples of their thinking and the Pharisees that though we are all impacted by the original sin, it was not for this reason this man was born blind otherwise it would be concluded that all those born with defects were more sinners than those who were not. His response <strong>vs. 3, “…“Neither this man nor his parents sinned, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">but that the works of God should be revealed in him</span>... 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” </strong>This statement alone is the heartbeat of Christianity, the glory of God and not the happiness of man as commonly preached.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>Watch what the Lord does,<strong> vs. 6, “When He had said these things, He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. 7 And He said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing”. </strong>Unlike Naaman who first protested the means by which he would be healed, this man’s response was different<strong>. </strong>God gives grace to the humble and leads them by His ways<strong>, James 4:6. </strong>Christ cured many who were blind by disease or accident; here He cured one born blind as the man later alludes that never before was it heard of one healed born blind. This miracle was to live as a monument to the Redeemer's glory, and recommend His grace to all who desire the same precious salvation.\r\n\r\nOf course his healing did not bring people to rejoice with him or over Jesus but rather question what had happened to him. His neighbors vs. 10 asked him how his eyes were opened. Not only did his neighbors question his testimony, the Pharisees did the same. They tried to cast doubt on the healed by labeling Jesus a sinner because He had healed on Sabbath. If that was not enough, the Pharisees sought his parents to cast doubts on his testimony too by declaring the same. Because his parents feared being excommunicated, they pushed the responsibility of giving the account back to their son. No one would stand with him only his faith in the One who had healed him and gave him a testimony, vs. 25, “…<strong>One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe more they tried to cast doubt in him, the more he became bolder and bolder in giving his testimony. Vs. \"<strong>30 The man answered and said to them, “Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes! 31 Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him. 32 Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. 33 If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.” </strong>None of what they said derailed him, he was consistent. All against one man with a testimony yet in all his faith and testimony got stronger. He identified the One that healed Him as Jesus, as a Prophet, as a man from God and finally as Lord when Jesus revealed Himself. <strong>vs. 35 “… He said to him, “Do you believe in the Son of God?” 36 He answered and said, “Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?” 37 And Jesus said to him, “You have both seen Him and it is He who is talking with you.” 38 Then he said, “Lord, I believe!” And he worshiped Him</strong>”. It started with Christ who saw him, touched him, sent him, found him again and revealed Himself to him.\r\n\r\nIn the work of grace wrought upon the soul we see the change, but we see not the hand that makes it: the way of the Spirit is like that of the wind, which you heard the sound of, but cannot tell where it comes, nor where  it goes. The more we stand, the more He reveals Himself. This is the testimony of God (<strong>1Corinthians 2:1</strong>), and this has become our testimony (<strong>Revelations 12:11</strong>).\r\n\r\nOur testimony fails in comparison to His which never fails the reason we need to embrace and declare His testimony that salvation is of the Lord and nothing can cast doubt upon us who have received it by grace through faith.

My family for one is in a trying period having finished the year with one only to open with another. The reality is that we live in a fallen world full of pain and suffering, however we as believers can be different from the world by learning to profit from trials.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to afflictions/trials, three men in new testament tells us how we should respond to them. James encourages us to count it all joy. Paul encourages to consider them light. Peter on the other hand encourages us not to think them strange. Only the grace of God enables us to speak and live in the light of such words with confidence.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nGreater testimony is not on what you have achieved but what you have survived, something these men were all aware of. They speak from experience and we learn from them. \"<b>In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials, that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ</b>\", <b>1Peter 1:6.</b> Genuine faith tested is preserved through fire.\r\n\r\nDeeper joy surfaces and becomes believers strength when we learn to profit from trials, \"<b>the joy of the Lord is our strength\". \"Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia: that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality\", 2Corinthians 8:1</b>.\r\n\r\nPatience is a must to every wise men. Patience is mastered in the sea of life as the faith goes through different stages and matures belivers to stand through anything having been equiped lacking nothing to stand, \"<b>My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing\", James 1:2.</b>\r\n\r\nLight affliction as Paul puts it enables believers to hold on tight to Christ looking forward to blessed hope which cannot be compared to the current suffering, \"<b>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,\", 2Corinthians 4:7. \"Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy\", 1Peter 4:12.</b>\r\n\r\nMay the Lamb who was slain receive the reward of His suffering as we become partakers in the fellowship of His suffering for the glory of His name, \"<b>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen\", Jude 1:24. </b>Blessings Ev\r\n\r\nSome thoughts to help us through trying times\r\n\r\n1. I am in better place than I DESERVE\r\n2. God owes me nothing, I owe it all to Him\r\n3. The challenges I am facing could be more worse than what it is\r\n4. Someone else has it worse than I do and wish they were in my position.\r\n5. I am far from where I started\r\n6. I'd rather STAND in there than HANG in there. I get tired quickly hanging compared to standing.\r\n7. I maintain memories of small beginnings, small and big victories, they remind me I have more to be thankful for than complain\r\n8. There is always a big picture"

If God is not perfoming these things then perhaps we are not experiencing God's abundant blessing as some may want us to believe.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThis is no different from the Israelites who lived on the verge of miracles. They only rejoiced when they saw God do something extraoridanry, spectacular, supernatural. This how they tested God's provision. They looked ahead at specific things they asked for, but rarely looked back to see God's providence in their day to day lives.\r\n\r\nWhy should we value providence more than miracles? Because providence is the means by and through which we learn that God governs all things in the universe. It is the protective care of God. The doctrine of divine providence asserts that God is in complete control of all things. This includes the universe as a whole (<strong>Psalm 103:19</strong>), the physical world (<strong>Matthew 5:45</strong>), the affairs of nations (<strong>Psalm 66:7</strong>), human birth and destiny (<strong>Galatians 1:15</strong>), human successes and failures (<strong>Luke 1:52</strong>), and the protection of His people (<strong>Psalm 4:8</strong>). This doctrine stands in direct opposition to the idea that the universe is governed by chance or fate. Your life and its affairs are governed by God's providence. <strong>Acts 17:28, \"for in Him we live and move and have our being...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe providence of God is rarely preached, much emphasies are on the miracles of God which in my judgement are often very temporal. Our call is not to live on the verge of miracles even though we need them but on the realm of blessings when we understand that God governs all.\r\n\r\nWe see God's providence with Jeremiah. God tells him to a buy a parcel of land for the right price despite being in jail. The land he is to buy would also be taken by the Chaldeans as they go into exile. You and I would question the wisdom in making that move. It is clear they were going away with no sign of them coming back and even if they did, how would he recover his land or even a better question, what guarantees he would still be alive then? While we question the wisdom of this move, Jeremiah gladly did when he understood it was of the Lord. This was to encourage them that Lord in His providence would sustain them in exile as they went through a pruning process. And the Lord would bring them back and restore what they had lost.\r\n\r\nGod provided the finances, the land, the wisdom, the encouragement and Jeremiah in response extoled God's great name \"‘<strong>Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You.\", Jeremiah 32:17.\r\n</strong>\r\nGod governs every aspect of our lives we enjoy, it comes from Him. The strength to wake up and go to work, ability to drive and stay on the right lane, to obey, to manage family affairs, finances, assets, wisdom to start things, make right choices, plan for retirement, have investements and the list goes on, these are all God's providence for us. \"<strong>Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God\", Ecclessistes 2:24.</strong>\r\n\r\nFor those consumed with pursuit of miracles, have you done an inventory as a whole to see God's providence in your life? It is good to manage even our worldly affairs in faith; to do common business with reference to the providence and promise of God the same way Jeremiah did. We constantly need to be reminded that God is ever present in the details. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Exodus 29:19-20, “Take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet… “<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5737\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog2.jpg\" alt=\"blog2\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nAaron was the high priest of Israel and Moses’ right hand man. He was a spiritual leader, and therefore both he and his sons went through a priestly ritual of being consecrated by blood. They were to have blood applied to three of their extremities which were: the lobe of the priest’s right ear, the right thumb, and the right big toe. Peter says, “<strong>But you are a chosen people, <em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">a royal priesthood</span></em>, a holy nation, a people belonging to God…“, </strong><strong>1Peter 2:9.</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe priest’s ear had blood applied to it which is the organ that hears the word of God and they were to hear only the Word of the Lord. A spiritual leader needs to know what God is saying to them to minister unto God on behalf of the people. Many Christians desire to spiritual leaders, but are too busy listening to all the other voices speaking in their ear. Carmen says in His song, Not ashamed, “<em>There’s many voices in the wind, but only one that saves the soul from sin…”</em> From the media, to celebrities, to preachers, everyone wants you to listen to them. Even Evans and I want you to hear the Word of God that He speaks through us for you in the daily devotional ministry. However as a spiritual leader you need to make sure that you are hearing His voice to direct your life, your family, your community, and your ministry, because nothing compares to His Word to direct you.\r\n\r\nRecall the account in <strong>Matthew 3</strong> whereby Jesus gets baptized by John. The Lord speaks out of heaven these words, “<strong>This is my Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased</strong>.” If there was a way to encourage Jesus or warm His heart, His Father certainly did that with His few yet powerful words. Yet just THREE verses later in <strong>Matthew 4</strong>, we see another voice speaking to Jesus, Satan himself. As a matter of fact he speaks to Jesus in three instances, and in all three instances Jesus hit the devil with the Word of God as He repeatedly stated to the devil the words, <strong>“It is written</strong>.” The enemy was relentless in trying to drown out the voice of the God the Father in the ear of His Son Jesus, but the Word of God was hidden in His heart <strong>(Psalm 119:9,11</strong>).\r\n\r\nAaron and His sons needed to have their ear tuned to God’s voice. In this day and age if you are a spiritual leader, or desire to be one, then you must learn how to block out the “other voices” that attempt to fill your ears with ungodly temptations, and nonsense. In Greek mythology the Siren’s were beautiful half-woman, half-birdlike creatures who sang such sweet songs that listeners forgot everything and died of hunger. The Sirens were sisters who lured sailors to their death by their irresistible song causing sailors to crash upon the reefs when they tried to reach the Sirens. Among those tempted were Jason on the Argo and Odysseus. Odysseus escaped from them by filling his crew's ears with wax while he tied himself to the ship's mast. The Argonauts were saved by Orpheus' music. The Argonauts were saved by listening to a sweeter melody, and what is sweeter than hearing the voice of our Father as the enemy tries to lead us to crash our lives upon the rocks of this world through his deceptive music. Moses sang, “<strong>The LORD is my strength and my song….</strong>” Is God’s Word that precious to you? <strong><em>To be continued…</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application</span></strong><strong>: Whose Word is in your ear more, God’s Word, or the world’s word? Are you being consistent and daily in your Bible reading? Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>Exodus 29:19-2, “Take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet…”<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5740\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog1.jpg\" alt=\"blog\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a> </strong>\r\n\r\nFirst we examined this verse and how the blood was applied to the ear lobe of the high priest Aaron and his sons. Second the blood was applied to the thumb on their right hand. What was so significant about that? well I’m glad you were pondering. Remember Peter wrote, “<strong>But you are a chosen people, <em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">a royal priesthood</span></em>, a holy nation, a people belonging to God…”, </strong><strong>1 Peter 2:9</strong>. <!--more-->The priests were spiritual leaders and therefore performed priestly duties. As the ear was the organ that hears the Word of God, the thumbs were the organs by which the mediatorial work was to be performed on behalf of the people. There was certainly a right and a wrong way to serve God and God’s people. In <strong>Leviticus 10</strong> we read of how two of Aarons four sons Nadab and Abihu, profaned the sanctuary with strange fire and actually died before the Lord (vv.1-3). Judgment was very harsh for these two men, but no more so than it was for Ananias and Sapphira when the Christian church was just beginning (<strong>Acts 5</strong>). One needs to remember that “<strong>to whom more is given, more is required</strong>”; and Aaron and the congregation needed to know that God was real and that the priests were not playing a religious game.\r\n\r\nPeter reminds us that as Christians we are all priests. And in light of that, Paul instructs us, “<strong>Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship.” Romans 12:1.</strong> I’ve always loved this verse, but there is a deep challenge within its words. A dead sacrifice can’t move, but a living sacrifice can crawl off the altar when God asks us to do something that our flesh rises up against. We are to give our lives to the Lord on the “altar of sacrifice” in simplest terms, by actively serving Him in ministry through the local church. We are to serve the Lord out of pure motives, and not out of selfish ambitions or vain conceit. This is why Paul tells us “<strong>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the</strong> <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">faith</span>…,</strong> as he did for himself (<strong>1 Corinthians 9:27</strong>). There are so many believers that have so many gifts that God has invested in their lives. However each one needs to find, what I would call ministry SHAPE. This is in an acronym for Spiritual Gifts, Heart (passion), Abilities (natural), Personality, and Experiences. As Evans shared before in his message “<strong>Doing everything does not equal effectiveness</strong>”, ministers need others to help them do ministry. As a matter of fact <strong>Ephesians 4:11-12</strong> reads “<strong>It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare (equip) God’s people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up</strong>.” The ministry leaders are gifts to the local church, but the real ministers are to be the congregation. The ministry leader can’t do it all, they are there primarily to train others to do the work of the ministry.\r\n\r\nHave you had the blood of Christ applied to your thumbs and found your ministry SHAPE yet? If so are you active or is ministry a spectator event for you? Can you imagine if every Christian had the biblical imperative, I was saved to serve? I can envision churches, and ministries exploding for the Lord, because He’s the One that gets the credit (glory). “<strong>Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you</strong>.” <strong>1 Timothy 4:14.</strong> The talents He’s invested in our lives, He expects a return on, Are we being wicked lazy servants talked about in (<strong>Matthew 25</strong>)?\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> </span></strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application</span></strong><strong>: Ask a mature believer or perhaps a ministry leader to help you find your place in ministry, and serve God in that ministry. To continue, Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>"

Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet…”\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nApplying the blood to the ear, was about hearing only God’s Word, while applying it to the thumb was about rightly serving God and God’s people. Lastly, but equally important is the application of the blood covering to the \"big toes of their right feet,\" so that the sanctified walk of the priests would be examples to the people. What priest walked here on earth in perfect righteousness?\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Hebrews tells us, <strong>“Such a high priest [Jesus] meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens</strong> (<strong>7:26</strong>). A priest offers sacrifice on behalf of the people, and Jesus offered His very life to be the sacrifice as well. The many former OT priests died, ‘But this man [Jesus] because He continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood… “<strong>Who needs not daily, as those high priests to offer sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself</strong> (<strong>5:10; 7:24,27</strong>).” Jesus didn’t only offer the sacrifice as the priest, He was the sacrifice once and for all which is why he said, “<strong>It is finished on the cross.”</strong>\r\n\r\nJesus walked in righteousness as a priest proclaiming that He Himself came for this very purpose as He said, “<strong>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost</strong>.” If we are to walk in righteousness the blood of Christ needs to be applied to our big toe and the rest of our foot because God tells us<strong>, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”</strong> If we truly walk in righteousness our feet will be carrying us to preach the good news.” “<strong>But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference…”</strong> The Law and the prophets walked in righteousness to bring spoken testimony and point to Christ. Only faith in Christ can bring about God’s righteousness. The Law doesn’t make us righteous, it doesn’t help us, and rather it leaves us helpless with the need to throw ourselves at the feet of the Savior. After now being born again by the Holy Spirit, and realizing that “<strong>…you are a chosen people, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">a royal priesthood</span>, a holy nation, a people belonging to God…”, </strong><strong>1Peter 2:9</strong>, we need to present our lives as living sacrifices to reach the lost for Christ. The lost need desperately to have the blood of the Savior applied to their sins to be redeemed from the curse of the Law of sin and death. God has left that mission to you and me to do. “<strong>We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us”, </strong><strong>2Corinthians 5:20</strong>.” “<strong>To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory”, </strong><strong>Colossians 1:27</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application</span></strong>: Do you have the blood of Christ applied to your toe, and are your feet mobilized to go seek and save the lost. Are your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace (<strong>Ephesians 6:15</strong>)? If you want to be used by God then move those feet that God gave you for Him and His glory. “<em>Satan prefers 1,000,000 choir members or pew-warmers to one Christian who is prepared to obey the command to preach the Gospel (Ray Comfort)”</em> Many believers have their feet stuck it seems when its time for obeying our mission to seek and save the lost because of all the excuses and a lack of zeal and urgency. To bring common ground many have said “<em>he puts his pants on one leg at a time. However there is one group, they put their pants on two legs at a time</em>”. Firefighters live with a sense of urgency, because they must respond to the alarm that they must GO or people will die. How much more truthful can that reality be for the Christians. You’re either going or staying, but only is done in obedience and you know which that is. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Now GO!</span></strong>"

              "<strong>John 3:1-21, \"3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog22.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5754\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog22.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"blog2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>Paul in his epistles helps us understand in details the mystery of the gospel, the power of God unto salvation (new birth). Jesus only here in <b>John 3 </b>and 4 introduces us to the nature of new birth in speaking with both Nicodemus and the woman at the well. With Nicodemus we see what must happen nd how. With the woman at the well we see it demonstrated. Most Christians know that something happened in their lives but many have little understanding of this mystery. I have often heard it quoted that “<em>salvation is as easy as A.B.C (Admit, Believe, Confess)\" </em>in relations to a man making decision to follow Christ. This statement has no merit if its not made effective by an outward power none of us possesses. <strong>Salvation is impossible (not able to occur) with man, Luke 18:27</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTo deal with this important subject, in the next few series I hope to briefly address four questions we must ask ourselves in addressing the mystery of the new birth. These are WHAT, WHY, HOW, WHO. They will not be exhaustive but rich enough to strength our faith.\r\n\r\nAnytime you are talking of the new birth, the starting point is very important because everything is to be aligned in the light of that starting point (foundation). The gospel that starts with man will definitely tailor its continuity through the lens of man, meanwhile the gospel that starts with God will center its message through the eyes of God.\r\n\r\nNow to set the ball rolling, I want to address these WHAT, WHY, HOW, WHO in chronological order with just a little turn of letting “WHO” do quick a cameo appearance and later get introduced as the main character of the mystery of the new birth.\r\n\r\nThe bible says, \"<strong>Salvation belongs to the Lord\", Jonah 2:9, Psalm 3:8, Revelation 7:10,</strong> that is the “WHO” that does the new birth. It’s not a prayer, repentance, confession etc. These are not the things that saves, they are some means to lead to the Savior. If we get this wrong, we have no hope. That is the heartbeat of the gospel, the power of God unto salvation. This helps us now study WHAT, WHY, HOW in the light of WHO.\r\n\r\n\"<strong>There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night ...\", John 3:1. </strong>The Lord Jesus Christ is talking to Nicodemus, a prominent Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin (the ruling body of the Jews). As we know he was a ruler of the Jews, a teacher of the law, He came to Jesus secretly by night to talk to Him. He realized that Jesus was radically different from what he had seen. He came secretly by night perhaps not be judged, demoted or something else. His opening address to Jesus lets us know what he thought or knew. He says <strong>vs. “2 Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.</strong>” Two things jump out of this verse. First Nicodemus did not know Him as Jesus the Messiah, the Savior of the world, he only knew Jesus as a Rabbi (teacher). This is similar to the rich young ruler in <strong>Luke 18</strong>, he only addressed Jesus as \"good teacher (Rabbi)\". Secondly, Nicodemus only knew that He had come from God and was not God as we later read in many passages that attacked the deity of Christ. If Nicodemus was a teacher of the law, he would have taught many Jews of the coming Messiah, Jesus did not fit that profile.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of Christ is important, the “WHO” we are addressing in this part. If Nicodemus a teacher of the law got it wrong, how many have the wrong understanding of who Jesus is. The “WHO” must be made clear as John writes <strong> \"Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son”, 2John 1:9. </strong>This is important because as we will continue to tackle <strong>John 3</strong>, we come to learn that understanding is revelation and revelation leads to salvation. Salvation is nothing but “WHO”, <strong>1John 5:12, “He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life”. </strong>Keep this in mind at all times.

              "<strong>John 3:1-18, vs. \"3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_0265.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-5758\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_0265.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"IMG_0265\" width=\"242\" height=\"145\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nAs we saw in part 1, Nicodemus came to Jesus by night and how he addressed Jesus gives us a clear picture he had very little understanding of who Jesus was. Our conclusion from the message was, understanding the doctrine of Christ is crucial in the new birth. The WHO is the most important in the new birth.\r\n\r\nWatch what Jesus does with His potential convert, He cuts to the chase and addresses WHAT. <strong>\"Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\", John 3:3.</strong> The weightier word the Lord uses here is \"being born again\". <!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe word \"born\" is to say the beginning or coming into existence of something. A baby being born does not effect the process, he or she responds to the process. We are born once into the world, we are then born again into the kingdom. WHY? Because we are dead in our trespasses according to <strong>Ephesians 2:1.</strong> By biblical definition, we are spiritually dead, morally bankrupt unable to do anything to become alive. This does not mean we cannot do some good things, it just means we cannot do anything good to bring us life. We like Lazarus are 4 days dead stinking with no hope in ourselves or anyone unless someone who has the capability of giving life effects it in us and we respond. In short Jesus is saying you must have new life to see and enter the kingdom of God, something foreign to Nicodemus a teacher of the law.\r\n\r\nWith this metaphor, Nicodemus is left to ponder of how possible that can be when it sounds easy and complex at the same time. \"Be born again\", sounds easy, not many steps. The complex part is what it means and takes for it to be. \"<strong>Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”, John 3:4</strong>. By Nicodemus' response, a teacher of the law, Paul was right in penning these words, \"<strong>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\", 1Corinthians 2:14.</strong> What Jesus said made no sense to Nicodemus the same with those who are dead in sin.\r\n\r\n\"<b>J</b><strong>esus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. “Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again\", John 3:5-7</strong>. The phrase \"born again\" literally means \"born from above.\" Two things involved in being born again, \"<strong>born of water\"</strong> and \"<strong>the Spirit\". </strong>Having studied this verse closely, I am convinced “born of water” has absolutely no reference to water baptism but cleansing, (regeneration).\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus was speaking to Nicodemus of being born of water, water baptism was new and had two different meanings. He would have understood only one, pre resurrection. John’s baptism was in response to repentance, outward sign that they were clean and believed on Him who was to come. Baptism after resurrection was a public declaration to those who had been regenerated,  that they had died and resurrected with Christ. <strong>, “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance...\", Matthew 3:11</strong>. As this was pre resurrection of Christ, Nicodemus would have understood the words of Christ to mean cleansing (regeneration), not starting with John but going back to the Old Testament. A better place to bring this to light is <strong>Ezekiel 36:25-27, “25 Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them</strong>”. I see Paul echoing to Titus <b>Ezekiel 36, </b>he writes <strong>, “not by works of righteousness which we have done, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">but according to His mercy He saved u</span>s, through the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">washing of regeneration</span> and r<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">enewing of the Holy Spirit</span>\", Titus 3:5</strong>, also as seen in <strong>Leviticus 15:13</strong>.\r\n\r\nTo make it simple, He has to cleanse before He can dwell. Born of water and Spirit involves cleansing of the old and a creation of the new. <strong>Romans 6:6</strong>. To continue, Blessings Ev"

True salvation (the only salvation) must make an effect on someone and there will be evidence, big or small. No one hit by truck for example can remain the same, something will definitely change due to the nature of contact/impact. When we get saved we know something has happened, there is a change but we may not understand how, we see the evidence. In vs. 8 Jesus uses another example to make His point, He says,“<b>The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”, John 3:8</b>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Christ and Paul declares that the gospel is the power of God (Dunamis). Dunamis (power) is the Greek term from which our word dynamite is derived. The gospel carries with it the omnipotence of God, whose power alone is sufficient to save men from sin and give them eternal life. There is the cause and effect, God causes it, we hear the sound (Faith comes by hearing...), we see or sense the effects.\r\n\r\nSecond, the teaching of the new birth is unsettling because it refers to something that is done to us, not something we do. Justification is what God does for us. <b>John 1:13</b> emphasizes this, it refers to the children of God as those “<b>who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.”</b>\r\n\r\nTherefore when Jesus says to Nicodemus<b> “…So is everyone who is born of the Spirit “</b>, in summary He is saying, salvation is about God, by God, for God. <b>Titus 2:11, “For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men”; Jude 1:1, “...To those who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ”</b>. God causes the new birth; we don’t. Peter stresses the same message, \"<b>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">he has caused us to be born again</span>”, 1Peter 1:3.</b>\r\n\r\nI stress this point, we do not cause the new birth, God causes the new birth. Any spiritual good thing that we do is a result of the new birth, not a cause. <b>Ephesians 2:4–5, “4 But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5 even when we were dead in trespasses, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">made us alive</span> together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)”; 1John 5:11–12,  “This is the testimony, that God <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">gave us eternal life</span>, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.”</b> “<i><em>Therefore, when Jesus says, It is the Spirit who gives life” John 6:63, and, You must be born of the Spirit” (John 3:5, 8), and, “Believing you may have life”, John 20:31, He means: In the new birth, the Holy Spirit supernaturally gives us new spiritual life by connecting us with Jesus Christ through faith. For Jesus is life”, </em></i>John Pipper.\r\n\r\nIt is morally impossible for the dead, dark, hard, resistant heart to celebrate the Lordship of Jesus over his life without being born again. That is why we in the new birth need creation of life in union with Christ. The work of the Spirit in regeneration is to impart new life to us by uniting us to Christ. The way John Calvin says it: “<i><em>The Holy Spirit is the bond by which Christ effectually unites us to himself\"</em></i>\r\n\r\nThose who believe that people can be saved and not be changed get it wrong because Jesus tells otherwise. There will be change and that change will be evidence that the Spirit is at work. He called Lazarus from the grave, how He did it we cannot explain but we read the effects because he came back to life. Lazarus could not hear any other voice and respond, but when Christ called him, that voice cut through the icy cold grave right to the lifeless decomposing body and caused Lazarus to hear His voice. The evidence, Lazarus responded and came back to life.\r\n\r\n\"<em>The Spirit of God is a free agent in regeneration; he works how, and where, and when he pleases; he acts freely in the first operation of his grace on the heart, and in all after influences of it; as well as in the donation of his gifts to men, for different purposes\",</em> John Gill commentary.\r\n\r\nUnless the Spirit of God moves there will be no life, lost people will be stillborn. To continue. Blessings Ev"

              "<div><strong>John 3:9-12, \"9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, “How can these things be?” </strong><strong>10 Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things? 11 Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness. 12 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?\"</strong></div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-5770\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog25.jpg\" alt=\"blog2\" width=\"231\" height=\"185\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThe key word in addressing these 4 verses is the word \"<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>understanding\"</strong></span>. This is HOW we receive the new birth. Up to this point, everything Jesus had talked to Nicodemus about made no sense, his question, <strong>vs. 9-10, \"9...\"HOW can these things be? </strong><strong>10 Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">do not know these things?</span>\"</strong>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nPaul already told us that <strong>“… the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">nor can he know them</span>, because they are spiritually discerned”, 1Corinthians 2:14. </strong>Though Nicodemus was a teacher, he was in the natural, for that reason, the spiritual things made no sense. If he could not know Christ while a teacher, how is it that we hear today people claim that there are people getting saved without hearing or believing in Christ? That is impossible because there is a key, and that key is “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><b>understanding</b></span>”, that understanding comes as the gospel is preached and God opens hearts to receive the message. <strong>Romans 10:14-15, “14 How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent?” </strong>\r\n\r\nUnderstanding is not man generated, it is God generated. <strong>Luke 24:45, “Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures” (NIV). </strong>If it’s understanding we need, the question is not “WHAT” brings us this understanding but “WHO”, <strong>1John 5:20, “And we know that the Son of God has come and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">has given us an understanding</span>, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life”. </strong>He who has the Son has eternal life.\r\n\r\nJesus told the Samaritan woman in <strong>John 4</strong> that they worshiped what they didn’t know. A chapter earlier, He is confronting Nicodemus with the same<strong>, vs. “11 Most assuredly, I say to you, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">We speak what We know</span> and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness. 12 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?” </strong>Similar experience with Philip led by God to meet an Ethiopian Eunuch<strong>, Acts 8:30, “So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Do you understand what you are reading?” </span></strong>The reason understanding is the key is because understanding is <b><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">REVELATION</span></b>. Salvation is revelation only God gives to those whom He has opened their hearts. It is revelation that comes about when God takes His spoken Word and makes it alive in a person He is saving so that they understand who they are as sinners and what He has done for them in Christ and they respond in repentance and faith<strong>, “…faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”, Romans 10:17</strong>. This does not happen apart from the preaching of the law and the gospel.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Acts 8 </strong>as mentioned, God sent Phillip the evangelist to meet an Ethiopian Eunuch he found reading the word, and Philip asked him vs.<strong> “30…Do you understand what you are reading?”31 And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him”.</strong> This man was reading with no understanding until God sent Phillip, <strong>vs. 35 “Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him</strong>”. Only God could give understanding of the scripture through Phillip to this man because God opened His heart.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus talked of the parable of the sower, He tells us of the results of those who hear and don’t understand, their soil is not ready for the gospel,<strong> Matthew 13:19 </strong>“<strong>When anyone hears the word  of the kingdom, and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">does not understand</span>  it, then the wicked  one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart”. </strong>This is he who received the seed by the wayside.  The good soil has one key ingredient, “<strong>understanding</strong>“. <strong>Matthew 13:23, “The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">understand</span> God’s word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!”. </strong>Wayside and good soil candidates both heard, only the good soil candidate understood and retained.\r\n\r\nWe therefore must present the gospel clearly to eagerly waiting hearts that they too may truly hear and understand God’s word and be converted. For true conversion to take place, the Holy Spirit must Convince, Convict, Convert and Contain, which is the true gospel. To continue, blessings Ev\r\n\r\n</div>"

He had no understanding that Jesus was more than a teacher, a miracle worker and one with and from God. Jesus was and is God, the Savior of the world. Jesus then begins to talk to him about the things of the kingdom which made no sense to him.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAs He continues to speak with him, He helps us all understand what the gospel (good news) entails and He declares it in the next few verses. We must define the gospel for us to understand well the next few verses. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What is the Gospel of our New Birth?</span></strong>  <strong>The gospel is an announcement of good news of what <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">God</span> has done in <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Christ</span> on the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">cross</span> by <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">grace</span> to give eternal hope to those who have faith in Him. </strong>Lets see in the next few verses how He lays it out.<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog27.jpg\">\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The Gospel must be God centered (His kingdom)</span></strong>. In Vs. 11 To Nicodemus “<strong>11 Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen…”</strong> This refers to Christ Himself and those to whom He has revealed Himself to. Jesus establishes His deity and teaching by declaring that <strong>“13 No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven</strong>”. This is not to suggest that no one had gone to heaven when we know Enoch and Elijah from OT were taken to heaven, but rather to make it clear that no one had ascended and brought back the message of the kingdom. He is from above and in Him is life, therefore He has not sent it, He has come for He is the message. This is why He is not sending the way, the truth and the life, no, “<strong>He is the way, the truth and the life…”</strong>, <strong>John 14:6. </strong>Many of our churches today do not preach Christ and His message as He ought to be preached. Most of the messages are man (earthly) centered, appealing to man rather than Christ and have no power. The gospel that saves must be God centered.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">This gospel must be cross centered</span></strong><strong>. Vs. “14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,” </strong>The people in Moses' day were rebellious, they spoke against God and Moses (<strong>Numbers 21</strong>), for that reason God sent fiery serpents that bit many Israelites and they died. <strong>Numbers 21:8, “Then the Lord said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” </strong>God who had plagued provided a remedy<strong>, </strong>a bronze serpent lifted up by Moses on a pole that whoever looked upon it was healed and lived<strong>. </strong>\r\n\r\nJesus comes later in the NT and refers back to the serpent Moses made and raised up on a pole. The Israelites needed the serpent of bronze on a pole to live, we needed Jesus being lifted up on the cross to die for our salvation. But how can a serpent have similarity to Jesus? “<em>The serpent signified Christ, who was in the likeness of sinful flesh, though without sin, as this brazen serpent had the outward shape, but not the inward poison, of the other serpents: the pole resembled the cross upon which Christ was lifted up for our salvation: and looking up to it designed our believing in Christ”,</em><em> </em>John Wesley. They could not look to Moses for healing, neither can anyone look to another man for their salvation or deliverance. Jesus lifted up on the cross is the hope for everyone. <strong>“</strong><strong>For He made Him who knew no sin <em>to be</em> sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him”, 2Corinthians 5:21;</strong> “<strong>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God, “1Corinthians 1:18</strong>. The gospel that saves must be cross centered. To Continue, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\"</strong><strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/john-3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5823\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/john-3.jpg\" alt=\"John 3\" width=\"183\" height=\"275\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThis verse by far is the most quoted in my judgment. It is one if not the most important verses in the entire bible. I also believe is one those verses abused if not looked at in its context to make it amazing. Grace is not amazing until you bring to light what enables grace to shine.\r\n\r\nHad Jesus given Nicodemus <strong>John 3:16</strong> before addressing <strong>John 3:14-15</strong>, it would have made no sense to him or appreciated it. The same way if a doctor gave a patient medicine to cure him without first letting him understand his need for it, the patient will despise it and will not consider it precious. Jesus took Nicodemus back to <strong>Numbers 21</strong> where the Israelites spoke against God and Moses; they murmured and complained for not having water or food. <!--more-->God had blessed them but they were never grateful. They called the bread God had provided worthless. It is at this point <strong>“... the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died”, Numbers 21:6</strong>. This was judgment to a disobedient people that led to death.  “<strong>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord that He take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.”, Numbers 21:7. </strong>They did not justify their sins, or even believed they were being punished unjustly. They saw that they deserved judgment and no one to blame but themselves. In the midst of condemnation they were also reminded of the mercies of God.\r\n\r\nWhen they understood what they deserved, they did not plead with God on the basis of their goodness but God's. God in His goodness did something for them without compromising His justice, He provided a way for them to live, “<strong>8 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” 9 So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived”, Numbers 21:8-9</strong>. Jesus later tells Nicodemus <strong>“</strong><strong>14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in Him should not perish but</strong><strong> have eternal life.\", John 3:14-15</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>John 3:16</strong> has very little meaning to sinners unless you address with them <strong>John 3:14-15 </strong>which would point them to <b>Numbers 21.</b> Without these two verses, men would have an idea that they are loveable. Men would think God saw something in them the reason He loved them and sent His Son into the world. The cross (Jesus being lifted up) is where the love of God is demonstrated. Paul helps us understand <strong>John 3:16</strong> by writing <strong>Romans 5:8</strong>, <strong>\"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us”</strong>. <strong>Romans 5:8</strong> is a clearer way to see what God's love does. God acts righteously, Jesus is the act of love God demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe gospel that brings about the new birth must be <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Grace centered</span></strong>, why? Because <strong>Grace is love in action</strong>. Our message to the world must be that they have sinned against God and are under God’s wrath/judgment as demonstrated to Nicodemus in <strong>Numbers 21</strong>. He is angry with them and the only way they can escape the fiery judgment is to look upon Jesus, believe and live, that is love. <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9, “8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast”</strong>\r\n\r\nGod is love, it is the product of God that is given by God because of who He is and not because of who we are. <em>“Love is the mutual and binding grace between God and man; it may also be said that in Christ is made God human and man divine</em>.”, McGarvey and Pendleton\r\n\r\nThe gospel that brings the new birth does not show us how special we are, we are under God's wrath. It does not show us how much God needs us or wants us.  It is not man centered. It does not begin with God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life. \"T<em>he sober, biblical truth that needs to be presented to the sinner's mind is \"You have made yourself an enemy of God, and in your present state of rebellion there is absolutely no hope for you.\" In fact, God's \"plan\" for the sinner at this point in his life is to separate him from His presence forever, in hell\",</em> Keith Green<em>.</em> The gospel must show us how much we need God by first convincing us of how dead we are with  no ability of saving ourselves, that is when <strong>John 3:16 (Gospel, God’s pill)</strong> brings us life. <em>\"…, it is an impossibility that you bring glory to God, His Christ, and His cross, because the cross of Jesus Christ and the glory thereof is most magnified when it's placed in front of the backdrop of our depravity</em>!\", Paul Washer.  The dying words of one ancient saint were,<em> \"Grace is the only thing that can make us like God. I might be dragged through heaven, earth, and hell and I would still be the same sinful, polluted wretch unless God Himself should cleanse me by His grace.\"</em>\r\n\r\nMen will never learn the true meaning of grace and desire it unless they are confronted with what they deserve, the wrath of God, <strong>Numbers 21</strong>.

              "<strong>John 3:17, \"For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/images.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5835\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/images.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"218\" height=\"232\" /></a> </strong>\r\n\r\nThe first mission of the coming of the Lord was not to condemn, He came as the Savior. Not the Savior of good people but bad people. He is coming the second time as a judge.\r\n\r\nI have heard it said by some that we should not listen to what men like Apostle Paul wrote because they condemned, that we only should listen to the red letters of Christ. Those who make such arguments lack understanding that \"<strong>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness”</strong>, <strong>2Timothy 3:16</strong>. What Jesus did not say in person, He said it through other men like the Apostle Paul.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLet’s see how Christ in person and Christ through Apostle Paul help us understand this vs. First, vs. <strong>“17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world...”</strong> He didn’t have to condemn, the world was condemned already (vs.18). In His preaching He would demonstrate that we are all under sin in need of a Savior. All He had to do was to pull the curtain of His holiness and let His glorious righteous light shine through our hearts to show how sinful and dead we are. Think of this analogy, imagine a lady is cleaning her table in the morning, she then looks at how nice and clean the table looks. Not long after, she opens the curtains of the window to let in the morning sunlight. To her horror she sees dust on the table she just cleaned. Did the light create dust? Absolutely not, it merely exposed what she could not see without the aid of the light. This is what Jesus began to do especially with the preaching of the Sermon on the Mount. He drew back the curtain that the light of His righteousness would shine through the hearts of men as He expounded on the law. He did not revise the laws; He explained and expounded on them <strong>\"you have heard it said, but I say...\", Matthew 5-7.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Jews thought they had kept the laws (their tables were clean) until the Lord drew the curtains to show them it was more than actions but heart condition. Listen to what He says, <strong>\"“Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill”, Matthew 5:17. </strong>Only Christ could fulfil the law<strong>. </strong>\r\n\r\nA rich young ruler came to Jesus to ask how he could attain eternal life, <strong>Matthew 19:16-22. </strong>He called him (Jesus) good teacher just as Nicodemus did to which Jesus corrected his understanding of who was considered good, …,<strong> “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God…”, Matthew 19:17. </strong>Then Jesus told him<strong>, “…if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” </strong>to which he responded<strong> \"18 ...\"Which ones?”. </strong>He thought you had to pick and chose some and leave the rest. The Lord gave him five horizontal commandments, he declared to have kept by his understanding and not as the Lord outlined in the Sermon on the Mount<strong>. Vs. “20 The young man said to Him, “All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?” 21 Jesus said to him, “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">If you want to be perfect,</span> go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me” 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.”, </strong><strong>Matthew 19:20-22. </strong>He was given a rude awakening that to get to heaven, he needed moral perfection he lacked, he loved his money more than God. And James puts the final nail on the coffin when he says, <strong>“</strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong>For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one <em>point,</em> he is guilty of all”, James 2:10. </strong>In other words, one bad egg is enough to ruin 9 good eggs.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the law was not to make man righteous but to reveal the condition of the heart. Paul in <strong>Romans 7:9-13</strong> says, <strong>“9 I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. 10 And the commandment, which was to bring life, I found to bring death. 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me</strong>”, …<strong>13 Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.” </strong>What he hoped to save him only condemned him because it called for moral perfection.\r\n\r\nDespite the condemnation, God sent a perfect substitute, “…<strong>but that the world through Him might be saved”. </strong>The purpose of the law was to show us we are condemned already in need of a perfect sacrifice<strong>, “ Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith”, Galatians 3:24. </strong> We were held captive by the law until a deliverer came to our rescue.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with law, it is good and serves its purpose, however it has no ability to justify (save), <strong>“For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh”,  Romans 8:3.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong><em>“A sinner must see how the Law of God totally condemns him as a sinner, and then the beauty of the Gospel, the glory of the cross, the marvelous power of Christ's blood will be able to penetrate his anxious, waiting mind and heart. Only by the preaching of the Law can a man fully desire to be saved from his sin”,</em> Keith Green. The law giver was the law keeper that He might justify the law breakers (condemned). Blessings Ev"

This is the sin that finally condemns. Anyone who dies in unbelief, their fate is sealed. The downfall of the Israelites was not because they were not religious enough; it is because they counted on their own righteousness. They lacked the true knowledge that would lead them to Christ for their justification by faith to secure righteousness. They had fallen from grace (<b>Galatians 5:4</b>).\r\n\r\nI see a direct correlation between <strong>John 3</strong> and <strong>Romans 10</strong>. Here is Paul's analysis and cry to God for men like Nicodemus and his people, <strong>\"1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved. 2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 3 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God</span>. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes\",</strong> <strong>Romans 10:1-4</strong>. Unbelief was their downfall; their only hope was the righteousness of Christ to be received by faith.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nA chapter ealier in <b>Romans 9, </b>Paul addresses their unbelief as he discusses how the Gentiles were made righteous while the Israelites were left behind. The Gentiles pursued (responded) to righteousness by faith, <strong>\"the people of Israel, who tried so hard to get right with God by keeping the law, never succeeded. Why not? Because they were trying to get right with God by keeping the law instead of by trusting in him. They stumbled over the great rock in their path”, Romans 9:30-32 (NLT)</strong>. Their unbelief became a stumbling block that brought about even greater condemnation.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is not of happiness or trying to keep the law, the issue is of righteousness and how to attain it. Jesus says to Nicodemus, <strong>John 3:18, \"He who believes in Him is not condemned...</strong>”  To believe in Him is more than head knowledge, it’s to put off the old man with its deeds and put on the new man. It’s to declare bankrupt and embrace Him who is able to make you righteous. <strong>2Corinthians 5:21, “For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him”. </strong>That is to say that God treated Jesus as though He lived our lives and treated us as though we lived His life. This is called “imputed” righteousness. To impute something is to ascribe or attribute something to someone. Through faith in Christ that comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God, the righteousness of God is given to us. When we place our faith in Christ, God ascribes the perfect righteousness of Christ to our account so that we become perfect in His sight. That is the new birth<strong>, “Therefore<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">, if anyone is in Christ</span>, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new”, 2Corinthians 5:17.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat Paul counted on at some point to save him, it condemned him as he found out. Jesus said “…<strong> he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God”, John 3:18. </strong>Paul penned these words<strong> “</strong><strong>7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">9 and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith</span>;”</strong> <strong>Philippians 3:</strong><strong>7-9.</strong>\r\n\r\nFaith in Christ is essential to salvation, it is what justifies believers. Salvation is received by grace through faith<strong> (Ephesians 2:8-9). </strong><strong>Romans 3:24-26, “24 being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">through faith</span>, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, 26 to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be JUST and the JUSTIFIER of the one who <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">has faith in Jesus</span>.”</strong>\r\n\r\nHe who is righteous by faith shall live<strong>, Romans 1:17 </strong>for <strong>“In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise”,  Ephesians 1:13. </strong>\r\n\r\nIn summary, those in Christ can confidently stand on these words<strong>, “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,...”, Romans 8:1.  </strong>Those who are not in Christ Paul has something to say to you,<strong> “… the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness”, Romans 1:18. </strong>To continue<strong>, </strong>Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>John 3:19-20, “19 And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed”</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-31.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-5856 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-31.jpg\" alt=\"John 3\" width=\"188\" height=\"188\" /></a>As we have already tackled that Jesus did not come to condemn the world, but as the Light He revealed His righteousness to show that the world (men) are already condemned without believing in Him.  In these two verses above, He states clearly why men will not believe (come to the light); they love darkness (sin).\r\n\r\nAt this point would we conclude that there are wonderful people in the world if the gospel was shared with them would gladly receive it because they love the truth (light)?<!--more--> There have been debates that those in the most primitive places trying to live a godly life would be more open to receive the gospel. This has been proven not to be the case and Jesus tells us why, “...<strong> men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil”.  </strong>The Jews rejected the Messiah they were waiting for; they loved their self- righteousness than they did God<strong>, </strong>the sin of unbelief<strong>. </strong>\r\n\r\nThe apostle Paul passed by Athens where he found some very religious people,<strong> Acts 17:22-23, </strong>he says<strong>, “22…Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; 23 for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you</span></strong>:” Paul tried to introduce them to the One they worshiped without knowing. He preached Jesus that they would understand the true God, true worship, repentance, life in Christ, resurrection etc., <strong>vs 32</strong> says <strong>“And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked…” </strong>it’s interesting that out of those who were religious, only a number received the message of the gospel.\r\n\r\nWhy is it therefore hard for men to come to the light? Because sinners love their sin and they do not want anything exposing the sin in their hearts. That is the case Paul makes in <strong>Romans 1:18-3:20 </strong>why the wrath (anger) of God is revealed because men love darkness<strong>. </strong>Men suppress the truth in unrighteousness (wickedness). This brings to reality that “<i>we are not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we are sinners</i>”. That is our nature, it started with Adam (original sin) and it has impacted us all and our only hope is the last Adam.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. \"20 For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed”. </strong>Because by nature men hate God, their hearts are hardened hating everything it should desire.  <strong>Ephesians 2:1-3</strong> in addressing those who in the past used to hate the light says, “1 <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Once you were dead because of your disobedience and your many sins</span></strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>2 You used to live in sin, just like the rest of the world, obeying the devil—the commander of the powers in the unseen world. He is the spirit at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God.</strong> <strong>3 All of us used to live that way, following the passionate desires and inclinations of our sinful nature. By our very nature we were subject to God’s anger, just like everyone else.</strong>”(NLT).\r\n\r\nThis is to say that those who love darkness are dead, their hard hearts are dead and cannot respond to the light because by nature it hates it and cannot be drawn to it. Not even amounts of trials can make it look like men are making progress. Paul already disqualifies that notion, <strong>Romans 3:</strong><strong>9-18, “9…For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, 10 as it is written: “None is righteous, no, not one; 11 no one understands; no one seeks for God. 12 All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.” 13 “Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive.” “The venom of asps is under their lips.” 14 “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.” 15 “Their feet are swift to shed blood; 16 in their paths are ruin and misery,17 and the way of peace they have not known.”18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes</strong>.” (ESV)\r\n\r\nMan can try to cage evil however he cannot eradicate it. We can put men in prison, but that does not change their hearts. They may just be evil men caged but not changed. The hard sin loving heart can only be surgically removed and replaced with a new heart that brings new birth. This is God’s job, He says, <strong>“26 And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules”, Ezekiel 36:26-27. </strong>New heart will have new desires; it will love the light and hate darkness. It will love what it once hated and hate what it once loved. This is a supernatural work, this is an inside job. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>John 3:21, “But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that they have been done in God</span>”</strong>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5862\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-32.jpg\" alt=\"John 3\" width=\"188\" height=\"236\" />\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series we asked ourselves four important questions in relation to the new birth, WHAT, WHY, HOW, WHO. In addressing each of these questions, the common thread centered on the question WHO. WHO is the cause of WHAT, WHY and HOW. We started with \"WHO\" because He is the most important in every verse covered. We said <strong>“Salvation belongs to the Lord”, Jonah 2:9, Psalm 3:8, Revelation 7:10 </strong>and the climax of verse 21 points us back to WHO.\r\n\r\nAs Jesus and Paul both declared that no one is good, no one does good, no one comes to the light, this verse <strong>John 3:21, “But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen…” </strong>This helps us see that we come to the light because we have been drawn by someone outside of us.<strong> John 6:44, “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day” </strong>Men cannot come to the light unless they are drawn by the truth of the word, the Father draws by His word. This truth helps sinners see how lost, dead, miserable they are and awakens them to the need of a Savior as we have already seen. <!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe then do truth because we have been made alive, “<strong>And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins”, Ephesians 2:1. </strong> “…<strong>that his deeds may be clearly seen, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that they have been done in  God.</span></strong>” In what way but by understanding <strong>Ephesians 2:4, “But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">made us alive </span>together with Christ by grace you have been saved”.</strong><strong style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> </strong>\r\n\r\nHow do we fulfil good works if we are made alive, <strong>Romans 8:3-4, “3 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, 4 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled IN us</span> who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is faith at work or faith that works. The evidence of the new birth is good works. The good works are a result of an inside job (the new heart). <strong>Philippians 2:12-13, “12 …, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">work out</span> your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">for it is God</span> who works <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">in you</span> both to will and to do for His good pleasure</strong>.”, we workout (bring out) what God is doing within. <strong>“For we are <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">His workmanship</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">created in Christ Jesus for good works</span>, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them”; Ephesians 2:10. “I have been crucified with Christ<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me</span>; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">IN the Son of God</span>, who loved me and gave Himself for me”, Galatians 2:20. </strong>That which is not of faith is sin.\r\n\r\nWithout the New birth through the giver of new birth, men remain dead in their trespasses, \"<b>And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.\", 1John 5:11 (ESV)</b>, there can be no life or hope to see and enter the kingdom of God<strong>.  “Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous. Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord</span>”, Romans 5:19-21</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis bad news for unrighteous (the wrath of God) highlights the good news of the gospel that in spite of how far man has gone, if he is awakened to his sin and his danger and is convinced of his need for a Savior, he will repent and trust Christ alone for his salvation. God will grant him His righteousness he desperately needs and his good works will be a result of God’s work in him and not his because “… <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">they have been done IN God</span>”, John 3:21, </strong>Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 119:18, “Open my eyes so that I may see wonderful things in Your law”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5879\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-33.jpg\" alt=\"John 3\" width=\"183\" height=\"275\" /> </strong>\r\n\r\nIsn’t it amazing at a crime scene, the crime scene investigators are able to spot things that the untrained eye would not see. These men and women are trained to look for things that others would not even consider for a moment. It is amazing that two people can look at the exact same thing and see different things.\r\n\r\nWhat do you read in the following example: “<strong>GODISNOWHERE</strong>”? Did you see “God is no where?” Many people initially see this. However, can you see that it also reads “God is now here?” Perhaps you just said yourself, “WOW,” I didn’t see both statements. In the same light there can be two people that look into God’s Law, into God’s Word, and not see the same thing. The Psalmist prefaces his statement “<strong>open my eyes…,”</strong> with “<strong>Deal generously with Your servant, so that I might live; then I will keep Your word.</strong>” <!--more-->He desired that God deal liberally, open-handed, with great kindness, so that he might live, because if God is not dealing kindly with him how can he live? As God is dealing kindly and generously with him he will keep God’s Word. He calls himself God’s servant, and a servant does what the Master says. Three times, The Lord called out to Samuel and initially Samuel didn’t realize the voice of the Lord, but when it was told to him by Eli that the voice was God’s voice, he was to respond accordingly to God. Therefore the very next time this took place the Bible says, <strong>“</strong><strong><sup></sup></strong><strong>Now the Lord came and stood and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel answered, “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Speak, for Your servant hears\",</span></strong> (<strong>1Samuel 3</strong>).”\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist in this same humble attitude desired his eyes to be open, so that he might see the wonderful things in God’s law! Everything in God’s law in God’s Word is wonderful. Just think of the word “<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">wonderful</span></strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">”<strong> which means “full-of-wonder</strong></span>.” <strong>Proverbs 30:18–19</strong> tells us, <strong>“18 There are <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">three things which are too wonderful for me</span>, Yes, four which I do not understand: 19The way of an eagle in the air, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the midst of the sea, And the way of a man with a virgin</strong>”. Do you comprehend these things, I think not. One cannot put the love for his or her spouse under a microscope and understand in fullness the complexities of that relationship. God’s Word is certainly full of wonder, but when one is a servant of the Master, then the Master can point out and illuminate His Word to His servant. Why is this? Because the servant (insert your name) can say, “<strong>Speak Lord, for your servant is listening…open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in Your law</strong>.”\r\n\r\nThe spiritual senses are engaged when receiving what God desires you to hear, to see, to know, to learn, and to do in accordance and obedience to His Word. It is one thing to hear a preacher, to read a Christian book, hear a sermon, read a devotional or article based on God’s Word, but it is an entirely more intimate experience when God shows YOU in His Word apart from someone else’s echoing of God’s Word. I have learned so much through mature Christian brothers and sisters in the Lord as well as through seasoned Christian leaders who chose to stay biblical no matter where the “theological wind” was blowing at the time. However, I have learned most through spending time with Jesus in prayer, in Bible reading, in journaling thoughts, in memorizing His Word, in meditating on His Word, and in sharing His Word with others. God’s Word is like an archeological dig, there is so much to “unearth” or should I say “unheaven” beneath the pages of God’s Word, or rather within the pages of His Word. Reading through the beginning of <strong>Psalm 119</strong>, the longest chapter in the Bible, which is predominantly about God’s law, God’s Word, is when God showed me these great nuggets that you are reading today. It all started with this one verse that God seemed to illuminate off the page to me, and before I knew it, this message began to brew in my spirit, and then onto the computer screen. Is God’s Word being illuminated to you? If He is your Master and you are His servant then call out to him in the same attitude of Samuel and the Psalmist, <strong>“Speak Lord, for your servant is listening…open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in Your law.”</strong>\r\n\r\nSeek the Lord today as a servant, when you do, I’m sure you will begin to look into God’s Word and He will illuminate things to you, that were always there, but that you have never seen before. The more I grow in God’s Word, the more this takes place. If I may, I would love to suggest this wonderful resource which will help you on this journey? Find <a href=\"http://www.livingwaters.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=603\">Herman Who? (DVD)</a> at Wretchedradio.com. Also consider journaling the things that God speaks to you and going back to read the wonderful things he has shown you. Lastly, if appropriate, share those things God opened your eyes to with others and encourage them to do as you have done. Remember God said in <strong>Isaiah 55:11, “</strong><strong>So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me </strong><strong></strong><strong>void (empty, fruitless) But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall </strong><strong></strong><strong>prosper in the thing for which I sent it.</strong>”\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings Phil The Evangelist"

              "<strong>Luke 10:25-37, “36 So which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?”  37 And he said, “He who showed mercy on him.” Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-34.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-5882 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-34.jpg\" alt=\"John 3\" width=\"225\" height=\"224\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne of the comforting words often shared when someone is facing challenges is “<strong>if you need anything, don’t hesitate to call me”. </strong>Many times I wonder the reality of these words. Are they many times said in the moments when there is nothing to say, or something easy to say but don’t mean it or has very little meaning or people don’t just think them through?  And what does “anything” really mean? <!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe parable of the Good Samaritan gives us a glimpse of who we should be to our neighbors, the word “anything” fits here well. James would call it practical faith as we will see. Now Jesus gave this parable to a self-righteous man who was prejudice to those he would call neighbors in his quest to find an answer of how to attain eternal life, <strong>Luke 10:25-29</strong>. The scribes and the Pharisees did not like the Samaritans; they considered themselves more righteous than the tax collectors, prostitutes, Gentiles, and especially the Samaritans. They believed they had what it took to belong and be blessed and those like the Samaritans were not in their league. Jesus was about to straighten him out.\r\n\r\nIn this passage Jesus addresses in a parable who is considered a neighbor. The neighbor here was not necessarily someone he knew but someone in need. It’s been said that this road from Jerusalem to Jericho was about 17 miles stretch and the road harbored thieves and danger. In the midst of the story we are told that  <strong>Vs. 30, ...\" A  certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among </strong><strong>thieves, who stripped him of his clothing, wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead</strong>\". In his condition and in desperate need, help did not come from those who should have offered it, a priest vs. 31 and a Levite vs. 32. The priest passed on the other side to avoid him, the Levite somehow stopped to look and then passed also on the other side as well. He was helped by a stranger, vs. <strong>“33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had COMPASSION”</strong> This is what makes us different, compassion. Jesus was full of compassion, our desire to be like Christ is to have one of His qualities, compassion. Compassion is simply sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others. We act when we are moved, however our hearts can sometimes be so hard and rigid and our prayer always need to be “<em>God take away our heart of stone and give us a heart of flesh”</em>\r\n\r\nThe man who was wounded was slighted by those who should have been his friends, and was cared for by a stranger, a Samaritan, of the nation which the Jews most despised and detested, and would have no dealings with. Vs. “<strong>34 So he went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 35 On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, ‘Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I come again, I will repay you.’”.  </strong>Note what happened when the Samaritan stopped to help 1. He was inconvenienced- he was on a journey and this means his priorities changed. 2. It cost him money – He spent his money that perhaps was set aside for business to help a stranger who was not going to pay him back leave alone even recognize who he was. 3. It cost him time – he was delayed in his journey perhaps upsetting others. 4. He put himself in harm’s way – he had exposed himself to danger by being slowed down and now helping someone else on a road that harbored bad people.\r\n\r\nWhat the Samaritan showed was a mile of excellence. He would have done minimum, but he went all out. It is the duty of us all, in our places, and according to our ability, to succor, help, and relieve all that are in distress and necessity. James addresses this extensively in James chapter 2. His opening encouragement, <b>James</b><strong> 2: “1 My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with </strong><b>partiality”, for “…</b> <strong>14 What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?” </strong>James says our faith is revealed in our works. That if you have faith, you will have works to demonstrate that you have faith. But this is rare even in our churches today, we say silently “<i>depart in peace, be warmed and filled and if you need anything call me…” </i>but sometimes those are just empty words. The Samaritan did not wait to be told what to do; he saw a need and acted on it knowing, it was the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nAre we becoming more like that priest or the Levite that we look and sound good by our titles but stink at being filled with compassion to be Christ like? Are we afraid of helping others lest we mess things up for ourselves and get sued? Are we too busy that we somehow say bear your own burdens and we will come watch you or as Paul writes to 3 churches (<strong>Galatians 6:2, Ephesians 4:2, Colossians 3:13</strong>) and his simple message in this, “<strong>bear one another’s burden</strong>”. It starts with compassion, may Christ deal with our hearts that we become what we already are in Him by faith. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Genesis 4:10, “Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-35.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5902\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-35.jpg\" alt=\"John 3\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nDo you have a brother or sister? The one thing that makes a brother or sister is having the same father or mother. However, being a brother is different from being a brother’s keeper. To be a brother requires no effort because it’s based on biology, but being a keeper speaks of a choice, care, responsibility, and a measure of ownership. God placed Abel as a keeper of sheep, and Cain as a tiller (keeper) of the soil. God gave both brothers the same opportunity of on the job training. In the Garden prior to his son’s responsibilities, Adam worked the ground and dealt with the animals. Now his sons would share in that duty, outside the Garden of course because of Adam’s sin.<!--more--> Adam failed to be a keeper of Eve. When the Serpent attacked her, he stood by and did nothing. When God questioned Adam, he blamed Eve for his fall. Now one of Adam’s offspring would follow in Adam’s footsteps by failing to be a keeper and worse off, because Cain would become his brother’s killer.\r\n\r\nI believe that Cain priorities were misaligned. Remember that God disrespected Cain’s offering, but respected Abel’s with pleasure. If there is one thing men want is respect for their work. However God wasn’t creating a “feel good” atmosphere, but demanding a do good one that results in the feel good because of obeying and pleasing God. God is to be first (first commandment), and his Kingdom sought after first (<strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>). If our priorities are misaligned with God’s will, our lives are out of order. If one was upset seeing a toilet out of order, how much more does God hate when our lives are out of order? However when our priorities are in order we will love God and our neighbor by being our brother’s keeper. Are you a brother’s keeper or a brother’s killer?\r\n\r\nKeepers bear one another’s burdens (<strong>Galatians 6:2</strong>), killers fail to carry and pile on more burdens. Keepers pray for one another (<strong>1Thessalonians 5:24; James 5:16</strong>), killers gossip and complain about one another. Keepers challenge, encourage, and inspire, while killers criticize, discourage, and exasperates others. Keepers help, killers hinder. Keepers forgive, killers hold grudges (<strong>Colossians 3;13</strong>). Keepers follow God’s design for marriage and family; killers take their marching orders from the world for marriage and family. Keepers love while killers hate. Keepers encourage one’s ideas; killers put a wet blanket on them and spew all the reasons why the idea “can’t” work.\r\n\r\n“<strong>By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead\", (Hebrews 11:4)</strong>.” I believe his blood cries out saying be a keeper not a killer. Can you hear it, and will you respond to it and be a brother’s keeper?\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Genesis 4:10, “Then the Lord said to Cain, \"Where is Abel your brother?\" He said, \"I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?\" And He said, \"What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-36.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5906\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-36.jpg\" alt=\"John 3\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe first sin committed horizontally (human to human) is the sin of murder. Cain and Abel both brought an offering to the Lord and the Lord respected Abel and his offering, but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell. Cain instantly became upset because God did not respect what h he brought him. God knowing this didn't try to boost his self-esteem, but rather asked him three questions. First God asked, \"<strong>Why are you angry</strong>?\" Secondly, \"<strong>why has your countenance fallen?\"</strong> Thirdly, <strong>\"If you do well, will you not be accepted?</strong>\" Now whenever God asks a question it is never because He doesn't know the answer, because God is omniscient (all knowing). <!--more-->\r\n\r\nGod is giving Cain an opportunity to come to his senses and realize that he needs to point the blame to himself and not to God who rejected his offering. And not to his brother which he would become jealous of. Just like his father Adam who blamed his wife and the serpent (the devil) for Adam's disobedience, so now does his son Cain proves the old saying true, <em>\"the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\" </em>God wants Cain to get a grip on things, and to overcome the sin that is knocking at the door of his heart which desires to control him, but God commands Cain that Cain must master it. Only one was going to be the leader, either Cain or the sin. So what happened? \"<strong>Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.\"</strong> Cain didn't master his sin, his sin mastered him, and Abel became the victim.\r\n\r\nGod comes to Cain and asks another question, <strong>\"Where is Abel your brother?\" He said, \"I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?\"</strong> Cain wasn't his brother's keeper although he should have been, but instead he was his brother's killer. We are to be keepers of one another and not killers of one another. <strong>1John 3:15</strong> reads, \"<strong>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.\"</strong> It’s not just the act of murder, by the spirit of murder that finds its way in our lives if we’re not discerning. The law magnified shows that God sees murder even in the hating stage of our minds. A man can be sent to prison for drawing out plans to assassinate the President, even before the plans are carried out! One must also be wise in how one treats others, especially in what comes out of ones mouth. Proverbs 18:21 tells us, “The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit. James says, “All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man, but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God’s likeness.” We kill with our words, and our actions.\r\n\r\nGod said to Cain, <strong>\"What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground.” </strong>Instead of being his brother’s keeper and being responsible for him, he became his brother’s killer. May each of us ask ourselves today “<em>Am I my brother’s keeper or my brother’s killer?</em>” For further reading read the story of Jonathan and David and see how Jonathan was his brother (David’s) keeper, when he could have been his killer.

From the moment Daniel and his friends are taken captive and exiled, they are required to immerse themselves in the language and literature of the Babylonians (1:4), with its focus on sorcery, astrology and polytheism. This was an alien atmosphere and culture to these displaced Hebrew boys.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Although they were in an ungodly, foreign land, this ungodly land was not in them. They were in Babylon but not of it. Daniel and his friends had their hearts resolved in Yahweh; therefore they refused to compromise with their actions. Before a public victory comes, a private victory must take place within the heart. This can clearly be seen in the life of these Hebrews as <strong>“Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat….”</strong> Daniel’s heart was set on Yahweh, his friends followed him in this desire as well, but now this desire certainly needed to be appropriated or fleshed out. Daniel didn’t just intend to keep himself pure for the Lord, he desired it.\r\n\r\nIn his book A Heart Ablaze, John Bevere points out the difference between an intention and a desire, showing they are not the same thing. <em>Many have good and godly intentions, but when it comes time to implement that intention they don’t follow through, because it may not have been their true desire</em>. He says, “Desire is the path that a person will take, no matter how good his intentions may be.” <strong>James 1:14 reads, “But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust (desire), and enticed</strong>.” This verse speaks about desire on the negative side. <strong>Psalm 37:4</strong> shows us the positive side, “<strong>Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</strong>” Both verses show the power of desire. Our intentions are what we will do when it is convenient at the time, but our desires are what will drive us even when it’s not convenient.\r\n\r\nDaniel’s true desire was stated when the Scripture reads, “<strong>But Daniel purposed [desired] in his heart…,”</strong> because he acted upon that desire in a time that was inconvenient for him. He made the request to the prince of the Eunuchs that he and his friends to be allowed to eat vegetables and water, and not be defiled by eating the king’s meat. Well at first the Eunuch didn’t go along with it because if the king saw the Hebrews looking worse (downtrodden) than the other young men their age, then the king would have had the Eunuchs head. However Daniel in his wisdom asked if perhaps the eunuch might allow them a test for only ten days to which it was agreed upon. Daniel true desire was to please not the king of Babylon but the King of Kings, the Lord.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application</span></strong><strong>: May you have your private victory today, to face the public challenge when tempted to sin. by Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>Acts 10, vs. “5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname in Peter.”</strong><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog22.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5946\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog22.jpg\" alt=\"blog2\" width=\"183\" height=\"275\" /></a></span>\r\n\r\nYou’ve heard it said, never send a boy to do a man’s job. Well God says never send an angel to do a disciple’s job. Cornelius was a Roman Centurion responsible for the band of 100 men under his authority. The Scripture says, <strong>“He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly (v.2).”</strong> Yet despite all of these great qualities he still needed to hear and know the way of salvation through Christ alone. So what did God do to reach this devout Roman Centurion?\r\n\r\nAn angel of God spoke to him in a vision and said, <strong>“Cornelius!” Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked. The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">memorial offering before God</span>. 5 Now send men to Joppa to <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter</span></strong>. <strong>6 He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.</strong>”<!--more--> WOW, this man’s efforts toward godliness were noticed by God, and God wishing for none to perish was going to make sure this man and his family knew what the real deal with reaching God was. Despite all of his efforts none qualified this man to earn a seat in the Kingdom of Heaven, because those seats can’t be earned<strong>. “8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9 not by works, so that no one can boast.”,</strong> <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9.</strong> The gift this man needed was Christ.\r\n\r\nMy question is, why didn’t the angel of the Lord give this man the Gospel, but instead told him to send for Peter. Doesn’t that seem like a lot of unnecessary hoops to jump through when it would seem that it would have been much simpler to have the angel give Cornelius the Gospel? Who did Christ give the responsibility to bring the gospel to others to, His disciples or His angels? This account shows us the great responsibility Christ places on you and I to fulfill the Great Commission. In the movie Spider Man, Uncle Ben says, “<em>With great power comes great responsibility</em>.” If we have the Great power of the Holy Spirit in us, then we need to fulfill the great responsibility of the Great Commission”. God could have saved Cornelius apart from Peter, but Peter was the mailman that was called to do his job, that of bringing the Gospel to this Gentile man. This should send a wake up call to the Disciples of Christ to be active in going out to seek and save the lost by being witnesses unto Him and making disciples. Christ didn’t tell us to pray for the power of the Gospel to do its work, but for laborers to take the gospel to those that need it. And if they’re breathing and without Christ then they need Him! A farmer doesn’t sit inside the farm and only pray for a harvest. He goes out to sow seed so that he may reap a harvest. Peter went to sow the seed of the Gospel in Cornelius’ life and family, because the soil of Cornelius’ heart had been prepared for the Gospel.\r\n\r\nThank God the disciples didn’t stay in the Upper Room and just pray for the unsaved, but they obeyed the mandate to Go and seek and save the lost. Jesus last command should be our first priority. Is that true in your life? Paul reminds us, “But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.”\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application</span></strong><strong>: Lord send, not Peter but the one who is reading this devotion to someone that is ready for the seed of the Gospel to be planted in an unsaved life. </strong><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> </span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Acts 10:15, “ And a voice <em>spoke</em> to him again the second time, </strong><strong>“What God has </strong><strong>cleansed you must not call common”</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/day2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5949\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/day2.jpg\" alt=\"Day2\" width=\"188\" height=\"188\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMany of us have been told by our parents when we were growing up, <em>“Don’t talk to strangers.”</em> The reason for that is that our parents didn’t know what certain strangers would say or do to our children. Hence it was a safety precaution for us as kids. Perhaps you are now a parent and you have passed the same caution onto your children. However, can this same wisdom be implored when it comes to obeying God to share the Gospel? It would seem that the same sentiment has crepted into the church manifesting itself as don’t talk to strangers about Christ only those you know and trust. Hence obeying our traditional rule from our parents and bringing into Christianity has manifested itself in disobeying our Heavenly Father when it comes to obeying His Gospel.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nPerhaps Peter was taught by his parents not to talk to strangers, and as a “good Jewish person,” he obeyed that very well. However, Jesus made it very clear in numerous encounters with Peter:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>“<strong>Go </strong><strong>therefore and </strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">make disciples of all the nations</span></strong><strong>, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”</strong> Amen, (<strong>Matthew 28:19-20</strong>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>“And He said to them, “<strong>Go into all the world </strong><strong>and</strong> <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">preach the gospel to every creature</span></strong>. “, (<strong>Mark 16:15)</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Jerusalem, and in all Judea and </span></strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Samaria, and to the </span></strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">end of the earth</span></strong>.”, (<strong>Acts 1:8</strong>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Great Commission was made clear by Jesus, as to who the disciples were to go to and where, <strong>ALL the nations</strong>, <strong>EVERY creature</strong>, and <strong>to the</strong> <strong>END OF THE EARTH</strong>. Yet, Peter had a problem with taking the Gospel to “strangers”, the Gentiles. Therefore, God gave him what may seem like a bizarre vision. Peter had gone up to the roof top to pray, <strong>“10 Then he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance 11 and saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth. 12 In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. 13 And a voice came to him, “Rise, Peter; kill and eat.” 14 But Peter said, “Not so, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.” 15 And a voice spoke to him again the second time, “What God has cleansed you must not call common.” 16 This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.”</strong>\r\n\r\nPeter was hungry, and was in prayer, but the Lord was getting at a different kind of hunger as He dealt with Peter. Didn’t Peter remember his account with Jesus and the woman of Samaria (<strong>John 4)</strong>? Peter had come back with all the other disciples from getting lunch and they came upon Jesus talking with the Samaritan women. This was a no, no in that culture for three reasons. First, Jews didn’t associate with Samaritans and actually looked down upon them. Secondly, a man would not be caught talking with women. Thirdly, a Rabbi would not be found speaking with a woman. Jesus broke three cultural norms, all at once. He tried to use this account as a teachable moment about eating and evangelism<strong>. John 4:32-35, “32 His disciples urged Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.” 32 But He said to them, “I have food to eat of which you do not know.” 33 Therefore the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?” 34 Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work. 35 Do you not say, ‘There are still four months and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest!” </strong>There was a spiritual meal Jesus emphasized, spiritual nourishment that came from doing the very will of the Father. We all know what it is like to be full from physical food and the physical hunger that precedes it, but do be spiritually filled is a different matter from physical food.\r\n\r\nRavi Zacharias points out this same type of amazing reality in his book titled <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Jesus among Other gods</span>. He points out<em> “When Jesus said, ‘Take and eat; this is my body…Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant’ (<strong>Matthew 26:26-28</strong>), He was not speaking in a cultural vacuum to consign His followers to cannibalism. Rather, His words were intended to life listeners from their barren, food – dominated existence to the recognition of the supreme hunger of life that could only be filled by different bread. It was in that very journey under Moses that He had first told them that physical bread had limited sustenance. He wanted to meet a greater hunger</em>.” Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Mark 7:19, “All too well </strong><strong></strong><strong>you </strong><strong></strong><strong>reject (set aside) the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition</strong><strong>” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5955\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog23.jpg\" alt=\"blog2\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How hungry are you spiritually? Are you driven to the Lord to fill that hunger?</strong>\r\n\r\nNow go back to that rooftop with me, where Peter is meeting with the Lord by a vision, and the Lord is again trying to teach Peter at a pivotal moment when Peter is in prayer and is hungry, about the sustenance of true hunger. There were all kinds of four-footed animals both clean and unclean animals. To keep the Israelites separate from their idolatrous neighbors, God set specific dietary restrictions regarding the consumption of such animals (cf. <strong>Leviticus 11:25, 26) (v.12).</strong> He tells him to eat what is traditionally unclean for Jewish people to eat. Yet He is touching on a much greater truth in this account, and the bigger picture is not about the food itself, but rather the nourishment that comes from feeding hungry people, which are starved of spiritual nourishment because they have not partaken of the Gospel.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe fully Gentile people like the half Gentile women at the well, were part of the harvest that the Lord desired. This is why Jesus said, <strong>“What God has cleansed you must not call common.</strong> John MacArthur points out, <em>“More than just abolishing the OT dietary restrictions, God made unity possible in the church of both Jews, symbolized by the clean animals, and Gentiles, symbolized by the unclean animals, through the comprehensive sacrificial death of Christ. Apart from Christ, we can do nothing (John 15), and apart from Him “<strong>We are all like an unclean thing, And all </strong></em><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>our righteousnesses are like </em></strong><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>filthy rags</em></strong><em> (<strong>Isaiah 64:6</strong>)…</em>” Was the woman at the well really any filthier than Peter when Christ found him? Are fishermen more spiritually pure than adulterous women? Were the Gentiles really any more unclean than Peter apart from the Gospel? Our spiritual cleanliness is not contingent to our outward façade, ethnicity or culture.\r\n\r\nOur ethnicity and culture must take a back seat when it attempts to create a roadblock for the Gospel and hence obeying Christ. Jesus Christ transcends culture! This is why unlike the religion of Islam, which is a cultural religion, and other world religions, Christianity cuts across cultural boundary lines, because Christ died for the sin of the world. Jesus will not compromise on this issue and please recall the words He spoke to the Pharisees that were saturated in this thinking when “He said to them, “<strong>All too well </strong><strong></strong><strong>you </strong><strong></strong><strong>reject (set aside) the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition”,</strong> (<strong>Mark 7:19</strong>). They should have set aside their traditions to keep the Word of God so as to please God, but instead they had things done in reverse.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note where this interaction between Peter and the Lord took place. Peter was at Simon the tanner’s house, who was also a Gentile. John MacArthur states, <em>“Peter breaks down a cultural barrier by staying with a tanner, which is an occupation despised by Jewish society because tanners dealt with the skins of dead animals. The local synagogue probably shunned Simon</em>.” Yet he didn’t always seem to be able to make this transition so easily.\r\n\r\nChrist loved His Father and wanted Peter to glorify His Father. Unlike the mindset of the Pharisees which clung to tradition, He refused to allow Peter’s Jewish ethnicity and cultural mindset to get in the way of the Gospel going forth and thus God being glorified through Peter’s life. Jesus was pushing Peter through his prejudice issue as this was a struggle in his life, because something bigger than Peter is at stake, the Gospel is at stake. Even the Apostle Paul had to put Peter in his place over virtually this same issue, withstanding Peter to his very face (<strong>Galatians 2:11</strong>)! Peter was guilty of sin by aligning himself with men he knew to be in error and because of the harm and confusion he caused his Gentile brethren. Unfortunately, Peter was affirming the very dietary restrictions he knew God had abolished (<strong>Acts 10:15</strong>) and thus striking a blow at the gospel of grace (MacArthur Study Bible).

              "<strong>Focus: Matthew 27:1-26; Mark 15:1-15; Luke 23:1-25; John 18:39-19:16</strong><strong> <a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-5978\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog.jpg?w=620\" alt=\"blog\" width=\"620\" height=\"131\" /></a>\r\n\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nBarabbas was a Jewish national/zealot. Hebrew custom establishes the idea that Jewish parents name their children based on certain characteristics. Barabbas means “son of the fathers”; that is, “Bar” means son and “abbas” means fathers. Growing up, I bet Barabbas thought he was something special. He was the hope of Jewish history (son of the fathers). His name suggests that the Jewish nation had a lot riding on his shoulders (son of the fathers). Barabbas was the product of the long line of Jewish wise men and sages (son of the fathers). He embodied and represented them. Little is known about his parents other than that they were political figures and did not raise him themselves. It is said that Barabbas was raised by the community- being groomed for a purpose. He was not raised with a lot of discipline. <!--more-->\r\n\r\nHistorically, Barabbas came on the scene during the interim between the old and new testaments. At that time, the Jewish people were subject to Roman power. Some said that Barabbas was a ‘robin hood’ character. He was hot-headed, quick tempered, and had little difficulty using violence to accomplish his goals. To him, the end justified the means and he didn’t mind doing whatever he wanted, whenever, or by whatever means necessary. This lifestyle got Barabbas on Rome’s top ten list of most wanted men. He had led a revolt in which several Roman soldiers were killed. He had stolen from the roman and Jewish treasuries. He was known for ambushing people and taking their belongings to finance the initiatives of his motley crew. And, interestingly, we find him (the son of the fathers) in Roman custody when he is first mentioned in the gospels.\r\n\r\nRomans kept their notorious criminals in a jail that was located in the garrison of soldiers. This jail would be equivalent of the maximum-security prisons of today. This jail was about a half mile from the governor’s palace and tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe story opens with the Roman governor judging the case of Jesus. And, the governor gives the people a choice of choosing Jesus, the Son of God, or, Barabbas, the son of the fathers. Jesus was divine, Barabbas was not. Jesus was Son to God the Father and heir to heaven, Barabbas was son of human people and heir to a collapsed history and dejected people. Jesus represented choosing the divine while Barabbas represented choosing the least admirable qualities in us all. Truly, there was no comparison and the obvious choice of the people should have been to choose Jesus. Instead, the Jewish people chose Barabbas; the lesser figure, the substitute, the crook, the man.\r\n\r\nBut, this is not where I want us to contemplate. Let’s contemplate the story as it unfolds from the viewpoint of Barabbas. He was locked up about a half mile from where Jesus was at. From where he was located, Barabbas could hear the words of the crowd as they shouted their responses in unison.\r\n\r\nImagine living close enough to Yankee Stadium whereby you could hear the chants of the crowd. While you don’t hear the umpires, yet you can easily hear the crowd shouting “let’s go Yankees” or “de-fense”. You can predict what are going on because you can hear the crowds’ woes, boo’s, chants, and their cheering. Now leave Yankee stadium, if you will, and go with me to the jail cell of one, Barabbas.\r\n\r\nSo, here’s Barabbas- locked up in jail. Now, remember, he could hear the crowds shouting in unison - but he couldn’t hear the governor. He hears the crowds scream:\r\n\r\n1.Not this man, but Barabbas; 2.Crucify him, crucify him; 3. We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar; 4. Away with him, away with him, crucify him; 5.  His blood be on us, and on our children.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine what was going on in the mind of Barabbas? He had been in custody for a long time. He had not seen the face of another common person nor had he had a visitor in years, besides a Roman soldier. By this time, he was accustom to seeing the routine faces of the roman guards. No doubt he thought that the people had betrayed him- after all, he did all of his bad deeds FOR them, right? How dare they turn on him like this? He just heard the death sentence be pronounced on him. This may sound all too familiar, but the crowd that perhaps once supported him was not turning on Barabbas, the son of the fathers, but on Jesus, the Son of God.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine the dread and the fear that seized his soul. Imagine what the other prisoners thought or said to their “champion” as they heard the sentence. No doubt a reverent, dreadful silence fell over the place. I imagine that there was a long wait. And then, they heard the footsteps and the keys clinging in the distance- getting closer and louder. They heard the guards returning for Barabbas. For all intents and purposes, they all, including Barabbas, thought Barabbas was going to be summarily executed. But, something happens when the doors are opened to his cell, and the instruments of death tell him that he was free to go. Imagine the fear- yet excitement he felt as the chains and the instruments of his captivity and imprisonment were removed. Then, imagine the solemnity that gripped him when he was told or came to realize that Jesus took his place!\r\n\r\nApplication: Lets’s consider how many times we chose Barabbas over Jesus in our lives. Let us not forget the significance of the story. In Barabbas’s mind- he was as good as dead. He heard the death sentence. But, Christ took his place. It is entirely possible that Barabbas went on to live a holy life after that. Perhaps, he realized the true meaning of the exchange and sacrifice that Christ made on HIS behalf- and it was enough to turn him around and truly live a life that was worth his dying for.\r\n\r\nYou may be Barabbas today locked up in the jail cell of your sins. Perhaps you will have diner today, with Barabbas, one that is chained to their own sins. Will you be like the Roman guard that released Barabbas? How you ask. Simple, show a person, a family member, a loved one a friend, a neighbor, your mother, your father, your children, that they have violated God’s Holy Law, His 10 Commandments, and therefore are on death row, deserving of God’s capital punishment, eternity in hell, because they are in bondage to their sins.\r\n\r\nThis sounds harsh. Does it? Does it not sound harsher, perhaps evil, to let one you say you say you love, die in their sin. We love getting together with family, but that is not what Easter, Resurrection Day is all about. It’s always been about Jesus, his death, his burial, and most importantly HIS RESURRECTION!\r\n\r\nTell your loved one, AFTER YOU HAVE HELPED THEM TO SEE THEIR SIN AND THEIR BONDAGE that Jesus died in their place to set them free. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if today, there were those that repented and put their trust in Jesus Christ. What are you waiting for, you may or may not have tomorrow and the following days to live. If you have not repented, and put your trust in Christ, today is the day. If you have not been a true and faithful witness then when you sit with your family, talk in a side room, be faithful to your Lord.\r\n\r\nWhen you hear give us Barabbas, think, give us, Michael, Andrea, Anthony, my dad, my mom, my children because you desire them to be released but the Son of God, Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nMay God richly bless you as you obey,\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil, and David\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

              "<strong>2Timothy 3:5, “having a form of godliness, but denying its power. And from such people turn away.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/business-object.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5990\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/business-object.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Business object\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the effects of false teaching is false religion, a false security based upon a merely outward religion. Paul here speaks of a people who are laden with sinful practice, yet falsely profess to be in Christ. Last week, Brother Evans shared on the toxic gospel, I see this to be one of the results of that gospel, and something that largely plagues what calls itself the church today. Let he who has an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\r\n\r\nThe form of godliness spoken of here refers to a merely ornamental religion, a dressed up outward religion that does not touch the heart. One of pomp and ceremony, tradition and idol worship, not one of love birthed in the heart. <!--more-->This religion gives no remedy for sin, only a covering of such things. The example here is the growing amount in the church, proclaiming Christ, while they drink and revel with the world. True religion is birthed in the heart, it springs forth in flames of holy love unto the Lord. This person willingly renounces the world, willingly forsakes sin and self, and pursues God with all the desire of the heart.\r\n\r\nNext Paul speaks of denial, a word here better translated as repudiate or renounce, which both speak of a willing turning away, one who hears the truth, but chooses to continue to follow their sinful practices. They hear of the necessity of a holy life, but they ignore this cry, choosing rather to hide behind a false theology or some empty dogma. The church today revels in this, worldly pastors preaching to worldly churches, no longer do the Pentecostal fires burn within these sacred walls. We have denied the power of the blood, shed by Jesus to cleanse us of our sin, not to cover it over. Jesus Christ came to destroy the works of the devil, all glory to His name!\r\n\r\nLastly Paul speaks of power. The power here is the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, birthed within the heart by faith. Holiness is the proof and result of this work, not a mere outward holiness, but a purity of heart and life, characterized by a love for God above all else, and without this, I scarcely believe one can say they have Christ. There must be a change, we must be new creations, we must be born again. Not baptized, not on our church registry, born from above, born of the Spirit, now living lives wholly given to the Lord, obeying Him, loving Him incessantly. Let us consider our ways, let us turn again to the Lord, for He will abundantly pardon, He is willing that none would perish, but that all would come to everlasting life, remaining in that place by faith.\r\n\r\nIn the Savior’s love, blessings Brother Benjamen"

              "<strong>Galatians 5:1-4, “1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free,  and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. 2 Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. 3 And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. 4 You have become estranged from Christ, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.”</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/law-and-grace.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5993\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/law-and-grace.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Law-and-grace\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a></span></strong>\r\n\r\nIn my study time on <strong>Galatians 5</strong>, I paused on vs. 4 and started working my way backwards to get a grasp as to what Paul wanted us to understand. Some  have suggested that vs. 4 is one of the strong passages to show that it is possible for one to lose their salvation. I do not believe that is what Paul is addressing here. <!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe first vs, Paul is trying to distinguish (separating) between law and grace instead of mashing them together as many do, example Catholics. He says one enslaves (law) and the other gives freedom (grace). Here the Galatians who had become brethren began to add some aspect of the law and circumcision as prerequisite to salvation. Paul reminds them they were freed from the law by grace through faith in Christ and should not put that bondage on themselves and on others because it nullifies (voids) grace.\r\n\r\nHe begins to make his case in vs. <strong>\"2 Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing”  </strong>In summary, Christ alone is the hope of salvation. You add any form of works of the law, Christ will profit you nothing. This is because law cancels the grace we all desperately need.\r\n\r\nSecond case vs. “<strong>3 And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law</strong>\" Here he states again that if you are seeking to be justified by the law, then you must keep them all in word, thought and deeds. Jesus told the rich young ruler in <strong>Matthew 19:21</strong> that he needed to keep the law perfectly (if you want to be perfect) if he was destined to have eternal life by keeping the law. It was not long before he realized that he loved his money more than God. He had broken first, second and third commandment, but James lets us understand how it is impossible to keep the law, <strong>James 2:10, “For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all”. </strong>If you break even one, James says you have broken them all.\r\n\r\nHaving made his case on the first three verses, now we can understand this verse \"<strong>For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law, you have been cut off from Christ! You have fallen away from God’s grace</strong>”, <strong>Galatians 5:4 NLT</strong>. This verse is not for the saved backsliding but those who would chose to be saved by mashing law and grace. In other words, if you add law as prerequisite to salvation, you are cut off from Christ. You cannot be saved because salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone in Christ alone (<strong>Ephesians 2:8-9</strong>). If this is not how you view salvation, you have fallen from grace because this is the only grace that saves <strong>\"…So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law”, Romans 3:28 NLT.</strong>\r\n\r\nAgain, any person who adds anything to Christ for salvation has fallen from grace. Let’s read what Peter says, <strong>Acts 15:8-11, “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us, 9 and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</span> 10 Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 11 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they</span>.”</strong>\r\n\r\nAre you counting on grace plus works to save you? If you do, you have fallen from grace and Christ will profit you nothing, He is the hope of everyone’s salvation. Therefore let the law show you that you have fallen from grace, repent of your sins and receive the grace of God through faith. The bible says Abraham believed God and it was counted for him for righteousness. Those considered sons of Abraham must come through the same door.\r\n\r\nYou may ask, is there a place for works? Yes, works validates faith but does not add to faith. This is not about faith plus works but faith at work or faith that works<strong>. </strong>Blessings Ev"

I think there's plenty of support throughout the rest of the bible to indicate that a believer cannot \"lose\" their salvation. But even if you just choose to isolate this section of scripture, I think it's abundantly clear the point that Paul is making. That, if you add anything to faith in Christ, you've voided grace by adding something you can boast in. Well done Evans."

              "<b>Genesis 20:1-6, “3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Indeed you are a dead man</span> because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man’s wife.”</b>\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6036\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></b>\r\n\r\nI was talking to a young man looking with lust at this beautiful woman. He was describing what he would do to her given the opportunity. So I asked him, “<i>are you not married?</i>” Apparently his wife is fine with him looking at other women as long as he did not physically cheat on her with them. <!--more-->\r\nA number of men have said, \"<i>there is nothing wrong with looking at the menu as long as you are not ordering anything\"</i> when looking at another woman. So i asked him, “<i>suppose you had a daughter and someone was describing what he could do to her sexually, would you be fine with that?</i>” to which he replied, “<i>No, in fact I would kill him</i>” he said, to which I responded, \"<i>you’ve done the same with somebody's daughter and it does not bother you\"</i>. He was creating what was acceptable to him, his own moral standard.\r\n\r\nI share this because God called king Abimelech a dead man for thinking of taking another man’s wife, Abram in particular. In the midst of Abram's foolishness, God stepped in to protect His name and His daughter from harms way, the daughter He entrusted to Abram as his wife. God considers a man who eyes a woman he is not married to a dead man because she is His daughter and she is someone’s wife. What if she is not married? well she will be unless the Lord chooses otherwise. You prepare your young people for marriage not necessarily because they have someone at that age. Your daughter is someone’s wife yet to be and the one you lust after who is not your wife is someone’s wife.\r\n\r\nThe unsaved dive into sin and drink iniquity like water, believers may stumble and even fall in sin but God who is rich in mercy rescues the tempted and/or the fallen.\r\n\r\nAbimelech knew what had happened to Sodom and Gomorrah, perhaps they purged their ways so as not end up like them. It is at this point of being a called a dead man in his dream he reasoned with the Lord. The bible says, \"<b>But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, “Lord, will You slay a righteous nation also? “Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she, even she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this\", Genesis 20:4-5. </b>He acted as one falling by ignorance, and not doing evil on purpose. He argued that out of the integrity of his heart he inquired first for he did not desire to sin against God.\r\n\r\nGod for the sake of His great name, for the preservation of the sanctity of marriage and for the protection of those whose hearts desire to be pure but have weakness, steps in to protect His people. \"<b>And God said to him in a dream, “Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.\", Genesis 20:6</b>. We all struggle with sin, we want to do what is right but some times fail, our prayer primarily should be deliverance by God for the sake of His great name. His name is on the line. I pray to be faithful to my wife primarily for the sake of His great name. God says, <b>“...I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD,” says the Lord GOD, “when I am <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">hallowed in you</span> before their eyes\", Ezekiel 36:23.</b>\r\n\r\nWere it not for the restraining hand of God through our conscious, His Word, prayers, accountability, etc, we would be no different from the young man I spoke of. God withheld king Abimelech from sinning against Him, the same as we read of Joseph and the same desire we ought to have and pray for.\r\n\r\nMy prayer and I hope is yours is make <b>Psalm 23:3 </b>our prayer that God would keep us pure by leading us in the paths of righteousness for His name sake, to be faithful to His daughters through sanctity of marriage, and be a testimony to the world that mocks marriages.

              "<strong>“…test and approve what God’s will is-his good, pleasing and perfect will”, Romans 12:2 (NIV).</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/images.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6040\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/images.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIf you were to choose between the two: having your wish or doing God’s will, what would you choose?\r\n\r\nBefore you answer this question, you need to understand the meaning of the two words: wish and will and the difference between God’s will and man’s will. Failure to understand the difference will mean incorrect choice. And incorrect choice can result into a conflict, compounded with very severe immediate, subsequent or future consequences. <!--more-->Many people are victims of painful circumstances, frustrations, defeat, depression, confusion, worry, disappointment, failure, and losses, physical and emotional sicknesses etc. because of making incorrect and ungodly choices or decisions for their lives.\r\n\r\nWhat is God’s recommendation? Note the word “recommendation”. God does not impose His will on anyone. He gives us His view, insight to His plans and His word to guide us in making choices. He also expects us to correctly, intelligently, and adequately use our mind to think and reason with Him about every choice or decision we are about to make regarding all areas of our life (Isaiah 1:18). Listen, for example, to what he says in the Bible, regarding making choices and reasoning:\r\n\r\n<strong>“This day I call heaven and earth as a witness against you that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curses, now choose life, so that you and your children may live and that you may love the Lord your God, listen to His voice, and hold fast to Him. For the Lord is your life and He will give you many years in the land…</strong>”, <strong>Deuteronomy 30:19 (NIV) </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>“Come now, let us (you and God) reason together,” says the Lord…If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good from the land; but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.” For the mouth of the Lord has spoken</strong>”, <strong>Isaiah 1:18-19 (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nThese and several verses in the Bible clearly indicate and confirm that knowledge, reasoning and obedience to his voice, are paramount for making decisions and choices that conform to his will and ensures our blessings.\r\n\r\nHow then can we avoid confusing our wishes with His will? How can we avoid conflict between our wish and His will? How can we escape the temptation of conforming to the world’s standards instead of being transformed by the renewing of our mind by the word of God so we can meet God’s standards?\r\n\r\nIn life, whenever we are making any choices, we are either choosing God’s will or our wish. That is how life is set to operate. It is unfortunate that many people, including Christians, because of their ignorance due to lack of proper teaching and understanding the meaning of the will of God, do miss God’s best. In addition, confusion and error in judgment are major contributors to missing God’s will.\r\n\r\nWe operate on wishes most of the time. God operates on His will at all times. We keep a wish list. God keeps a will list. Often, we express our wishes and in some cases insist on them when trusting God to provide for our need. But God insist on His will; it is His will that He approves and appropriates in the lives of His children. Nothing less!<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>“ Insisting on getting your wishes is a sure guarantee of missing God’s will, for God may grant or permit a wish, without approving of it, for He approves and affirms His will only”.</strong><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> </span>\r\n\r\nWhy then do we often insist on our wishes? Why is it that often we let our wishes override the will of God? Why is it that when God’s will conflicts with ours, we choose and insist on our wishes? Why do we find it hard to say “<strong>Thy will be done</strong>” when God cannot give us our wishes? Why is it that we sometimes insist on having our preference and not God’s provision? If God is all knowing and is the supplier of all our needs, why is it  that we refuse, arrogantly, at times, to listen to God’s truth and be convinced so we can accept God’s will? How, then, can one know His will? Why do we often insist on our wishes so we can please ourselves and others instead of accepting God’s will so we can please him, first, and then ourselves? Pray that God will help you know and walk in His will. God bless you. Brother Boaz Olang"

              "<strong>Mark 11:24, “Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/prayer-changes-me.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6049\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/prayer-changes-me.png?w=300\" alt=\"prayer-changes-me\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a></strong>To tackle this vs., I open with this question, did Jesus give believers a blank check to ask for anything? It sounds straight forward \"<strong>...whatever things you ask when you pray...\"</strong>. This needs to be looked at in the light of who we are in Christ. We should be driven to have the mind of Christ, be imitators of Christ, be conformed to the image of Christ.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nBefore salvation, most of our desires were wrong, selfish desires. Now in Christ, some of those still lingers and must be dealt with continuously. James writing puts us in check, <strong> \"You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures\", James 4:3</strong>. James says often believers ask but they don't ask for the right things with the right attitude or in faith or even with the right timing,  therefore they miss.\r\n\r\nMy study of <strong>John 15:7-8</strong> helped me understand<strong> Mark 11:24</strong>. <strong>\"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. “By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples\", John 15:7-8</strong>. Look at the starting point, \"<strong>if you abide in me and my words abide in you...</strong>\", the end result, <strong>\"bearing fruit for the Father's glory\"</strong>. If we abide in Him, our will, our desires, our drives are conformed to His. And what He desires for us becomes our desires. His desire is that we bear fruit. If we ask for things that will make us grow and bear fruit, more fruit and much fruit, He will grant to us those.\r\n\r\nJesus said, <strong>“But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you\", Matthew 6:33.</strong> Mark the word \"<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">added</span></strong>\" not \"<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">given</span></strong>\" because His kingdom first is the most important. What does the kingdom of God entail, <strong>Romans 13:17-18, \"for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men\".</strong> In other words, we ought to seek to be more righteous, more at peace and more joyous, which in my judgement is the summary of the fruit of the Spirit in <strong>Galatians 5:22</strong>, because they hinge upon these three. Those who desire and serves Christ on these are acceptable to God and approved by men. This is more than changing things, it is more about changing us.\r\n\r\nLets listen more to the words of Jesus concerning those who abide in Him<strong>, \"Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.”, John 6:27</strong>. Paul echoes with these words, <strong>\"If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God\", Colossians 3:1-3.</strong>\r\n\r\nAll these will make greater sense after we look at Solomon's prayer when God spoke to him in a dream. <strong>\"At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask! What shall I give you?”, 1Kings 3:5</strong>. Solomon was given a blank check to ask for anything. What would you have asked for, more money, great health, protection? Not with Solomon, he asked for wisdom to discern (the mind of Christ).<strong>“Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”, 1Kings 3:9</strong>. Solomon who penned these words <strong>\"The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable\", Proverbs 10:32</strong> knew what best to ask for because he was abiding.\r\n\r\nI love this, <strong>\"The speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing. Then God said to him: “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice “behold, I have done according to your words; see, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you. “And I have also given you what you have not asked: both riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days\", 1Kings 3:10-13</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis is how we should think and pray <strong>Mark 11:24</strong> by keeping to heart <strong>John 15:7-8</strong> with a great example of Solomon's prayer in <strong>1Kings 3</strong>. It always boils down to, what we desire. Will it make us more imitators, mind like and conformed to the image of Christ or our own? Lets keep this in mind, what we pray for the most will reveal what we desire the most. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Revelation 3:18-, \"I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/images1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6058\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/images1.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"271\" height=\"186\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nBy secular standards, true wealth is considered to be the accumulated gain one has horded to themselves.  How sad though, that such a mindset has swept up the church, to the degree that many of today’s big name TV preachers tell the deceived masses that monetary gain is God’ s plan for them, and the surest sign of his blessing. Falsehood and lies I say. Look to our Lord, he had nowhere to lay His head, are we greater than Him?<!--more--> Here the inspired apostle pens the words of the glorified Christ, true counsel from Jesus’ heart. Here He gives us three things of value, three things that will truly enrich the life that is earnestly seeking after God. These are worth more than all this worlds riches combined.\r\n\r\n1.)    He counsels us to buy from Him gold, refined in the fire. This gold is the true, intimate knowledge of God known by all who would abandon themselves and seek Him in truth, true spiritual wealth, for the one who knows God is truly rich, not in the ways of this world which is passing away, but in eternal ways, those which shall last for eternity. The refining is the burning away of every desire but Him, all of our self-seeking, all of our asking of Him to gain for ourselves, instead of out of a humble desire and love for God.\r\n\r\n2.)    Next He counsels us to buy from Him white garments. Here is the true proof of a Christian, a holy heart and life. These are the pure garments of holiness, unspotted from the world, that every Christian is to be clothed with, for it is commanded of our God (<strong>1Peter 1:15-16</strong>) and it is required to enter Heaven’s gates, for without holiness we shall not see the Lord (<strong>Hebrews 12:14</strong>). We must be clothed in the wedding garments. The life of a Christian is marked by ongoing faith and obedience, for He that is truly born of God does not sin (has no sin as an option) (<strong>1John 5:18</strong>). The life of sin has been abandoned, we now pursue a life of holiness.\r\n\r\n3.)    Lastly He counsels us to buy from Him eye salve, that we may see, true spiritual illumination, that we may see our helpless state, and that we may bow our knee humbly before His majesty, in reverence and awe, surrendering our lives wholly to Him. We are either completely His, born of His spirit and dead to ourselves, or we are still under the sway of the evil one. We mustn’t let human reason and philosophy draw us away from the truth of what God’s word says.\r\n\r\nNow you may ask, how is it that I buy these precious gems of the Christian life, how do I obtain what it is Jesus is telling me to purchase? The price is our lives, our desires, our wills. Renouncing the world and ourselves, and offering our lives as a living sacrifice to God Almighty, that He might do with us as He pleases. Our wills must be as His will, and He alone must be our desire. We must be willing to sell all to follow Him( <strong>Matt. 19:21</strong>). Then we will truly know Him, divine intimacy with the Lord of glory, Christ reining in our hearts, now and for all eternity.\r\n\r\nIn the love and truth of Christ, and for His glory alone, blessings Brother Ben"

              "<strong>Psalm 118:17-18, \"17 I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of the LORD. 18 The LORD has chastened me severely, But He has not given me over to death”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6062\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download.jpg\" alt=\"download\" width=\"284\" height=\"177\" /></a> </strong>\r\n\r\nIf there was an enemy any of us would want to get rid of, most of us would say death. Death robs us of those dear to us, leaving us with such a great void. The more we also think of it, the more we all realize that we are on death row waiting for our time.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn the light of this elephant in the room, I pondered on this verse that I have read many times. In the past I have I had one way to look at it for application, today I see 3 more ways that can be an encouragement and comfort to us.  .\r\n\r\nTo get us started, when David says, \"<strong>I shall not die, but live,” Psalm 118:17, </strong>David was not thinking that he was immortal and could never die because <strong>Hebrews 9:27</strong> reads “<strong>And as it is appointed for men to die once …</strong>.” There is significant abundant encouragement to pull us through this difficult life with knowing our life is hidden in Christ, <strong>Acts 17:28, “for in Him we live and move and have our being...” </strong>Let me therefore give us 4 encouragements.\r\n\r\nFirst encouragement:  vs. 17, there is nothing in your life that can be cut short by Satan or any other means as long as the Lord gives you breath. Your life is in His hands, He gives you breath to “…<strong>declare the works of the LORD”. </strong>The Lord gave David breath to praise Him here on earth. Man's chief End is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. “<em>A good Christian is like the sun, which not only sends forth heat, but goes its circuit round the world. Thus, he who glorifies God has not only his affections heated with love to God, but he goes his circuit too; he moves vigorously in the sphere of obedience.”</em> , Thomas Watson. Paul said “<strong>For to me, to live is Christ …” Philippians 1:19</strong>. Take comfort you are in His hands and nothing can snatch you from there.\r\n\r\nSecond encouragement: Perhaps David meant to say never die meant eternal life. What a great promise, the blessed hope as we read in <strong>Titus 3:4-7,</strong> “<strong>4 But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">7 that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life</span>.”  </strong>We also read in<strong> Romans 8:11, “But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you”. </strong>In Christ we have eternal life, the afflictions in this life cannot be compared to the weight of glory that awaits us.\r\n\r\nThird encouragement:  David may have spoken these words looking at his legacy as a man after God’s own heart and continuing to live on through his descendants until Christ was revealed years later. In <strong>Matthew 1:1, 1:20, 9:27, 12:23, 15:22, 20:30, 20:31, 21:9,21:15 </strong>Jesus is referred to as<strong> Son of David. </strong>We desire such legacy of faith to continue from one generation to another starting with our children. It’s what we have done for the Lord that will last (live on). Paul reminds Timothy of where his faith began <strong>2Timothy 1:5, “when I call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also”. </strong>What would you pass on?\r\n\r\nForth encouragement:  <strong>Vs. 18</strong> is the most befitting reason for not dying in reference to vs. 17. It reads <strong>“18 The LORD has chastened me severely, But He has not given me over to death”. </strong>Even in the midst of pain, suffering, chastening, no one is in control but God. His rod of correction would not kill David but made him to rejoice, <strong>Psalm 119:71, \"It is good for me that I have been afflicted, That I may learn Your statutes”; Hebrews 12:6, “For whom the Lord loves He chastens, And scourges every son whom He receives</strong>”. A father who does not chasten his son does not love him. A father’s chastening is not an aim to kill but make the children become what they were born to be.  The hands that break are the hands that make, heal, restores.\r\n\r\nWhen you know your father is for your joy, you know you shall not die when the chastening comes. His chastening shall make you glad when He is done with you that you may display who He is to the world. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Thessalonians 5:12</strong><strong>-16 “…And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and ADMONISH you: And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace among yourselves. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them who are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. Rejoice evermore”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/confrontation.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6065\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/confrontation.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"confrontation\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> </strong>\r\n\r\nConfrontation is not desirable. However, it is necessary and correct delivery, and reception of it is desirable. Typically, there are three ways to face confrontation: respond, react or avoid it. In most cases, the most preferred choice of many is avoidance.  That is, not willing to face up to confrontation. This is because confrontation, of any kind, is most likely to touch on something in us or about us that we fear to face or talk about because a weakness, fault, mistake, negligence, sin, etc. in us may be exposed and/or discussed, with a view to correct, instruct, rebuke, admonish or punish us.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHave you ever been confronted? Your friend or spouse or boss or parents or co-worker or an elder or any authority or somebody you don’t even know says to you “you blew it!” How do you feel when confronted? Embarrassed, perhaps? Defensive? Guilty? Surprised? Angry, at yourself and/or at the person who confronts you?\r\n\r\nWhy do we typically react negatively instead of responding positively to confrontation? There could be many reasons, but here are four possible reasons: First, none of us enjoys having his weaknesses or shortcomings exposed or put under spotlight. Salt added to the wound of ego or pride, ignorance or foolishness hurts. And we hate anything that hurts. Second, sometimes confrontation is painful because the spirit of the other person is haughty and insensitive. Their approach may hurt or their words may pierce through our hearts like a dagger or spear. In such cases, we tend to react by staging, sometimes, a head-to-head and nose-to-nose exchange, and that can be explosive and hurt badly. Third, sometimes the person does not have his facts straight, and his accusation may be unfair, unrealistic, malicious, or presumptuous. And forth, sometimes we think that the problem or issue is solely our own and we are not willing to open up to the possibility that we can be wrong and need correction.\r\n\r\nNo matter what the reason may be for confrontation, we need to respond positively and not defensively. Worse, we should not avoid confrontation all together. That is the godly way. Many a times we may be wrong or mislead or confused and may need confrontation from someone who can shed some light, give advise or correct us. The Bible encourages believers to admonish and to receive admonition. Simply put, it encourages believers to confront one another, in love, speaking the truth with a view to correct, advise, warn, instruct or counsel. The word <strong>‘admonish’</strong> carries the meaning of “<strong>setting the mind or heart right</strong>”-to redirect a person toward a correct behavior, attitude, action or approach to a problem or situation.\r\n\r\nPaul, writing to the Christians in Thessalonica, urged them to receive ‘admonition’ from those elders who were laboring among them: <strong>1Thessalonians 5:12-16 “…And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and ADMONISH you: And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace among yourselves. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them who are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. Rejoice evermore”</strong>\r\n\r\nSo confrontation is appropriate and should be encouraged, given and accepted within the body of believers. Next time you are confronted or confronting, don’t be negative and selfish. You may miss the will of God and your opportunity to bless or to be blessed. Meditate on these for liberation and progression in faith. Be blessed, Boaz"

              "<strong>Daniel 1:17-20, “17 To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds. 18 At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. 19 The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's service. 20 In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom”.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/confrontation1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6075\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/confrontation1.jpg\" alt=\"confrontation\" width=\"295\" height=\"171\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIn the past we have looked at the true desire that Daniel and his friends had in their hearts and how they manifested that desire in their request to eat vegetables instead of indulging in the King's meat. Though in the ungodly land of Babylon, they refused to be infested by it influence. <!--more-->Instead the Lord Himself was their influence, which was evident as He placed within them the knowledge, and skill, in all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. God equipped these men to be the best of the best, the cream of the crop<strong>. Proverbs 9:10</strong> shows us why this was so as it reads, \"<strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nThese men certainly displayed this, once again in their prior actions of their food choice. Only these four would manifest the wisdom and knowledge that was matchless in light of the spiritual advisory board of Nebuchadnezzar full of astrologers, soothsayers, and sorcerers. The ungodly would not stand up to the godly. King Nebuchadnezzar summoned the four Hebrews into his chambers and communed with them finding them to be ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in his realm. Because these faithful Hebrews communed with the King of Kings and had the fear of the Lord in their lives, directing their motives, thoughts, and actions, they could not help but to out shine all the others. God showed that His chosen ones were truly the best of the best. As a follower of Christ, I believe that God's people should shine as the best of the best in this ungodly world (our Babylon). We should shine as the best parents, spouses, educators, businessmen, musicians, actors, artists, writers, journalists, and leaders of our class. By class I mean as the four Hebrews boys were the best among their group and so should we be the best among ours. And what is the reason we should be the best, but to bring glory to God.\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew  5:14-16,  \"14 You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe need to covet the fear of the Lord in our lives, in order to have the same spirit manifest that shown in the lives of our four Hebrew examples. They lived in a land against their will, but thrived with that environment anyway. Perhaps you have chosen your path or perhaps it seems you found yourself in it, or it was chosen for you against your will. Whatever your scenario may be, be one that cultivates the fear of God in your life, and live in the fear and therefore wisdom of the Lord.\r\n\r\nApplication: What kind of parent, spouse, employee, teacher, etc...are you? Are you the best of the best? Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Acts 26:28, \"Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You almost persuade me to become a Christian.”  </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/confrontation3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6103\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/confrontation3.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"confrontation\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nTo come close but feel like it’s still far is a test we all face. This happens to me many times when I evangelize, there are people who seem to be close but in reality still far, very raw. For those who appear close, we are often tempted to close the deal, ask them to say the sinner's prayer and proclaim them believers. I see this many times when reports are given of hundreds or thousands of people making decisions to follow Christ through crusades, meetings etc. And my thought, how was the gospel presented and how many of those are truly saved (God saved them). Could it be possible that we are dealing with almost persuaded, people convinced but not changed when 80-90% of those who make a profession of faith fall away? That is the question.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe Apostle Paul was before king Agrippa, he had given his testimony, Festus the governor had tried to shut him down accusing him of too much learning that had made him mad. Paul had gone back to declare the same message Moses and the prophets would have agreed to making known that he was not speaking of anything new. None of these were strange or unknown to king Agrippa, in fact Apostle confirms it to him and those present in <strong>vs. 26.</strong> These were all convincing facts through history and Torah including the big one denied, the resurrection of Christ, <strong>1Corinthians 15</strong>. But is the convincing all we need to declare people saved? Paul in writing to Timothy reminds him of how the scriptures made him wise in preparation for salvation, \"<strong>and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus\", 2Timothy 3:15. </strong>The Scriptures does the convincing, God does the saving through that which He has convinced with.\r\n\r\nKing Agrippa was convinced even though he may have tried to silence his conscious. His eyes had been opened, what he knew made him accountable, however his actions shows he rejected it. <strong>Acts 26:28 </strong>reads,<strong> \"Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You almost persuade me to become a Christian.”</strong> This was like almost being married but not. Almost is never good enough. Almost like being on the finish line but not crossing it or schooling but not graduating. The king thought this was something by his power he could make it work or not until Paul said, <strong>\"<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I would to God</span> that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these chains\", Acts 26:29</strong>. He appealed to the power of God to convict and convert. Salvation is the gift and the work of God but we must cast ourselves into the able hands who has opened our eyes to the truth.\r\n\r\n<em>\"A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God, Agrippa saw a great deal of reason for Christianity. His understanding and judgment were for the time convinced, but his heart was not changed. And his conduct and temper were widely different from the humility and spirituality of the gospel. Many are almost persuaded to be religious, who are not quite persuaded; they are under strong convictions of their duty, and of the excellence of the ways of God, yet do not pursue their convictions. Paul urged that it was the concern of every one to become a true Christian; that there is grace enough in Christ for all. He expressed his full conviction of the truth of the gospel, the absolute necessity of faith in Christ in order to salvation</em>\", Matthew Henry.\r\n\r\nAre you convinced of the truth and not converted? Are you almost like king Agrippa but your heart is still hard to bend your knees to God in repentance and faith for salvation?  Your hope is not on “Almost”, you need to “<strong>Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you”, Acts 8:22</strong> as Peter told Simon the Sorcerer. What is repentance?  It is taking sides with God that you are not a good person only playing religious games and turn away from your sins and place your trust in God through Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit to save you. You must humble yourself, be done with self. God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble <strong>James 4:6. </strong>Blessings, Ev"

              "<strong>Lamentations 3:22-23, \"Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. 23 They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.“<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/testing.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6131\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/testing.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"testing\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nOnce there was a pair of doves living in the wilderness, not knowing where they would get their next season of rain in the desert land where they were naturally born . This was a dry, hot and desolate place, no food, no water. Total hopelessness. They longed for a difference, for a day that would bring rain and quench their thirst. What strikes is a pair of doves lived in that desert, a rare case that not many times one hears! One day a heavy storm broke and the doves were disillusioned as to how would they go out to get their food, even if it meant dry tweeds from wild plants and worried to leave the nest with their newly born chicks. It was heavy showers of rain for hours, thunders, uncontrolled and untamed loud screaming wind blowing madly from here to there, it began to get cold and dark, the little doves were home with their chicks, sheltering them under their wings, warming them.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe chicks were quivering from hunger, they hadn't eaten for a few hours now, their young &amp; fragile wings were wet with rain water and the nest had been blown from its place to edge of the tree due to heavy winds. The doves were in the midst of a trauma, something like this had never happened in the desert land where they lived all their lives. This was rather phenomenal , irrespective they were heart-broken and worried, desperate for the showers to stop. Their thirst was long quenched but they were getting more severely hungry now, drooping below to cover ever so closely their children from falling off the nest.The female dove looked at the male dove, as if asking him to miraculously stop the winds- wondering and hopeful that something would happen. The male dove rose up, fluttered his wings, leaving his chicks beneath him there, and his beloved, he flew out and above to the open sky while the rain still poured. He rested on a naked branch and prayed - Lord, “<em>you are the maker of heaven and earth and all in between,\r\nthank-you for the rain Lord for this desert became more than a graveyard, not a leaf to bring home to my children . Though it may look dark and spooky, and thunders may hurt their ears but we know you are a faithful God that loves us beyond measure and knows what he is doing and is in control, so I pray Lord and thank you again, though I'm too small before your wonders and might but I believe that where I am right now is just the right place that you have chosen me to be. For where there's the desert that's the only place where I can long for water, for where there's barrenness, that's where I hope for fruits. Lord I see that if I was not in this place, amidst this situation, I would not know what rain means. Thank-you again for hope for tomorrow Lord.”\r\n</em>\r\nWe are like these little doves, wherever we are, we may feel like we are in a desert, we maybe panting and thirsty for something different, for a change, a hike, a job change, a boss change etc. etc but God knows us since He created us and He assured that He is \"faithful\". He knows what's best for us today and tomorrow.  It will be the same sun that will shine tomorrow, same moon that will light the sky. Everything will look like it was from before but its only God's blessings that renew every morning.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lamentations 3:22 \"Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.23 They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness”.</strong> Instead of waiting for tomorrow, count your blessings today, count them now for \"now\" is what matters! If you really have to wait then wait on Jesus.  <strong>Matthew 8:27 \"Even the winds and the waves obey him!\" Lamentations 3:24 I say to myself, \"The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him</strong>.\" <strong>Lamentations 3:25, “The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him”</strong>.  Conclude- <strong>Matthew 6:34</strong>, “ <strong>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Wait patiently for God to instruct you until you receive your rain showers</strong>.”\r\n\r\nIt is written in the Bible about what God said to Us: Matthew <strong>6:25,  \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?  … Matthew 6:28 \"And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you?”, </strong> Blessings Peggy Hawk"

              "<strong>Leviticus 24:1-2, \"The Lord said to Moses \"Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually\" <a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6134\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"227\" height=\"141\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nWhat is clear oil? From is it derived from -olives? Olive has a special significance in the Bible. The oil can be extracted only if olive is pressed rather crushed /squeezed. This olive undergoes painful treatment for the core essence to get extracted, which in turn becomes the source of nourishment for many. This oil has to be used in the lamps so that they give light and can be kept burning continually.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nOur Lord Jesus was crushed on the cruel cross of Calvary. Why? Isaiah answers according to <strong>Isaiah 53 \"But he was pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities\"</strong> Yes the precious blood shed by our dear Lord is the only source for our lamps to keep burning till the end. Not just few drops of oil, but it needs to be poured substantially. His blood was poured out for you and me. A lamp is only an article in which oil should be poured in order to give light. Without this oil, it cannot serve the very purpose. The blood of Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith symbolizes the clear oil of pressed olives referred above.\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 25</strong> speaks about ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five of them were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps with them but not the oil whereas the wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps. Since the bridegroom was a longtime in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight the cry rang out \"<strong>Here is the bride groom Come out to meet him</strong>\". Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps, but the foolish ones realized only then that their lamps were going out because of lack of oil. Meanwhile before they could go and buy some oil, the bridegroom arrived and the wise could go with him to the wedding banquet and then the door was shut, thus the foolish ones could not reach. Be it a bedside light or a street light or a lantern or a table lamp or a reading light or desk lamp or floor lamp , without fuel in it, it is useless.\r\n\r\nImportance of oil in the lamps is well demonstrated here. Yes the lamp is useful only when sufficient oil is poured into it.. Let us be like the wise virgins who realized the importance of oil, in their lamps to be kept burning continually. How does a person become wise? Let us learn the way since it is mentioned in the above parable that wise virgins could meet the bridegroom and were invited to the wedding banquet. And after they could enter, the door was shut and not opened for the foolish. \"<strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy one is understanding</strong>\". Well, God leads us till the end. He never leaves us nor forsake us in the middle of this life's journey. He is ALL SUFFICIENT. Our lamps need to give light CONTINUALLY, as mentioned to the Israelites. Consistency is one of the most characteristics of a believer. In spiritual terms, this moment a person cannot be on a mountain level and the very next moment fall to the ground level.\r\n\r\nOur lamps need to filled with oil from above in order to give light in a continuous/ constant/ non stop/ unbroken/ permanent way. David was at great spiritual heights but his lamp could not give light for a season due to a break caused by desires of the flesh. Joseph's lamp was burning continually though he was put to the tests of lust , prison and distance from near and dear. Are our lamps giving light without breaks/stops?\r\n\r\nLight is meant for this dark world. Isaiah prophesied about the birth of Lord Jesus in <strong>Isaiah 9:2 \"The people walking in darkness have seen a great light , on those living in the land of shadow of death, a light has dawned\"</strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\nJesus is the light of the world. The real light, and the light that lasts forever. We as His children need to reflect his light as long as we have breathe. Are we the light to this world or are we allowing the darkness in this world to enter into us, thus putting off the light?  <strong>Matthews 5:14 \"You are the light of the world. “A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven</strong>\"\r\n\r\nAre we hiding the light under a bowl? What does this bowl signify? Some tend to pretend as if they do not know the Lord. Are our job/profession/career/ family/ culture /friendship /prestige not allowing our light to shine? Are they making our light to be put under a bowl? Let us examine ourselves. Nowadays people are denying his name for some worldly benefits. \"<strong>For God who said “Let light shine out of darkness\" made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ \", </strong> <strong>2Corinthians 4:6</strong>;  <strong>\"\"Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens and those who lead many to the righteousness like the stars for ever and ever\",</strong> <strong>Daniel 12:3</strong>.\r\n\r\nYes if we resist the devil and shine out of the darkness, we will all inherit the eternal home where the Lamb is its lamp \"<strong>The city does not need the sun or moon to shine on it for the glory of the God gives it light and the lamb is its lamp. The nations will walk by its LIGHT and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.\", Revelation 21:24</strong>. \"<strong>There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light and they will reign forever and ever\" Revelation 22:5.</strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\nWe are indeed privileged to be invited to the greatest beautiful city ,which words cannot describe and we will be with the Lord forever and ever\r\n\r\n<strong>\"The light of the righteous shines brightly but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out\", Proverbs 13:9.</strong>  May the brilliance of the light from heaven, which flashed around Paul and transformed him from a persecutor to a preacher, also flash on us to transform us to meet the Lord in the air. by Sarah Susan"

              "<strong>Luke 5:4, \"When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, \"<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.\" </span></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6139\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images1.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"236\" height=\"236\" /></a></span></strong>\r\n\r\nI love good surprises especially from God. I remember when Pastor Phil was getting engaged, he brought now his wife onto a hill surprised her there real good with an engagement ring.  Tears of joy ran down her cheeks, what a surprise. Wives, remember when your husband proposed? some of you had no clue it was coming or if you did, you couldn't tell when. When he did, you just fell apart, no words to say but shed tears of joy. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">We all love good surprises for they are things we don't expect or if we expect them, we do not know when they will drop</span></strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nPeter was surprised real good at one point in his life. As a professional fisherman, he would go out with other fishermen to fish at night and have fish by morning for the market. One day, they tried fishing all night but caught no fish. In the cold, very dark, maybe windy, exhausting night, all they went through the night was rewarded by the catch in the morning. On this morning, there was no pay for the hard work. There were people waiting for fish in the market, but no fish. Here comes Jesus, unexpected by Peter. I'm not sure if he knew who Jesus was. He may have heard about Him. Jesus comes by the lake with a great multitude. To Peter, these could have been potential customers. On this day, more consumers but no products. Peter and the rest went to wash their nets, maybe thinking of how great it could have been selling fish to the new customers. <strong>All they knew to do could not yield any fruit that morning</strong>. Someone once said that <strong>our God is the God of 11:59, He surprises you when you least expect Him</strong>. Over the years, God has surprised me real good and I was left stunned and over joyed.\r\n\r\nHe might have not known Jesus but I believe Jesus was there to surprise Peter. Yes He taught multitudes but greater miracle was to be recorded when He met Peter and the miracle was for a greater purpose. After teaching which is putting the kingdom of God first, He tells Peter, \"<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch\"</span></strong>. Peter perhaps would have said something like this, <em>“Let me tell you something Teacher, we fish at night the time fish is available, already we have tried but nothing happened and by the way, we are professional fishermen while you are a teacher, what would you know about fishing?” </em>Why try to fish in the hour no one expects to get a catch? That could have been Peter's thought but listen to his response in <strong>vs. 5, \"But Simon answered and said to Him, \"Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.\" “ </strong>I have done the best I could thorough ideas, expertise I mean everything but You are the author of all things, I will cast my faith in that situation again despite what my logic mind tells me<em>. <strong>It doesn't make sense but \"I will not lean on my own understanding\", Proverbs 3:5</strong>.</em>\r\n\r\nWhat has failed in the natural, God can accomplish it in the supernatural, we can see this with God showing Jeremiah what He can do with marred clay. <strong>Jeremiah 18:4, \"...so He made it (marred clay) again into another vessel (means)</strong>\". It failed you? it will not fail Him. It got broken? He can fix it. He made \"<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">IT</span>\" the same thing, \"AGAIN\" one more time \"ANOTHER\", what you were not expecting.<strong> vs. 6, \"And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking\". </strong>His greatest catch in history, Jesus surprised him real good simply because that was his time. He did not deserve it, he wasn't looking for it, he didn't expect it but Jesus knew He needed that surprise cause from that day his life was changed, never to be the same again. It was about taking the Lord at His word and knowing the miracle was not about fish but what He will make him to be, fisher’s of men. Are you opened to surprise the Lord may bring your way? I recently had a chance to evangelize a guy I had been praying for opportunity to share with. It came at a time I least expected it (surprised) and what a joy it was. Lord surprise us today as you have appointed this day just to be our time to show Yourself great to those you love. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Samuel 1:1-27, \"O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maid servant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life</span>, no razor shall come upon his head\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/teswting.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6168\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/teswting.jpg\" alt=\"teswting\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>Anything the Lord does, He does it for a reason and it's upon men to learn why He chooses to do certain things through people. Everything God does, He does it glory for His glory and men become the beneficiary of His blessings.\r\n\r\nHere is Hannah who had a loving and caring husband. She was married to Elkanah who had another wife called Peninnah. Elkanah loved Hannah more than Peninnah for we see how they get treated when it comes to getting gifts. <strong>Vs 4&amp;5, \"And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife... vs. 4 But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah\"</strong>.  Now God had blessed Peninnah with children, Hannah on the other hand was barren for the Lord had closed her womb. Being that she was loved and cared for, given more attention, more material things you would think that would give her all the joy and the happiness, not in Hannah’s case.<!--more-->In life, we see people who have everything other people think should make them happy yet these are some of the most miserable folks why? <strong>Relationships are more fulfilling than possessions.</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe she was fine in her situation until her rival Peninnah began to provoke her severely to make her miserable Vs 6. We saw this with Jacob’s wives, Leah and Rachel. Leah had children while Rachel did not. Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and therefore Leah provoked her daily and that made Rachel desire a child. Hannah was provoked so much that she desired a child of her own too. We can be provoked by people around us to desire bigger cars, houses, promotions, ministries or anything etc but the question is, what is your motive? Yes they are good things and can be desired but the motive for desiring them can be wrong. <strong>James 4:3, \"Ye ask and receive not, because you ask a miss, that you may consume it <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">upon your lusts</span>\". </strong>At times we don't ask but many times when we ask good things we find later they were for wrong reasons. Hannah desired a child but why? Did she want a child to get back at her rival, or a child to not feel left out, or escape loneliness? This could have been her motive and therefore year in year out she prayed but God would not answer her prayers. You should not be quick to blame God for not answering your prayers when you know for sure that if He answered them, you will not go to church anymore, you will not give Him glory due to Him, your pride will take over. God will not give you what He knows will destroy you until He changes you. This is why the priority of prayer is about changing you first before changing things\r\n\r\nHannah perhaps came to realize that her previous prayers were selfish prayers (for self) and God would delay response until she changed the focus of her prayers <strong>vs. 11, \"Then She made avow and said, \"O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maid servant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, no razor shall come upon his head\". </strong>This is what I call praying with a purpose, this is the type of prayer that supercedes our selfish desires and ambitions for we begin to see that anything God is going to bring our way is not for us but for His glory and to reach others. He may entrust it in our custody but it's more than for us. Her vow was for her son to be God's servant all the days of his life. After she prayed this prayer, her desire was granted. These are the prayers that pleases the Father. These are the prayers that focusses on the object of our faith rather than the outcome of our prayers. This is life transforming prayer rather than situation changing prayers.\r\n\r\nNow I understand why many people cannot be used of God for God knows that they will love the praises of men and He will not get any of it. <strong>2Corinthians 4:7, \"But we have this treasure in the earthen vessels that the excellence of the power maybe of God and not of us\". </strong>The bible says that our God <strong>is a jealous God </strong>and He will not share His glory with anyone else. When I pray for a promotion, a better place to live, to be used more is because I want to glorify Him in all things and others may be blessed too, it's all about Him. My motive is to build a testimony that many may know that God is able Read <strong>Ezekiel 36:22-</strong>.\r\n\r\nJohn the Baptist was told that Jesus was doing the work he should have been doing, here was his response, <strong>John 3:30, \"He must increase, that I may decrease\". </strong>Because of Hannah's change of prayer attitude, Samuel is born to become one of the greatest prophets of God, used to serve many. Yes the mother rejoiced to have received a male child, but God used His gift to the woman to accomplish His will. Rachel bore Joseph who became mighty, a picture of Christ. What do you desire that you have prayed for? What was your motive? Before you pray to God to change the situation, why not pray that God changes you. When He changes you, you will still have faith and confidence in Him whether He comes through or not because your faith is not in the outcome, it’s in who is in control. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Daniel 3:16-18, \"16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 17, If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18, But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6180\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images3.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"272\" height=\"185\" /></a> </strong>\r\n\r\nFour men are brought from their land to so serve king Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. They were full of wisdom, good looking and the greatest thing, they trusted and depended on God. Everything seemed well until the king made his own gods (idols) forcing everyone to fall down and worship the gods he had made. Three men living for their true God were also challenged to bow down. What do you do when what you stand for is challenged? Situations bringing you two sides and you have to choose one. One presents you with the picture of the immediate consequences, the other promises relief.<!--more--> At one time, things were going on so well but then out of nowhere, everything you stood for was threatened. Should I blame God for bringing me to this place and then letting challenges come my way? Should I give up on God because of the new development? What is your stand? What is the truth? Are you willing to stand even if it means suffering the consequences in the hands of those who have made the decree? For Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, they were commanded to bow even given another chance to act, and they were told of the consequences (furnace heated 7 times hotter than the usual) if they did not bow. Let us see what they did.\r\n\r\nThree things in their response in the situation, First, \"<strong>our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace</strong>\". No question about God's ability, He is the God of the impossibilities, the God who calls those things which are not as though they were. <strong>Jeremiah 32:17, \"Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">There is nothing too hard for You</span></strong>\". Second, \"…<strong>He will deliver us from your hand</strong>\", what a faith to see God coming your rescue when the pressure from people and things of this world challenges everything you stand for. Wonderful words, \"<strong>Our God is able</strong>\" and \"<strong>He will deliver us</strong>\" let's see their third response to the king, \"<strong>But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up</strong>\". To someone, the last response could mean that they were not sure God would deliver them. I look at it differently, this is the extra mile walk many don’t want to go or unwilling to go, but this is the mile of surrender, this is the mile of the garden of Gethsemane experience, where you say <strong>“not my will but your will be done”</strong>. This is the mile that says, “<em>God allow me to go through what brings You more glory</em>”. The three men desired God’s will, they said, “<strong>17, If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up</span>” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">If God would not deliver them from the furnace of fire, He must have counted them worthy to go through it</span></strong>., <strong>Acts 5:41, \"So they departed from the presence of the council, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. </span>2Thessalonians 1:5, \".. that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer</strong>\". <strong>Romans 8:18, \"For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us</strong>\".  They obeyed God rather than men, this was an opportunity for them to shine for God. The situation got worse, the furnace was heated 7 times hotter than usual.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <strong>The hotter the heat, the greater the glory</strong></span>. Bound and thrown into the fire. Two things to note, 1. <strong>the fire could only burn what needed to be burnt and revealed who needed to be revealed</strong>. The fire burnt the ropes they were tired with, freeing them and 2. the Son of God was revealed in the midst of the fire. I do not find anywhere in the scripture where they were quick to get off the fire. Through their stand, the decree was changed by the king himself who said, \"<em>no one should worship any god apart from the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego</em><strong>\" (paraphrased). </strong>Three men's stand made a difference, they were counted worthy for “<strong>greater is He that is in us, that he that is in the world”</strong>. I want to be counted worthy, how about you?, Blessings Ev, God's servant\r\n\r\n<em> </em>"

              "<strong>Romans 1:19 “Because that which be made known about God is manifest [plain] in them, for God hath shewed it unto them (KJV).”</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6189\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images-1.jpg\" alt=\"images (1)\" width=\"240\" height=\"210\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFriends come on various levels.  So of us have friends that we refer to as acquaintances, other friends are casual friends, then we have our lose friends, and lastly our intimate friends.  Just as we have different levels of friendships with others, so too are there various relationship levels when it comes to knowing God.  In <strong>Romans 1:19-32</strong>, knowing God is a key word that is repeated in the passage and its interesting to see that each of the “knows” refers to one of those relationship levels with God.\r\n\r\nThe Greek word for “know” in verse 19, is the word Gnostos which means to be an acquaintance, literally “the knowable God.”  <!--more-->Men see the attributes of God in His Creation.  I find it amazing that people can look at a building and know that a builder was responsible.  Someone can look at a painting and know there was painter, and realize that everything made has a maker, but when it comes to Creation not all use that same logic to acknowledge that Creation shows us that there is a Creator!  Nevertheless God gives everyone, the whole world an unmistakable witness of Himself.\r\n\r\nIn America 95% - 97% of people believe in a “higher power” and therefore “know God” or have knowledge of God at an acquaintance level.  Creation gives natural revelation of God that is knowledge of Him based on nature.  This is what the Psalmist knew when he wrote, “<strong>The Heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament shows His handiwork.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Expositors Bible Commentary points out<strong> “Natural revelation is sufficient to make man responsible, but is not by itself sufficient to accomplish his salvation”. </strong>Four characteristics are noted. First, it is a clear testimony set before the eyes of men, as the word \"<strong>plain</strong>\" implies. Second, from the use of \"<strong>understood</strong>,\" the revelation does not stop with perception, but is expected to include reflection, the drawing of a conclusion about the Creator. Third, it is a constant testimony, maintained \"<strong>since the creation of the world</strong>\" (cf. Acts 14:17). Fourth, it is a limited testimony in that it reflects God in certain aspects only—namely,<strong> \"his eternal power and divine nature.</strong>\" One has to look elsewhere for the disclosure of his love and grace—i.e., to Scripture and especially to the revelation of God in His Son <strong>John 1:14.</strong>\r\n\r\nAll created beings are accountable before God whether one believes in Him or not, or follows Him obediently or not.  There are so many that have this kind of acquaintance relationship with God, and that is where everyone starts, “knowing God” as Creator only, but not as Father.  It is the difference of a boy that has seen a picture, and lives in the home provided for by his biological father, but the boy has never developed a relationship with his biological father.  With no relationship, that father is just the sperm donor, and all the boy knows about his father is what he can see when he looks in the mirror and knows that there are similar attributes to his father, but void of relationship.\r\n\r\nDo you feel that God is a distant Creator and not your Father?  God desires that we call out to the One that has made the skies, the trees, the sun, moon stars, and you that you see daily.  God doesn’t want us to know Him merely as an acquaintance, as Creator, but as Father. This is level 1  To be continued…\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Romans 1:21-23, </strong>“<strong>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6195\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images5.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"images\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nWe looked at <strong>Romans 1:19</strong> and how Paul spoke about those who “knew” God by Creation, and how this alone leaves the relationship with Him at the level of what we may refer to as an acquaintance.  This level of knowing God is sufficient to make man responsible, but is not by itself sufficient to accomplish His salvation.\r\n\r\nPaul continues in <strong>Romans 1</strong>, about knowing God where he spoke about those that “knew God.” If these people knew God, why did they display a lack of thanks to Him, and why foolish, darkened hearts that worshipped idols? The Greek word used here for “know” is “<em>Ginosko</em>” which means to allow, be aware of, feel, or perceive, etc…<!--more--> If these people knew God they certainly had a “funny” way of showing it. When looking into the history of humanity a willful rejection of God’s revelation of Himself can be traced. Even though these knew God via Creation, humanity failed to act upon it, and thus God was not worshipped by those whom Paul is addressing here. Humanity was created to worship, and if humanity fails to worship the One True God, they will worship someone or something else certainly, and in this case their choice idol was images made to look like man, as well an the animal species.\r\n\r\nRecall in Exodus when Moses was on Mt. Sinai receiving God’s Law. While Moses was on the mountain where were the rest of the Israelites? They were at the bottom of the mountain creating an idol, the Golden Calf. Now this strikes me with great humor on the part of the High Priest Aaron. Aaron tries to explain away the Golden Calf, even though he clearly submitted to the will of the people in their darkened imagination and desire to create a god for them to worship. After collecting gold earrings and trinkets, he melted them down and out of the pliable gold, fashioned a Golden calf. When Moses comes back form Sinai, Aaron tells him “<strong>They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. So I told them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.’ <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!</span>”</strong> This excuse makes me laugh that Aaron threw some gold in the fire and like a “genie” a calf popped out!\r\n\r\nMany people gather the darkened imaginations of others and fashion those ideas together and create a god to suit their sins, one they are comfortable with. Then they worship the god by their foolish darkened hearts. For this reason God commands us to love not the world, and if anyone loves the world the love of God is not in him. The world is a system of thinking that is opposed to the God of truth, justice, love, and holiness. Adam tried to hide on God in the trees when he sinned because his heart became darkened. It would be easier to try and cover the brilliance of sun with a blanket than to try hiding from God. David wrote, “<strong>Where can I flee from Your presence</strong>….” Filled with “intellectual pride” many “claim to be wise,” and try and justify their idol worship, just to reveal “their foolish hearts are truly darkened.” We need to be in God’s Word daily so that the light of His truth can flood our hearts daily, and leave no room for the darkness to enter in and thus worship Him! To continue, <strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt; </strong>"

              "<strong>Romans 1:28 “Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images6.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-6230 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images6.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nMoral perversion brings mental perversion. Paul writes about those that did not like to retain God in their minds and how their minds were affected by such a decision. The mind is a very powerful place. Perhaps the human mind is one of the most powerful things on earth next to God. With the mind, humankind has placed men on the moon, we can send information by the click of a button around the globe, we can breathe underwater using SCUBA gear, etc…. our mind controls our actions, and whoever or whatever controls our minds will certainly control us.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAt the time when Paul was writing Paul addressed that there were those people who refused to see it to be rational and relevant to acknowledge God. If one acknowledges God then it stands to reason that the one is accountable to God as their Creator. Many do not desire to acknowledge God and therefore create idols and systems that are secular (without God). As ones conscience convicts them of breaking God’s Law, and as Creation proves there is a Creator, some still refuse to give in and submit to God, and one’s pride keeps them from retaining the knowledge of God. One can sit in a class and hear information, or read a book, but retaining information is when that information becomes part of a person. Each of us can attest to this when we have studied for our tests, and although we reviewed the material, there was some information, or formulas that we did not retain at that time, and the test revealed that to us.\r\n\r\nWhat did God do because many felt it undesirable, or unnecessary to retain the knowledge of God? God “gave them over to a depraved (reprobate-KJV) mind to do what ought not to be done.” The word “reprobate” (<em>adokimion</em>) means “rejected after testing.” God would reject those that rejected him, because He gave many chances to them, notice they were rejected after testing, not prior to. Man was created in God’s image and because of sin that image has been distorted, and only through Christ can that image be restored to its rightful place whereby God intended it to be. At salvation God pronounced a divorce from us to our father the Devil that “nourished us” with the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, and called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. John writes that men stay in darkness because men love darkness rather then light, because light exposes us for who we really are. Just as the sunlight reveals the dust on the surface of a table that has just been dusted, likewise does the light of God’s truth reveal our lives, our minds in truth. <strong>Hebrews 4:12</strong> states, “<strong>For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword,…<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart [mind]</span></strong>.” God gave these men up to minds which held thoughts that He disapproved of to the judgment of their sin. That sinful mind will go head to head with God on Judgment and their will be no excuses to appease the Judge of the universe. These men because of their darkened minds did those acts which ought not to be done.” Through our conscience and Creation, God still has shown us right from wrong. We desperately need Christ so we can think right, about God, others, and ourselves. Is He in you! “<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus”, (Philippians 2:5).</span>” </strong>Don’t only read His Word, but obey it!\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Exodus 7:8</strong><strong>–</strong><strong>10, “8Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 9 “When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Show a miracle for yourselves,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and cast it before Pharaoh, and let it become a serpent.’ ” 10 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as the LORD commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images7.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-6238 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images7.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"216\" height=\"146\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nHow does one come to trust someone in the midst of trials? Who do you know you can go to when you must do something that causes you to become uneasy about the possible outcomes? Perhaps you turn to a spouse, a best friend, a co-worker, a parent, grandparent, or a sibling. Do you believe God to be trustworthy? Let’s look to Moses to discover what Moses discovered about how God builds trust for trials on the horizon.\r\n\r\nMoses was called by God to be Israel’s deliverer. Surely God could easily destroy all the Egyptians, just as he killed the firstborn son of the Egyptians when sending the tenth plague. However, like many times, God chooses to send a man to display the His power.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn the desert God commanded Moses to throw down his staff. What did Moses have to loose, he didn’t know it was going to become a serpent. Then God asked Moses to pick it up by the tail. Now, perhaps Moses was not as quick to do so, after all what if he would have been bitten. Yet Moses picks up the serpent by the tail showing his trust and it became a rod once again. Soon after, Moses finds himself standing with his brother Aaron in front of the most powerful man in Egypt, Pharaoh himself. Now again God is asking for a rod to be cast down to allow it to become a serpent. Moses did it alone before God, but could he instruct Aaron to do it before Pharaoh? Moses obediently instructs, Aaron obeys, and the staff becomes a serpent before Pharaoh. Pharaoh calls in his magicians (sorcerers) and they duplicate the same miracle causing their thrown down staffs to become serpents. However, Aaron’s rod (serpent) swallowed their rods (serpents). “<em>The loss of the magicians’ rods in this fashion gave evidence of the superiority of God’s power when Aaron’s rod gulped down theirs”,</em> (MacArthur). From God in the desert to Pharaoh in the palace, why did God allow a “trial run” on this miracle and then perform it a second time? Perhaps these reasons will shed some light.\r\n\r\nMiracle of the rod before God\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>God allowed Moses to build trust in Him for trials on the horizon.</li>\r\n\t<li>God showed Moses, if he could trust God in this miracle, He can trust God in others.</li>\r\n\t<li>God showed Moses, when he throws something down before God, God can change it!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nMiracle of the rod before Pharaoh\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n\t<li>God showed Moses he could trust the Lord even when things look to be seemingly going in the wrong direction.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Romans 8:28</strong>, “<strong>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. </strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Hebrews 11:27</strong>, “<strong>By faith he (Moses) forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nHow is God trying to build up your trust to face trials on your horizons? What is God asking you to trust him in and are you doing so? Throw it down, and pick it up changed by God. Blessings Pastor Phil"

Aaron and Hur held his hands up</strong><strong>—</strong><strong>one on one side, one on the other</strong><strong>—</strong><strong>so that his hands remained steady till sunset. 13 So Joshua overcame the Amalekites army with the sword.”<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images8.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-6243 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images8.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nUsually people are very tensed in battles, no one knows what the outcome will be…..Their life is in jeopardy...severe danger /hazard ...In the battlefield, the men fighting are at the heights of stress and tension/ agony. Ultimate aim is to defeat and destroy the enemy..<strong>No matter what </strong>…..But the Israelites had great comfort, even in the face of the fierce battle, the savage war that they all were being supported by prayer …What a privilege, it was for the Israelites that they had a leader who was upholding them all in prayer –intercessory prayer…Though all the others were perishing in tension, these people had great source of comfort ….<!--more-->Moses said to Joshua ”<strong>Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands</span>”</strong> Moses assured Joshua and all his fighting men that he would stand on their behalf with the staff of GOD in his hands….the staff of God which parted the Red Sea; the staff when struck the rock and water gushed out and quenched the thirst of lakhs of the Israelites; the staff when stretched, God sent an east wind which brought locusts that invaded Egypt …This staff in Moses hands was anointed by God to perform endless miracles and finally God delivered Israel from bondage of Egypt….\r\n\r\nNow we are also in continuous warfare /battle with the dark forces, <strong>\"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms”, Ephesians 6:12 </strong>...Though it seems terrible, we have a great intercessor... Indeed we are more privileged than the Israelites …since we have a high priest who can sympathize with all our weaknesses, whose hands never grow tired, whose hands need not be held by any other person….This intercessor intercedes for us round the clock …<strong>Hebrews 7:25, \"He was a priest not on the basis of relation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of indestructible life</strong>\"... The staff in his hands -the cruel cross of Calvary on which he died, gives us great peace.\r\n\r\nDavid summarizes his total life in brief and sweet <strong>Psalm 23</strong> where he narrates his experiences .\"<strong>Even though I walk through the valley of shadow of death, I will fear no evil ...Thy rod and thy staff comfort me\",  Psalms 23 </strong>Right, David does not speak of the valley of death but \"<strong>valley of shadow of death\" </strong>....It is a continuous process...The shadow of death or following of death throughout our life...Amidst this frightful/horrifying encounters also, His staff is our comfort ... While the rod disciplines, the staff comforts….A staff in the hand of a shepherd is of great importance in taking care/managing/administering the sheep..\r\n\r\nAlso it is used by people to lean upon...It is a comfort to have something to lean upon when you cannot stand the situation...<strong>Genesis 47:31</strong> speaks of an old ,exhausted person, Israel who worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff ...Yes, this staff provides endless relief and solace ..So the staff in the hands of Moses which symbolizes the Cross of our Lord Jesus is our great comfort /consolation/ solace /satisfaction and we are more than conquerors,  even in the most dreadful valley !  \"<strong>But Thanks be to God!

              "<p><strong>Philippians 2:12-13, \"12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">13 for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure\"</span></strong>\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images9.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6269\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images9.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"236\" height=\"236\"/></a></strong>\n\nAs I continue to study closely the writings of the Apostle Paul, I discover a common thread in how he says things about himself and how they came about. If I was to use the movie setting to make his overall point, Christ is the main character/cast while he took the supporting role. This is important because the supporting cast have a role to make the main character shine by how they fit in. Apostle Paul took the supporting role depending on God through Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit to empower him to become what God had in store for him.\n\nThe tragedy of today, many believers want to be the main character in the movie, the songs are about man, the books stores are filled with \"how to be\" books. People even have back up plans for running their lives, marriages, churches, leading people to the Lord. In short leaning on self and not on the sufficient power of God to save and keep.<!--more-->\n\nApostle Paul in the verse above tells us of what is required of believers and then tells us the effectual working of God in believers to be what God requires of them. When I talk of effectual, I’m talking about the ability to produce a desired effect. Other Synonyms for effectual are effective, efficient, fruitful, operative, potent, productive.\n\nI want drive briefly two points, Effectual calling (justification) and Effectual living (sanctification). They are all under the umbrella of the effectual working. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Salvation is the effectual calling of God, </span></strong>the &nbsp;power of God unto salvation, <strong>1Corinthians 2</strong>, <strong>Romans 1:16. </strong>&nbsp;This is the action of the Holy Spirit in producing conviction of sin and bestowing the gift of faith in Christ to those being saved, <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9</strong>. Paul acknowledging the work of God in salvation pens these words,&nbsp; <strong>1Thessalonians 2:13, \"For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe.\"&nbsp; </span></strong>This is justification (declared not guilty) something done for us by God, <strong>“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him”, 2Corinthians 5:21.</strong>\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Effectual living (sanctification)</span></strong> is what God does in us and we live out what He does in us, meanwhile Justification is something God does for us. Paul says “...<strong>work out your own salvation</strong>…” this is not to be confused with working to be saved but working because your are saved. Sanctification is a state of separation unto God; all believers enter into this state when they are born of God: “<strong>But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—and righteousness and sanctification and redemption\"</strong>, <strong>1Corinthians 1:30.</strong>\n\nHere are some thoughts on effectual living (sanctification):-\n</p><ol>\n\t<li><strong> <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I live because He lives</span></strong>, <strong>Galatians 2:20</strong>, “<b>I</b><strong>&nbsp;have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me</strong>”; <strong>Acts 17:28, \"for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> I work because He works in me,</span></strong> <strong>Galatians 2:8, “ (for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles)”;</strong> <strong>Philippians 1:6, \"</strong><strong>being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ\"</strong><strong>; Philippians 4:13, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”; 1Corinthians 15:10, “ But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me</strong>”</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I know him because I am known of Him</span></strong>, <strong>Galatians 4:9, \"But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?\"</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I pray because He prays through me</span>, Romans 8:26, “ Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered</strong>.”</li>\n</ol>\nPaul avows that he has power to \"strive\" in spirit for his converts only as Christ works in him and by Him , <strong>Colossians 1:29, \"To this end I also labor, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">striving according to His working which works in me mightily</span></strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\" </span>for “<strong>13 for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure\", Philippians 2:13.</strong>\n\nEven though it’s the Lord who keeps us from falling and present us faultless in His presence with exceeding joy (<strong>Jude 1:24</strong>), this does not mean that we have no part to play. Paul says the Philippians obeyed and should continue even in Paul’s absence (action on their part). Paul knowing that only through the effectual working of Christ did they have the ability to obey. In our lives, our marriages, family, work place, live holy life, pray, evangelize etc, we need the effectual working of the Holy Spirit to live, work, know, pray and more. Blessings, Ev"

              "<p><strong>John 11:43, ”When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out””</strong>\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images10.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6276\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images10.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"images\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"/></a></strong>\n\nThis is the familiar account of the resurrection of Lazarus, sister to Mary and Martha.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Lesson 1 - Jesus Timing is not always our Timing</span></strong> - “<strong>Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days (v. 11).”</strong> Isn't it puzzling to our human minds to think that upon hearing of Lazarus’ sickness, Jesus didn't treat that news like a 911 call? No Jesus stayed where he was another two days before He left to be with Lazarus. There are times when we call upon Christ in prayer and He says not yes or no, but wait. The Palmist said, <strong>“I waited patiently for the LORD? he turned to me and heard my cry”, Psalm 40:1.</strong> It’s in the waiting on God that we learn to trust Him. We live in an society of instant gratification of minute rice, e-mail, cell phones, etc…. However God lives outside of time and therefore is not bound by it. To God all time is now. Noah’s flood and your situation are not worlds apart in light of eternity. <!--more-->One day in eternity we will understand this, but now we are bound by time. When Jesus finally arrived on the scene Martha shares that if Jesus had only been there while Lazarus was sick he would not have died. Again she was thinking about human timing verses God's&nbsp;timing, but how can we blame her, after all she was human, and her faith was being tested.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Lesson 2 - Jesus reveals His identity </span></strong>- <strong>“23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” 24 Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; 26 and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” 27 “Yes, Lord,” she told him, “I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”</strong> Jesus was trying to help her see that she was thinking of the resurrection as an event, and Jesus was showing her that His identity was the resurrection. Jesus was the great I AM that He proclaims in <strong>John 8:58</strong>, <strong>“before Abraham was born, I Am</strong>!” It’s crucial for us to know not just what Christ can do, but who He is, because it is because of who He is that translates to what He does.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Lessons 3 - Jesus uses people to do His Work </span></strong>- Jesus gave two commands for others to do to take part in Lazarus’ miracle. First Jesus commanded them <strong>“Take away the stone,” to which Martha replied, “by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.</strong>” Secondly, Jesus said to them, <strong>“Take off the grave clothes and let him go.”</strong> Now Jesus and only Jesus could have called Lazarus back from the dead. It’s been said “<em>When E.F. Hutton speaks people listen</em>.” However death would have placed its icy hands of its ears if E.F. Hutton had said Lazarus come forth. But when Jesus cried with a loud voice “<strong>Lazarus come forth</strong>,” “<em>The words of Jesus cut through the icy grip of death like a white - hot blade through soft powered snow\",</em>&nbsp;Ray Comfort. Not even death could silence the words of the great I AM, the Resurrection and the life, because death had to concede, and forfeit the victory to life. Surely if He could raise the dead, He could move His own stone. Didn’t an angel move His stone in His resurrection? Yet, Jesus commanded the stone to be moved by others. There are times when we need to preach the Law of God to the stony heart of a sinner so the stone is moved to make way for the gospel seed to be planted. <strong>Mark 4</strong> makes this clear. God told <strong>Ezekiel 36</strong>, “<strong>19 I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. 20 Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God.</strong>” Their heart needs the stone moved. And God called us to preach His Word, and if we are speaking to a prideful hearted person, their heart of stone needs to be moved and by using the Law of God to break the hard heart, and then use the gospel to heal the broken hearted. Jesus calls the dead sinner to life, and then we are to be used to remove the grave clothes. New converts will have some of the stench of the world upon them and be wrapped in the grave clothes of some old worldly habits and thoughts, and it is our job to help remove the grave clothes, that is make a disciple out of this person.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application</span></strong>: Do you wait for His timing patiently? Do you know His identity? Are you being used by God to remove stones in evangelism and grave clothes in discipleship? Jesus prayed, “Not my will but your be done” <strong>Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong></p>"

              "<strong>Deuteronomy 2:1-4, \"...You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6284\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"images\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIt's easy to talk about trust and be led of God but when it comes to the actual action it becomes a little bit hard because of what we have trained ourselves to think of ourselves. I don't know how many times I have talked about trusting in God to lead and then felt like I was by myself or I did not see how things were going to come out in the long run. <strong>If you've noticed, the Lord tells us things but He never explains Himself.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen God called the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, the plan was to bring them to the promise land. <strong>When the Lord begins to do something, He already has an end result for it </strong>and so <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">when He begins to do it, it's not for Him to try and see if it would work but for Him to finish what He has began</span></strong>. We can start with Him and then give up but He will not.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nNow we see Him bring His people through the desert ultimately that He may bring them to the land He promised. Then all of a sudden there are obstacles, barriers, partitions, walls, valleys just to mention a few. God did not tell them what it will take to bring them there meaning the process. Thank God that He does not always tell us the process but the purpose. If some of us knew the process, we would give up before we even go far. David was promised that He would be the next king, God did not tell him that He would have to wait 17years, be wanted dead by Saul and face many challenges. Joseph receives a dream and he is not told that dream to be accomplished, he will have to be thrown into the pit, sold to Egypt, be thrown in jail and then receive it. If these two guys ever knew the process, I bet they would have thought twice about what they desired or rather what God desired for them.\r\n\r\nWhile in the desert, the children of Israel are brought by the mount Sinai and they camped there many days. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The Lord may bring you through the desert but He will not leave you in the dessert</span></strong>. That's why we always need to be reminded that we are <strong>nomadic people</strong>. If we stop somewhere, it will be just for a season and not forever. Someone once said, \"<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">never build permanent decisions on temporary circumstances</span></strong>\" As nomadic people, we are always packed up so that we can pass over. It's easy to settle at a place where you don't fight anymore, the same case with the Israelites, peacefully sitting by the mountain. God then says, <strong>\"You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward\"</strong> meaning it's time to make a stand and move forward. Yes I brought you to this mountain but this was part of the process to get you ready for the promise land. I know how I struggle with this at times because I tend to be too territorial when I know for sure that God was just using something as a bridge. He will bring me to certain places just to rest and then move me to the next level. He wants me to go Northward as there is something about Northwards, it's in His plan. Going forward would mean fighting our way through, as you read down in the same chapter, you see how they begun to fight many enemies before they possessed. They were not told that they would fight but that was part of the process.\r\n\r\n“<em>Lord I don't know where I am at this point but I know that I need to move forward, some of the things I ever trusted you with Lord, you want to accomplish them in me. Lord speak through your word to cause me to take a stand and move Northwards and may you accomplish what you have started in me. Your word says, “<strong>being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;”, Philippians 1:6</strong>. I know how territorial I can be and how this causes my faith to be dormant but when I know that I am still on the move, I will trust you to take me to the next place (level) for Your glory”.</em> It will be tough when you know that what you have accomplished is not the end but the middle as that was part of His process to accomplish His purpose. Maybe His process is to build you up in ministry, singing, intercession, strong in the word, walking with Him etc,. <strong>If He promised, sure enough He will accomplish it but the question is, CAN YOU STAND THE PROCESS? Blessings Ev</strong>."

              "<strong>Luke 5:1-11, \"...Master we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your Word, I will let down the net\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images12.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-6294 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images12.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"236\" height=\"275\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nPeter and his friends were professional fishermen, their life occupation. They knew fish seasons and where to fish as experts. On this particular night, they caught nothing having fished all night long. The morning come, they were disappointed and all they can do was wash their nets. Customers were going to expect fish, they needed to make money, they needed to feed their families. I can imagine them pondering over what they will tell the people. In simple, their normal, daily routine had been interrupted and brought to a halt. Have you ever be at a place where everything you knew how to do at your job or at home all of a sudden was interrupted and those looking up to you were disappointed in you? Hang on, help is on the way.\r\n\r\nJesus came by and was teaching the word of God. He had great multitude listening to Him teach. Great thing about Him, He comes right when there is a need. In as much as people need a touch from Him, everyone has a different need and my need may not be yours. He saw a boat and requested to use as a pulpit to preach.<!--more--> Peter was asked to move the boat closer to the shore and he faithfully did it even in the midst of his disappointments. Jesus wanted to do something big and so He prepares everyone by teaching them. It is not mentioned to us as what He was teaching on, perhaps “faith”. Peter must have been listening carefully for the bible says in <strong>Romans 10:17, \"… faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord\". </strong>After Jesus did the Kingdom's work, He tells Peter to launch into the deep, meaning cast his nets again in the same place he had tried fishing last night. Listen to his response \"<strong>Master we have toiled all night and caught nothing; <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">nevertheless at Your Word, I will let down the net</span>\"</strong>. It's easier to hear the word, “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">try another place</span><strong>” </strong>but to <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">try the same place???.</span> Yes you might have tried surviving in the same job and you already lost hope and instead of Him telling you to move on, He tells you to cast your nets again. You may have applied for a promotion and nothing has come through because of frustrations, instead of Him telling you to move out, He is telling you to cast your nets again in the same position. <strong>It's not about what we know, what we can do or qualified to do, it's about what God can do when we can't do it. </strong>It's being obedient to the word of God to the point where you do as He has said regardless of what you know. It may never make sense but the key word is “<strong>be obedient</strong>”. After all, many things that God say don't make sense and if you tried to make sense out of them, you will never get anywhere because while you are busy making sense out of them, your blessings will be passing you by.\r\n\r\nPeter's obedience moved the Lord to provide the biggest catch in his history of fishing. He began to call on his friends to come out and help pull the nets which proves <strong>Proverbs 10:22, \"The blessings of the Lord maketh rich and adds no sorrows with it\". </strong>The blessings of the Lord overtakes as the bible continues to say <strong>“try me and see if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour you out blessings that you will not have enough room to contain all of them</strong>”. What I'm I saying? Y<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">our place of misery could be your place of blessings</span><strong>, </strong>but you have to have the faith and take Him at His word. Had Peter explained how professional he was, and how he had done this for many years and refused just to apply the simply instruction, the blessing would have passed him by.\r\n\r\nWhile this miracle is big, the message is not in the miracle, the message is in the bigger picture of what Christ would do through Peter by faith to bring souls into the kingdom. Even when the Lord blesses His children, there is always a bigger picture yet to be revealed. In short, the blessing is bigger than us all, its way more than for us.\r\n\r\nIf God still gives you grace to deal with something that you really would like to give up on, keep on standing and launching out in the deep. You have come too far to go back, you have gone too deep to fail. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>John 1:12, \"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right (power) to become children of God, to those who believe in His name:\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6300\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"images\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nEver had those days you just couldn't function effectively like you should? Before day break, you are tossing on your bed back and forth wondering what the day will bring. Previous days were tough and your conclusion is, <em>“today will present the same if not worse</em>”. Fear has gripped your heart and you just can't seem to get past it and move on. Don't fret for God is present in the situation with a solution. In school we would give the teacher the right answers to math question only to learn that he was interested in how we arrived at the answer more than the right answer. Most of the time the answer was right but we couldn’t tell the teacher how we arrived at it because we cheated. The process to get to that answer is more important than the answer itself. So praying that God would lead you to that destination is better than praying, God let me find myself there.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">POWER is authority, ability, right, strength, control, influence etc</span></strong>. At the point of believing, you are given rights you did not posses before the conversion. <!--more-->That right (power) is the energy one receives to do greater things they couldn't do without it. God empowers His people, in other words, gives them ability, right, strength to influence their day to day living. <strong>2Timothy 1:7, \"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of POWER...\" </strong>Give anyone power and they will function even more. In job or leadership positions, people are not respected much because they are people, they are respected because of their ranks (positions). Their ranks give them power to rule. The officers have power to enforce laws because of their given positions and ranks. If you are stopped, their badge is what shows you that they have power to do what is right.  If you go against it, that badge will stop your mouth from saying, \"<em>You cannot do nothing to me</em>\". <strong>\"As many as received Him, to them gave ye POWER to become\",1. A child and 2. As a child, an overcomer\"</strong>. Your rank and position gives you the Power to overcome the world, the flesh and the devil.\r\n\r\nAs long as you have the power, you will lay and sleep, <strong>Psalms 3:3-8, \"5 I But You, O Lord, are a shield for me, My glory and the One who lifts up my head.4 I cried to the Lord with my voice, And He heard me from His holy hill. Selah 5 I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustained me. </strong><strong>6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around”. Psalms 23:4, \"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You (My POWER) are with me; Your rod and Your Stuff (badge), they comfort me\". </strong>Only God can empower you and I to become what we couldn't be by ourselves and with that power, we can face and conquer fear, doubts, difficulties, and life obstacles. Often times we face the day without wearing our uniform and putting on that badge to give us power and that is why Paul writes to the Romans in <strong>Romans 13:14, \"</strong><strong>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts\". </strong>Without the uniform, we are exposing ourselves to stuff we could overcome if we wore our uniform otherwise we are vulnerable to attacks. Purpose in your heart to wake up, take the power given to you through prayer and His word, put it on, have your badge in a place where it can be seen and face the day under His POWER that works within you (<strong>Ephesians 3:20</strong>).

              "<strong>John 14:14, \"If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6307\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"images\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIt's nearly impossible to tell someone <em>\"I know how you feel</em>\" in a tough situation when you have not gone through it yourself. Often mistake made is encouraging someone who has either lost a dear one and say words from no experience of your own. If you have not gone through it or similar, you do not know how it feels. The best way to respond in my judgement is to say something like this <em>\"I don't know how it feels but I want to let you know I care</em>\". The good encouragers are the ones who have had a taste of it and can stand and encourage.\r\n\r\nFor God to create, He only had to speak, to redeem, Christ had to suffer<strong>.</strong> There are many things that accompany Jesus' life here on earth. We know His main mission was to come and die on the cross to save mankind. And while He was here, He also taught, healed, raised the dead, raised leaders etc. He became a person (Man) to identify with us. <strong>You cannot redeem what related to</strong>. <!--more-->Christ had to relate to us, bring Himself to our level yet without sin then redeem us. He was here on earth 100%God and 100% Man. Living a normal human life. He was tempted like any other man, was moved when He lost His friend Lazarus, rejected by men, lied on, hated by many, got hungry, denied, had no place to live and call His own, experienced hardships, experienced exhaustion, emotionally drained, became a servant, beaten, spat on, stripped naked, crucified on the cross etc. When Jesus says to me, <strong>\"I know how it feels son</strong>\", I know He does, <strong>He has been there</strong>.\r\n\r\nHere comes the good report, after resurrection, He ascended into heaven. Before then He tells His disciples, <strong>John 14:14, \"If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.\" </strong>Why do we pray in \"Jesus name\" and not in \"Father’s name\" directly? Jesus said, when you pray, pray in my name. Well the Father has never been flesh and blood, yes He is God but He has never reduced Himself to the level of men to feel what men feels. In the old testament they did not have abounding GRACE like we do, they did not have the level of mercy we have in the NT. All these came more as a result of Jesus experience, the ultimate sacrifice. We offer prayers to God the Father through Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus takes our prayers and presents them to Father in a way we could never do. It’s like a child who has picked flowers for his dad, he gives them to his mother and the mother preps them in a way they look presentable and gives them to the father saying, “from your son”. Jesus having been here on earth prays on our behalf when we ask something like this, \"<em>Father, I know how it feels to be in their position, do not destroy them, provide for them, let <strong>GRACE</strong> and <strong>MERCY</strong> plead for them”</em>. When I pray in Jesus name, Jesus presents my case to the Father as an experienced God/Man because He has been there (both sides).\r\n\r\n<strong>Proverbs 18:10, \"The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous run to it and are safe</strong>\". Praying in His name is a reminder that you are supported by a strong tower. You are safe under that name when Jesus the High Priest, seated at the right hand of God the Father is interceding for us. <strong>Romans 8:34, \"Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">who also makes intercession for us\".</span></strong> Anything desired in accordance with His will is released under Jesus’ name (signature, label). If we ask God through His Son's name, Jesus puts His seal of approval. Go through the one who knows your feelings. Be blessed Ev"

              "<strong>John 15:1-2 “1 I Am the True Vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6312\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images3.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"images\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThe foundational principles for knowing and living in the will of God as a Christian is to abide in Christ and bear fruit. <strong>Acts 17:28 </strong>reads<strong> \"for in Him we live and move and have our being\"</strong> a summary of <strong>John 15</strong> in my judgment. <strong>John 15</strong> is one of the most important chapters in all the Bible, it has wealth of treasure we will look at in the next few postings.\r\n\r\nThe opening of <strong>John 15</strong> begins with one of the Jesus’ “I AM” statements. These statements distinguished Him from others who may have used some of these metaphors He used to describe Himself. In this “I AM” statement, He wants us to understand who He is, who we are and the connection we have to the Father through Him. Jesus is encouraging His disciples as they know His time on earth was drawing near, crucifixion and ascension were not far from this time.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->In the nature of this relationship, Jesus begins  by saying vs. “<strong>1 </strong><strong>I AM the True Vine…”</strong> , God the Father as the vine dresser (Gardner) and the believers are the branches. Jesus distinguishes Himself from any other vines. He acknowledged that there were vines, He stands alone as the True Vine which means “genuine.” Jesus is the final, real “vine,” (last Adam) as compared to Israel, a type foreshadowing the reality. Israel is called God’s “vine” or “vineyard” in the Old Testament (<strong>Psalms 80:8–16; Jeremiah 2:21</strong>). Israel is judged for not bearing fruit and Jesus does what the type signified. In the same vs. He tells us that God is the gardener who is not looking for branches but fruit\r\n\r\nTo describe the <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Nature of our relationship</span></strong> to Him He<strong> says Vs. “2 Every branch <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">in Me</span> that does not bear fruit He takes away; …”</strong> Jesus desires for us to know that even though we will not see Him, we are as closely connected to Him as the branches of a vine are connected to its stem<strong>, “for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring.’”,</strong> <strong>Acts 17:28. </strong>Believers are called to bear fruit, production is of God,<strong> Philippians 2:12-13. </strong>Our source of life and spiritual fruit is not in ourselves; it is outside of us. Our life is hidden in Christ Jesus. Those who abide in Christ, the true vine are inspected by the Father (the vine dresser) for fruits. What kind? Good fruit <strong>Galatians 5:22-23, Matthew 3:8-10, Matthew 7:16-20. </strong>The well spring of righteousness flows from Christ, the Living Water. A believer who has the root of righteousness will \"<strong>bear fruit</strong>”, the fruit is an evidence of growth. The fruit tells you more about the condition of the soil and the roots. We live rightly, and serve Him effectively only if we are rightly connected to Him in a faith/love relationship, <strong>Philippians 1:6, Colossians 1:10.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe process is<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Fruitful Growth in the Faith, </span>“…and every branch that bears fruit He PRUNES, that it may bear MORE fruit”. </strong>Every branch that is pruned will be like what<strong> 2Peter 1:8</strong> says<strong> “8 For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ”. </strong>Majority are stuck at bearing fruit, the Lord wants us to bear more fruit and the way to bear more fruit is by pruning.\r\n\r\nPruning is the practice of removing diseased, non-productive, or otherwise unwanted portions from a plant. The purpose of pruning is to shape the plant by controlling or directing plant growth, to maintain the health of the plant and increase the yield or quality of fruits. Pruning requires cutting back, cleaning, removing dead leaves for a reason (setbacks). Pruning makes you grow more in faith, patience, love, joy, peace, grace, prayer, His word, reaching the lost. Cutting back is most necessary because it propels you to grow more and more under what you would call adversities. Cutting back is not meant to destroy but build, it means the branch through the vine has potentials to grow more if pruned. How can we abide on the true vine and remain the same?\r\n\r\nProper pruning is as much a skill as it is an art, since badly pruned plants can become diseased or grow in undesirable ways but the Lord is the Master in pruning. He knows how best to prune each of us so as to bear more fruit and much fruit. David says, <strong>Psalm 119:71, \"It is good for me that I have been afflicted (pruned), That I may learn (grow) Your statutes\". </strong>Pruning can either make you or break you depending on how you respond to it.\r\n\r\nI believe Jesus was speaking these words as he prepared His disciples for perilous times. Not long after this did Peter hear from Jesus letting him know that Satan had desired to sift (prune) his as wheat. The Lord allowed the pruning process even through an agent of destruction who had limited access to what he could do to him because Christ was in control.\r\n\r\nWithout a strong foundation where virtue, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, kindness are ingredients in your life, your growth is in jeopardy and pruning is the remedy for your growth. Only the skillful gardener knows what you need and does it for His own glory. To continue Blessings Ev"

As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. 5 “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6317\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images4.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"images\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\" /></a></strong>In this vs. Jesus wants His disciples to be reminded of their salvation and He uses the word “already clean”. This cleansing is effected through hearing, believing, and obeying the Word. The Word tells us what to do that we may be cleansed and saved. The word of Christ is spoken to all believers; and there is a cleansing virtue in that Word, as it works grace, and works out corruption. We have been purged from the guilt and power of sin, moved from the wild vine and grafted into the New True Vine.\r\n\r\nThose who have repented and trusted in Christ alone for eternal salvation are already clean (made holy); the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, <strong>Romans 1:16, Romans 11:16, “For if the first fruit is holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches”</strong>.<!--more--> Believers are born of water and the Spirit <strong>John 3:5.</strong> The water here is not baptism but cleansing (regeneration). <strong>Titus 3:5, “not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit</span>”. </strong>Christ cleansed first before He could indwell, <strong>Romans 6:6, Leviticus 15:13, Ezekiel 36:25.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you talk about sanctification, Jesus washing the disciples feet brought this to light, <strong>John 13:4-10, “8 Peter said to Him, “You shall never wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me</span>.” 9 Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head “10 Jesus said to him, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">“He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you</span>” </strong>The significance of washing their feet was to remind them that they were already clean even though their feet were dirty to show His continuous cleansing and not for regeneration. Salvation is a one-time act of justification by faith, but the lifelong process of sanctification is one of washing from the stain of sin we experience as we walk through the dusty world, <strong>Ephesians 5:6. </strong>This is the Comfort believers have, they are already clean in regeneration, and feet are cleaned in sanctification.\r\n\r\n<strong>John 15:4, “Abide in Me, and I in you…”. </strong>If we are saved by grace, you must also be kept by grace. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Salvation is of the Lord</span>, the Father draws us to the Vine (the Son).<strong> “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him…”, John 6:44,  John 13:8-9. </strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The keeping power is of the Lord</span>, vs.4 “…<strong>. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me”  Romans 11:</strong> <strong>18 </strong>strengthens this point when it says<strong>, “do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you”. </strong>And the more fruit we bring forth, the more we abound in what is good because our life depends on it, <strong>“…He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing” </strong>\r\n\r\nTo be fruitful, we must abide/remain in Christ, have union with Him by faith (relationship/fellowship), constantly keep up our dependence upon Christ, and communion with Him (<strong>Galatians 4). </strong>To continue, blessings Ev"

As I mentioned in part 1, <strong>John 15</strong> is one of the most important passages in the bible because it helps us discern the will of God for believers. In this posting we will look at discerning perceptive or revealed will of God and in the next posting we will look at closely at God's permissive or perfect will.\r\n\r\nBefore I address the two vs. above, we need to ask ourselves what does <strong>Mark 11:24</strong> mean? It reads,<strong> “Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.\"</strong>  Its one of the most quoted and also highly abused vs. From looking at the vs. it sounds like a blank check does it not? “<em>God told me</em> <strong>\"…whatever things you ask...\"? </strong>This needs to be looked at in the light of who we are in Christ. We should be driven to have the mind of Christ, be imitators of Christ, and be conformed to the image of Christ.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nBefore salvation, most of our desires were wrong, selfish desires. Now in Christ, some of those still lingers and must be dealt with continuously in the light of our relations to the Vine. James puts us in check when he writes, <strong>\"You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures\", James 4:3</strong>. James says often times believers ask but they don't ask for the right things with the right attitude or in faith or the timing might be off, therefore they miss.\r\n\r\nWe can now look at<strong> John 15:7-8 </strong>to help us understand <strong>Mark 11:24,</strong> \"<strong>whatever things you ask/desire when you pray</strong>.\" Indeed it is a blank check however we must know what it is for and how it works.  Look at the starting point, \"<strong>if you abide in me and my words abide in you</strong>...\", the end result, \"<strong>bearing fruit for the Father's glory</strong>\". If we abide in Him, our will, our desires, our drives are conformed to His. His desires becomes our desires. His desire is that we bear fruit. If we ask for things that will make us grow and bear fruit, more fruit and much fruit, He will grant those to us.\r\n\r\nJesus said, “<strong>But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you\", Matthew 6:33</strong>. Mark the word \"<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">added</span></strong>\" not \"<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">given</span></strong>\" because His kingdom is priority. What does the kingdom of God entail, <strong>Romans 13:17-18, \"17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men</strong>\".  We ought to seek to be more righteous, more peaceable and more joyous, (summary of the fruit of the Spirit in <strong>Galatians 5:22)</strong>, because they hinge upon these three. Those who desire and serves Christ on these are acceptable to God and approved by men.\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Whatever you ask when you pray...\"</strong> is more about changing us than changing things. Jesus said, <strong>\"Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.”, John 6:27</strong>. Paul echoes with these words, \"<strong>If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God\", Colossians 3:1-3</strong>.\r\n\r\nSolomon's prayer when God spoke to him in a dream is a great example of discerning His will. <strong>1Kings 3:5.</strong> Solomon was given a blank check to ask for anything, he asked for wisdom to discern (the mind of Christ). He said, “<strong>Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”, 1Kings 3:9.</strong> Solomon who penned these words <strong>\"The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable\", Proverbs 10:32 </strong>knew what to ask for and God added other things he did not ask for because his priority was God’s priority for him.\r\n\r\nThis is how we should think and pray <strong>Mark 11:24</strong> by keeping to heart <strong>John 15:7-8</strong> with a great example of Solomon's prayer in <strong>1Kings 3</strong>. It always boils down to what we desire. Will the desire make us more imitators, mind like and conformed to the image of Christ or to our own? Let’s keep this in mind, what we pray for the most will reveal what we desire the most. David had a simple prayer in <b>Psalm 25 (show me, teach me, guide me in Your truth and keep me). </b>To continue, Blessings Ev"

Then you will be able to <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">TEST</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">APPROVE</span> what God's will is--his <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">GOOD</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">PLEASING</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">PERFECT WILL</span>”(NIV). </strong>CONFORMED is to act or be in accord or be in agreement with something, in this case the world (<strong>Psalm 1, Romans 8:7, Colossians 1:21). </strong>TRANSFORMED on the other hand is to change the nature, function or condition. Other word suitable is to convert.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe do not need improvement, we need transformation. When we come to Christ, our old nature is not improved, it is changed, made new (transformed), <strong>2Corinthians 5:17, \"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new</strong>\".  Another picture to consider, God showed Jeremiah in the potter’s house how He <strong>\"…made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make\", Jeremiah 18:4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>As you read the chapter, you come to learn how the potter did not improve the existing vessel, He took the same broken clay conformed to this world and transformed it into another vessel<strong>.</strong>\r\n\r\nI find these keys to be very important in knowing the will of God, Wisdom, Discernment, Counsel. Abiding in Him and His words abiding in us there lies in the power to transform the mind. The word of God is the wisdom of God<strong>, Colossians 1:9-10, “9 For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding</span>; 10 that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;</strong><strong>” </strong>\r\n\r\nWhat is the point of praying for wisdom if God is going to tell us exactly what to do? The bible does not tell us exactly what to do in every situation as we read it. It gives us wisdom within His word to act on His permissive will with His guidance, <strong>Proverbs 3:5-6, “5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; </strong><strong>6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths”</strong>. A number say “<em>trust your heart”</em>, the truth is, you cannot trust your heart because it is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, <strong>Jeremiah 17:9, Deuteronomy 30:19 (NIV</strong><strong>). </strong>We must trust God through His sufficient word <strong>“</strong><strong>For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding; He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk uprightly; He guards the paths of justice, And preserves the way of His saints”, Proverbs 2:6-8, Proverbs 2:10-12, Proverbs 9:10, Proverbs 3:3-8.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe bible says<strong>, “He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful; And a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment, Because for every matter there is a time and judgment, …”, Ecclesiastes 8:5-6. </strong>Those seeking to know and love God must employ the word of God that gives knowledge, wisdom, ability to discern. Paul’s prayer, <strong> “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, that you may approve the things that are excellent,</span> that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ, being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God”, Philippians 1:9 -11, 1Corinthians 2:12.</strong>\r\n\r\nWalking in wisdom means knowing, thinking, praying and acting biblically in everything we do such as who to marry, where to live, work, raise children, serving the Lord. This calls for God to show us, teach us, guide us (<strong>Psalm 25:4-5)</strong> in counting the cost, surrounding ourselves with the right people (who know, think, pray and act biblically especially on big decisions), proving, testing all things in making decisions while trusting God to carry us through..\r\n\r\n<em>“</em><em>The true mark of spirituality is when we desire to know and live according to the will of God as revealed in Scripture, and that can be summarized as “be holy for I am Holy” (1 Peter 1:15-16). Our responsibility is to obey the revealed will of God and not to speculate on what His hidden will for us might be. While we should seek to be “led by the Holy Spirit,” we must never forget that the Holy Spirit is primarily leading us to righteousness and to being conformed into the image of Christ so that our lives will glorify God. God calls us to live our lives by every word that proceeds from His mouth”,</em> Gotquestion.org\r\n\r\nIn all we desire to do we must constantly ask ourselves, is this going to bring glory to God or self? This is why we abide in Him, His words abide in us then with wisdom we know and learn what and how to ask. To continue, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>John 15:9-12, “9 As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. 10 If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love. 11 “These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full. 12 This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images7.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6333\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images7.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"images\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIn my experience in the last 15 years or so, songs about God’s love in different genres have been heard and sang. What I found strange is that majority of the lyrics left out the words like “God, Jesus, Son of God etc.) and you were left to somehow figure out if they were Christian God’s love song or not. Even some of the popular worship songs sound like thinly disguised teenage crush songs. When we think of God’s love, are we to think of boy/girl type of love type (hold me, kiss me, etc.)? Most of these songs are pampering love. God’s love is perfecting, persevering love. The disciples preached the love of God by preaching Christ crucified.\r\n\r\nJesus said<strong>, John 15:9 “As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love” </strong>We cannot be anything apart from Him, therefore love starts with the Father who loves His Son who extended that love unto us through His son,  <strong>1John 4:8, 1John 4:16. </strong>The Father the gardener loves the Vine (His Son), and the branches He prunes, He does it to align with His love for the Vine (His character, nature). <!--more-->His love was demonstrated by laying down His life, <strong>vs. 13. </strong>Abide in My love opens us to learn about His perfecting love not pampering love. This is the love we show the world, a love that has no partiality. The Fruit of the spirit begins with<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> LOVE</span></strong>, <strong>Galatians 5:22. </strong>Apostle Paul dedicates a whole 1Corinthians<strong> 13</strong> to tell us what love is and what it’s not. It’s in the light of this definition of love that other gifts may flower but love is the only power.  In summary, Love <strong>“bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things”, 1Corinthians 13:7.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>John 15:10, “If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love” </strong>We are not justified by keeping the commandments, we are recognized by living in the light of them. The world tries to keep just enough commandments to enter the kingdom of God (<strong>Luke 18</strong>), as if to say there is a minimum requirement to graduate. Jesus calls for perfection (maximum) <strong>Matthew 5:48, </strong>a righteousness far beyond the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees who were considered the most righteous religious people who did the minimum for qualification. Jesus says to us all<strong>,</strong> “<strong>…, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven”, Matthew 5:20. </strong>This is impossible with men however in salvation God works in us to live in the light of what we fell short according to His perfecting love. To abide in His love by keeping commandments is to demonstrate our delight in the law of God<strong>. 1John 5:2-3,” 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">commandments are not burdensome</span>”.</strong>\r\n\r\nTo keep His commandments is to go an extra mile, a mile of excellence, <strong>Matthew 5:38-. </strong> In demonstrating what we are to our neighbors, Jesus gave the parable of a Good Samaritan in <strong>Luke 10</strong>. Jesus taught that His followers must demonstrate love to all kinds of people-no matter what faith, nationality, or personality-enemies included. Perfecting love goes outside the normal circle the world would demonstrate their love. Loving those who love us is easy and even unbelievers already do that. Jesus called us to love our enemies, forgive them, pray for them, that is an extra mile of excellence. This is what makes believers different, demonstrating to the world that we belong to Jesus and our lives are hidden in Him and we are a result of who He is in us. Paul in <strong>Galatians 2:20</strong> says he lives but not him but Christ lives in him to show he can become what he could not be to others because of the new nature of relationship he has with Christ. It's only through the power of God's Spirit that His people can truly love and pray for those who intend to do them harm (<strong>Romans 12:14-21</strong>).The commandments of Jesus were not to be obeyed in the spirit of bondmen, but in that of friends.\r\n\r\n<strong>John 15:11, “These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full”. </strong>The second item of the fruit of the Spirit is <strong>JOY</strong>, <strong>Romans 15:13, “Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit</strong>.” Joy is the fruit of a right relation with God, God is for our JOY. <strong>Psalm 104:31</strong> speaks of God Himself rejoicing in His creative works. <strong>Isaiah 65:18</strong> speaks of God rejoicing over His redeemed people who will be to Him. A person who walks with the Lord can continue to rejoice even when troubles come<strong>, John 16:</strong><strong>33, “These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will[a] have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” </strong>To continue, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>John 15:13-17, “Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends. 14 You are My friends if you do whatever I command you. 15 No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you. 16 You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you. 17 These things I command you, that you love one another.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friendship-pictures-quotes_18053-5.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6339\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friendship-pictures-quotes_18053-5.png?w=277\" alt=\"friendship-pictures-quotes_18053-5\" width=\"277\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nEvery day we hear the word “LOVE” expressed in a number of ways (people, food, clothes, movies etc.). A musician at the end of his concert would conclude with something like this “I love you all” which may mean little or nothing. If we are to understand love, we have to get the biblical definition that both Christ and Paul give us.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of love we see in the bible Eros love, Philos love and Agape love not to be confused. I will only address Agape love which fits perfectly with this chapter. Agape love is what God commanded all believers to have for everyone (believers or not). Agape love should never be determined by our feelings; it is more of a set of behaviors or actions. With agape, you do not have to actually feel it for you to give it, which means that you can be able to show love without feeling anything at all. At times feelings can follow after showing this kind of love but they are not the defining factor. Agape love is a demonstrative love, its love in action.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Greater love lays down His life for His friends:</span></strong> <strong>John 15:13, “Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends”. </strong>Jesus demonstrated love in a greater way by laying down His life. This is considered the outworking love<strong>. </strong>John in his 1<sup>st</sup> epistle says <strong>“16 By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren”.  </strong>By these words our Lord shows how far love to another should extend, even to the laying down of our lives for the brethren; which is the highest instance of love among men; (<strong>1John 3:16, Ephesians 5:1-2, Romans 5:8). </strong>Jesus also demonstrated love when He washed His disciples’ feet. He stripped Himself of His garments, went down on his knees and took care of part of the body most of us would want to avoid coming in contact with, <strong>John 13. </strong>This is demonstrative love He led by example.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Greater love calls for obedience:</span></strong><strong> John 15:14, “ You are My friends if you do whatever I command you”. </strong>In<strong> Ephesians 5, </strong>Paul gives us in details what it means to follow God’s commands. His opening<strong> vs. “1 Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. 2 And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma”. </strong>He then in details help us understand what it means to Walk in Love, Walk in Light, and Walk in Wisdom. You are a friend of Jesus when you love, forgive, care for those Jesus loves, forgives, cares for etc. because you have been instructed<strong>. <a title=\"1Peter 1:22\" href=\"http://biblia.com/books/esv/1Pe1.22\" target=\"_blank\">1Peter 1:22</a>, <a title=\"1Peter 3:8\" href=\"http://biblia.com/books/esv/1Pe3.8\" target=\"_blank\">1Peter 3:8</a>, <a title=\"1Peter 4:8\" href=\"http://biblia.com/books/esv/1Pe4.8\" target=\"_blank\">1Peter 4:8</a>. </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Greater love defines the nature of relationship:</span></strong><strong> John 15:15, “No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you”.  </strong>We are not sons (friends) of God by RIGHT but by ADOPTION. Adoption is the giving to any one the name and place and privileges of a son who is not a son by birth, <strong>Ephesians 1:3-6. </strong>A son by adoption might not be heir of the property, whereas a son by birth certainly is, we are born again as sons/friends.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Greater love reaches out first and empowers to serve:</span></strong> <strong>John 15:16, “You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain” </strong>Many claim to have chosen Christ, that is not true. He chose us, and we responded to His choosing. We love Him because He first loved us; we know Him because He knew us first. We serve because He was the first to serve, <strong>Mark 9:35, “And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, “If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all. Galatians 5:13, “… but through love serve one another. 14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” </strong>None of us can be anything apart from His effectual work in us.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Greater love seeks to give access to His friends</span></strong><strong>: John 15:16, “… that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you”</strong> God has blessed us with every spiritual blessings in high places because He has adopted us through Jesus Christ to Himself. We have access to the throne of grace because of His finished work on the cross. <strong>Romans 8:14-17, “14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">these are sons of God </span> 15, For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">but you received the Spirit of adoption</span> by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe love because He first loved us, <strong>John 15:9 “As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. 10 If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love.” </strong>Therefore Laying down your life would be a heavy price to give up; the payoff is personal growth and the opportunity to develop a wonderful and supportive relationship of Christ to others. Love is duty, (sacrificial) <strong>1Corinthians 13:7 Love \"… bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\" </strong>When you live his love out loud, it shows that Jesus is real. Practical Christian lives points to the reality that Christ is real, and the Savior of the world. Let us love in deed and in truth, <strong>Hebrews 10:24, “And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works”; 1 John 3:18, “My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but indeed and in truth.” </strong>To continue, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Judges 6 \"12 When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, The Lord is With You Mighty Warrior.\" …Vs. 25 That same night the LORD said to him, \"Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. 26 Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images8.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6379\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images8.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"images\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nWhat was the Lord doing here? The Lord first dealt with Gideon’s identity, then he spoke of the promise of His presence with Gideon, and now God is helping him to begin to make practical changes in his life so that he can be displayed as the mighty warrior that God called him to be. God first instructs Gideon to tear down his father’s altar to Baal. Baal worship was popular, however, Gideon knew he was risking his life by obeying the Lord. Gideon was pulling down strongholds and dealing with the influence of idolatry in his life<strong>. 2Corinthians 10:4 states, \"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds</strong>\" This was a stronghold in his life, even though there is no mention that he himself worshipped this idol, I imagine that he did as his father’s idol.  He had heard stories about the power of God, but most likely really worshipped Baal as was taught to him. Yet God was not going to allow him to continue to magnify, promote, and worship this idol. <!--more-->This idol, (stronghold) was being ripped down and a new one would replace it. God Has made Himself known as a <strong>stronghold (Psalm 48:3)</strong>. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Francis Frangipane </span>describes a spiritual stronghold as a collection of thoughts that can influence a nation, a city, a family, or an individual. Here God is having Gideon set up a new stronghold, and that is the Lord Himself. He set up an altar to the Lord, not a \"statue of the Lord\". Why did God do this, well let’s look to a clip from a Superman Comic Book Issue #58.\r\n\r\nIn the comic books, Superman's father, Jor-El, once noted, \"that when a native Kryptonian (Superman’s planet) is elsewhere, free of Krypton's unique atmosphere and tremendous gravitational pull, he becomes a superman. But superman actually once on earth received his power from the unique ultra solar rays that penetrate Earth day and night. The father Jor-El spoke words of truth about the destiny concerning his son. Listen to what God the Father said about His Son. And a voice from heaven said, \"<strong>This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\" Matthew 3:17</strong>\r\n\r\nKryptonite (the substance of the world Superman came from weakened his powers)<strong> “Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world”, 1John 2:15-17. “ The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus</strong>”, <strong>Romans 6:23. </strong>Sin has a pull on our lives if we allow it to. It must therefore be displaced. \"<strong>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death”</strong>. Just as the law of aerodynamics displaces the law of gravity so does the law of the spirit displace the law of sin and death, because of the Power of Christ. That is why Jesus said in <strong>Acts 1:8, \"But you shall receive power, after the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” </strong>Superman was empowered by the S-U-N, and we are to be empowered by the S-O-N!  <strong>Luke 23:44-46, “44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, 45 for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. 46 Jesus called out with a loud voice, \"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.\"</strong> When he had said this, he breathed his last. Only one SUN / Son can shine at a time. When the Son was shinning, the Sun had to cease from shinning.\r\n\r\nAs a Christian you have like Superman left planet Krypton (the world) as you were born in sin. What is kryptonite to you (the sinful temptations of the world)? Lex Luthur (Superman’s enemy) always would place kryptonite in the presence of Superman to weaken him. When the enemy places kryptonite (sinful temptations) in front of you to influence you, use the power of the SON to overcome the temptations of this world as he always provides a way of escape from temptation (<strong>1Corinthians 10:31</strong>)\r\n\r\nSuperman had a mission to save the world from evil against the enemies. As a Christian you have a mission to seek and save the lost through the power of the SON (Holy Spirit).\r\n\r\nApplication: Be a superman (superwomen) for God. Fly strong for Christ. Watch out for kryptonite (temptations) from planet krypton (the world), be empowered by the sun (SON), and be serious about your mission.Blessings,Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Psalm 56:8, “Thou hast taken account of my wanderings; put my tears in Thy bottle; are {they} not in Thy book?\" NAS. </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6382\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo.jpg\" alt=\"memo\" width=\"236\" height=\"183\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nAs you search the church history, you'll find people who have been greatly used of God have been men and women of prayer. They've learned to wait in the secret place of prayer allowing God to impart His heart to them. They've been people whose hearts have been passionate for the [same] things which God is passionate about.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mueller began orphanages for children in Bristol during the 1899s. He trusted God to meet their every need. He never asked for money, but he clothed, housed and fed many thousands of children. Near the end of his life he said that every person for whom he had prayed to come to Christ (with the exception of two), had come to know Christ as his Savior. After Mueller died, those two people also came to a personal knowledge of Christ.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nDavid Brainard ministered among Indian tribes in the Northeastern part of the United States during the 1700s. It was said of him that the snow would melt underneath him because he prayed so long for the Indians. He was God's instrument to bring many to the knowledge of the Savior.\r\n\r\nWhen our hearts beat in harmony with God’s heart, He will do incredible things to bring to pass those things for which we have prayed. God’s heart breaks for a lost and dying world. When our hearts feel the same burden, we will cry unto Him and He will hear and answer us. The Psalmist said, \"<strong>Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy. He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him\" (Psalm 126:5, 6 NIV).</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen a mother weeps for a rebellious son, it touches God’s heart. When a father cries to God for His fallen children, it moves heaven to earth. When young people are broken over their schoolmates' salvation, the Spirit of God is released from heaven to capture that school for Christ. God holds dear to His heart the tears of His children.\r\n\r\nGod has a bottle where He stores our tears; a book where He records our heartaches. As we weep for those who are without Christ, we must never forget that God has not forgotten. One day, in His time, He will open the heavens and pour out a blessing upon us that's beyond imagination.\r\n\r\nA pastor recently told me when his church put in new carpet for their prayer room, he made a special request of the Lord. He said, \"<em>Oh God, I pray that this carpet will be dedicated to You by the tears of your people</em>.\" Not long afterwards, his prayers were answered. The church had a series of \"revival meetings\" with Life Action Ministries. God moved during those days, and the prayer room was filled with people weeping in brokenness and repentance over their sins.\r\n\r\nTears touch the heart of God. He understands the hurts of humanity because He gave His own Son for those injured by their own sins. Perhaps the shortest and most powerful Scripture in the Bible is the one that simply says, <strong>\"Jesus wept.\" </strong>If God in human flesh wept, then we'll also weep when we grasp His heart. If you find yourself weeping for the souls of man, remember God is storing your tears in a bottle. One day, He will open that bottle, and out of it will flow \"rivers of living waters.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application</span></strong><strong>: What names are attached to the tears that God is bottling up on your behalf?

              "<strong>John 15:18-19, \"18 </strong><strong>If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you. 19 “If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6385\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"memo\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIn the early verses of this chapter, Jesus talked to His disciples of the nature of His relationship to them. Towards the end, He turns to address the disciples’ relationship to the world. His relationship to His disciples was that of love and of friendship. In addressing them in vs 18, He would have them understand that the world's relationship to them will be the opposite of His. He uses a strong word \"hate” which means a deep and emotional extreme dislike. It is often associated with feelings of anger, disgust and a disposition towards hostility. Hate by biblical definition is murder at heart something we are not to have as His friends.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHe said<strong> \"18 </strong>If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you\". We have to understand that in this world, believers will not be treated any better. In fact Jesus from birth was already hated and wanted dead. This started with King Herod, Jesus presence threatened his kingdom. Throughout His earthly life there were those who truly loved Him, those who pretended to love Him, and those who out rightly hated Him with a passion. He was disliked by His family members, hated in His home town, hated for doing good on a Sabbath. Hated for hanging out with tax collectors, prostitutes, lepers. They wanted to stone Him for declaring that He is God from above. He was labeled a drunker; His miracle powers were accredited to Satan. They shouted Hosanna to Him one day, a week later they cried crucify Him. Judas Iscariot hated Him so much that he was willing to take anything to betray Him. They were willing to have one man who was a rebel, a thief and murderer released and have the sinless, humble, perfect Son of God crucified because of their hatred for Him, and the list continues. Jesus echoing words prophesied in <strong>Psalm 35:19</strong> says in <strong>John 15:25, \"they hated Me without a cause\". </strong>He went through all these and yet prayed that they would be forgiven.\r\n\r\nIf the world hated Him, be reminded it still hates Him today and His friends. In some countries predominantly in the Middle East hate Christians with a passion and are doing everything to wipe out Christians in those countries. Extreme Islamic terrorists have waged war on Christians. Recently in Egypt it was reported that Christians were murdered because of their faith. From my home country Kenya around147 were killed less than a month ago because they professed to be Christians. In Nigeria, Kenya and other parts of the world, churches have been bombed during worship services. We get newsletters telling stories of persecution in South Sudan, India in the hands of Hindus, China and other parts of the world. Here in America we hear hatred from the media, internet postings, and some leaders. Christians are labeled intolerant for standing for truth regarding sanctity of life, marriages, championing for morality, the gospel. Christians are hated for their message, even falsely accused and the reason is simple they first hated Him and His message<strong>. </strong>Believers are citizens of another country therefore they would not be loved in the present world.<strong>  </strong>We are not greater than our Master who was hated yet He was not of this world neither are His friends the believers, vs<strong>. </strong>19 “If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you\". We take comfort that He knows what His friends are going through; He has been there and more so to the extreme.\r\n\r\nWhat makes our message different? It’s the gospel of love, God is love, He demonstrated it by sending His Son to die for our sins. We love because He first loved and laid down His life. Without love we are considered murderers, <strong>1John 3:15, “ Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him”.</strong> <strong>Luke 6:27, “But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you”</strong>. Our message is that of hope, it’s a message that calls us to go an extra mile of excellence, it’s a message of forgiveness. Jesus on the Sermon on the Mount called us blessed<strong>, “11 “Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. 12 Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you”, Matthew 5:11-12. </strong>Jesus also in<strong> Matthew 10:22 </strong>said<strong>, “And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">But he who endures to the end will be saved.</span>” </strong>This is a message if endurance.<strong> Matthew 24:9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake.”</strong>\r\n\r\nOur blessed hope<strong>, “7 … we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. 8 We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed— 10 always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. 11 For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh”, 2Corinthians 4:7-11. </strong>They hated Him without a cause, expect to be hated the same way, but what a friend we have in Jesus, nothing can compare…Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Numbers 33:2, \"And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the Lord: And these are their journeys according to their going out\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6388\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"memo\" width=\"300\" height=\"185\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nMany people record many things in this life. In looking at the Guinness book of world records you will discover that it records some of the craziest things that people have done.\r\n\r\nMoses recorded all the places that Israel pitched their tents. Each place had its ups and downs, positives and negatives, yet they pitched their tents anyhow. Think for a moment of the Tabernacle of Witness, which had as its purpose to be in the middle of tribes as a witness of God’s presence as they traveled. <strong>John 1:14</strong> states, that Jesus Christ became <strong>\"tabernacle among us</strong>\". And what was further written of the life of Christ was that He would bring redemption paid for by His blood. Why, because His mission was to seek and to save the lost.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIs our mission any different? Now the whole being the Redeemer of Israel could only go to Christ, but His mission of seeking and saving the lost is still ours as a continuation of what He began. We need to go in the power of the Holy Spirit obeying the mission so that Heaven’s recordings of our lives show that we pitched our tents and shared the gospel with the lost on our way to the Promised Land of Heaven.\r\n\r\nWhat will be written of you or what do you think has been written already about your pitching your tent to reach the unsaved? We are called to be living epistles read of by men. <strong>\"You are our epistle (letter) written in our hearts, known and read of all men...written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart\", 2Corinthians 3:2-3. </strong>Our very lives in Christ are results of God’s grace upon us giving us salvation instead of condemnation.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore become a letter for all to read, we are walking testimonials. But to bring balance let us NEVER FORGET that we are called to be <strong>\"living letters\" </strong>called to speak the word and truth of God, (<strong>Romans 10:13-15</strong>), because \"they\" can’t hear unless you speak. Now does your walk match your talk, that is to say live a godly lifestyle, but don’t take a vow of silence! Ray Comfort speaks of \"<strong>monasteries without walls</strong>\", to describe any Christian who leaves their church on Sunday, goes home and does nothing for Christ, then returns the following Sunday to rejoice in the Lord. Such Christians have extended their monastery without walls and keep a vow of silence about Jesus Christ in their sphere of influence. If we do this, then we deserve the evil that is coming to our nation, for we seek no way to use the only change agent, THE PREACHED GOSPEL! That is why only 2% of Christians, even 2% of you who receive these devotions actively share the gospel. You were saved! to serve, end of story.\r\n\r\nIf we claim to be a living letter, why then are we not pitching our tents (lives) daily to share the gospel with those around us? What will Heaven write about how you pitched your tent? Will your tent be pitched for food, fun, and fellowship (the great disguising mark of most churches), or perhaps your pages will be blank because this book will record what is done to further \"<strong>the kingdom by force</strong>\". Perhaps it will it be written of you that you pitched your tent for furthering the gospel? Israel pitched their tents in all kinds of situations, and we are called to do the same. If you like your job or not, if you like your school or not, remember, we are not here for ourselves, we are saved to serve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: \"Woe to me if I preach not the gospel.\" (1Corinthians 9:6). </strong>Blessings, Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Psalm 119:89, “</strong><strong>Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6399\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo3.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"memo\" width=\"300\" height=\"229\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nHere on earth people have various discrepancies with the Word of God. Here are the thoughts of some people that don’t believe God’s Word to be the absolute truth:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>I don’t believe the Bible to be God’s Word.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Bible has been changed.</li>\r\n\t<li>It’s just a bunch of stories.</li>\r\n\t<li>Not everything is true in the Bible.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Bible has contradictions.</li>\r\n\t<li>I tried to read the Bible, but can’t understand it.</li>\r\n\t<li>Didn’t men, NOT God, write the Bible?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAnd whereas all of these statements can be easily explained in away, and please e-mail us if there is one you believe and need an answer to, or one that you would like to know so as to answer another who has or may make such a statement, these statements are never heard in heaven.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn heaven not one of these statements is ever spoken, why, “<strong>Because forever O’ Lord Your Word is settled in heaven”</strong>. Forever speaks of eternity, yet many live for the temporary. God, and all the host of heaven (angels) and the saints present in heaven live in the eternal, spiritual realm, and are not sitting around questioning God’s Word. No, the host of heaven and saints see plainly the Word of God. The Apostle Paul said it like this, <strong>“Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known”, 1Corinthians 13:12. </strong>\r\n\r\nWe do not see clearly. Paul’s metaphor is that of the imperfect reflection seen in one of the polished metal mirrors (<strong>see James 1:23</strong>) of the ancient world in contrast with seeing the Lord face to face (see <strong>Genesis 32:30; Numbers 12:8; 2Corinthians 3:18</strong>). We have impaired spiritual vision. If Paul saw “<strong>a poor reflection as in a mirror</strong>,” how much more is our vision impaired? Have you ever tried to view the world through a medal mirror, or perhaps you remember the mirrors you saw in a fun house (which brings distortion), or even seeing through a foggy mirror? There is truly no perfect spiritual mirror here on earth, except God’s Word.\r\n\r\nYet even God’s Word is not crystal clear to us. Oh yes, we do our best being inspired by the Holy Spirit. And the longer you diligently serve God, mature spiritually, consistently read God’s Word, learn, memorize, and meditate upon it the more you will comprehend. But in heaven the angels and saints don’t have vision problems, they see “<strong>face to face</strong>,” and “<strong>they know fully, even as they are fully known</strong>.” Perhaps that is why in heaven instead of theological arguments they reverently cry out “<strong>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is filled with your glory</strong>. Now through the Word of God, I know in part; then, in the presence of the Lord I will know fully, to the full extent that a redeemed finite human being can know and in a way similar in kind to the way the Lord in his infinite wisdom fully and infinitely knows me. God’s glory (presence) makes everything clearly seen and makes sense perfectly. His radiance illuminates all things in Light of Truth, and so one can only cry out holy, holy, holy. Why is this so, because <strong>“Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application</span></strong><strong>: </strong>How often are you reading God’s Word to settle your life in truth? Are you right with God that you cry out holy, holy, holy, and will do the same on Judgment Day, or will you cry out when you stand before Him, “Oh no Your Word really is true? Make sure it is settled. Amen Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Genesis 26:1-14, “2 Then the Lord appeared to him and said: “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land of which I shall tell you. 3 Dwell in this land, and I will be with you and bless you;…”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011011.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6410\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011011.jpg\" alt=\"20131203-0701101\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIn world full uncertainties, we all want to find ways to grow, move, flourish, prosper, and be successful. We have unexhausted list of things to accomplish, achieve, however there are factors that play part in either growth or hindrance. Now some of these are not luxuries but necessities. To lose an income is not about luxury but necessity. To not have food on the table is not luxury but necessity. It becomes harder when you are the leader and the breadwinner for your household.\r\n\r\nGod in <strong>Genesis 12</strong> told Abram (Abraham) to move his family to a land where He would show him and promised to bless him there. At some point there was severe famine in the land of Canaan, Abram decided to go down to Egypt with his family to escape the famine. Years later his son Isaac runs into a similar situation, great famine in the land. He chose to follow his father’s footsteps by planning to go down to Egypt. The situations were the same, the form and the content of the Lord’s command and promise to Isaac and Abraham were the same, and the only difference was the means God used.<!--more--> God told Isaac <strong>Genesis 26:2,” Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land of which I shall tell you. 3 Dwell in this land, and I will be with you and bless you;…”  </strong>Human reasoning would say there is no way a promise could be fulfilled in a land that was barren. Logic indicated that they were better off in Egypt than Canaan as they saw his father benefited there. To stay meant death but God.\r\n\r\nThis is the struggle even believers face. When there is a famine (lack of anything considered necessity) or anticipating something changing, it’s easier for all of us to think of a plan B, and the plan B here is to run to Egypt. Relocate, start somewhere else. And there are benefits to starting somewhere else, but what happens when the truth of God’s word weighs heavy in your heart to stay because of the prompting of the Holy Spirit. You cannot see a way out, everything looks cloudy, no light at the end of the tunnel but you choose to obey the echo of truth God has placed in your heart and stay. Everyone is giving you this look like <em>“I can’t believe you are staying”</em> however your convictions overrides others opinions. Jesus told Peter to launch into the deep. To cast his nets where he had already tried fishing all night (<strong>Luke 5</strong>) sounded foolish, \"<strong>5 But Simon answered and said to Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.” Luke 5:5.</strong>\r\n\r\nGod tried Isaac by His providence. Isaac had been trained to believe and depend on God. As Abraham was going to sacrifice him without him knowing, Abraham believed that God will provide a lamb. Isaac perhaps had lived under the umbrella of his father’s faith, now it was his turn to deal with God directly and trust God and he did, <strong>Vs. 6, “So Isaac dwelt in Gerar”. </strong>He had to convince his family, servants to trust God with him. Like his father, he too had a weakness in his faith. He trusted God to provide but not to protect him and his wife when he lied about his relationship to her. We sometimes trust God in some areas and not with others but God who is rich in mercy still fulfilled His promise to him and He has done the same for us.\r\n\r\nVs<strong>. “12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold; and the Lord blessed him. 13 The man began to prosper, and continued prospering until he became very prosperous; 14 for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants. So the Philistines envied him”</strong>. Isaac had no land of his own; he was a stranger, a foreigner in Gerar. God chose to bless him in a foreign land in the midst of great famine because He was obedient. It was to be a testimony to king Abimelech and his people to recognize a blessed man, highly favored of God and more so the providence of God. <strong>Philippians 4:19, “And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are like me facing some uncertainties with a job situation, not knowing what else to do, my prayer for you and for me is to be calm, launch into the deep, sow in the same ground if the Lord has through His word strengthened your faith to wait on Him where there are no signs of life, abundance, or progress. Where you want to run away from could be the ground of thriving like Isaac and the testimony would be to those in your Gerar who have never learned to trust God because they always had a backup plan. God is faithful. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>JOB 2:3, “ Then the LORD said to Satan, \"Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ecover_-_job_book-225x225-75.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6405\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ecover_-_job_book-225x225-75.jpg\" alt=\"eCOVER_-_Job_Book.225x225-75\" width=\"169\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nWhat do you see the world recognizes? Money, Fame, Power, Prestige, Talent, etc…. What are some of the things that you have been recognized for in your life? Are they awards you’ve won, degrees you earned, positions you’ve raised too, a certain financial status that you’ve obtained? We must realize that what we value, and what the world recognizes is certainly NOT the same as what God recognizes. Sure almost everyone appreciates recognition for things they have done, but it’s an entirely different ball game when the God of heaven looks upon your life and measures it from his perfect perspective, which is vastly different from yours, perhaps even offensive to you. God is not recognizing Bill Gates in heaven because of a huge earthly success and the plethora of money that he earned. Yes, he worked hard, and did a lot of good with his products and software which most of us are probably using right now to read this devotion.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nYet in Job’s day and time, he himself was the Bill Gates. Let me explain how this I know so from a preacher that I heard on the radio although I forget his name, his word opened my eyes even further to this man called Job. He lost all his sheep - Sheep were used to make clothing at that time to which Job had more than anyone. When fire fell from heaven, HIS WHOLE CLOTHING LINE, before GAP, Tommy Hilfiger, Sean John, etc.., was gone. He lost all his camels when the Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on his camels and carried them off. Camels were used to take long journeys. Job’s TAXI CAB SERVICE WAS DESTROYED! A mighty desert wind then came in and caused the house to collapse were his sons and daughters were abiding. THERE WENT HIS CHILDREN! And if that was not enough, Satan then afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head. Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes. JOB’S BODY WAS IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN. This only added insult to injury or perhaps better said injury to insult.\r\n\r\nYet with all that Job had that God had blessed him with, God honored Job’s character not even mentioning his great wealth that he had when He spoke to Satan. Here’s what God pointed out.\r\n\r\n1 - There is no one like him in all the earth. Job was many notches above the rest. When put under a microscope his life shows what no other life can show.\r\n\r\n2 - He is blameless and upright. No one can find any dirt, deception, deceit, jealousy, pride, or crooked ways in his life.\r\n\r\n3 - A man who fears God. Job recognized that God was in charge and he so reverenced the Lord NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. It’s easy to worship God when everything is hunky-dory (great), but to fall to the ground in worship and say: \"<strong>Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away</strong>; <strong>may the name of the LORD be praised</strong>.\" What a statement. Most men fear other men, NOT JOB, he feared God alone. “<strong>A man who is intimate with God is not intimidated by men”. </strong>\r\n\r\n4 - And shuns evil. Job’s heart, unlike most people’s heart, perhaps even yours, repelled sin and was not drawn to it like a moth to the flame. His heart was resolved completely with the attitude “<strong>Teach me your way, O LORD, and I will walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name</strong>.\"\r\n\r\n5 - And he still maintains his integrity. <strong>Real integrity is character woven throughout the fabric of your life</strong>. It’s how you are, how you think, and what you do in the dark, when no one is looking, when no one would know. What would you try and get away with if you knew no one would catch you? Perhaps your answer to this will cause you to worship the Lord or confess, and get right with God.\r\n\r\nTake a self-check, inventory your life, how are you measuring up to God. If you are a saint perhaps you are struggling with some sin that needs to GO. If you are a sinner, then you are not yet saved, and God is angry with the sinner daily (<strong>Psalm 7:11</strong>). What do you think God is saying right now about your character, what can he recognize in you? Blessings, Pastor Phil"

What happens when the very life of your support structure is eroded, and dried up? This is when all looks hopeless, all signs of life have ceased, and it seems as if there is nothing left to do because all resources are exhausted. Here Ezekiel was staring at an impossible situation. God asks him a very probing question, when He says, \"<strong>Son of man, can these bones live?\"</strong> Ezekiel in his wisdom knew that his knowledge was limited, and therefore replies <strong>“…O Sovereign LORD, you alone know</strong>.\"<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn a practical way God was asking Ezekiel my people Israel are dead (they are the dead bones in your vision) do you think I can bring a dead situation to life? Do you think I can make a seemingly impossible situation possible? Can I bring forth life from death?, can I bring all these people who decided to stay in \"Death Valley\" and died because of it, out of this valley? No wonder Ezekiel responded as such, \"<strong>O Sovereign LORD, you alone know.</strong>\" What was he saying? Lord You know Your power. I know I can’t do this, and I don’t see how it can happen, but there is no one on this earth that can answer this question. Imagine if God asks you a question that you can’t answer. God asks many people many questions in His Word. It would be interesting to search the Scriptures and examine the topic \"<em>questions God has asked ordinary people</em>\". But, here God asks Ezekiel the question that no one but God alone could answer. And perhaps he was seeing if Ezekiel would run to a human answer. When problems in this world arise, everyone has their human opinion on the subject, \"<em>the lawyer says</em>\", <em>\"the politician promised</em>\", \"<em>the psychologist stated\", \"my mom thinks\", \"the self help book showed\",</em> etc. And we are so quick to find an answer that suits our finite thinking, our limited perspective, our many times clouded minds. But not Ezekiel, he wasn’t going to tackle this question in his human estimation. He knew that God had infinite knowledge, unlimited, holy, and eternal perspective, and a mind that could not be clouded but that was far above the clouds.\r\n\r\nIf you read the rest of the chapter which I suggest, you must do to get the full impact and not just a taste. You will see what God does with this \"Death Valley\" Situation. He was not talking about an individual, but a NATION.\r\n\r\nThink for a moment. We say can, God get me out of \"Death Valley\". Perhaps we say Lord, get my family out. Have we asked the Lord to get our city out, our nation out! We limit God so many times to a personal relationship and forget His desire for a corporate relationship. He sees His church as His Bride. In Cinderella the prince kissed her to wake her up from her \"Death Valley\" and as Pastor Dave shared, the Lord has kissed the face of His children with His divine favor. Oh we are not trial free, because if we were how could God mold us to become like Christ, the Ultimate Conquer of \"Death Valley\"\r\n\r\nApplication: Cry out for not only yourself, but your city and your nation to live again.Blessings,Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Matthew 26:20</strong><strong>–</strong><strong>22, “Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall betray me. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I?\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011012.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6418\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011012.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"20131203-0701101\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nAt the Last Supper Jesus is eating with His twelve and speaks about betrayal. This is perhaps the worst gesture that a “friend” can do to another friend, even worse than death, because one has to live with the fact that betrayal meant a complete hardening of the heart in the midst of the relationship. Jesus makes the statement that one of his “friends” there would deny him, and when He did everyone of them became sorrowful and looked introspectively saying “Lord is it I?” No one pointed fingers at Judas as if he had a big hook nose and devilish horns coming out of his head. The Scriptures point out that two of the disciples went against Jesus at his hour of need. Peter denied Jesus and Judas betrayed Jesus, so what’s the difference, or are they not the same?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWell let’s look at Peter first. Jesus says to the group that “<strong>all you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad</strong>.” <strong>Peter answered and said to him, “Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet will I never be offended.” Jesus responded by saying to him, “…this night, before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.” Peter said to him, “Though I should die with you, yet will I not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.</strong>” Peter really meant to keep his word, but when he was tested he folded under pressure three times just as Jesus said. We know that later in Peter’s life he got things together and became a leader among the Apostles and wrote two books of the Bible bearing his name.\r\n\r\nJudas on the other hand turned against Jesus a bit differently. <strong>“Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, And said to them, What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.”</strong> Judas was plotting and scheming behind the scenes with those that wanted to see the destruction of Christ, and the disbanding of his disciples. Those evil men used Judas as a pawn to work an inside job on Jesus. While in prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, Judas comes with his entourage of chief priests and armed soldiers. <strong>“And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. And Jesus said to him, Friend, wherefore are you come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</strong>” Jesus calls him friend and yet Judas still sells him out in betrayal. With friends like Judas who needs enemies?\r\n\r\nPeter grabbed his sword when they laid hold of Jesus and cut of one of the soldier’s ears to defend the Lord. He was showing his seriousness of protecting Jesus at all costs, even death. After Peter’s denial the Scriptures says that Peter “<strong>went out and wept bitterly [in repentance].”</strong> Judas however felt the guilt of betraying Jesus for thirty pieces of silver and tried to give it back, admitting that he had sinned against innocent blood, and he threw the coins down at the feet of the priests and went forth and hung himself. Both men felt sorrow for their sin, but Peter repented while Judas committed suicide.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application:  If you find your actions plotting against your relationship with Jesus, repent right away, because the Judas lives in us tries to rise up and take charge. If you have denied Jesus by your life in anyway also repent and move on and do great things for your Lord. Remember your faith MUST stand trial, so that it can be refined.   Blessings Pastor Phil </strong>"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 9:25-27,“All those who compete in a race use self-control so they can win a crown. That crown is an earthly thing that lasts only a short time, but our crown will never be destroyed. So, I do not run without a goal. I fight like a boxer who is hitting something-not just the air. I treat my body hard and make it my slave so that I myself will not be disqualified after I have preached to others” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011013.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6421\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011013.jpg\" alt=\"Runners\" width=\"236\" height=\"236\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nAre you a winner or are you a loser in the race of life? You can’t be both.\r\n\r\nChristian life is a lot like running a race or playing a game. It requires discipline, training, caching, determination and sheer hard work. There is a goal to be reached and reward to be won at the end of the race for those who win the race.\r\n\r\nJust as the goal of any team or individual playing a game or running a race is to win in order to receive a crown, trophy or a reward, so should be the goal of a Christian. We are called to run our race diligently here on earth so we can live victorious life and finally receive the crown that Jesus our master and chief coach has prepared for those who will win the race. There is a wonderful party planned in heaven for the winners. That is why you and I must run and fight persistently against all odds and ends, obstacles, limitations and intimidations of the devil. In our race, the enemy of our soul and a body is the Satan. <!--more-->He has marshaled his fallen demons to resist us on the way so we can give up and accept defeat. Well, the choice to win or be defeated is yours. God has equipped us and trained us as His children for winning. The Bible says that when you train a child in the right way to, to live and run the right way, he shall not forget when he is old (<strong>Proverbs 22:6</strong>)\r\n\r\nGod is never a looser. His children should never be losers either. If they chose to follow in the footsteps of the Father and do what the Father teaches and has always done to win they too must win. Satan’s main occupation is to defeat the believers. He can only do that if we let him. If we rise up and run tough, he has no chance of winning championship.\r\n\r\nRun to win. Only winners can celebrate victory. Joy is in the camp of winners. Happiness, jubilation, excitement, relaxation and relief, and expectation can only be found with the winners. Losers are gloomy, sad, disappointed, frustrated, and hopeless, in some cases.\r\n\r\nI remember back in 2004 NBA how Detroit Pistons won the NBA championship, beating the Lakers. Now this was unexpected. The winning team was being referred to as underdog which stood no chance of winning. But they won. What a celebration of the victory! I watched them shout, scream, jump, hug each other and kiss their trophy. Now that is the spirit of a winner and a winning team. What about you and your team? Are you winning or losing? If you are not excited, thrilled, joyous, celebrating, optimistic and happy with your life today regardless of what happens to you, you are losing the game to the devil. Rise up and play tough. Listen to the coach-the Holy Ghost. Even Jesus depended on His father and the disciples to win. You too must support and seek the support and help of other team members. You can’t win a lone. Don’t forget the supporters and fans who are also eager to see you win. That is why they are encouraging and cheering you to run hard and not give up.  Today, meditate on the words Paul wrote about the Christian race:\r\n\r\n<strong>“All those who compete in a race use self-control so they can win a crown. That crown is an earthly thing that lasts only a short time, but our crown will never be destroyed. So, I do not run without a goal. I fight like a boxer who is hitting something-not just the air. I treat my body hard and make it my slave so that I myself will not be disqualified after I have preached to others (1 Corinthians 9:25-27). Let us run to win! Blessings, Boaz</strong>"

              "<strong>Numbers 21:8-9, “8 </strong><strong>Then the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> said to Moses, “Make a fiery <em>serpent,</em> and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” </strong><strong>9 </strong><strong>So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011014.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6425\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011014.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"20131203-0701101\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThe book of Hebrews opens up with God’s supreme revelation, and throughout the book it establishes that Jesus and His message is above the prophets, angels, priests etc. It begins with “<strong>1 God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 2 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">has in these last days spoken to us by His Son</span>, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; “, Hebrews 11:1-2</strong>. There were some signs either through dreams, acts, audible voices that were for a time and a season. They addressed specific things in history however they were not rolled out by the Lord as normative for us to look to. God has spoken to us consistently by His sufficient trusted word. Jesus said as recorded in <strong>Hebrews 10:7, “… ‘Behold, I have come— <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">In the volume of the book it is written of Me</span>— To do Your will, O God.’”</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, there are things that were consistent based on His promises and then there are things rarely out of the ordinary for a time, a season God did for a people to communicate, strengthen or provide. We constantly wrestle through the word to determine if what we see was for a certain people group, for certain time and for a season or a regukar pattern. We need to learn by the word if it’s a promise or a principle because there are things which were not repeated or guaranteed promises. The bible has some things described but that does not mean prescribed.\r\n\r\nGod in His anger in <strong>Numbers 21 </strong>sent a fiery serpent unto the children of Israel because they had spoken against Him and His servant Moses. They had complained of lack of food and water, and even the food God had provided, manna they considered worthless<strong>. </strong>Having been judged, the Lord sent fiery serpent as an act of judgment and they bit the people and many of them died. It is at their point of repentance that<strong>, “8... </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> said to Moses, “Make a fiery <em>serpent,</em> and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” </strong><strong>9 </strong><strong>So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.</strong>”, <strong> Numbers 21:8-9. </strong>This was a spectacular miracle, a picture of Christ dying on the cross<strong>. </strong>Jesus alludes to it in <strong>John 3:13-15</strong>. It was for a time, for a season with significance not to be repeated. Of course the memory was to stay but for what reason worship or remembrance?\r\n\r\nIn <strong>2Kings 2:18</strong>, the brazen serpent had been carefully preserved, as a memorial of God's goodness to their fathers in the wilderness. That was the way it should have been but then Hezekiah destroyed it because what was to be a memorial had been turned into an idol people worshiped, <strong>2Kings 18:4</strong>. What was a means had been turned into an object of worship. It was considered more precious than the giver. It was idle and wicked to burn incense to it. While in our time we may not be doing exactly as they did, I see many people take God’s means and turn them into idols. For example, I have had dreams about certain things and I am convinced it was of the Lord to stir me up but I cannot make the dreams the norm by which the Lord would press something into my heart. His word is sufficient, that is where I turn. If He chooses to strength something by a sign or wonder, my focus is not to shift to those things. I run into people who when God used a means to do something in their lives, that became their focus. They expect the Lord to do it the same way or else. I know of even people who want to hear “thus says the Lord” but not from the scripture but by a word of knowledge, a new revelation, close your mind and tap into the divine etc. to learn what the will of God is for their lives. Remember in these last days God has spoken to us by His Son. If you want to hear God speak, read the word. If you want to hear him audibly, read the word out loud.\r\n\r\nAll helps to devotion, not warranted by the word of God, interrupt the exercise of faith; they always lead to superstition and other dangerous evils. Human nature perverts everything of this kind, this is  why we thank God for His preserved word to keep us in line. True faith needs not such aids to build its confidence apart from the word. It is not looking to and for God’s means as normative, it is turning to the word of God, daily thought upon and prayed over, is all the outward help we need. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Galatians 1:8-9, \"8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/galatians-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6439\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/galatians-1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Galatians-1\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIt is believed by some that there are about 20 - 30 gospels that have been written. When Christians think about the gospel what comes to mind? Perhaps some words like four, good news, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, etc.... However there are writings that some non-gospel writings that some claim have been cleverly left out of the Bible because of contradictions with the four books of the gospel. The Gospel of Thomas, Judas, and Mary are three to name a few. Unfortunately many Christians don't know there Bible that well and are unfamiliar with church history. A few years back the famous book fad that came out was called the Bible Code. Now the Da Vinci Code and the Gospel of Judas are the latest fads.<!--more-->\r\nJesus said, <strong>\"10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\" </strong>Jesus said, \"<strong>THIS GOSPEL of THE KINGDOM WILL BE PREACHED...\"</strong> The Law of God condemns all humanity and breaks the hard heart, but it is the gospel that heals the broken hearted. These other writings are not the gospel. The Gospel of Judas doesn't even mention God's Law which Jesus referred to all throughout His earthly ministry.\r\n\r\nThere is one gospel, the gospel according to Jesus. Paul said that if a man or even an angel from heaven preaches another gospel let him be accursed! Bankers can spot counterfeit currency because they spend so much time looking at the real thing. Let's commit ourselves to looking into the real thing, and living that real thing, the gospel.  We are called to know, do, and preach His Gospel. Do you have a love for what Jesus said? The very author of life has left us a life manual called the gospel. God has trusted His children with the gospel, to magnify it among the nations. Jesus said, \"<strong>The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news (gospel) to the poor [in spirit].\"</strong> If the Spirit of the Lord is upon you, then you too are called to be one that proclaims this gospel. Since the world is interested in these gospel fads of Satan, why not use them as a springboard to bring the gospel to them?\r\n\r\nIf you know the gospel then may you proclaim as Paul \"<strong>Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel</strong>.\"\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Psalm 102:1-28, “1 Hear my prayer, O Lord; let my cry for help come to you. Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly……. 17 He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/galatians-11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6442\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/galatians-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Galatians-1\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nI usually like to share the word from my experiences, I find it easy to share with people what I have already gone through just to encourage and give them energy to keep going because sometimes we feel like we are going through a lot but someone else went through worse and they survived, and so if you hear their story it gives you the oomph to push on. So my devotion today kind of ties up with what my husband shared on “God can” message sometime bac. I am sure we have all prayed a similar prayer like the one above in <strong>Psalm 102</strong> and there are times it did feels like God never answered. Have you ever prayed for something for years and years and then you prayed with someone about the same thing for God to open those doors for that someone and it happened within hours or a couple of days or weeks or just months? And here you are, been praying for years and years and nothing? <!--more-->Yes I have been there and it is quite painful but when we realize that the will of God is different for each one of us just like we are all different from each other, then we understand what it means for God to answer our prayers at His own perfect timing. Isn’t it interesting we pray to God about something and tell him God please you know my heart you know my desires, I pray that you will grant me this and that at your own perfect timing and when he takes time to give it to you at His perfect timing we give up, throw in the towel, become bitter, depressed, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are so many stories I can give here but I am going to choose one that happened recently. I graduated as a nurse in 2007 and this was quite an accomplishment for me, see all through my school years up until college, I was a very average student. My siblings were doing much better than I was in school, my two sisters were B+ students and my two brothers were C+ students and me? I’ll leave that to your imagination. I struggled with school a lot and for some reason when I came to America it seemed like school suddenly made sense and here I was graduating with my bachelors in nursing 5 yrs later. Well, the battle started when I had to sit for my Boards to get my license I thought well, I did well in nursing school and that was a lot of work so if I accomplished nursing school then Boards should be a breeze right?? Wrong!! It took me 8 trials to get my licensure and every time I went to sit for the exams I had to part with $200. I was an emotional wreck, I hated answering this question every time I met people or went to gatherings and people knew I graduated as a nurse being asked all the time so how is work and me having to tell them I’m not working and then having to answer to why, it was exhausting. But in between my, I think it was the fifth time, I was so broken I remember calling my mom and crying on the phone and asking if I was never meant to be a nurse, if I should go back to school and do something else, was God punishing me for something that I did? Why did God bring me out here and help me through nursing school only to have this tiny road block that I seem to not know how to maneuver around it? Poor mom, she has been a big part of who I am, and she encouraged me and took me back to some basics that I needed to hear and needed to be reaffirmed. So I picked up myself, my husband cried with me, we prayed and I decided that from that day on whatever happens I will love my God, I will serve Him, I will praise Him, I will trust in Him, I will not run away from Him and I will do all these with gladness and JOY in my heart. It was hard, it was very hard, I had come to a point where going to church was a struggle, I did not feel like praising God why should I when I am hurting and feeling like He forgot about me? I still cry when I remember when I made that decision but I cannot overlook my life without God in it and I knew there has to be a purpose and it will all make sense to me one day. I went and sat for my boards a 6<sup>th</sup> time and a 7<sup>th</sup> time and 8<sup>th</sup> was my breakthrough. I remember standing at the door before I entered the exam room and telling God please Lord, I don’t know where I will put my face if I don’t come out of here victorious, I know I promised to try until I get it right and I promised to be on your side no matter what but I need this Goliath in my life to die. Those were my exact words and I said if you don’t go with me Lord, I am dead and I opened the door and went through the routine I had done over and over again. I finished my exam &amp; I had no idea what to think of it. About 3 or 4 days later I received 2 big packages in the mail and I thought oh my word, they have seen my name so many times they are sending me back to nursing school or rejecting me, my heart was literally pounding off my chest, my hands were shaking so bad, I had a tremendous headache as I was opening that package and when I saw passed, I couldn’t breath, I almost called 911. And the rest is glory to God.\r\n\r\nThe Joy of the Lord was my strength, I had anxiety attacks thinking of how my friends were going on with their lives as nurses while mine is stagnant, but the Joy of the Lord kept me going. He hears our prayers brethren, he sees our hurts and when the time is right we receive our answered prayers. It might not be the way you wanted it to be but if it comes from the Lord, it will work for your situation. So whatever it is you are praying for do not and never give up, pray earnestly keep knocking and I always like reminding people and myself to leave space for God’s will to be done, we have all sorts of plans for the future but ultimately its God’s plan that prevails whether we like it or not or whether we realize it or not. And I will leave you with this keep hope alive, <strong>Romans</strong> <strong>5:5 says, “And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given</strong><strong> us.”</strong> Blessings, Judy Olang."

              "<strong>Psalm 23:5, “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies...” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6445\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nDavid wrote <strong>Psalm 23</strong> toward the end of his life, and therefore it is his reflection of God’s work in the life of David. David had the following experiences: tending sheep, defeating Goliath, being chased by King Saul, anointed King of Israel, committing adultery, repenting of his sin, etc…. To say that David had a full life of vast experiences would be an understatement. Many of us are familiar with this most popular Psalm but what snapshot of David’s life was he thinking of when he wrote, <strong>“You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies...?”</strong> Was Goliath on his mind, or one of his many battles that he led? I believe that David reflected on the time his sheep were hunted by a lion or a bear that could easily devour and carry them away. However David was the sheep, and he was not being hunted by a foreign army, or even any such enemy of Israel, he was being hunted by an enemy lion, with the attributes of Satan who seeks to steal kill and destroy, that was supposed to be on his side.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>“He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. The men said, “This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.’ ” Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe</strong> “, <strong>1Samuel 24:3-4.</strong>\r\n\r\nPerhaps the worst enemies of all are those that you think are on your side, but that pursue your demise. There may be any number of reasons such as jealousy or bitterness, which in the case with David and Saul seemed to be the prevalent reasons. David learned how to dodge Saul’s spears time and time again, and now David is hiding out far back in a cave. Interestingly enough though while David and his men were at the back of the cave, guess who laid down to rest near the front of cave? Saul! God had prepared a table for David in the presence of his enemy Saul. David had Saul in the palm of his hand as David was standing over a sleeping Saul he raised his blade over Saul. WOW, God had given David’s enemy into his hands for him to deal with as he wished. David being more honorable man than Saul chose to spare Saul’s life by bringing the blade down and cutting off a piece of Saul’s robe to show that he could have taken Saul’s life.\r\n\r\n<strong>“…The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their cry;”</strong> God’s favor rested with a righteous David as he brought his enemy to him and placed David’s enemy in a vulnerable state. God has a way of bringing down our enemies, and preparing a table of blessing before us in their presence. David could have killed Saul, but he didn’t. David implored what we now read as Christ’s words, “<strong>Bless your enemies.”</strong> Are their perhaps those that are seeking your demise because God is looking with favor upon you? Do not fear because God has a way of bringing your enemies to your feet and preparing a table before you in the very presence of your enemies.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: Have you been following the world’s advice of “don’t get mad, get even?” “Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord. On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, Romans 12:19-20.

              "<strong>2Kings 6:8-23, “21 </strong><strong>When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?” </strong><strong>22 </strong><strong>“Do not kill them,” he answered. “Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master.”</strong><strong>23 </strong><strong>So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel’s territory.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6449\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThe world is hostile. We have enemies in every corner and greater enemies against believers. Other religions are more tolerated than Christians in dealing with challenges that face Christians. While the fierce battle against Christians is to wipe them out of the map, the strategy God has often given believers is not to engage the enemy with the same battle plan as they do but fight God's battles God's way. God’s given strategies are many times unconventional in our judgment, they don't make sense but they are mighty through God and we must learn by the word of God how best to fight.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe story in <strong>2Kings 6</strong> is of Elisha and his encounter with the Syrians. Naaman a captain of Syria had earlier been healed by Elisha; however that did not stop his people from waging war against Israel and their prophet. This is a picture of how the enemy can be blinded even when you do good to one of their own. Elisha the prophet was able to see in the spiritual realm their plans and warned the king of Israel of Syrians pending plans, exposing their plans leading to failure. The fact that Elisha knew their plans and could advise the king of Israel to set up a troop against them was a form of demonstrating that God had delivered the Syrians in the hands of the prophet and his people. They had in every way by God's divine providence dodged their enemies plans. God in more than once had delivered them in their hands, however they did not raise their weapons to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was persistent, worked hard to find the mole that exposed their plans only to be told it was Elisha the prophet. Elisha was deemed dangerous and was to be captured by a great army. They sent an army by night to surround the city and Elisha the prophet slept through the night knowing there was an enemy there to capture him. Those who were with them were greater than those who came against them. While they had power over the Syrian army, God did not command them to destroy them, if anything; Elisha prayed that God would strike them with temporary blindness. In one case his servant’s eyes were opened to see the greatness of God, but unto the enemy, they were blinded and sought help. Elisha then led them right into Samaria where he prayed that their eyes would be opened.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 21, “Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”</strong> What a great opportunity to destroy the enemies of Israel and here we see the king very eager to destroy them, asking for permission. Elisha answered, <strong>vs. 22</strong> <strong>“You shall not kill them. Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.” </strong>The invisible army to supporting Israel did not destroy the Syrian, Elisha who could ask the Lord for anything including the death of the enemies did not, and when the king of Israel asked for permission, he would not let him. He did something Jesus would preach about later in the NT. He told the king to set food before them and water and the king <strong>vs 23. “…prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis was a mile of excellence, the second mile, not only forgive, but set a great feast before those who sought to destroy them. The first mile is the minimum most may sign up for, with Christ believers go the second mile, the mile of excellence, the mile that distinguishes us from the rest. <strong>Romans 12:20, “Therefore \"If your enemy is hungry, feed him; If he is thirsty, give him a drink; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.\"</strong> Jesus teaching<strong>, “43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47 And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? 48 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.” </strong>The first mile is forgive, the mile of excellence is love, bless, and pray for your enemies. If He said let go, that might be a little bit easy but not only let them go, love them, bless them, and pray for them? This is impossible unless you have drawn from the one who forgave, loved, blessed, and prayed for his enemies who put Him on the cross.\r\n\r\nWith the leadership of Elisha, they shut the mouth of the enemy not with a sword but by their action, a mile of excellence. They did good to those who did not deserve it, those who wanted to destroy them and sent them away <strong>“For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men”, 1Peter 2:15.</strong>\r\n\r\nCan we as believers pray to God to baptize us with such great compassion that we forgive, love, bless and pray for our enemies? That we win them by love they desperately need, <strong>Proverbs 10:12, “Hatred stirs up strife, But love covers all sins”. </strong>Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Jude 1:3 “…contend earnestly for THE faith which was ONCE for ALL delivered to the saints</strong>”<strong>.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6452\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n3.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIn the last couple of years, there have been stories about people from the middle east getting saved through dreams without hearing the gospel or the name of Jesus. While I may not limit anything the God of creation can do, I believe when I read scripture that He has chosen to limit the means by which He will save His people. I do not find anywhere in scripture where God saves by dreams and even visions and I will by scripture present a case.\r\n\r\nThe natural revelation helps men see that God has created everything.  David heralds this in <strong>Psalm 19:1, “The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork”</strong>.  And Paul in <strong>Romans 1:20</strong> echoes the same <strong>“20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse”. </strong>God never chose the natural revelation to be the means to save men but prepare men for the supernatural or special revelation. The natural revelation can create a  desire for special revelation, however the natural has no power of its own.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nPaul declared that the Gospel (good news) is the power of God unto salvation, <strong>Romans 1:16</strong>, for in the Gospel is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, <strong>Romans 1:17</strong>. And Paul who penned these words, he made sure we understood by what means the power of God came about. It is by preaching the gospel that people respond by calling on Him. In <strong>Romans 10:13,</strong> He declares how we are saved “<strong>For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.” </strong>But then he brings about a dilemma that must be addressed, he says<strong> vs. “14 How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?”</strong> Paul is stating clearly that for one to believe, they must hear to believe and it must be done by preaching (sharing the gospel). The gospel that is preached produces faith, <strong>Romans 10:17, “ So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”. </strong>The voice of God is His word, this is the special revelation. “F<em>aith comes by hearing the word and not by studying the nature. Nature drives us to scripture for true understanding of God and His ways, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">it’s the word of God that gives birth to faith</span>”</em>, Phil Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe sufficiency of scripture prepares man for salvation. Paul reminds Timothy of the process of his salvation “<strong>and that from childhood you have <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith</span> which is in Christ Jesus”, 2Timothy 3:15. </strong>Timothy did not come through any other means but by the truth of the scripture.\r\n\r\nCornelius in <strong>Acts 10 </strong>received a vision of an angel of the Lord who brought good tidings of God’s acceptance of his alms and prayers. Instead of God by the angel declaring him saved or preaching to him, Cornelius by vision he received sent for Peter who when he came preached Jesus (gospel) to him and his household and there they received the gospel. Similar to the experience of the Ethiopian eunuch, he did not receive an angel visit like Cornelius but his heart was eager the same way as Cornelius to learn and serve. God sent an angel to speak to Phillip to go and meet him, <strong>Acts 8:30-32, “30 So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Do you understand</span> what you are reading? 31 And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” …35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him”.  </strong>The understanding is informed by the word of God, faith comes by hearing…Jesus called a person who hears the word and understands it good ground or good soil, <strong>Matthew 13:23.</strong> Understanding is special revelation.\r\n\r\nThe natural revelation is important and most necessary just like the law, the reality is, the scripture has superior power to bring to light special revelation that leads to salvation through the preaching of the word. Dreams and visions may be a means of awakening, but they are not the means for salvation, <strong>Hebrews 4:12, “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” </strong>\r\n\r\nJude encourages believers to <strong>“…contend earnestly for THE faith which was ONCE for ALL delivered to the saints</strong>”, <strong>Jude 1:3. </strong>We must stick to the word, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 39:1, \"I said, “I will guard my ways, Lest I sin with my tongue; I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle, While the wicked are before me.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-shepherd-sermon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-6475\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-shepherd-sermon.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"The-Shepherd-sermon\" width=\"257\" height=\"193\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nOur tongues are great, God made them to be used for His glory. It becomes lethal if untamed. It's a very small thing but has such great power. This makes me wonder whether the Lord gave us two ears and one mouth so that we will be inclined to hear more and speak less. I know the power of the tongue because I've said things I wished I did not, they cut deep like a sharp knife. It's like a gun, once fired; it's gone and cannot be retrieved. I hear people say, “Take back what you just said” as a figure of speech. I also hear some say, “speak your mind”, very dangerous request. <strong>Proverbs 18:21</strong>, tells us <strong>\"Death and life are in the power of the tongue,...\". </strong>This verse is often used by prosperity preachers to tell their listeners that they can create their reality by how they speak, that you are what you speak. This is not correct, all the verse is saying is that a man may do a great deal of good, or a great deal of hurt, both to others and to himself, according to the use he makes of his tongue.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJames (Jesus half-brother) is the only one I find in the Bible that describes greatly the power of the tongue. James provided several analogies that show how the tongue, even though small, has the power to control one’s whole person and influence everything in his life. He says <strong>\"And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell\", James 3:6. </strong>The tongue is like a wild fire seeking to be unleashed. It is never satisfied, it is always looking for ways to be out of control. You may feel like I do sometimes to have the last word in a conversation showing exactly its drive. It is by the tongue that we blame and it is by the tongue that we justify ourselves even when we are wrong. What has been used the most to try and get people out of trouble? lying lips. The bible says, <strong>\"Lying lips are abomination to the Lord\"</strong>. It is by the tongue we speak error. We backbite and contaminate or ruin other people’s lives by it. Sometimes we say nice things but how we say them defiles even with good intentions. It is by the tongue that we boast the more, <strong>Luke 18</strong> records of a Pharisee boasting in his prayer despising a publican praying too.\r\n\r\nCan anyone put their tongue under control? James says <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">no man can tame the tongue</span></strong>. He says people have tamed wild animals but have failed to tame their tongue. And the reason is simple, no one has the ability on their own to tame the tongue, only God by His power can do this. When we guard our ways as the Psalmist says, God's power is present in us to overcome sinning with our tongue. To be conformed to the image of Christ and Him be formed in us (<strong>Galatians 4:18-20</strong>) is the means to bring our tongues under control. The psalmist says, \"<strong>I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle\"</strong>, a muzzle is a device that is placed over the snout of an animal to keep it from <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">biting </span>or <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">otherwise opening its mouth</span>. The muzzle is put in the mouth of an animal the times it needs it the most and our prayer to the Lord is help us muzzle our mouths so as not to sin. God’s word is a muzzle. <strong>Psalm 119:11, “Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You</strong>”.\r\n\r\nHow do we do it, <strong>James 1:19, “So then, my beloved brethren<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak,</span> slow to wrath; 20 for the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God</span>\". </strong>We need wisdom from above,<strong> James 1:5, \"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him\". Proverbs 12:18, \"There is one who speaks like the piercings of a sword, But the tongue of the wise promotes health\". </strong>How much more do we need wisdom to know when to be quite and when to speak encouraging words that build? <strong>Proverbs 15:2, “The tongue of the wise uses knowledge rightly, But the mouth of fools pours forth foolishness</strong>”\r\n\r\nUnder frustration and anger, people often say things they wish they could take back. Husbands say things that hurt their wives and vise versa. Parents say things to their children, and we say things to our bosses, colleagues at work, and members of the body of Christ that hurt. On our own we are unable tame our tongues the reason to pray always to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves in how we hear, respond, speak. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Our tongues untamed by the Holy Spirit is deadly on their own</span></strong>. Paul encourages Timothy his son, <strong>2Timothy 2:23-25 “23 But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. 24 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, 25 in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth</strong>”, All these are cultivated by the fear of God we should crave for.

The 36th verse reads \"one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him\".  Did the Pharisee need to be close to Jesus or did he think it would help his reputation to have such a great guest at his table? Remember the centurion, he declared his unworthiness to have Christ’s company in his own house. Did this Pharisee imagine he was worthy of Jesus’ attention? He calls Mary a sinner but not himself. According to him, if Jesus was a true prophet, he would not let such a woman tend to Him. We always grapple with our purpose for coming to Christ. Was He worthy of our worship or did we come of our own merit? Do we think we deserved His attention or feel that we are better than others?\r\n\r\nSimon, the Pharisee, represents the unloving and self-righteous. He represents  those who are ignorant of God. Those are the people God has a heart for. They may be respectable in life but rigid in morality. He despised the woman, and now, Jesus, who received the woman. He was quick to judge others than himself. \"A Pharisee is hard on others and easy on himself, but a spiritual man is easy on others and hard on himself.\", A.W. Tozer."

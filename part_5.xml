  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Judges 15:18-19, "18 Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the LORD, “You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?” 19 Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived.", (NIV).</strong>

The desire to be victorious in every area is a thirst majority craves for. A desire to let everything run smoothly in one’s life yet we find that there are times you are victorious in one area and a failure in other areas. We are like trees that go through different seasons, the winter, spring, summer and autumn. If you took time to look at trees in these different seasons, you will discover that there is change on how they look. During winter time, their leaves are gone. For someone who may not know may conclude the trees are dead but the truth of the matter is, they are alive and well adjusting to the season in which they find themselves in. Their existence is not dependant on the season, their existence is dependant on the roots that have gone deep underground in search of water and nutrients. So the days they may not look attractive, they still have a way of surviving one season while they wait for the next season.

<!--more-->

Is this different from a life of a believer? I don’t think so, we too go through different seasons. There are seasons of great victories, the seasons where everything you touch is blessed, every move you make prospers then there are those times that everything you touch is a disaster. The seasons of defeat, every believer have different seasons. The key is to learn to adapt in every season, causing your roots to go down deep into the ground in search of water provided by the Almighty God, meanwhile you wait and prepare for the next season.

In <strong>Judges 15</strong>, Samson had such a season of great victory. By just a jaw bone of a donkey, he had killed a thousand men. What a huge success, great victory not by his own hands but by the help of God. Then out of the victory, right in the sun, tired and exhausted, he thirsts for water. He turns to God and cries out to God, “”<strong>You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised</strong>" This is to some how say, “<em>God if you gave me victory over one area, will you let me be defeated in another area?"</em> He desired water that may give him strength to survive the heat of the sun. He desired water to revive him to face another season. It’s sad to know that there are people who abandon God when they find themselves in a season that is not comfortable being in. Like Samson, right in that hot season, we can cry to God for water, His words to give us strength and revive us. Just as the disciples said, <strong>John 6:68, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life”</strong>, seasons had changed for them too from being fed with bread to being fed with the word, many stopped following Jesus and the disciples had a chance to leave too. They knew that instead of turning away in a new season, they desired to cling to the water giver and that is what they did.

Amazing thing about seasons, they change but God remains the same and believers can learn to adapt in every season. The same God who gave Samson strength to destroy God's enemies is the same God who gave Him water to sustain him in that victory and the life to come. <strong>Hebrews 12:2, "… looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith", blessings Ev</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 1:8-18, "But Hannah answered and said, "No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured my soul before the Lord"</strong>

People do struggle to pray. You may have struggled numerous times to pray and still got nowhere. And if you prayed, your prayers felt so dry, not effective, and did not even enjoy it. I remember years back when I had the same kind of struggle and God had to teach me to pray effectively changing my whole perspective on prayers and how to approach the throne of grace. Yes I still struggle to pray, the will to is there, the strength and the effectiveness sometimes fail.

<!--more-->

<strong>If we are going to get heaven's attention on a matter, we have to do what it takes. </strong>Prayers gets God’s attention, it causes heaven to be in motion. Hannah had something she desired of the Lord and she understood the only way to receive it was to come before the Lord. <strong>God rewards persevering faith in prayers</strong>, she had it. The bible says in <strong>Hebrews 10:35-36, "35 Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward, 36. For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise". </strong>Our confidence in God drives us to pray to Him as there is a reward in seeking God. Seeking Him calls for endurance (patience) and we see this with Hannah too. After we have done the will of God which is to seek His Kingdom first and His righteousness, <strong>Mathew 6:33</strong>, then the promise of the things we have desired according to His will shall are added unto us.

One thing about this woman was that she learnt to pour her heart to the Lord. A lot of things were in her spirit, all she could do was cry out to God. Eli mistook her for being drunk with wine and even asked her to refrain from it and her response, "<strong>I have poured my soul before the Lord</strong>". <strong>I would say that you have to be broken to pour what’s inside. Part of being broken will cause you to be real when you pray</strong>. <strong>When you are broken, you have no ability to hold anything inside</strong>. A woman came to wash Jesus feet wiping them with her hair, she brought with her the Alabaster box that contained precious oil, she was willing to break the box so that oil would flow out. She did not want to save anything so she poured it all out. If we are going to pray effectively, we are going to break everything and pour our hearts to the Lord like Hannah. A tax collector in <strong>Luke 18:13</strong> poured his heart to the Lord by beating his breast and saying, <strong>"God, be merciful to me a sinner</strong>", he poured it all. If you remember the Pharisee that was standing next to this publican, he came to pray but was proud and arrogant and God would not listen to him.

We can pray for sure but can we pray effectively? have we learnt to pour our hearts to the Lord to say everything that I am dealing with, troubling me, destroying me, I desire, I choose to pour it to you? Just as I am, I am coming to you, casting all my cares upon you. What are you trusting God for today? are you willing to endure praying and pouring your heart to the Lord like Hannah did? If we want God to move, this must be the year of prayer.

Be blessed Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 103:1-2, “1 Bless the LORD, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His holy name! 2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, And forget not all His benefits:”</strong>

To God be the glory great things He has done. He is worthy to be praised, He redeemed our lives from destruction. One woman who had been delivered by Jesus, at one point brought in an alabaster box full of precious oil. She broke the box and out of it came precious oil with fragrance filing the room. She took that which was precious to her to wash Jesus’ feet wiping His feet with her hair. I see a woman blessing the Lord, she is taking that which is precious and giving it back to God what belongs to Him. She is sacrificing and doing what is right and not everyone is happy about it especially Judas Iscariot.

We are blessed to know that we can offer back to God what He requires, worship. I know that we are used to being on the receiving end, but let’s begin to bless the Lord commanding every fiber of our being to acknowledge that He deserves our worship<strong>. Psalm 150:6, “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord” </strong>We choose to bless the Lord this day, <strong>Psalm 34:1, “I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in my mouth”.</strong>

<!--more-->We don’t bless Him because we have it, we bless Him because He deserves it. Blessing the Lord is not reserved for special occasions, He deserves to be blessed at all times just as we don’t except to receive blessings on special occasions. Bless Him in the morning, at noon time, in the evening, all night long. The Psalmist in our text begins by blessing the Lord, giving God back what He requires of us which is worship. He understands that the moment he begins to give this service, not every part of his body will comply with his desire, but if he can get his soul to begin, the soul has a way of affecting his entire being. This is why the Lord deals with the heart first before dealing with the body and mind. If the heart is touched, the heart is in a position to affect the mind and the body. With our hearts, we bless His holy name for He is holy.

As we bless the Lord, we are reminded of the benefits bestowed upon us. There is a great difference between the benefits and the benefactor for there can be no benefits without the existence of a benefactor. It’s in our process of worshipping God that we are reminded of His benefits. Today I will touch on the benefit of healing (Who heals all thy diseases). Healing is a benefit from the Lord, a benefit that came with salvation package. Salvation is the main thing just like applying for a job, the job is the main thing but besides the main thing, there are benefits to go with it. Not only does healing become a benefit, we are told that He heals all our diseases. If He said some, then we will dig in further to find out which ones are covered in the benefit but when He said all, it’s an indication that there is no sickness that cannot be handled by God. <strong>Isaiah 53:5, “He was wounded for my transgressions, He was bruised for my iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon Him and by His stripes we are healed”.</strong> He was beaten that I may be saved and not just saved but healed also from all my diseases. He says, “<strong>I am the Lord that heals you, I sent forth my word and it healed all your diseases for there is nothing too difficult for Me</strong>”.

Since the year started, we have heard cases of people sick and we’ve been praying for them. You might be sick in your body this morning or someone whom you know is sick, know that sickness is not from the Lord, it’s from the devil. You might have this thought that sickness could be coming in as a punishment for sin from the Lord, well God is not the author of evil but good, He may allow but He will not start it. We have a chance to bless the Lord, remember His benefits and call on Him to bring them to pass according to His will. He is a God of restoration <strong>Joel 2:25, “And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten…”</strong>, God will restore health in the days, weeks, months, years that the enemy has brought sickness in your life and loved ones. The word restoration is to bring back to its original state before losing anything. Some people’s health need to be restored, you may be having a cold, asthma, stomach pain, chest pains, back pains, cancer, kidney problems and you name it. God is able to restore back your health because that is His benefit for us. <strong>Ephesians 3:20, “Now unto Him who is able to do exceeding, abundantly, above all we ask or imagine according to the power that works in us”.</strong> Let God be God in your situation and may He receive glory for being God in your needs. Healing is a benefit, why not trust God to move in your situation according to His written will? Have a blessed day full of healing. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It's past time that we should get back to believing and trusting the Lord Jesus Christ at his word. So many are sick in the Body of Christ, and suffering needlessly. Praise God there are those who are teaching about the Lord Jesus desire to heal. It is all there in his precious Word. Let us read and understand, and then appropriate this gift for ourselves and our loved ones and brethren. But...we must have or aquire the necessary faith to lay hold on it. 
He, the Lord Jesus could do no mighty works in his own country because of their unbelief. And so, these apparently continued on in their suffering. How sad.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 139:1-24, “Search me, O God and know my heart; Try me, and know my thoughts (anxieties).</strong>

The Psalmist in this text had an encounter with God in a way that caused him to know that God has a perfect knowledge of man. He begins by saying in<strong> vs. 1, “O Lord, You have searched me and known me”,</strong> He knows more than just my name, He knows me inside out. The Psalmist is giving us examples to show how the Lord knows him.<strong> "You know my sitting and my rising up; You understand my thought a far off", </strong>God knows when we are weak and when we are strong. He knows when we need more and He knows our thoughts from a far off, both wicked and pleasant thoughts. When you are thinking of what to say, He already knew what you were thinking and what you planned to say.

<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 3, “You comprehend my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways”,</strong> Lord You understand when I take this road, when no one else understands me and when many criticize me for taking this path, You are the only One who understands. My lying down also is not news to You for You know when I am tired and weary, You protect me when I am lying down. Vs. 4, “<strong>For there is not a word on my tongue, but behold, O Lord, You know it altogether”,</strong> I’m glad Lord that You know the words that are coming out of my mouth, You know what I’m trying to say, when I’m trying to say it and how I’m trying to say it. Before I even pray, You already know what I’m going to pray about for nothing in my life escapes You.<strong> vs. 5, “You have hedged me behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me”,</strong> I remember when You told the children of Israel that You will go before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire, I know You are doing the same in my life, for the wind cleans my path and the fire builds a hedge of protection around me and lights my path. When I feel like I’m alone, Your hand upon me gives me the assurance that I am not alone.

<strong>vs. 6, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain it</strong>“, Lord just being convinced up to this far that You know me blows my mind for it’s just to much to really understand that in as much as I do not know myself like I should, You know me better than anybody else in the entire world.<strong> vs. 7 “Where can I go from Your Spirit”,</strong> With all this knowledge about me Lord, where can I go where your presence is not there for You are everywhere. They call you Jehovah Shammah which means God present, You are our refuge and strength, a very present help. I am encouraged to know that I can never escape Your presence for when I find myself in heaven one day, Your presence will be there. You are there in good times in my life and in bad times. And if I put my bed in hell which in other words if my actions, denials and rebellion puts me in a state where I feel like I am in hell, You will still be there with me because You know how to deliver me. <strong>Vs 12, “Indeed even darkness shall hide from You, But the night shines as the day; The darkness and the light are both a like to You</strong>“, Lord I’m reminded that you are not intimidated by darkness in my life for you see through and beyond the darkness. The moment You come in, darkness has no choice but to leave. Whatever is a mess in my life, You take it and turn it around to make something good out of it. You are the only God who has a way of taking my mess and making it into something useful. Thank You for taking me a mess and making me into a vessel of Honor to store treasure in.

<strong>Vs 13, “For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb”,</strong> Lord the fact that You formed me blows my mind. You took time to make this being, crafted me in Your arms. A lot could have killed me or caused me to be aborted or miscarried but You covered me, You protected me and natured me until I was ushered into the world and even with that, still You did not say the work is done.

<strong>Vs 14, “I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, marvelous are Your works</strong>“, This is now too big to comprehend Lord, that out of the 6 billion people on the earth, You fearfully and wonderfully made me that no one else is like me. To make it even interesting, You did not make me a junky but took time to form, fix, straighten me the original version and therefore there can be no one that can beat me being me. I’m a piece of art designed and developed at a time like this, marvelous are Your works and my soul knows it very well.

This is just too good to be true but it is, God knows each and every one of us in a way we could never understand. He can hear everyone at the same time and to prove what He can do,<strong> Matthew 10:30, “The very hairs on your head are numbered</strong>” not counted but numbered.

In the whole devotion there is one little important word repeated over and over again, it’s the common denominator<strong> “YOU”</strong> which is God Himself. Without Him, we can do nothing. Why not sit back and let “YOU” take over your life. To finish. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 139:1-24, “Search me, O God and know my heart; Try me, and know my thoughts (anxieties).</strong>

From what we shared in part 1, the common denominator word<strong> “YOU”</strong> which refers to God in everything and in every step of the way, for He knows us inside out, whether we be sleeping, waking up, talking, standing, fallen and so on and so forth, He still knows us. Let’s continue from vs. 15 of <strong>Psalm 139.</strong>

<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 15, “My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth”.</strong> My frame which are my bones which form the skeleton were not hidden from You Lord, after all You made me. I’m amazed how You applied skills in making my internal and external organs in secret that all people could see the finished work. You created my spirit out of nothing, formed my body out of something and breathed in life in me and I became a living soul. My life is in your hands.
<strong>Vs. 16, “Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And Your book they were all written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them”.</strong> Lord I could stop here for this is just too wonderful, You already knew how I would be born, how I would live and the days You fashioned for me in this world. You told Jeremiah that I had plans for you before he was formed, You knew him and ordained him to be a prophet to the nations.<strong> He made us to glorify His name the reason He can brag on His handiwork”</strong>.<strong> vs. 17, “how precious also are Your thoughts to me O God”,</strong> Lord You think about me even when I don’t do the same many times, every single day of my life Your thoughts towards me surely stands and I know that they cannot be numbered. It’s not because I am worthy of that precious thought but because Your loving kindness.

<strong>Vs. 19-22,</strong> In these verses I know of those who hate You and oppose Your existence oh God, they hate and blame You for certain things they had to go through but they forget to look at the great things that You have done in their lives already. No one can add even a second to their lives. We therefore humble ourselves for we are motivated by reality that without You we can do nothing.

<strong>Vs. 23&amp;24, “search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts. And see if there is any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting”.</strong> Lord in as much as there are people who don’t believe, live or even walk with You, there could be something in my life that could be holding me back from knowing You fully. I know You hate sin and do not want anything to take Your place in my heart. I could feel like everything is fine for your word says, “<strong>a man’s ways are pure in his own eyes</strong>”. You are the One to declare us righteous by what You do therefore search me O my God and know my heart,. Like a doctor who performs tests in a person to detect sickness, You are doing the same with my heart. Try me and know my thoughts that will reveal to me where my trust is in. Lord see if there is any wickedness (pride, hatred, anger, lust, resentment, un-forgiveness etc.) in me and then lead me to Your everlasting way. Lord I could perform my own search but I know I might compromise your holiness by qualifying some sins so I give You full control. By this I mean not just be the Savior of my life but also the Lord of my life. NO ONE KNOWS ME LIKE YOU DO. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 5:1-14, vs. 1, “Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, but a leper”.</strong>

I am amazed by how God works, His ways are not our ways and His plans are not our plans. He is the God of the impossibilities. We know He will do it because He has said it in His word, yet often times we do not know how He will do it. We tend to work well with recipes because if we stick to a recipe, we can tell what the result will be. Often times we bring this also in our Christian life as we feel God has a recipe of doing things. It’s like He has set a method A,B,C of how to get it done. <!--more-->God is not a respecter of methods and that is why with God there is no recipe. All you need to know is that it will be done, let the way it’s done left for Him to execute. Another thing, God is no respecter of persons, He can bless anyone including sinners why <strong>Matthew 5:45, “… for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust”</strong>

<strong>Those who validates God’s ability by a recipe are those who lack understanding that He is unlimited God.</strong> How often did you know God was going to come, you thought He will come through the door only to see Him come through the roof?, that is God who does not use recipes. Naaman was a commander, there is no indication that he was a just man because in the later verses of the same chapter, he gets to know the true God. Reading the first line, he was honorable in the eyes of his master because the Lord had given him victory in the battle field. You can tell the rain rained also on the unjust. He was a respected man, had servants, honored, successful but had leprosy. Being told that there was a prophet in Israel who could cure him of this disease, led him to seek help but from the wrong person, the king of Israel. To further complicate things, he came with his own recipe of what he believed God will or should do to heal him. After all he wanted to maintain his status, and deal with certain ranks of people.

Well the king of Israel could not heal him and the prophet who was to heal him did not even meet him though he had what people would consider success. At least we know the prophet was not also a respecter of persons but principles. Naaman was asked to go and dip himself in the river Jordan seven times and he would be cured. Why didn’t God heal him instantly while he was still in his land or respecting his status? Simple God did not have a recipe for this man. And so are we, God can use someone who we don’t even get a long with to bless us, a job that has turned out to be a frustration, something that did not seam like a good thing God could use. He can use the least expected, the least likely, the stones that the builders rejected. If we have a recipe, then the recipe becomes God for we will be out to dictate God on what He should and shouldn’t do. We might be tempted to tell Him of a step on the recipe He might have missed. So don’t keep your eye on one thing He used before thinking that is what He will always use. <strong>Namaan had an end result of what he desired but not by the method he had in mind.</strong>

Jesus healed two blind men in differently, one he spat on the ground, anointed his eyes and told him to go and wash, the other he spoke to. Same results, different methods. When are you going to stop creating recipes from what the Lord did last time and trust Him to do a new thing? Hasn’t His word said, “<strong>Behold I am doing a new thing?</strong>”. If we can know the end result, let the method be left in His hands. Throw away your recipe book, watch, pray, have faith because He is doing something new that is not on any recipe book. Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ecclesiastes 5:4, "When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it; For He has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you have vowed 5, Better not to vow than to vow and not pay"</strong>

In a movie entitled "It could happen to you", we see officer Charlie (Nicholas Cage) a NY city cop with a heart to serve. At the beginning of the movie he goes to this particular restaurant and buys coffee, upon checking his wallet, he finds that he has only enough change for coffee and nothing on the side to leave for tip. At that moment he remembers he had a lottery ticket in his hands he and his wife had purchased hoping to win.<!--more--> His promise to the waiter was to come back and give her the tip or split with her half of the lottery if they won. The waiter (Yvonne) who had dealt with many people who make promises they can't keep including the man she was married to had a hard time believing him. She did not see any way possible for this cop to come back however the cop vowed to come back with tip or half of the lottery win. Not long after, he and his wife discovered they had won 4million dollars. 4 million dollars?, half to go to the waitress? he had a chance either to fulfill the promise (vow) or break the promise (vow). His wife tried to discourage him from giving out the 2 million bucks, but his friend who was also a police officer told him to do the right thing. The thought that ran through his mind was either to lie to the waitress and give the tip but then he decided to "keep his word" for that was the kind of person he was. With the word kept, the waitress received 2 million in the midst of his wife’s protest. I'm told the movie was based on a true story.

In as much as I believe that Christians should not gamble because we don't live by luck but by faith, there is something about the story I just shared that brings the point I would like to make, "<strong>making a promise and keeping it</strong>". It's very easy to make a promise but hard to keep it. You can say you will do something just to be left alone and then find it hard to fulfil it or not do it at all. At times promises are made on the basis of "what it is in for me" and how can I benefit from it. You ask yourself, “<em>will it inconvenience me in any way?</em>” Marriages are based on promises (vows) but if you look at it, performing those vows are hard for many couples because it's more about them than others. People say something like this, "<em>I don't feel the love in this marriage like I used to, I don't get satisfaction like I used to"</em> the word here is "I" (ME, MYSELF and I), it doesn't matter how the kids will be affected as long as "I" get what "I" want if I have to stay. It's not about what "I" can do to improve it, it's a matter of what can "I" gain from it. There is no "I" in teamwork.

<strong>Ecclesiastes 5:4, "When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it". </strong>What is a vow anyway, <strong>it's an earnest promise to perform a specified act or behave in a certain manner</strong>. It has to come from the heart and you've counted the cost of performing it. When we make vows to help someone, we do it in the presence of the Lord and unto the Lord. God takes vows seriously and He would rather you make no vow than make it and break it. The scripture also says, do not be slow to fulfill a vow, it needs to be fulfilled on the specified time. You make it, you owe it and should pay it. Charlie from the story made a vow, he had a chance to pay that vow in time as promised and his conviction moved him to perform it and perform it soon. In <strong>Matthew 21:28,</strong> we are told of two sons who were asked by their father to go and work in the vineyard, the first one said he will not go but after some time he regretted and went and performed it. The second son said he will but did not go. Out of the two boys, only the first one did the will of his father, the one who said no but then later went. <strong>1Corinthians 10:3, "Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God" Colossians 3:17, "And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , Colossians 3:23, "And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men" 3John 1:5, "Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers".</strong> If you said you will do it, take the time to do it, go out of your way to do it, it may not benefit you in anyway but do it, this goes for ministry, work, family, community service you name it. Keep your word. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Peter 5:10, “And the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.”</strong>

God sometimes speaks loudly through His Word, I was excited as I read this scripture which refreshed and revitalized me . We should remember that the trials the devil seeks to use to destroy us, God desires to use, to make us stronger and more equipped to follow Him. Every tree that produces fruit, He prunes so as to make it stronger. (<strong>John 15:2</strong>) Suffering wasn’t a sign that they were doing something wrong, but Peter reminds us that through the sufferings, God strengthens us spiritually. Satan may try to tear us down through failures, discouragements and humiliation, but God builds you in the midst of all the pain. Want to know more? Stay tuned!<!--more-->

As I look back into my life, the most humiliating moments have been the ones which helped to break me and mold me. We need some breaking in order to be blessed. Too many successes makes us haughty and proud; when God steps in, He loves to cut that off. Remember, Moses was handsome, when he was born but God had to put him 40 years in the wilderness and then made use of him. Never get proud of your height, color, personality and intelligence or whatever; God can spot that subtle ego buried inside you and He would deal with it severely. God has a way to look deep into our sins. We may think it “small” and insignificant but it is “big sin” for God. Understand? Once while on the stage I suddenly lost the Presence of God near me, I felt lost and scared. I was screaming on the inside for God to give me the anointing back, but He allowed me to suffer on the stage. After the meeting, I fasted and prayed seeking for an answer. God showed certain things which might be petty for me but pretty big deal for Him and He was dealing with me to crucify me and make me fruitful. I can suffer anything in this world but not the pain of losing His anointing, I still shiver at the thought of being left stranded without the anointing!

These words, “<em>after you have suffered a little while</em>”, catches our attention, is it not? While waiting on God, seeking the face and advice of my God, he dropped this word into my spirit – it will only hurt for a little while! Friend, since I am a mother of two children, I can surely explain this better to you today. When my children come home hurt and bruised, I would take the first aid box with antiseptics, soap, water, sponge, and bandages in it. My kids would look at my face pathetically and I would lovingly tell them, “If we don’t clean it, it will get infected, and besides it will only hurt for a little while.” When the antiseptic is applied it burns, but it heals. Sometimes children insist on just putting a band-aid on the infected place which would result in the wound getting septic.

God is trying to pour on the antiseptic on our wounds, hurts, and pains. It is only to eventually heal you. The subtle pride that is buried in you, the infection of laziness, rebellion, disobedience, self-righteousness everything would go. God knows everything about us. Sometimes we need ‘deep treatment’ for cleansing, but once He touches us, He brings about a marvelous change. The ‘treatment’ that God gives us may be in the form of illness, financial loss, job loss, misunderstandings in relationships, rebellious children and so on. Only when it hurts us do we understand the hurt that we had done to others, which stirs us to repent and change. When God pours that antiseptic into your wound you will be reminded of your ill spoken word and you will have to go and ask that person to forgive you. Observe the above scripture closely, it says, ‘He will Himself restore you.’ Comforting is it not? He will never leave you to be burnt, but through the trial period, God makes us strong, firm and steady. Blessings, devotion by Sis. Bala Samson]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 12:2, "And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God"</strong>

Anything that we do most of the time does not just affect a day but days to come. The more reason we need to be careful about what we plant in our lives for sooner or later, we will look back and see why it was good or bad to plant some things. Let me share briefly on three things I call <strong>CCD</strong>. These are <strong>CHOICES</strong>, <strong>CHANGES</strong> and <strong>DECISIONS</strong>. <strong>We are what we are because of the choices, changes and decisions we make</strong>.<!--more-->

<strong>According to thesaurus, Choices are options, alternatives, selection, preference and pick</strong>. We can see that choices are not one thing or one plan; they are many things that give you and me a chance to pick from. Choosing is preferring one thing or a person over another. This is my theory; choices tend to start from the beginning where you choose what direction to take. <strong>The choices you and I make today will have the ability to affect our tomorrow</strong>. People choose based on the surrounding, situation, peers, the present and even more. Everyone has to make some type of choices in their lives, choosing who to marry, what kind of job you desire, what kind of house you want to live in etc.

<strong>Change</strong> on the other hand is to <strong>alter, modify, vary, transform, revolutionize, adjust or amend</strong>. No one can say that they have no ability to change. There are two types of changes, <strong>the change that occurs in a person </strong>and <strong>the change a person makes</strong>. Change is as vital as Choice is only that Change allows you to improve a Choice made. The change can be big or small but everyone can see its significance. Changing your community begins with changes inside out to put aside what you don't normally do and begin to develop a mindset of desiring to do it anyway, making it better. The change is not supposed to make it worse but better. Couples ought to change inside to make their marriages better and then using their change inside to change, perfect, revolutionize their marriage. <strong>Anyone who is not desiring to change is not ready for progress</strong>.

Last but not least, “Decisions”. Decisions sound like choices and it is, but I look at choices as the beginning before anything happens. Decisions are made in the middle of something and now a mind has to be made up. Decisions is making judgment, assessing the situation and making a resolution to it.

All these three have one thing in common, <strong>they improve</strong>. Paul writes to the Romans and he is giving them guidelines to help them exercise these three things. One, <strong>"Do not be conformed to this world", </strong>meaning do not try and copy the life style of this world to effectively bring these three to life because the world has set its standard on how to view them. Second, "<strong>But be transformed by the renewing of your mind</strong>", Choices, changes and decisions are not made on emotions as many do; they are based on clear minds. It's easy to do things without thinking and it affects us in the long run, but when our minds are renewed, they become in tune with our hearts, and with that we are ready to progress. "<strong>That you may prove what is that good and acceptable</strong>", the three has to be approved. Example, when manufacturers build anything, they are not quick to bring it to the market. They test, prove, asses it to make sure it works well. They do not just look at what it can do today, they look at how long it will last, can it be effective, will it serve the purpose and so is with Christians, we have to prove what is that good, but by whose standards? Men's or God's? God's standards are acceptable because they are based on His perfect will.

We can make Choices, Changes and Decisions based on what is proved to be good and acceptable and perfect will of God. What choices are you making today? what changes have you purposed to make? What decisions do you have to make? Have you proved them to know that they are good and acceptable and are in line with His perfect will? Prove Before Executing, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 5:43-44, “You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbour, and hate your enemy “But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;” See Full passage (Matt 5:43-48)</strong>

I believe that each one of us has people in our lives that are enemies. Who are the people in your life that seek your demise, hate when you move forward in life, try to get on your last nerve, and are vindictive and outright cruel to you? <!--more-->I gather that some name(s) just surfaced in your mind rather quickly. These enemies play a vital role in your life of you becoming more like Christ. God sent us an example (<strong>John 13:15)</strong> in His Son, that we should be conformed to His image (<strong>Romans 8:29</strong>) and walk as Jesus walked <strong>(1John 2:6).</strong> What does any of this have to do with your enemies helping you to become more like Christ?

Jesus pointed out that we are to love, bless, do good to, and pray for our enemies. “<em>If we want to make a difference we must be different.</em>” Jesus continues by saying, <strong>“For if you love them which love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same? And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more than others? do not even the publicans so?”</strong> The essence of what Jesus is saying is that if you follow Me (Jesus) and you treat your enemies the same way the world does how can you rightly say you are a Christian?

<strong>Acts 6-7</strong> tells the account of Stephen. He rehearsed the history of Israel to his Hellenistic compatriots that were disputing with him (<strong>6:9</strong>) showing themselves to be his enemies. Stephen <em>“pushed the envelope</em>” hard when he said to them, “<strong>Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him-you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.”</strong> The truth hurt! “<strong>Upon hearing these things, were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth</strong>.” And as these men ran upon Stephen to stone him, Stephen looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw Jesus standing NOT sitting on the right hand of God. As he is about to breathe his last breath he says, “<strong>Lord Jesus, receive my spirit”…and cried with a loud voice, “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge</strong>.” Wow, Stephen has become so much like Christ in dealing with his enemies that his last dying words paralleled and were almost identical with Christ’s and certainly in the same Spirit of our LORD (<strong>Luke 23:34)</strong>. Read the gospels and examine how Jesus responded to his enemy Judas, to the point of allowing Judas to betray him with a kiss. Wow! Even as Christ was being verbally and physically abused He still died for sinners.

Your response to your enemies speaks volumes of how Christ-like you are. How do you treat the Judas’ in your life? Is it like our Master, or like our previous father, the devil? If you don’t treat your enemies any different than the world does, then you are acting like your enemies. Ouch! When dealing with your enemies, show them Christ’s love, share the gospel with them. When they curse you, bless them. When they show you hatred, purposefully be and do good unto them. At the time they persecute you and despitefully use you, pray for them. Proverbs says “<strong>If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you</strong>”. This is “godly revenge!”

Oh Lord, may we bless, pray for and show kindness and love to those who are our enemies and those who are yours, in response to their treatment toward us .
Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Colossians 3:23, “And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men”</strong>

Understanding the order of things should drive how we handle things. There is always a continuous battle on how we do things especially in the job set up. We need to understand that where we are number one it’s God who brought us there and not our education or ability.<!--more--> If you think about it, how many have more degrees than a thermometer and yet are still struggling to find a place to put those degrees to work? We have to come to grips with the truth that we are where we are because of God and this leads us to have a sense of humility for He is the Boss (Master). We tend to forget that our employer is God and through our earthly employers He fulfils His plans and purposes, that is part of where His character shines because He has His ambassadors representing Him in the job set up. God is the SOURCE, our earthly employers are the MEANS by which He provides.

If we can distinguish between the Source and the Means, then we are channeled to look and deal with things differently. I can therefore work hard in the job He has placed me in knowing that He is my employer. I can be faithful with little or much knowing that He knows why He has placed me there. Take ownership by understanding you are out to please the Lord in the job He has placed you in. <strong>Colossians 3:23, “And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men</strong>”. I look at the last part of this scripture and it says “AS TO THE LORD” which gives me this understanding that how you would treat the Lord is how you would treat your boss, you are doing it unto the Lord through them. I know there are some who are not happy with their jobs and their bosses and just like Joseph who did not have his dream job, where he was prepared him to where God would move him too. His qualification for the next move was in his hard work, obedience and faithfulness in what he was doing. Moses was reduced from a prince in Egypt to a shepherd however you can see his faithfulness that channeled him to be elevated in due time to be a leader of millions. I believe God allows us to be in certain jobs not as a punishment but training grounds for character enlargement. A place to learn obedience and faithfulness. You can be faithful where you are as you trust God for where you want to be.

The bible says in <strong>Colossians 3:22, “Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God”.</strong> How would we please a Boss (Master) we cannot see without pleasing a boss we can see. If we know we are pleasing a boss we can see to please the Boss (Master) we can’t see then our attitude towards work will be different. We will not slack, steal time, be careless or be lazy because we are not where we want to be. The scripture says, obey in ALL things but not please them when they are looking or when you can see what you will get out of it but with sincere heart, fearing God. This is pleasing to the Lord. I believe there are days we mess our progress to greater levels because of our attitudes towards work and our bosses.

Ask yourself this question, why are you in your job? Why do you do what you do? Who do you do it for? Do an attitude check, see what changes you need to make and be the best worker the Lord wants you to be, you are His ambassador in that company.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 37:4, “Delight yourself also in the Lord and He shall give you the desires of your heart.” </strong>

God has a grand plan to bless your life in a very special way. How do you get to know what plans He has for you? What do you need to do to receive His blessings, both spiritual and material? Here are a few recommendations to meditate on today:

First, you need to have a relationship with Him. You must be made His child and remain his forever (<strong>John 1:12</strong>). Only God’s children have inheritance to the blessings of God. The righteous shall inherit the earth, the Bible says.<!--more-->

Second, you need to search the word of God and find out every promise he has given which assures you of His blessings. The word of God is His will for your life. He knows the plans that He has for you. Do you know them?

<strong>“For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.”, Jeremiah 29:11</strong>

God has good thoughts and plan toward His children. However, He expects His children to have personal expectation. What you expect, is what God confirms and releases in you. <strong>You cannot have what God has if you do not desire it and expect it. Your desire and expectation, faith, in Gods ability and willingness to bless you, are your elevators to His throne room where mercy and goodness dwells. </strong>So, get into the elevators.

Third, you must follow the Lord Jesus Christ’s teaching and instruction on how to prosper. The Bible is the authentic source of God’s instruction. It reveals the mind, ways and will of God. When read, understood, believed and applied, you get what God has promised. <strong>What you desire, pray for and you believe is what you can expect from God when you are sure it is in line with His will. </strong>Jesus said:“<strong>Therefore I say unto you, what things so ever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them and you shall have them.”, Mark 11:24</strong>

The verse is specifically talking about things. Moreover, we do need things. Things, perhaps, are the greatest concern of your life today. That is why we are working hard so we can afford things. God has no problem giving things as long as things will not draw you away from Him and hinder your fruitfulness in the Christian life and ministry. You are saved by grace and, have been preserved for His purpose only. When you desire, pray and believe for anything that will help you fulfill His purpose, be sure you will have it.

Ask god today to fill your heart with godly desires. Ask Him in prayer to grant you the desires of your heart. Believe, wait and receive, in His time, your expectation. Do not limit God to your own desires and dreams. <strong>Let God and let go of yours</strong>.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jeremiah 1:5, "Before I formed you in the word I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations"</strong>

The more I walk with the Lord, the more I see my life being changed as I go to new dimensions. As a child growing up, I had some thoughts of what I wanted to be and always dreamed of it. The more I have lived, the more I have come to realize that what I thought was what I needed cannot be compared to what God has done. In other words, I got more than I bargained for.<!--more-->

I believe with all my heart that there are many things deposited in us that we know not of. Some are reserved for a certain time when we are ready. If we knew our end result, it would scare some of us to death. <strong>We always try to see our destiny based on our history</strong>. One of the people who was told of his destiny was Jeremiah, it scared him to death. The first thing we are told of where God was involved in his life. It was not when he was born or when he was conceived, God knew him when He thought of making him. "<strong>Before "I" formed you in the womb "I" knew you". </strong>God was telling Jeremiah that he was a result of His making and God does not make anything that has no purpose. God orchestrated every life not when it was born but right before the thought of the parents to have one. Why is it so important? because you begin to understand your life is God planned. God planned it, stepped in, made it, fixed it. "…<strong>Before you were born I sanctified you</strong>", He knew that Jeremiah would be born in sinful world but He was already sanctified in the womb. Sanctify means to set a part, to make holy or purify. Those who are saved are sanctified even if they don’t feel like it. It's not a matter of feeling but knowing that you are. "…<strong>I ordained you a prophet to the nations</strong>", this was to be Jeremiah's calling, a prophet. The word ordain means to invest with ministerial or authority. Three things God told Jeremiah about himself, <strong>I</strong> <strong>FORMED, SANCTIFIED, ORDAINED</strong>. I can see how no one can form, sanctify or ordain but God.

In our thinking we would wonder how can this be? 1. Jeremiah was too young to understand all these; 2. He could not see how he could be what God had called him to be. Now I know why God would not show us everything. We would not understand them even if He explained, they would not make sense, they would look and sound foolish compared to what we know of ourselves so He just leads us to them. <strong>Romans 8:30, "Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified</strong>". Paul talks about how God works and says that those whom he predestined, in other words those that He elected by divine will, He also called them. Something to think about, when he predestined them, there is no where it shows they were perfect or complete. This is because the next line reveals to us that He also justified them. Justified means, declared free of blame from guilt and penalty attached to grievous sin. And those that He justified, He also glorified. The glory part puzzled me a bit for I know Only God receives the glory but how can He glorify us then. Here is an interpretation the Holy Spirit gave me. That which has been taken through the process of formed (predestined), sanctified (justified), ordained (called) He lives in them and glorifies Himself in them. You shine because He shines through you.

If you are a believer, there is a calling in your life. It may not be what you thought you will be or planned to be. I never saw myself preaching, teaching, encouraging, writing, praying etc. I grew up a very shy skinny boy, bullied by a number in school, I was nicknamed every name I could think of, an average student. I never thought or saw myself being used of God mightily but now I understand that I was Formed, sanctified and ordained. God had deposited so much in me I did not even know until the right time. It's the same with you, you have no idea what God has deposited in you yet to be revealed. <strong>You may be looking at your history, God is looking at your origin</strong>. Since you have no recall of your origin, let God who was there tell you of what He made you to be. My history did not affect my origin though I concentrated on my history. My history showed more of my failures than success, my origin showed "Formed, sanctified and ordained" Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Jeremiah 29:12-14, “<strong>Then you will call upon me and you will find Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And if you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for me with all you heart…”</strong>

Have you found God? If you are saved and have been born again through faith in Christ and by the power of the Holy Spirit, I know for sure that God found you. I also know where He found you from. <!--more-->
And I know the marvelous change He has brought into your life. I also know about the promises He has given you. I also know about His love and willingness to help you walk in His power and live a victorious Christian life. But, the question that I want ask and would like for you to think about and mediate on is this: <strong>Have you also found God as He has found you? </strong>

Finding God? What does that mean? Is it necessary? Is it practical? Does God hide at times, and then give us hard times to find Him? If God found us and saved us, why then do we need to find Him? Why can’t we just lay back, recline, take it easy and just enjoy the ride to heaven? Why put effort when Jesus did everything for us so we could be saved and go to heaven?

You might have asked these questions and even more just like many of us have. You probably are still wondering whether it is necessary, logical, and practical to find God. For one, God is bigger than big. The whole world cannot contain Him. So, how could He be contained in you if you found Him and desired to retain Him in your heart? You may also be thinking that because He is Omniscience and Omnipotent, He is everywhere and all powerful and so it is not necessary and theologically correct to urge believers to search and find God? Whatever your thinking is or your belief is, you need to listen to what God is saying about the need for you and all believers to find Him. You need to understand that God, from time immemorial, has required His children to seek and find Him. There is something special about that requirement. It has a dual purpose. One, God delights in seeing His children taking time and reverently seeking Him with all their heart, and Secondly, the children of God benefits a great deal when they seek God and find Him. <strong>The union between the believer and God, following the believer’s desperate and selfish search of God’s presence, is the most perfect and highest level of spirituality anybody can attain.</strong> You can’t go higher than that. And you can’t get better than that. Everything life is and all that we could ever desire or want, according to God’s will, is within reach when we seek God and find Him. <strong>Righteousness and Holiness, without which no man shall see God</strong>, become attainable by we the mortal when we have searched God and found Him. Isn’t that wonderful? <strong>The call to seek God is a call that must be heeded, because it is a call with a purpose and a promise. </strong>It does not matter where one may be; there is always a call from God to seek Him.

For example: When the Israelites were exiled in Babylon, God through the Prophet Jeremiah urged them to seek Him with all their heart until they found Him. The prophets, priests, elders, men, women and children were urged by God Himself, to seek Him till they had found Him. Following is the ‘call’ and ‘directive’ God gave: <strong>“Then you will call upon me and you will find Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And if you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for me with all you heart. And I will be found of you, ‘declares the Lord, ‘and I will restore your fortunes and will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, ‘declares the Lord, ‘and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile.”, Jeremiah 29:12-14</strong>

You may not be in exile right now, but you need to seek the Lord. You need to pray. You need to put effort. You cannot give God leftovers and please Him. You cannot find Him when you are not searching and seeking Him with all your heart. It is not where you go to seek Him that matters; it is the condition of your heart and the ardent desire you have and the faith you have that matters and will lead you into His presence. You need to seriously set yourself to go on an expedition to find God. Once you have found Him, live in His presence daily through the power and presence of the Holy Ghost. <strong>The Holy Ghost cannot be your occasional Holy Guest. He must be a permanent resident and the president of your heart and home.</strong> You must retain God in your heart, mind body and soul. God has to fill your entire being. When you wake up in the morning, you need to crave for God like an addict craves for drink, drugs or cigarettes. Be filled with His Spirit. Walk in the same power everyday wherever you are. You truly will be turned from exile-whatever the exile may be that you are in right now, when you seek God with all your heart. In exile or not, find God. Do whatever it takes to find God. Don’t be satisfied and limited by your current level of the knowledge of God you have. You can’t know God fully as He really is even if you searched throughout eternity. But, He will reveal Himself to you in response to your searching and according to the level of your faith. Then you will Grow in His knowledge and <strong>His righteousness will be revealed to you from “faith to faith”</strong> glory to glory (<strong>Romans 1:17).</strong> Let the Holy Spirit help your infirmities, and pray on your behalf and lead you into your search for God. If you seek Him with all your heart, you will sure find Him. God bless you! By His Servant, Pastor Boaz Olang.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 1:1–2, “BLESSED is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful. 2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.” </strong>

In <strong>Psalm 1</strong> two lives are contrasted, the blessed life and the cursed (ungodly life). Many people think that they can stay on the fence, having one foot in the church and one foot in the world. If a soldier did that in war, stood in between both sides, he would surely be killed by the crossfire of both sides firing at him. <!--more-->Yet, many still try to blend in with both the world as well as the church. Jesus came to earth and split time in half from BC to AD, and his position in your life or lack of position in your life has the same effect spiritually. Either you are living life as a blessed godly person, or you are living life as a cursed ungodly person, which one are you? Why, because outside of God's blessing, man is "cursed" and ultimately leads a meaningless life (<strong>Ecclesiastes 1:2).</strong>

<strong>Psalm 1</strong> instructs us that a blessed man does not take counsel from the ungodly. There are many advice givers, but is that advice coming from a godly source? One that is blessed will take life counsel from spiritually mature Christians. A blessed man also will not stand in the way or will not flow in the thinking of sinners. Sinners are the ungodly, enemies of God, while saints are the godly, righteous, redeemed children of God, and again you are either one or the other. Yes saints sometimes struggle with sin, but if they are a saint, that is the identity given to them by Christ. A blessed person will not sit in the seat of the scornful, those that mock God. The "mockers" have no regard for God and his commandments. The mocker is <strong>a fool in the language of wisdom</strong> (<strong>Proverbs 9:8; 14:6</strong>). <strong>He does not respond to instruction </strong>(<strong>9:7; 15:12</strong>) but <strong>stirs up strife by his insults </strong>(<strong>22:10</strong>). He <strong>delights in mocking </strong>(<strong>1:22</strong>). The blessed life takes delight in, God and His Word.

The blessed life is the one that responds to God’s commands begrudgingly, by gritting their teeth and sheer will power, kicking and screaming. No way, the blessed life delights in God’s Word so much so that he meditates on it day and night. (<strong>Josh 1:8</strong>).

In his book “<em>What in the World is God Doing”, </em>Dr. Ted Engstrom, former president of World Vision, relates a story told by a Korean believer. The story concerns three Korean workmen who found jobs in China in the 1880s. While in China they heard the gospel and embraced Christ as Savior and Lord. They were now determined to find a way to bring the gospel to their own country of Korea, even though evangelizing was illegal. They decided to try and smuggle a copy of the Chinese Bible, because the Korean alphabet was so similar. The first man buried the Bible in his luggage and walked many days to the border. His bags were searched, the Bible was found and he was executed. Word got back to the two friends, and the second friend tore pages from his Bible, stuffed them throughout his luggage, made the long journey, only to be searched and beheaded. The third friend determined to do what his friends did not succeed in, ingeniously tore his Bible apart page by page. He them folded each page into tiny strips and wove the strips into a rope. He tied the homemade rope around his bag, made his journey, was searched, and succeeded in passing over the border. The man arrived home, untied the rope, and ironed each page. He reassembled the Bible and began to preach Christ wherever he went. Now that is delighting in God’s Word. Charles Spurgeon said, “<em>Some of you have enough dust on your Bible that you can write the word ‘damnation’ in the dust with your finger</em>.” Ouch, hopefully that’s not you!

<strong>Application: Are you living the blessed or cursed life? Who do you take counsel from? Do you stand in the flow of sinners and mockers? How much do you delight in his word? By Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 1:3-4, “And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he does shall prosper. Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.” </strong>

The blessed is personified as a tree that is planted and therefore rooted. Jeremiah tells us “<strong>But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in Him. He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit</strong> (<strong>17:7–8).”</strong> <!--more-->Trees have a root system and all of the roots go down into the soil and branch out underground that is all except one root. The tap root drills straight down into the earth, and the older and stronger a tree is, the more deeply rooted it is. I love the popular bonsai tree, but to keep the tree small the roots are cut therefore the tree is left dwarfed. It looks great aesthetically, but the roots do not go down deep. However think of a Great Oak Tree whose roots drive deep into the earth. Its tap root is what causes it to be rooted and grounded. The Apostle Paul writes in<strong> Ephesians 3:17, “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love.”</strong> This person is rooted and grounded because and ONLY because they are connected as a branch to the Vine. In <strong>John 15</strong> Jesus likens our lives to branches and Himself as the Vine, with God the Father as the Gardener. Jesus says more than once in this passage that apart from Him we can do NO-THING, nothing. Do you believe that? Both in <strong>John 15</strong>, and <strong>Psalm 1</strong>, the key to being fruitful is the connection to the Vine and to the rivers of [Living] Water [emphasis mine]. God wants fruit from His tree, because He is the Owner and the Gardener. The blessed life will produce fruit in his season, as those living in right relationship with God will receive God's blessing and enjoy life as a gift of God.

The cursed life is personified as the chaff that the wind blows away. Chaff, in the vernacular is, light straw which can be easily be blown away. Ultimately the wicked will be easily blown away. I picture the western movies when the tumbleweeds, like chaff, blow through the town. Why can the chaff be easily blown away, because it has no root, it becomes dried out, and can be eaten by the animals. Paul tells us “<strong>Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming</strong> (<strong>Ephesians 4:14</strong>).” Again in <strong>John 15</strong>, Jesus spoke of the branches that a branch that fails to remain in Him is thrown away, withers, and thrown into the FIRE! Although it may seem at times that the wicked are really getting ahead in life, over and above the Christian. The ultimate thing that the cursed life, which is dead in sins and transgressions (<strong>Ephesians 2:1</strong>), will be death. Death will blow and the wicked will move to its influence, wither away and be thrown in the fire.

When death comes reaching for, and blowing murderous threats at the blessed life, the Lord Himself will not allow that life to be budged in any way. Why, because whatever the blessed life does shall prosper. Did Jesus Christ prosper in this life? That is almost a foolish question I realize, but as we live like Him and in Him, we will process like Him because we are in Him. When your faith is put to the test will you bear fruit in season? The storms of life will show if you are a tree planted of chaff getting blown. Make sure that you are attached to Christ, and that you remain in Him.

<strong>Application: If you were put on trial for being a Christian would there be enough evidence to convict you? Your faith MUST stand trial to see what you are putting your trust in.</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:4–6, “…No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. “I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.” </strong>

Many professing Christians seem to be religious, but not fruitful ones. What Jesus did when He was alone with His disciples is that He spoke to them about living productive, fruit-bearing lives. Just as in <strong>Psalm 1</strong>, the key for the tree to be nourished was being rooted near the streams of water and having the water travel up the root system all the way to the branches to produce fruit, so to do we find a similar illustration here.<!--more--> Jesus emphasized strongly that “…<strong>no branch can bear fruit by itself”.</strong> Can you imagine cutting off a branch from a tree, and expecting it to produce fruit when disconnected from the source of nutrients? That would be absurd. Jesus points out that in the same way, no one can live a fruitful life UNLESS and only UNLESS they remain in Him! It is not enough for a branch to be near the vine (trunk), it must be connected. Jesus tells us that HE is the VINE and we are the branches.

If we are in Christ it will show forth from our lives. A healthy vine cannot but help bear grapes, a healthy orange tree will bear oranges, etc…, and a healthy Christian life will bear the character of Christ and reproduce souls into the Kingdom of God. It has been rightly said that when a husband and wife are intimate children are born, and likewise when one is intimate with the Lord souls are born again! Peter denied the Lord, wept bitterly in repentance, and eventually became the leader of the Apostles as he preached at Pentecost (<strong>Acts 2</strong>), he wrote first and second Peter, and eventually would be crucified upside down for Christ not feeling worthy to die in the same exact manner as his Lord.

Why would a professing Christian stay fruitless? Jesus tells us that some branches don’t produce fruit ever, because they are not connected to the vine. A branch cannot bear fruit unless it is attached, and if it is not it withers up because the branch can only die without life flowing to it. When I cut branches off from trees all they were good for eventually was firewood because they were nice and dry and dead, as dead wood burns the best. A life unconnected to Christ will be one that is picked up and thrown into the fire. Judas was a fruitless branch that betrayed Jesus and ended up committing suicide. Judas was NOT connected and everything that Judas influenced was toward death! Jesus said, “<strong>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy (cast) both soul and body in hell.” </strong>Unconnected lives that stay unconnected will end up in the Lake of Fire. <strong>Rev. 20:15</strong> reads, “<strong>If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire</strong>.”

An absolutely fruitless life is evidence that one is not a believer. <strong>“Fruit bearing is not only possible but certain if the branch remains in union with the vine. Uniformity of quantity and quality are not promised. But if the life of Christ permeates a disciple, fruit will be inevitable (EBC).</strong>”

<strong>Application: Is there fruit in your life that you are Christian? Do others recognize that Christ is in your life? Ask two trusted believers and two non-believers how they view your relationship with God? And above all remain in Him and you will bear fruit and show to belong to Him! Go and reach the unconnected lives in your life and connect them to Christ! Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 11:14, “Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again...” </strong>

Jesus spoke a destructive miracle into being! Of all the miracles that Jesus performed, none of them was of a destructive nature other than the cursing of the fig tree. Upon leaving Bethany Jesus was hungry, and saw a fig tree in the distance, and therefore went over to it to satisfy his hunger. However the tree He noticed only bore leaves, but NO fruit. Then Jesus spoke the words of cursing upon the tree, “<strong>May no one ever eat fruit from you again</strong>.” This doesn’t quite make much sense in light of Mark stating, “<strong>He [Jesus] found nothing but leaves</strong>, <strong>because it was not the season for figs</strong>.” Why is Jesus cursing a tree for having no figs, but every other fig tree had the same testimony, “<strong>because IT WAS NOT THE SEASON FOR FIGS</strong>.” Was it reasonable for Jesus to curse the fig tree for not bearing its fruit out of season?<!--more-->

Dr. Christie in his book ‘The Barren Fig Tree,’ explains six weeks before figs were actually to bear upon the tree in April, the tree would first have the foliage coating complete. Coincident with [this], and sometimes even before, there appears quite a crop of small knobs, NOT THE REAL FIGS, but a kind of early forerunner. They grow to the size of green almonds, in which condition they are eaten by peasants and others when hungry. When they come to their own indefinite maturity they drop off. These precursors of the true fig are call <em>taqsh</em> [”pre-figs”] in Palestinian Arabic. Their appearance is an indication, a sign, of the fully formed figs which were to appear six weeks later in. Mark says the time for figs had not come yet. However if the leaves appear without any <em>taqsh</em> [pre-figs], that is a sign that there will be no figs appearing six weeks later. Since Jesus was hungry and found nothing but leaves, leaves without any <em>taqsh</em>, He knew that it was an absolutely hopeless, fruitless fig tree, and said as much.

Jesus said in <strong>John 15:5, “I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.</strong>” And in <strong>Matthew 7:21-23 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’</strong>

People will say to Jesus on that day [Judgment Day], look at all the things I did in Your Name Jesus. In Your name we prophesied, cast out demons, performed miracles, we knew every worship song and joined the choir, we even started ministries, etc…. God wants fruit in lives and many people will point to things in their lives, all of their spiritual accolades, but Jesus was saying to those in <strong>Matthew 7</strong>, <em>“All I see in your life is leaves, but NO FRUIT. You did those things all right, but I NEVER KNEW YOU, because you never did ABIDE IN ME all that is plain to see now because all of your efforts are just leaves and that is not my will, my will was that you bear fruit. There is only one reason that you produced leaves instead of fruit, because you lived disconnected from me, although you were very religious, you did NOT do my will, but YOUR OWN! Depart from me! Many do works for God, apart from abiding in Him</em>”. If faith without works, hence works without abiding, being connected to His heart and will is also dead (fruitless). If the life of Christ permeates a disciple, fruit will be inevitable, NOT leaves. May we give Him what He wants, FRUIT.

<strong>Application: Are you bearing leaves or fruit in your life, because Jesus only honors fruit! Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 17:7-10, "7 And which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come at once and sit down to eat’? 8 But will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare something for my supper, and gird yourself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink’? 9 Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not. 10<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, ‘We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.’”</span>’ </strong>

We all have a drive to be acknowledged, be thanked for things we do. We also love to be compensated for a job well done, we feel we deserve and are entitled to a number of things.

<!--more-->

We feel we have done enough merit or have some qualifications for something in light of a duty performed. And we become frustrated when what we think we have earned or deserved goes unrecognized or appreciated. One televangelist hammers this in his broadcast of what believers are entitled to and deserve because of their relationship with Christ which is totally unbiblical.

<strong>I want us to be reminded that God owes us nothing</strong>. Even that which He does for us is not because of us but because of Jesus who was obedient to the Father even to the point of going to the cross. If you asked apostle Paul if he was special having done great things for God, he will say no. He was just fulfilling his call and in that he also benefitted.

Listen to Jesus address this issue in vs. 7. "<strong>But which of you having a servant ploughing or tending to the sheep...". </strong>While this bible verse uses the word<strong> "servant", </strong>in the original text the word is<strong>"slave". </strong>In order to keep the disciples humble in the performance of miraculous works; and that they might not imagine they could have any thing at the hands of God by merit; and to excite them to go on from one duty to another; and never think they have done, or done enough, or more than what is their duty, Christ delivers this parable. The servant goes to the field to plough or tend to the sheep or both. When he gets back, he does not sit and wait for his master to prepare food for him, no, he prepares supper for his master and feeds him and when he is full then his servant (slave) sits down to eat. But does the master thank the servant for doing his job? Jesus says no. How then do we sometimes accuse God for not being fair? If He gave us what is fair we are all in trouble "<strong>for the wages of sin is death...", Romans 6:23.</strong>

<strong>Vs. "10 ....When ye have done all, say, We are unprofitable servants". "</strong><em>Aman cannot profit God. Happy is he who Judges himself an unprofitable servant: miserable is he whom God pronounces such. But though we are unprofitable to Him, our serving Him is not unprofitable to us. For He is pleased to give by His grace a value to our good works, which in consequence of His promise entitles us to an eternal reward", </em>John wesley

Our Master owes us no thanks when we serve Him faithfully, for we have only done our duty. The heavenly reward to the faithful is of grace, not of debt. We have not, as his servants (slaves), profited or benefited God at all. We do not benefit God by being obedient, we benefit ourselves. This thought should be a load lifted off us to be free from the thought that obedience makes us special entitling us for blessings.

The servant in this parable is cared for by being given identity, duties, protection, food and shelter, all provided for by the master, but not because the servant is worthy but because the Master is. May we walk in obedience not because we are special but because He is special. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong> John 14:6, "I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE</strong>"

What do you think is uniqueness of Christianity? No one in any religion in the entire world has ever risen to claim they have the POWER TO FORGIVE SIN, Jesus Christ of the Christians has. <strong>Matthew 9:6, "But that you may know that the Son of Man (Jesus Christ) has power on earth to forgive sins". </strong>This is one of the reasons they hated Him the most, they didn’t mind Him healing the sick and raising the dead<strong>. </strong>Not only has He the power to forgive sins, He has distinguished Himself as unique. He was here on earth <strong>100% God and 100% Man </strong>meaning He was the infinite God Man. <strong>John 1:1, "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God and the word was God...without God nothing made could have been made....the word was made flesh and dwelt among us (paraphrased). </strong>Jesus the living word came in flesh yet without sin. The reason He came to us inform in flesh was to relate to us and redeem us. <strong>You can only redeem what you are related to</strong>. He understood what it meant to be tempted, go without, be exhausted, loose a friend, to be attacked but still became a victor. Who understands the nature of suffering like He does?<!--more-->

Because of His uniqueness, He has described Himself as THE only way to God,<strong> John 14:6, "I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE</strong>". To get to God, Jesus is the way; to know the Truth, He is the truth; to have life, He is the life. Why do we pray in Jesus name? because as I have mentioned, that is how we get access to the Father, <strong>John 14:26, "...that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you</strong>". If He used the word I Am “A” way, “A” truth and “A” life, that would mean that there is another way to get to God and that would mean that He is not THE only way as Oprah Winfrey and many other professing Christians states. STATING that HE IS shows that there can be no one besides Him. This is where the 2nd commandment comes in, <strong>Exodus 20:3-5, vs. "You shall have no other gods before Me. vs. 4 "You shall not make for yourself a carved image--any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; vs. 5 you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God</strong>". This is also the God in Jesus saying that He is the only ONE. See when He died on the cross, not only was He the Savior of the world, He also became the Lord. Being Lord means taking ownership and there can be no two owners but one, <strong>Romans 14:9, "For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that He might be Lord both of the dead and living</strong>", <strong>1Corinthians 8:6, "yet for us there is ONE God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and ONE Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live</strong>".

People like to come to people who will receive them, Jesus came to His own and His own rejected Him. He knew He would be rejected way before He came to us. As someone said, the best way He could glorify His Father in heaven was while here on earth and we glorify God when we submit to Jesus. <strong>Philippians 2:5-10, “5 Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, 6 who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, 7 but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. 9 Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</strong>

Just like a woman cannot have more than one husband, Christ is a husband to one wife to those who received Him therefore we call Him Lord. He says, choose ye this day whom you will serve, either be God or .... the choice is ours. <strong>He has revealed to us who He is, what He stands for and what He requires of us</strong>.

Different religions teach that it's by works that we are saved, the bible teaches in <strong>Ephesians 2:8&amp;9, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast". </strong>We don't get to heaven by our good works but by the gift of grace through faith. <strong>And Grace is a favor rendered to one who desires it and does not deserve it. No one can take the credit of making it to heaven by themselves, Jesus is THE way to Heaven. Blessings Ev</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 1:1-6, "... He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings fruit in it's season..."</strong>

I believe the opening chapter in the book of Psalm down to a few verses is one of the guidelines to being blessed of God. God has no shortcuts for His people to get blessed despite the many teachings we hear especially with televangelists. I believe God would want us to move from expecting miracles to being blessed. Being blessed in my judgment is a working progress. Let’s see what <strong>Psalm 1</strong> teaches us how to be blessed.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 1, “Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful”.</strong> It’s interesting to note that the bible already calls you blessed when you are set apart from the world. This verse puzzled me for a very long time as I was not sure whether it meant I should not walk with the unbelievers. The verse does not mean we cannot walk with the unbelievers, it says we cannot go by their counsel (wisdom), thinking or their ways. To grow, your counsel and their counsel has to be replaced by His. The primary reason we should hang out with the unbelievers is to witness to them.

To be blessed is vs. 2, “<strong>to delight in the law of the Lord, and on His law, meditate day and night”. </strong>Though we know the law is to tell what sin is, God uses it also to keep and safe and sound but you have to delight in it. Here the law is more than rules but the word of God.

<strong>Vs. 3, “ He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper”</strong> Every tree is planted for a reason. Trees don’t just grow for nothing and no one also plants trees for nothing. Some plant trees for beauty, shade, timber, fruits. God does plant His trees for fruit. He wants to see us grow. As a tree, we are planted by the river of the living water to bring forth fruit. As branch in <strong>John 15</strong> we abide in Him that we may bear fruit. You can see that to be blessed you have to be connected to the right source. So what kind of fruit is the bible talking about, <strong>Galatians 5:22-23, “22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law</strong>”. I don’t see how one can bear this fruit real quick. It takes time and growth. Do you realize the bible does not say produce fruit or grow fruit? It’s because if we are planted by the river and are abiding, the fruit will come. Our leaves will not dry and whatever we do, we will prosper.

God has planted us by His rivers and as He living water, He continuously flows in us. The river is not stagnant water but moving water always bringing in the fresh water. When the word of God dwells in our hearts daily and we pray and meditate on His word daily, we get continuous supply for our day to day. I believe that when we are planted by the His river, we get our nourishment every day. We don't need to struggle to stay good or be fruitful because it will happen without any struggle. Many will see the change in us and would desire to know where we are planted. Remember that everyone is planted by a certain river, the question is, which one? Christ gave the Samaritan woman the living water and she went back to be a witness in Samaria. She did not struggle to do it as she was now planted by the river of life. The more I see the fruit of the Spirit in my life, the more I consider myself blessed. It takes time because of the growth process but it’s worth it. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Corinthians 10:4-5, “For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5972" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog.jpg" alt="blog" width="188" height="188" /></a></strong>

It is better to try to keep a bad thing from happening than fix it once it has happened. And I will apply this to dealing with demonic forces, satanic oppressions. Anyone who is vulnerable is setting him or herself as an easy target for the enemy. Why be an easy target then try and deal with them after they come in? It’s hard to empty a boat that is being filled with water due to holes in that boat.<!--more-->

The bible says in <strong>2Corinthians 10:3, “For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh</strong>”, it’s clear we are at war, spiritual war daily. The enemy is not at rest neither should we. The question then is, what is the strategy to overcome the enemy of our soul, vs. 4 tells us, “<strong>4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ”, </strong>our weapon is the truth of God’s word, 1. It pulls down strongholds (fortified) places where His word is trying to reach, 2. It casts down imaginations (made up thoughts) and every high thing that tries to arise above the knowledge of God, (things the enemy elevates above God’s word), we see this in the garden of Eden where he tells Eve to doubt God’s word 3. It brings every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ (submission). Jesus used the truth of His word cast down imaginations in the dessert. “<strong>…the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; </strong>also<strong> 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints”, Ephesians 6:16-18</strong>. The more you are in the word, in prayer and doing the work of the Lord, the less you become vulnerable to yielding to the enemy. His strategy is to tempt the elect to drop down their weapons and surrender. I would rather have prevention measure than cure.

A Scriptural expectation of victory, will purify the soul, and keep it from being defiled by Satan. It subdues and mortifies evil desires and blasphemous thoughts as they rise within; and answers unbelief and error as they assault from without. A single text, well understood, and rightly applied, at once destroys a temptation or an objection, and subdues the most formidable adversary. Prayer calls for submission as you cannot resist without first submitting, <strong>James 4:6, “Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you” </strong>. The bible will keep you from sin and sin will keep you from the bible. We must fasten all the other parts of our Christian armor if we are to be overcomer. If you are not in submission to the Lord in word, in prayers, in serving Him, you can chase the devil all you want only to be defeated. You can gain victory after attack but remember, cure may leave scars. Why not act on preventive measures today. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Galatians 1:6–9, “is a curse on anyone who distorts the gospel of Christ:”</strong>

<strong>“6 I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, 7 which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed”,</strong> <strong>Galatians 1:6-9</strong><!--more-->


We live in a world with the genuine and the counterfeit, the true and the false, the real and the fake. We have genuine currency (monies) and counterfeit. There are genuine works of art, and then there are frauds. Ask any magician and he will tell you that fooling people is certainly possible as they use optical illusion to illustrate that the hand is quicker than the eye. Therefore it should not be a surprise that there are false gospels in our time that attempt to go against the true gospel. Paul gave a sober warning that anyone that preaches a distorted gospel will be anathema, that is to say accursed. The gospel did not originate with man but with God, therefore who are we as humans to come up with our own version of the gospel? We must under no any circumstances veer off from the gospel that Jesus preached. The opening line of Paul’s warning states vs. “<strong>6 I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, 7 which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.”</strong> Turning to other gospels are always for selfish ambition and vain conceit as it puts the word of man above the Word of God. Many in evangelicalism having certainly gone off the beaten path that our Lord paved by His blood, His life and His Word, and have abandon it for a different gospel. This was happening in Paul’s day, hence the reason that he writes, therefore it should be of no surprise that the false gospels still corrode many lives today.

We live in a world that at one time used <strong>John 3:16</strong> as the staple verse from the Word of God. Now many use a new verse as the staple verse, <strong>“Do not judge, or you too will be judged</strong>”, (<strong>Matthew 7:1</strong>). This is said because many don’t want to call sin for what it is, sin. These same people have not looked to the balance of this verse out of John’s gospel which reads, <strong>“Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a RIGHT JUDGMENT!</strong>” When we use the Word of God we can call one that steals a thief, and one that tells lies, a liar. I close part one with a quote from author and Pastor, John McArthur from His book the gospel according to Jesus writes, “<em>The gospel in vogue today holds forth a false hope to sinners. It promises them they can have eternal life yet continue to live in rebellion against God. Indeed, it encourages people to claim Jesus as Savior yet defer until later the commitment to obey him as Lord. It promises salvation from hell but not necessarily freedom from iniquity. It offers false security to people who revel in the sins of the flesh and spurn the way of holiness. By separating faith from faithfulness, it teaches that intellectual assent is as valid as wholehearted obedience to the truth.”</em>

Thus the good news of Christ has given way to the bad news of an insidious easy-believes that makes no moral demands on the lives of sinners. It is not the same message Jesus proclaimed. Is the gospel you believe, what Jesus preached? Is the gospel your pastor preaches, the one that Jesus preached? Examine your Bible, and your belief, do they line up? In the following messages, I will share on some of the different gospels that many are embracing today such as the prosperity gospel, happiness gospel, the emergent gospel, the racist or prejudice gospel, the Mormon gospel, the Jehovah’s Witness gospel, the Muslim gospel and of course the Biblical Gospel (the one Jesus preached). Please, examine the gospel you believe, is it truly the Gospel Jesus proclaimed, died for, and the one many today still die for? If not repent, and believe the gospel, and be transformed by the truth of Christ. Because of the seriousness of this issue, I welcome any responses to the crucial issue facing our lives today. Until the nets are filled, Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Galatians 1:9, “As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be anathema (accursed).”</strong>

In part one of what gospel do you believe, some groundwork was laid showing the framework of the real gospel is not the gospel that everyone is following these days. Paul was greatly disturbed recognizing that the Galatians in fact so quickly deserted the biblical Gospel for a different gospel.

<!--more-->

Paul rebukes the Galatians for their departure of the true gospel for the false. Perhaps through these messages, if you have left the biblical gospel for a false one, you too may hear the words of Paul rebuking you as well, and repent quickly.

One of the “different gospels” in our day that is preached is surely the prosperity gospel. What is the basis for the prosperity gospel? <strong>Anyone who watches “TV evangelists” has no doubt heard the Prosperity Gospel. </strong>A central tenet of the prosperity gospel is that God wills the financial prosperity of every Christian. If a believer lives in poverty, he/she is living outside God’s intended will. “You must realize that it is God’s will for you to prosper” (Copeland, Laws of Prosperity, p. 51).<em>- Source: </em><a href="http://www.watchman.org/profile/wordpro.htm"><em>Word-Faith Movement</em></a><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5095" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/picture-device-independent-bitmap-1.jpg" alt="" width="9" height="6" /><em>, “Other Doctrines,” a </em><a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/w00.html"><em>Watchman Fellowship</em></a><em> profile</em>
Those that preach a prosperity gospel make some grave errors. First, isn’t it interesting that many of these preachers don’t preach this gospel in the poorest areas of the world, where “financial blessing” it most needed, places like Calcutta India. Secondly, the preachers are selfish and have vein conceit desiring you to send your faith seed (your money) to their ministry, or should I say their bank account? Thirdly, they actually make it harder for people to get into the Kingdom, because the Kingdom of God then comes with a financial price tag, not simply laying one’s life down to follow the Christ.

It would follow suit then, that Hollywood celebrities don’t need Jesus, because they are wealthy already. Is that a sign of God’s blessing on Hollywood out of their right relationship with the Father? Fourthly, why are these prosperity preachers most often not using the financial gifts they receive through manipulating people with the Word of God, to help the needy, to reach the unsaved? God can certainly flow finances through a believer, for what end? If anyone should have modeled a wealthy life, if according to the prosperity gospel, shouldn’t it have been Jesus? He was born in a stable not a palace, as he grew up in common Jewish family. Jesus made replied to one desiring to follow Him, “…<strong>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air<em> have</em> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay<em> his</em> head” (Matthew 8:20).</strong> This hardly sounds like the words of a wealthy man. Jesus said, “<strong>From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.</strong>” Where are the prosperity preachers in their personal giving? Recall Peter when He was asked to give alms by a needy person, to which Peter replied, “…<strong>Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have given I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.”</strong> Peter gave the man the biblical gospel and demonstrated it in faith and power! <strong>Proverbs 11:4 states, “Riches profit not in the day of judgment, but righteousness delivers from death</strong>.” If a millionaire dies without the Savior his money will not impress God. Jesus told the rich young ruler to sell all he had to follow Christ. It wasn’t until the prodigal son lost all his money that he was humbled to repent toward God and his father.

The prosperity preachers are not preaching the biblical gospel. Recall Simon the Sorcerer wanting to buy the power of the Holy Spirit. Peter said, “<strong>Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money</strong>.” Perhaps you have been financially blessed of God, use it for His Glory and not your own. We are not to “name it and claim it!” He tells me what to do, not the reverse that is why He is Lord!

Here are some links to further investigate the dangers of the Prosperity Gospel and the preachers associated with this false gospel. Please be wise, let God be the Lord of your heart and finances. Perhaps there is someone that you could financially bless, expecting nothing in return. Our Father has a way of taking care of all of our needs, not our greed To be continued….

Until the nets are filled…Be watchful…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Galatians 1:6-7, “6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.” </strong>

The Gospel means good news. Paul states that some have moved to another gospel, which is not another. The false gospels, such as the Prosperity Gospel, is a false gospel, therefore it is bad news, because it does not teach the way of salvation through Christ. Let’s examine this next “gospel” in this series, which is perhaps brothers with the prosperity gospel, hence the feel good gospel. The question is asked, “Why not preach that Jesus gives happiness, peace, and joy.” Jesus didn’t initially come to bring us happiness, but rather holiness.<!--more-->

My brother in Christ that I look up to very much has done an incredible job with this, so I will defer by sharing brother Ray Comfort’s sound teaching on the happiness, feel good “gospel”.

“<em>Two men are seated on a plane. The first is given a parachute and told to put it on as it would improve his flight. He’s a little skeptical at first, since he can’t see how wearing a parachute on a plane could possibly improve his flight, he decides to experiment and see if the claims are true. As he puts it on, he notices the weight of it upon his shoulders and he finds he has difficulty in sitting upright. However, he consoles himself with the fact he was told that the parachute would improve his flight. So he decides to give it a little time. As he waits he notices that some of the other passengers are laughing at him for wearing a parachute on a plane. He begins to feel somewhat humiliated. As they continue to point and laugh at him, he can stand it no longer. He slinks in his seat, unstraps the parachute and throws it to the floor. Disillusionment and bitterness fill his heart, because as far as he was concerned he was told an outright lie.</em>

<em>The second man is given a parachute, but listen to what he is told. He’s told to put it onbecause at any moment he’ll be jumping 25,000 feet out of the plane. He gratefully puts the parachute on. He doesn’t notice the weight of it upon his shoulders, nor that he can’t sit upright. His mind is consumed with the thought of what would happen to him if he jumped without the parachute. Let’s now analyze the motive and the result of each passenger’s experience. The first man’s motive for putting the parachute on was solely to improve his flight. The result of his experience was that he was humiliated by the passengers, disillusioned, and somewhat embittered against those who gave him the parachute. As far as he’s concerned, it will be a long time before anyone gets one of those things on his back again. The second man put the parachute on solely to escape the jump to come. And because of his knowledge of what would happen to him if he jumped without it, he has a deep-rooted joy and peace in his heart knowing that he’s saved from sure death. This knowledge gives him the ability to withstand the mockery of the other passengers. His attitude toward those who gave him the parachute is one of heartfelt gratitude.</em>

<em>Now listen to what the modern gospel says: “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ. He’ll give you love, joy, peace, fulfillment, and lasting happiness.” In other words, Jesus will improve your flight. The sinner responds, and in an experimental fashion puts on the Savior to see if the claims are true. And what does he get? The promised temptation, tribulation, and persecution—the other “passengers” mock him. So what does he do? He takes off the Lord Jesus Christ; he’s offended for the Word’s sake; he’s disillusioned and somewhat embittered...and quite rightly so. He was promised peace, joy, love, and fulfillment, and all he got were trials and humiliation. His bitterness is directed at those who gave him the so-called “good news.” His latter end becomes worse than the first, and he’s another inoculated and bitter “backslider.” Instead of preaching that Jesus improves the flight, we should be warning sinners that they have to jump out of a plane. </em><strong><em>That it’s appointed for man to die once and then face judgment (Hebrews 9:27).</em></strong><em> When a sinner understands the horrific consequences of breaking the Law of God, he will flee to the Savior, solely to escape the wrath that’s to come. If we are true and faithful witnesses, that’s what we’ll be preaching—that there is wrath to come—that God “</em><strong><em>commands all men everywhere to repent: because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness” (Acts 17:30,31).</em></strong>

<em>The issue isn’t one of happiness, but one of righteousness. It doesn’t matter how happy a sinner is, or how much he is enjoying the pleasures of sin for a season, without the righteousness of Christ, he will perish on the day of wrath. </em><strong><em>Proverbs 11:4 says, “Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivers from death</em></strong><em>.”. Peace and joy are legitimate fruits of salvation, but it’s not legitimate to use these fruits as a drawing card for salvation. If we continue to do so, the sinner will respond with an impure motive, lacking repentance.</em>

<em>Can you remember why the second passenger had joy and peace in his heart? It was because he knew that the parachute was going to save him from sure death. In the same way, as believers we have joy and peace in believing because we know that the righteousness of Christ is going to deliver us from the wrath that is to come. With that thought in mind, let’s take a close look at an incident aboard the plane. We have a brand-new flight attendant. It’s her first day. She’s carrying a tray of boiling hot coffee. She wants to leave an impression upon the passengers and she certainly does! As she’s walking down the aisle she trips over someone’s foot and slops the hot coffee all over the lap of our second passenger. What’s his reaction as that boiling liquid hits his tender flesh? Does he go, “Man that hurt!”? Yes, he does. But then does he rip the parachute from his shoulders, throw it to the floor, and say, “The stupid parachute!”? No, why should he? He didn’t put the parachute on for a better flight. He put it on to save him from the jump to come. If anything, the hot coffee incident causes him to cling tighter to the parachute and even look forward to the jump. If we have put on the Lord Jesus Christ for the right motive—to flee from the wrath that’s to come—when tribulation strikes, when the flight gets bumpy, we won’t get angry at God, and we won’t lose our joy and peace. Why should we? We didn’t come to Christ for a better lifestyle, but to flee from the wrath to come. If anything, tribulation drives the true believer closer to the Savior. </em>

<em>Sadly, we have multitudes of professing Christians who lose their joy and peace when the flight gets bumpy. Why? They are the product of a man-centered gospel. They came lacking repentance, without which they cannot be saved.</em>”
Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Galatian 1:6-7, “6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ </strong>

Paul was marveled at those that decided to jump ship from the real gospel to a false gospel. As I have been going through this series, God has put this series on my heart to convey His heart about false gospels as compared to the only true gospel. <!--more-->
How does one know that although God is not surprised by yet angry with these other gospels? Recall this occurrence of Jesus in the gospel of John. “<strong>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables”(John 2:15)</strong>. It is clear that God opposes all while God opposes error and sin, He is especially passionate about expressing this opposition when error and sin come into His house and when His children are affected. Another error, false gospel that has become very popular at this time is the gospel of the emergent church. <em>“The Emerging Church movement consists of a diverse group of people who identify with </em><a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/c110.html"><em>Christianity</em></a><em>, but who feel that reaching the </em><a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/p02.html"><em>postmodern</em></a><em> world requires us to radically reshape the church’s beliefs and practices to conform to postmodernism.</em>

<em>Postmodern rejects the fact that words have meaning which causes them to “deconstruct” the language of texts (including Scripture), redefining the words and reinterpreting the texts to mean whatever they feel as they have an encounter with the text’s language” (Apologetics index). </em>Ravi Zechariahs in his message postmodernism and philosophy brings out a question that was asked on a TV program<em>, “Do words have meaning, or does the speaker reserve the right to fuse his or her own words, with his or her own meaning? Is there a point of reference for language, or does the speaker determine the right to say whatever he or she wants, and mean whatever he or she wants? The program put out a survey to hear from the world on this issue. If words have no meaning how can one see meaning in the question itself? The surveyors responded that words do not have any meaning the speaker reserves the right to fuse in his or her own meaning. A second question asked, does morality have any meaning or does each individual reserve the right to choose his or her own morality? The surveyor respondents to hear from the world at large, morality doesn’t have any absolutes, one reserves the right to create his or her own. The third item was that if Saddam Hussein didn’t stop playing word games over the airwaves, the US was going to start bombing.” </em>

If words and morality have no meaning then what does the Christian do with the words of the Scripture, especially those spoken in the gospels by Jesus Christ, who used words to convey meaning about our bankruptcy of morality and our need for God’s forgiveness? We are born dead in our sin and transgression and then proceed as we grow older to break God’s moral Law (the Ten Commandments). The emergent church gospel does not subscribe to words having absolute meaning nor absolute truth. Also there is no moral absolute because a Christian can then assume moral superiority over a non-Christian. Furthermore, they do not seek to save the lost like Jesus did, because they use modern methods of evangelism, also known as “friendship evangelism”. Satan is not creative but rather deceptive. A faithful brother in Christ of mine named Ivan shared with me, Satan will use our need for sleep and try to lead us to be lazy, he will use our design for work and try to cause us to become “workaholics”. The emergent gospel has its roots in Satan back in the Garden of Eden when the serpent said to Eve, “<strong>1 Did God really say, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?” 2 And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; 3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’”4Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. 5 For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil (Gen 3:1-4).”</strong> Did God really say? If the emergent gospel can redefine things, then humanity can play God and redefine both good and evil.

The emergent gospel wants everyone to be accepted and for everyone to feel good about oneself. So then Jesus makes a statement such as in <strong>Luke 14, </strong>“<strong>26 If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. 27 And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple</strong>,” this is extremely exclusive, it excludes some people who fail to do what Jesus is commanding as a prerequisite.

The emergent gospel really wants Christ-less Christianity. Brian McLaren, one of the emergent gospels leaders said, <strong><em>“Good evangelism</em></strong><em> is the process of being friendly without discrimination and influencing all of one’s friends toward better living, through good deeds and good conversations…Christian commitment is where I’m coming from…This is not to say that there isn’t a place for Buddhist or Jewish evangelism, but someone else will be better suited to write on these topics</em>.” Compare this to the beginning of Jesus’ ministry, <strong>“From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Perhaps the following dialog will put the unbalanced, “friendship evangelism,” which perhaps many of you subscribe to in its true light:</strong>”

<strong>Preacher’s Progress (by ray Comfort)</strong>

<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “Hi, Mrs. Smith. How are you doing? Is Erik in yet?”
<strong>Mrs. Smith:</strong> “Lunch again, huh? I haven’t seen him come through the lobby today. He came into work last week with a bad hangover. Probably the same thing has happened today. How was church?”
<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “It was really good. We had Brother Don Waterdowns come in and do a series of healing meetings. Hundreds gave their hearts to the Lord. I’m in charge of the follow-up program. Man, I didn’t realize how easy it is to get people saved. Lots were getting healed and people were coming to the altar without even being preached to.”
<strong>Mrs. Smith:</strong> “What a blessing. We had him at our church too. He advocates ‘friendship evangelism,’ doesn’t he?”
<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “Yes. I like that. It’s what I’ve been using on Erik. We’ve become good buddies over the years.”
<strong>Mrs. Smith:</strong> “I like that approach. It’s so much better than shoving the gospel down people’s throats.”
<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “True. That can alienate them. I’m waiting for the right time to mention the things of God to Erik; I don’t want to make him feel uncomfortable. Erik came to one of the meetings, and he really seemed to enjoy it. That’s the good thing about non-confrontational evangelism. He didn’t give his heart to the Lord, though. Maybe today he will bring up the subject. I never do, because I don’t want to offend him. I’m just a good friend, and I think that’s the right approach.”
<strong>Mrs. Smith:</strong> “I agree. I’ll call the Third Floor and speak to his secretary. Perhaps she will know why he’s late.”
<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “Okay.”
<strong>Mrs. Smith: </strong>“Jeannie, Rose Smith. Is Erik Tuday in yet? Christian Loveless is here to see...”
<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “What’s wrong? Your face has gone pale!”
<strong>Mrs. Smith:</strong> “I’m afraid Erik died during the night. He had an aneurysm in his sleep and was pronounced dead at 8:17 this morning...”]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Galatian 1:8, “But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed”</strong>

“<em>Friendship Evangelism that doesn’t seek a way to quickly tell people about their eternal fate is the ultimate betrayal of trust. How can we call ourselves a friend of someone we don’t bother to warn of terrible danger? Friends don’t let friends go to hell”, </em>(Ray comfort)<!--more-->

I realize that these messages are longer than usual. It has been a challenge both in the study, because the topic is so vast, and a challenge communicating effectively to you, those we deeply care about. May you stay aware of the dangerous, false gospels being preached, and hold fast to the Gospel According to Jesus Christ (see Bible for complete text). For further study on the emergent church please check out, <a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/">www.apologeticsindex.org</a> and click on the right side bar, emergent church. Today we will look at the Mormon Gospel.

In Paul’s defense of the true gospel he does not fail to mention that “<strong>an angel from heaven</strong>” may come and preach to you another gospel. In Paul’s day the Mormon belief systems did not exist at the time. However it certainly is preaching its false gospel today. Perhaps you have Mormon friends, or have been approached by Mormons. We should not run away from them, but rather give them the Biblical gospel, their lives depend on it.

In 1823, the angel Moroni allegedly visits a man named Joseph Smith in his bedroom three times one September night. These visits are the start of a series of lessons that results in Joseph’s getting gold plates that were allegedly buried in Hill Cumorah, just a few miles south of Palmyra, in Manchester, New York. In 1827, Joseph allegedly receives from the angel Moroni the gold plates that were buried in Hill Cumorah. Written on them in “Reformed Egyptian” is the history of a previously unknown New World people. With the help of God Joseph translates the writing into what is now the Book of Mormon. What the book of Mormon teaches is that <strong>Salvation,</strong> a word that Mormons qualify in one of three ways: <em>unconditional </em>or <em>general</em> salvation is simply resurrection from the dead, granted to all through Christ’s atonement; <em>conditional</em> or <em>individual</em> salvation involves entering the celestial kingdom through works of Mormonism; <em>full</em> salvation means exaltation to become a God as a result of temple ceremonies and other works (Farkas, J. R., &amp; Reed, D., A. (1997, c1995). <em>Mormonism: Changes, contradictions, and errors</em> (electronic ed.). An angel of God would not contradict the Word of God, and we certainly cannot become a god ourselves, that is idolatry!

Mormonism is a self – righteous system that can earn their own salvation through good works. If one could earn salvation then who needs Jesus Christ to die for the sin of the world. <strong>John 3:16, 1 Peter 3:18,</strong> and numerous other verses of Scripture make this plane. “<strong>For by grace you have been saved ﻿through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of ﻿﻿works, lest anyone should ﻿﻿boast”,</strong> (<strong>Ephesians 2:8, 9</strong>).”
Remember that Satan masquerades as an “<strong>angel of light</strong>” <strong>(2 Cor. 11:14).</strong> There is only one God, not many, as the Mormons propose, <strong>(Isaiah 43:10 – 11; 44:6, 45: 5 – 6, 21 – 22)</strong> all other “gods” are idols (<strong>1 Cor. 16:26, Exodus 30:3, 23</strong>). The God of the Bible created the entire universe (<strong>Gen 1:16; Psa. 8:3; Jer. 31:35</strong>). Jehovah (translated as “LORD” in all caps) and Elohim (translated as “God”) are the same being (<strong>Duet 4:35; 1 Kings 8:60; Psalm 100:2</strong>). Jesus and Satan are not brothers, as put forth in Mormonism. Jesus is surely the only way to Heaven. “<strong>Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved</strong>.”
May you help Mormons find their way to the truth lest they end up in Hell for all eternity!
Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jude 1:4, "For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ"</strong>

There’s a famous Greek story about the conquering of the city of Troy. The story goes that Greeks laid siege to the city of Troy for over ten years, and in that time, were unable to capture it. Finally, a man by the name of Ulysses decided to have a large wooden horse built and left outside the city walls as a gift to the unconquerable Trojans. The Greeks then sailed away in apparent defeat. The curious and proud Trojans felt confident enough to drag the horse inside their walls.<!--more-->

That night Greek soldiers crept out of the horse and opened the city gates from within, allowing Greek forces into Troy. The Greeks then massacred the population of Troy, looted the city, and burned it. Throughout history the “Trojan Horse” has been a symbol of infiltration and deception.

There's a movement spreading through the church today that I believe to be a "trojan horse." It’s referred to as the “Health and Wealth, Name it and Claim it or Prosperity Gospel.” This movement isn’t new. It is however, extremely popular. A majority of what is being broadcast on Christian television is consistent with “Word of Faith” theology. Christian bookstores prominently display books that are written by people who leaders in this movement.

Here’s a few statistics that show the extent of this movements reach: 46% of self proclaimed Christians agree with the idea that God will grant material riches to all believers who have enough faith. 90% of Pentecostals in Nigeria, South Africa, India and the Philippines believe that: :“<em>God will grant material prosperity to all believers who have enough faith.”</em> Nearly half of American Christians in any denomination, and roughly ⅔ of American Pentecostals now embrace the basic premise of the Prosperity Gospel that: “<em>God wants you to be happy, healthy, and rich</em>.” Although names like the “Health and Wealth, Name it and Claim it, and Prosperity Gospel” accurately describe some of “Word of Faith” teaching, they only begin to tell the whole story.

WOF preachers teach that we can speak things into existence. That our tongue actually has power to bring about life or death. They would reference <strong>Proverbs 18:2</strong>1 which says that “<strong>death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those that love it will eat its fruit.</strong>” So is that true? Do I have that kind of power with my words to bring about death? Well, not in the way that they would lead you to believe. This verse is talking about someone who gossips and the inevitable consequences that will ensue. It is in no way telling us that we have the ability to create life or death in a literal sense.

There is so much to share in the next posting, keep reading, blessings Matt]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jude 1:4, "For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ"</strong>

Another Word of Faith doctrine is faith being an actual substance or a force that we can direct at God. For this, they would appeal to <strong>Hebrews 11:1</strong> which says “ <strong>now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</strong>” From looking at this verse you would think they’re right, but if you look at the word “substance,” which in the greek is “hypostasis,” you’ll see that a more accurate translation in today’s speech, is the word “assurance.” <!--more-->In most other translations, other than the KJV, the word assurance or confidence is used in place of substance. This is because the King James translation is about 400 years old and language has evolved since then. WOF teachers hold that we can use this substance, or specifically, faith filled words and direct it at God, which causes Him to act. They insist that just as God created with His words, so can we.

Most importantly, Word of Faith preachers have a distorted view of the person and work of Jesus Christ, and His atonement for our sins. There are some, like Kenneth Copeland, that say that Jesus wasn’t God, he grew into his Godhood. Others claim, like Paula White, say that Jesus isn’t the only begotten Son of God, only the first of many. E.W Kenyon, who is known as the Grandfather of the WOF movement, claimed that Jesus’s death on the cross didn’t atone for our sins, but there was a “Spiritual Death” that occurred, which served as our atonement. This is taught by many in the WOF movement, including Joyce Meyers, and is a complete contradiction of the Word of God. <strong>1Peter 3:18</strong> says “ <strong>For Christ also died for sins ONCE and for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.”</strong>

There are some that feel that questioning the doctrinal accuracy of certain teachings is divisive. That we should all just get along and not test popular teachings against the bible. In response to this kind of criticism, the late Dave Hunt said this “<em>Biblical unity is not something we establish by making an agreement not to disagree with each other. We are to KEEP the unity that has already been established by God the Holy Spirit, of whom Christ said, ‘When He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.’ Christians are united in Christ not by some joint effort they put forth but by the Holy Spirit, who indwells each member of His body, and by the truth that each member embraces. Such unity is not MAINTAINED but BROKEN by compromise"</em>

In the book of Galatians, there’s a confrontation that takes place between the Apostle Paul and the Apostle Peter. What led to that was that prior to certain men coming to Antioch, who were members of the “Party of the Circumcision", Peter used to eat with the Gentiles. But once these men arrived, he began to separate himself from the Gentiles. You see, he was reverting back to Jewish customs, and in doing so, he was causing other men to do the same, including Barnabas. That in itself doesn’t seem like something that would be cause for Paul to “<strong>oppose Peter to his face</strong>,” but when you look at verse 14 it becomes more clear as to why he did. It says in <strong>Galatians 2:14, “when I (Paul) saw that they were not straightforward about the TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL, I said to Cephas (Peter) in the presence of all, ‘If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”</strong> Paul opposed him in such a way because they weren’t being straightforward about the TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL. Paul knew that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Jesus Christ. He was compelled to stand up for the TRUTH much like Jude is urging us to do in his epistle.

To finish, blessing Matt]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jude 1:4, "For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ."</strong>

Jude appeals to us in <strong>chapter 1:3 </strong>to “<strong>contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.</strong>” I think it’s important to really understand what’s being said here. The word contend in the original Greek literally means to struggle for, or fight. And the faith he’s talking about isn’t a spiritual commodity. <!--more-->He’s not telling us to struggle for our faith in God. The faith he’s talking about is the culmination of all that we believe. It’s the same faith of <strong>1Timothy 6:12 </strong>where Paul tells Timothy to “ <strong>fight the good fight of THE FAITH.”</strong>

Jude tells us that this FAITH was delivered to us once for all. How was this faith delivered? It was delivered to us in the Bible. To sum it all up, he’s telling us to contend or struggle or fight for the preservation of the TRUTH, for God’s WORD.

And who are we fighting? <strong>2Timothy 4:3</strong> says “<strong>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires; and will turn away their ears from the truth, and will turn aside to myths.</strong>” Dave Wilkerson said this: “<em>There is an evil wind blowing into God’s house, deceiving multitudes of God’s chosen people. This perverted gospel seeks to make gods of people. They are told, ‘Your destiny is in the power of your mind. Whatever you can conceive is yours. Speak it into being. Create it by a positive mind set. Success, happiness, perfect health is all yours. If you will only use your mind creatively. Turn your dreams into reality by using mind power.’ Let it be known once and for all, God will not abdicate His lordship to the power of our minds, negative or positive. We are to seek only the mind of Christ, and His mind is not materialistic; it is not focused on success or wealth. Christ’s mind is focused only on the glory of God and obedience to His Word. No other teaching so ignores the Cross and the corruption of the human mind. It bypasses the evil of our ruined Adam nature, and it takes the Christian’s eye off Christ’s gospel of eternal redemption and focuses it on earthly gain. Saints of God, flee from this!”</em>

The men and women who are teachers in the “Word of Faith” movement, are not being straightforward about THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL. Their doctrine is in direct opposition to the TRUTH, and it’s causing many believers to be led astray.

There is much more to Word of Faith doctrine that I haven’t touched on. I also haven’t elaborated fully on the topics that I did mention. I will go through each topic in the future, one by one, to bring to light the many falsehoods being portrayed as biblical truth. I can’t stress enough the enormous reach that this movement has. <strong>2Timothy 2:15, "Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." </strong>Blessing, Matt]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 12:2, "do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6173" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

I struggle at times to know whether I am being led by my will or the will of God. Today I will share on some principles from a verse you have heard or read many times.

First I pick two words "CONFORMED" and "TRANSFORMED” from the verse. The bible says, "<strong>do not be conformed to this world</strong>". <!--more-->Conformed is to act or be in accord or be in agreement with something, in this case the world. How will you know the will of God when the world sets up your standard? What you respond to the most will dictate where your life will lead. If you are conformed to the world, you do things and become like the world. For example dating the unsaved, whoever you are dating at one point will pull you to his or her side and you will agree with things that you had purposed never to do. You have moral standards, they may not have or if they do, they could create their own. <strong>2Corinthians 6:17, "Therefore "Come out from among them And be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, And I will receive you."; 2Corinthians 6:14, "Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?"; Psalm 1:1, "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly..." </strong>No need to pray for a situation like this to see if it's God's will for your life. He has already given us guidelines of knowing His will in the area of relationships and marriage. You are canceling the will of God in your life by being yoked to the unbeliever. By the way, this is for our own good.

TRANSFORMED is to change the nature, function or condition in other words convert. Why not use the word improve instead? The reason is this, the things of the world in someone’s life are not worth improving. They need transformation, not with what it has but by something or someone foreign to it, <strong>2Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new</strong>". When we come to Christ, our old nature is not improved but changed, made new <strong>Jeremiah 18:4, "...he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make". </strong> The potter did not improve the existing vessel, He took the same broken material conformed to this world and transformed it into another vessel<strong>. </strong>

Who will make a vessel if He has nothing to put in it, unless He makes it because He wants to pour <strong>HIS WILL </strong>in it, <strong>Luke 5:37, "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined". </strong>Because we are made new, we have new desires, new dreams, new ambitions, our old selfish things are gone because we are transformed. One of God's will for our lives is to be transformed by the renewing of our minds. Why our mind? <strong>Romans 8:7; "Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God; nor indeed can be"; Colossians 1:21, "And you; who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works; yet now He has reconciled"</strong>. The mind is the stumbling block we have to overcome, it fights the will of God. To finish. Blessings Ev, God's servant]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 12:2, "do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6175" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image1.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

We looked at "conformed" and "transformed", two key things to lead us to know the will of God. In this session let's look at the last part of vs. 2, "…<strong>that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God". </strong>From the beginning of this verse, I see a wide angle and the more you read and study it word by word, the more you can see how it's being condensed to a common denominator "...<strong>perfect will of God</strong>".

While I was in school in my math class, I was taught about the common denominator which means a quantity into which all the denominators of a set of fractions may be divided without a remainder. <!--more-->A commonly shared theme, a place where it ends, its final destination. Let's break it into phrases <strong>"...that you may prove</strong>". To prove, you have to establish truth and determine the quality by testing. The bible says<strong> 2Corinthians 13:5, "Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. ...unless indeed you are disqualified"</strong>. This is the greatest test of all, seeing if you are in the faith (saved), then in <strong>1Thessalonians 5:21,"Test all things; hold fast what is good</strong>". <strong>1John 4:1, "Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; ...</strong>". It all comes back to, are you in the faith and what does the Word of God have to say about a situation.

Next to tackle <strong>"...what is good and acceptable</strong>". Something can be good but it may not be good for you for a number of reasons. It could destroy you by making yo forget God, pride, selfishness to mention a few. For example riches are good, God is the author of it but it's not good for some people. Solomon said, "<strong>Do not give me riches lest I forget you</strong>"(paraphrased). Your character has to be enlarged if God is going to bring it your way. A number cannot be trusted with more good things because they have not utilized what God gave them before. In other words, they cannot be trusted with more. You can see this being narrowed down, it has to be approved according to His Word, it has to be good and acceptable just for you, now let's look at the last part <strong>"...and perfect will of God". </strong>I believe that when we are not conformed but transformed and we have approved what is good and acceptable, we will have no problem knowing the perfect will of God in our lives in most situations. The reason being, when we have narrowed it down, all we are left with is to see one way out, God's way of bringing victory through His will.

"…<strong>Thy will be done</strong>" is our common denominator, all we need are things that get us ready to know His will and then yield to His will. If your will is in conflict with His will, you abandon your will and you submit to His. May He teach us how to be in His will. I am still learning, how about you? Be blessed Evans, God's servant]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 6:33, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you".</strong>

Looking around, I see so many trees standing, an indication they are alive and growing. Big, tall, thin, young trees are everywhere. Some do bear sweet fruits and some don't. Many have pleasant looking leaves making them look attractive and yet some don’t. I also see that some do provide shade in hot and sunny seasons. We appreciate trees for many reasons because of the results, what they have turned out to be, but the question is, <strong>where does their strength lie?</strong><!--more-->

Every believer has to know where his or her strength lies. Others things will fall in place when the introduction to this is correct. In as much as everyone appreciates the trees, the strength of those trees lies in their roots. I believe that for a believer to be strong, he or she has to have roots grounded somewhere. When we look at the trees, we don't see the roots but we see the result of what the roots are doing. The deeper the roots, the healthier and stronger the trees can be.

Prayers is one of the biggest and strongest roots a believer can have as part his or her life. <strong>The destination of the tree depends on the introduction of the roots</strong>. If the roots are shallow, most likely when it rains heavily, that tree will be washed away. If it's also shallow, the wind will blow it away. The only way that trees can stand and look good is by allowing it to be planted in the right soil, the roots going deeper and deeper seeking and searching for food that will sustain it. In my life I found out that my prayer life is my roots, very important. I am what I am because of my prayer life. The more I was shallow in prayers, the more I could not stand for long however the more I prayed, the more my roots went deeper and the more I became stronger as I sought the Lord.

People appreciate the outcome, but they don’t understand that my strength is not on what they see but on the roots they don't see. To grow in righteousness, I have to sink my roots deeper in prayers and God’s word, the same in reaching the lost, being a good husband, good worker etc. <strong>Psalm 1:1-3, “1 Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful; 2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night. 3 He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper</strong>.”

When we pray, we don't pray to be seen, it’s done in secret, the results is what everyone sees. You want to be blessed, stay strong, grow?, the secret is being willing to do whatever it takes to dig your roots deeper. It’s easy to ask someone to help you out by praying for you, or even encourage you, I believe the greatest way you can be a victor is by going to the Lord yourself. Let someone come and add to what you already have. The woman with the issue of blood sought the Lord, her strength was in her faith in God and her move, and so was the blind man who cried out to the Lord while everyone tried to silence him. He knew his moment, his strength was in his faith in God and voice. <strong>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness (develop your roots) and all these things shall be added unto you (You will blossom in the natural). Where does your strength lie? Blessings, Ev</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 11:4, “By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks”.</strong>

We constantly meet people who refer to themselves as spiritual or religious. Most serve a god in their making, a god they are more comfortable with instead of serving the Living God. People try to offer their very best to God, question is, is it ever good enough.<!--more-->

In <strong>Genesis 4,</strong> brothers, Cain and Abel one time brought sacrifices before God, <strong>Genesis 4: 3-4, “3 And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord. 4 Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord respected Abel and his offering”. </strong>They both brought what they felt was acceptable to God. If “<strong>Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God”, Romans 10:17, </strong>they must have known what the Lord required of them. We see Cain bringing fruit of the ground. Now the ground was cursed in <strong>Genesis 3</strong> and here he is trying to make something for himself, in his own effort, and he brings it to the Lord (works). On the other hand, Abel offers to God “<strong>the firstborn of his flock and of their fat</strong>”. He is offering to God what is from God, a lamb. God honored his sacrifice. <strong>Hebrews 11:4</strong> gives us the reason God honored his sacrifice, he offered it by faith. His sacrifice by faith was counted to him as righteousness.

It’s the saving faith that honors God, receiving from us what is from Him. What can we offer God on our own that is good enough? nothing. Hasn’t the bible said already in <strong>Romans 3:20, “Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight</strong>”. That in as much as we offer to God the offering from the ground, something we have worked, what we are comfortable with, our accomplishments, it’s never good enough. God requires a perfect sacrifice. To offer a sacrifice from the fruit of the ground is not to offer a perfect excellent sacrifice. We all fall short. We need to offer to God a perfect sacrifice and He is the only One who can give that perfect sacrifice. And He did, He gave His Only begotten Son to suffer and die for our sins. And by repentance and faith, we can offer to God Christ (the firstborn (position), first fruit) who offered Himself as the Lamb, the blood sacrifice to save us. <strong>Revelation 1:4-6, “4 …Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, 5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, 6 and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen”. He is the more excellent sacrifice.”</strong>

<strong>Galatians 3:11, “But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for “the just shall live by faith</strong>.” a different bible version puts it this way, <strong>“he who is righteous by faith shall live</strong>.” God demands His requirements be met in His way. Ritual in itself never satisfies God and is an abomination to Him. If you are trying to get saved by good works “fruit of the ground”, then you’ve disqualified yourself like Cain. <strong>What God has commanded in the law (ten commandments), He has provided in the gospel of His Son Jesus</strong> and for you and I to satisfy the demands of the law, we have to abandon our sins, turn away from them and receive Christ as the Lamb of God to wash away our sins.

Have you repented of your sins?, are you counting on your “fruit of the ground” to save you?, what you are counting on may be the very thing that will condemn you. “<strong>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks”, Hebrews 11:4, Blessings Ev</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Deuteronomy 1:6-7, “6 The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: ‘You have dwelt long enough at this mountain. 7 Turn and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring places in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates”</strong>

The Israelites had left Egypt under the leadership of Moses by the hand of God. They journeyed to Mount Sinai, a place where they would worship the Lord and be ready to continue with their journey to the Promised Land. <strong>Exodus 19:1 says “In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai”. </strong>Mark how long it took them to get there, about 3 months and how long it took them to stay there, 40 years, <strong>Deuteronomy 1:3, "Now it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him as commandments to them”</strong><!--more-->

From a land of bondage, a land of less than enough, a land of hard labor, the Israelites were by this mountain cared for, protected, and provided for. They became comfortable, way too comfortable. Of course they were to be there for a season, they had not arrived to their destination. They had come from a land where the Lord fought for them; the time had come where the Lord would fight with them and through them. This is where they became paralyzed. Where they were going was going to require total trust and confidence in God, to which they were not ready for. So they sat by this mountain year after year and that’s when “<strong>The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: ‘You have dwelt long enough at this mountain</strong>”<strong>, Deuteronomy 1:6. </strong>Are we anyway different? There are people who have been in one place forever; the same prayers they prayed 5-10 years ago are the same today, they became used to being out of Egypt but done progressing to God’s promise land because they fear battles ahead to make it there. If you were to evaluate your spiritual life, would you discover you are stagnant, no challenges, no desire to move forward? Satisfied right where you are, complaisant, lukewarm, and not allowing the Lord to use you? only depending on Sunday morning church to keep your spiritual life alive? If you are experiencing any of these, you are no different from Israelites who dwelt by the mountain long enough, stagnant.

Sinai dwelling was supposed to be temporary; they made it a permanent dwelling. You and I need to have something big before us that serve as a challenge otherwise we too will stop moving with the Lord. I’m glad to be out of Egypt but I’m not bound to die by the mountain when God has revealed that there is more. We ought to turn to the One who is more than able, who has made us more than conquerors and we take Him at His word and vs<strong>. “7 Turn and take your (our) journey, and go to the mountains of (whatever your mountain is)</strong>. The following verse, tells us we are not there yet, <strong>1Corinthians 2:9,” But as it is written: “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.” </strong>Imagine the time they wasted and the time we too have wasted not obeying His voice due to fear of the battle a head of us. We have battles to fight, mountains to climb, valleys to go through, all these serves as challenges. They bring more glory to His name, something we all want. Examine yourself, where are you stagnant by a certain mountain for too long. Rise and move. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1 Kings 19:3-5, “3 Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.” 5 Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.” </strong>

The following is a message that I was deeply inspired by from Charles Swindoll’s book Elijah, about the time in Elijah’s life when he went from victory to depression. Here are some great truths for us to learn:<!--more-->

<strong>Firstly, Elijah was not thinking realistically or clearly.</strong> Who made the threat? It was Jezebel not God that came against Elijah. How was Elijah able to so boldly challenge 450 prophets of Baal, but yet this one woman caused him to feel so threatened and vulnerable to his core? Often it’s the little things that we make bigger than God in our eyes that seem to threaten all that we hold dear, and all that we identify with.

<strong>Secondly, Elijah separated himself from strengthening relationships.</strong> Why did he get alone? Often when one is depressed one tends to retreat to be by oneself, instead of connecting as one should, often one will disconnect at the time he or she so desperately needs others. However when this happens others are pushed away and whatever encouragement others try to give, it is appreciated but not received or heard as much as it is needed. One looks inward and refuses for a time to look outward.

<strong>Thirdly, Elijah was caught in the backwash of a great victory</strong>. Often after a victory, often comes temptation and vulnerability. Elijah previously battled against and proved that God NOT Baal is the true God that manifested Himself by answering by fire.

<strong>Fourthly, Elijah was physically exhausted and emotionally spent</strong>. When we are in this state, our spirit is affected. We tend to drag, become sluggish, tired, weary in well doing, etc….

<strong>Fifthly, Elijah got lost in self-pity. </strong>Have you ever had the “victim mentality,” whereby you blamed the world, “the system,” and everyone and everything else for your unhappiness? The blame game has been played since Adam blamed Eve when he was questioned by God. When we are in self pity, as far as we are concerned we are the only one with problems, and they are larger than life, even greater than the Lord. God will not allow us to stay in self – pity if we are following Him, because He has too much for us to do, and to come to glorify His name in victory, and not in defeat.

<strong>God’s ministered to Elijah</strong>. God allowed Elijah a time of rest and refreshment. God communicated wisely with Elijah (v.9), and gave Elijah a close personal friend (v.19-21) <em>ELISHA.</em>

<strong>Elijah reminds us</strong>. <strong><em>Let’s look up</em></strong>after the Lord graciously delivers us from our depression. <strong><em>Let’s look up</em></strong> when he allow us rest and refreshment following an exhausting schedule that has taken its toll on us. <strong><em>Let’s look up</em></strong> and thank Him when He gently and patiently speaks to us from his Word after we’ve climbed out of a pit of self-pity. <strong><em>Let’s look up</em></strong>and praise Him when He faithfully proved the companionship and affirmation of a friend who understands and encourages us. <strong><em>Let’s look up</em></strong> and acknowledge the Giver more than the gift.

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 13:3, "Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering".</strong>

A while back my wife and I attended the Voice of the Martyrs Missions Conference in Oklahoma. This gathering was filled with our precious family members, many that have been imprisoned, beaten, tortured, and almost killed for Christ. Many of us have probably never met a brother or sister in Christ that has been through real persecution in this day and age<em>. "It didn’t end at the Coliseum, Christians still die</em>"<!--more-->

<strong>1Corinthians 12</strong> speaks about the body of Christ, being of one body but many parts all operating by the same Spirit. God designed each member of His body to fulfill their purpose in which they have been designed for. <strong>1Corinthians 12:26</strong> states, If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. Picture if you broke your foot, lost an eye, or went deaf. Would your whole body not be affected by it? As our brothers and sisters around the globe are being beaten for faith in Christ do we as the Body “feel it?” Many don’t know, or care, and some don’t care to know about Christian persecution.

However, if you are part of the body, even now your heart will ache for these dear family members. Go to www. Persecution.com and be exposed to the reality of Christian suffering. Now this is not shared with you to give you a morbid day, but rather to expose you to the reality of your family that is suffering. We don’t experience much of this in the U.S. but this is not so in China, Iran, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq etc.

To remember them that are in bonds is more the cognitive recollection. Rather remembering is an active love toward those in the bonds. This may take in prayer, financial support, letters written to them, or visiting them yourselves. Whatever you can do at a practical level, please feel their pain. We are called to not only remember them as if we were in prison with them, but as if we ourselves were suffering. If you were the one in jail, if you were the one suffering would you not desire your brothers and sisters to love you and support you? Our family needs us desperately.

Read <strong>Hebrews 11:36-38</strong>. The world may not be worthy of them, but they are worthy to Jesus, and worthy to us. They counted not their lives unto death. (<strong>Revelation 12:11</strong>)

Blessings,
Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Isaiah 6:1-9, "In the year king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord..."</strong>

At the introduction of the book of Isaiah chapter 6 shows us the preparation of Isaiah’s life to respond to the call God had for him. "<strong>In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord</strong>", I am yet to study who king Uzziah was. Let me for now say by looking at the scripture that he looks like a king who blocked men like Isaiah from seeing God as He is. Can’t tell how he might have done it. I believe Isaiah was raised under his leadership and he must have looked up to him. Through that, Isaiah may have had self-righteousness in that compared to his people he talks about in the earlier chapters. He had not had a revelation from above to the true holiness of God, therefore as the bible puts it in <strong>Romans 10:3, "For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God</strong>". Any time you can think to yourself that, "<strong>I'm a little bit better</strong>" will be a sign of establishing your own righteousness.<!--more-->

If you have someone or something blocking your view of the true thing, it's easy to get satisfied by what is there. Why would I want to progress in my spiritual walk if I feel I have arrived? I am going to heaven, sounds good. I feel a little bit better compared to those who have not received Him. I give to the Lord, I make it to church, what more could the Lord require of me? I used to feel this way, I was comfortable being saved and going to heaven that I did not want to do anything else besides that. Just when you feel comfortable, God will disrupt your life causing you to see something extraordinary. Something that has been clouding your way has to die and be removed. Remember there are two kingdoms here, King Uzziah's and King Jesus'. As king Uzziah faded from the picture, Isaiah began to encounter with the God of holiness. <strong>Isaiah 6:1, "...I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple</strong>". <strong>I believe that you can never see who you really are until you see who He really is</strong>. Seeing who He really is exposes you to who you really are in His light. As long as king Uzziah was alive, Isaiah had no understanding of who God was (is) because king Uzziah’s living clouded his eyes to see Who He was(is). Isaiah in this case first saw Him sitting on the throne, <strong>HE is the King</strong>. High and Lifted up, <strong>Worshipped</strong>; train of His robe filled the temple, <strong>covering everything exposed</strong>. <strong>vs. 2, "Above it stood seraphim; each with six wings: with two he covered his face, with two covered his feet, and with two he flew</strong>". If Seraphim is a heavenly being, a type of an angel, he must be holier than us. Bowing before God, covering his face, everything that Isaiah may have known about holiness was shattered at that moment. And the angels cried one to another, <strong>"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory"</strong>. Of all the things that describe the nature of God, none has been repeated more than once as the word "holy". You don't hear, faithful, faithful, faithful but "Holy" always mentioned three times perhaps referring to each member of the Trinity.

Holiness is what God requires of us, <strong>1Peter 1:16 "Be holy for I am holy …</strong>". The holiness is not based on men's standard but God's. The holiness of God humbles me to the fact that I’m undone. Not only did Isaiah see the holiness of God, he also saw that he had not worshipped the God of holiness. I am always reminded by God that I am not there yet even though He has used me mightily. I am grateful to be reminded to keep pursuing more and more. So Isaiah's standard of holiness had been disrupted, what will he do about it?.

His response,<strong> Isaiah 6:5, "So I said, "woe is me for I am undone!..". </strong> As Isaiah, we are not complete yet, whether God has used us mightily or not, we are not there yet. Why drift back when you haven't reached yet? why relax and be comfortable because you established your own righteousness by looking at someone's life? Pray that God will let all the king Uzziah's in your life die that you may see Him as He is and in turn open your eyes to see yourself in His true light, and confess like Isaiah did.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Isaiah 6:1-9, "In the year king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord..."</strong>

<strong>Vs. 5, "So I said: Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts"</strong>. As we said in part 1, you will never see who you really are until you see who He really is. His holiness raises a standard for us and not men. I know that when God is bringing you to a place where He can reveal to you who you really are, He will bring you to a place where it's one on one. He did the same with Jacob, Moses, Abraham, Mary the mother of Jesus to mention a few. Over and over again I see the Lord eliminating everything that is distracting and letting you be in a place where you concentrate on what He is showing you.<!--more-->

God revealed Himself to Isaiah not in front of everyone. And Isaiah's words were, "<strong>woe is me, for I am undone</strong>", in other words "<strong>distressed is me for I am incomplete</strong>", It wasn't "<strong>woe they are not complete</strong>" neither was it "<strong>woe we are not complete</strong>", he personalized it. “<em>It's me who needs work, it's me still under construction</em>”. I wish I could wear a sign on my back saying, "<strong>Be patient with me, I'm still under construction</strong>". Why I'm I man of unclean lips? what has been harbored inside is manifested through the mouth and actions. If I had thought that everyone else was not good enough, eventually that will be manifested outside through my mouth. To make it even interesting, Isaiah also realizes that there are people who have been like him, proclaiming self-righteousness and have been ignorant of it. He has a new vision of who he is and who God is but how about the rest? He had seen the King to know that He was not where he needed to be. Here is something that turns many people away when they come to God, they think God will just take over from where they left. God first shows you how far you’ve missed the mark, strips you of self-righteousness and when your mouth is stopped, then He cleanses you, takes all the guilt and shame away and <strong>Romans 8:1</strong> becomes your pillar, <strong>"There is therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus..."</strong>

One of the seraphim flew with live coal and touched his mouth saying, <strong>vs. 7, "...Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away and your sin is purged</strong>", if I am under construction, I need all the help I can get. My sins taken away, my joy restored, my peace upgraded because I still have a journey to make, a race to run, a mountain to climb, a valley to pass through, battles to fight. If we are not complete yet, then we are not there yet. Of all we have talked about revolves around a man under construction.

<strong>Vs. 8, "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: "Whom shall I send and who will go for Us?", then I said, "Here am I! send me". </strong>Here is the work of the saints, not to sit and enjoy but be ready to be sent out. The working in him propelled him to see that the people he was living among were deceiving themselves just as he was thinking they were fine while they were not. <strong>1John 1:8, "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us</strong>", how many deceive themselves everyday thinking that their life style is okay? How many establish their own righteousness being ignorant of the righteousness of God? who will point them to the truth? Isaiah did not want to receive a revelation, be changed and be comfortable. What he saw rocked his world that when the Lord was looking for someone to send, he responded to the call.

Isaiah carried a message of both hope and judgment. He described and predicted the coming of the Messiah: Jesus Christ. We too are carrying a message of hope and judgment and proclaiming the second coming of the Lord. Have you responded to His call in your life or are you okay with the fact that you are going to heaven? do you feel you are there yet or are you still journeying? Are you under construction or is your house complete? Are you establishing your own righteousness and not that of God? Has He touched your mouth with live coal and taken your iniquity away? my message is simple today, "<strong>WE ARE NOT THERE YET</strong>!!" Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 6:21, “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”-</strong>

According to legend as popularized by the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, pirates, open sea rebels travel far and wide in search of treasure ranging from gold coins to Aztech gold. Even though it's been said that not all that glitters is gold, they never grow weary in search of priceless trinkets because that's what their hearts beat for.<!--more-->

Like pirates who will travel open seas through peril for a chest of gold, do you search for Christ with all your heart? Is he the treasure your heart longs for, or are you wasting away chasing after silly rainbows that fuel nothing more than the lust of the eyes. According to <strong>Matthew 6:19-20</strong>, we shouldn't store for ourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust can destroy them, but in heaven where they are eternal. Pirates waste away to their death searching for trinkets because for every stolen trinket, their hearts lust for larger, pricier and more lavish pieces. To keep stolen treasure, they are also susceptible to betrayal, theft, and death because there is no honor among thieves. It's the never ending battle for mortal satisfaction.

According to the Bible, when we seek after righteousness, we shall be filled because this heavenly treasure profits the soul and not our carnal lust. <strong>Matthew 5:6</strong> declares that blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. If the Lord is your treasure, you will never grow weary in seeking after Him because only in the Lord will your heart be also. <strong>Jeremiah 29:13 says, “You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart</strong>.” If we desire the Lord on a constant basis like a pirate longs for treasure, we shall receive the everlasting fulfillment that can't be found in silver, gold or any other corruptible thing.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 4:32, the Bible says, “Be compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you” (NIV1984).</strong>

At one time or another, we have all struggled with letting go of the past. This resonates even deeper if emotions were tied to a specific incident. We have all held on to things that have crippled, consumed, and literally sucked the life out of us. Betrayals, regrets, bad choices, emotional, and even physical hurt generally make up the past's lexicon. More often than not, for many, the past is usually married to un-forgiveness. <!--more-->Like misery attracts company, the past walks hand-in-hand with un-forgiveness. Maybe at one time in your life someone broke your heart leaving you to scramble to put the pieces back together, or you faced betrayal's sting in the worst possible fashion. For Christians and non-Christians alike, hurt, and primarily un-forgiveness unflinching aura has a way of scarring us to the point where the future seems like a distant uncertainty. In fact, one writer described un-forgiveness as “spiritual poison.” Getting past clouds of pain and emotional torment to see the light of forgiveness on a hill becomes more of an illusion than reality.

Like many, I know how challenging un-forgiveness and letting go of the past can be. I know what it's like to look betrayal, hurt, and frustration in the eye. As depicted in The Lion King, un-forgiveness for ourselves and others will always plague us until we finally let go. While chants of “Hakuna Matata,” as highlighted in the popular animated movie does nothing to relinquish this burden, we can only let go of the past once we submit to forgiveness. Bearing the burden of un-forgiveness follows men even in their dying days. In <strong>Ephesians 4:32, the Bible says, “Be compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you” (NIV1984).
</strong>
For many, a scripture such as this has no meaning because even the most powerful literature ever written has little effect if we haven't reached a place of brokenness to forgive and let go. Sometimes scripture makes forgiveness seem easier said than done right? Off course; however, there isn't a writing on a wall, a self-help book, or a motivational speaker that can persuade you to forgive. When we get hurt, our heart's undeniable fragility leaves us hardened, and often as cold as ice. For some, not even love can penetrate this icy exterior because the walls we build hold off anything and everyone. Like the burning desire to love and be loved, we all know that we should forgive. Even though it's written on the tablets of our conscience, only a broken heart can lead to such an epic conclusion. Unless the Lord breaks this hardened shell and softens our hearts as he declares in <strong>Ezekiel 36:26</strong>, we will always wallow in our past hurts with this immense cloud hovering over us.

To be concluded..., blessings by Kefa]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 4:32, the Bible says, “Be compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you” (NIV1984). </strong>

When should we forgive and finally let go? How should we do it? Does the offender even need to know that you forgave him? Whenever these questions start to haunt you, it may be an indication that the Lord is stirring up a spirit of forgiveness. Now don't get me wrong; this does not mean you'll wake up one morning to a chorus of "Oh Happy Day," smiling at the birds chirping, feeling all happy and dandy saying, “<em>yes! yes, I have forgiven my offender, and I am finally letting go</em>.” <!--more-->Truth be told, that's more likely on a utopia than the real world. On the contrary, forgiveness and letting go is a process that takes time; it can come to fruition if the desire is evident. When you read scriptures addressing un-forgiveness, you can clearly tell that it was intended to be a tough battle we must fight vigilantly and ferociously. The battle can only be won if we fight our pride to its last stand.

As I stated in the first part of this devotion, no one can tell you when or how you should go about forgiving. Anyway who attempts to is clearly out of touch with the reality of your hurt. Un-forgiveness causes restlessness and lack of peace. There's no greater discomfort than when we are not at peace. But as we desire to forgive just as our heavenly father Forgives us of our countless sins, He starts a restoration process, which even begins to highlight just how irrelevant the offender actually is. You finally realize that you aren't forgiving your offender for his sake, but for the Lord. Coupled with hurt, un-forgiveness is a heavy burden to carry. It gives your offender so much power over you. Choosing to run or hide only does so much to suppress these emotions, because just like the buoyancy that causes a log to float, these feelings will always resurface<strong>. In Matthew 11:28, the scripture says, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (NIV1984).</strong> If you're struggling with past hurts and un-forgiveness for months or even years, bring it to the Lord because there is rest for the weary. To paraphrase <strong>Philippians 4:6-7,</strong> the scripture says that whatever we ask in his name through prayer and thanksgiving he can do it and provide peace that surpasses all understanding. If you desire to be free from the bondage brought by the past's gripping hold to, submit it to the Lord consistently, so that you can finally forgive and let go to receive the sweet release of peace in the Lord.

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 5:33, “Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.”</strong>

This was shared by one of my favorite pastors.

There is sometimes a tendency to prioritize our children to the neglect of our marriage. There are at least three reasons that make prioritizing our children over our marriage both foolish and dangerous:<!--more-->

<strong>1. Our children will eventually leave home. Prepare your marriage for the empty nest:</strong>
To my knowledge, I’ve never talked to a person who divorced after twenty-five or thirty years who didn’t say something like this: “<em>Once the kids were gone, we realized we really didn’t have much of a marriage.</em>” Building a marriage on the foundation of the preeminence of children is like building a house on a rented removable slab. You may have days or even years when you feel completely secure, but the day is coming when the lease will be up and the foundation upon which your home stands will be taken away. A family shepherd must not allow his family to fall into this trap.

<strong>2. Our marriage forms the cornerstone of our children’s security:</strong>
Ironically, those who prioritize their children above their marriage are not only jeopardizing their marriage, they’re actually depriving their children of the very thing they desire to provide them. The greatest source of security our children have in this world is a God-honoring, Christ-centered marriage between their parents. Putting the children first is like a police officer putting away his badge and gun in order to make the public feel more at ease. A family shepherd must put his marriage before his children in order to provide them with the security they both need and desire.

<strong>3. Putting your marriage first will actually prepare your children for marriage:</strong>

Prioritizing your children above your marriage is both foolish and dangerous because it sets a precedent that contradicts one of the greatest lessons you’ll ever teach your children—how to be good husbands and wives. We must first and foremost model a commitment to marriage. Failure to do this will communicate ideas that are contrary to what we believe—starting with the narcissism it tends to create in our children—including the pitfalls that may follow them into their marriage. For example, if we prioritize our children above our marriage, we teach our children that marriage exists for children. If this is the case, how will our children react to the early months or years of their marriage when there are no children? How will they respond if, God forbid, they should struggle with infertility? If the heart of marriage is “living for the kids,” these scenarios could be difficult at best.

Jesus our Savior—and our example of what a bridegroom truly is—laid down his life for his bride (<a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+5.25">Eph. 5:25</a>). He doesn’t neglect her for another. And it’s this relationship of our Savior to his bride that governs our understanding of our role as husbands and family shepherds. We must give ourselves to and for our wives. We must view them not only as ours but as us! As I often remind myself concerning my wife, “She’s not just mine; she’s me. She’s bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh (<a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Gen.+2.23">Gen. 2:23</a>); she’s my body (<a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+5.28%E2%80%9329">Eph. 5:28–29</a>), and I am her head (<a href="http://www.esvonline.org/1+Cor.%2011.3">1 Cor. 11:3</a>; <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+5.23">Eph. 5:23</a>). We are one (<a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+5.31">Eph. 5:31</a>; see also <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Gen.+2.24">Gen. 2:24</a>); and our union is a blessing to our children (<a href="http://www.esvonline.org/1+Cor.%207.14">1 Cor. 7:14</a>).”

As family shepherds, our primary mission is to love our wives as our own selves. We must not allow anything to interfere with this mission. Neither our careers nor our children can be allowed to keep us from our task of modeling for the world the beautiful, mysterious, one-flesh union of our Savior and his bride (<a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+5.33">Eph. 5:33</a>).

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 5:1-19, “But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, “Indeed, I said to myself, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.’”</strong>

Worthiness is having adequate or great merit, character, or value. Worthy people command great attention and respect. In this passage we meet worthy Naaman but by his own standards.

To understand who Naaman was, we look to<strong> 2Kings 5:1</strong> to get his resume, 1. He was commander of the army of the king of Syria, 2. He was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, and 3. He was also a mighty man of valor. He commanded attention because of who he was, however he had leprosy. Upon hearing that there was a prophet in Samaria who could heal him of his leprosy, he does not come humbly, no, he comes with great entourage for his healing service and a plan. <strong>Vs. 9, "Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and he stood at the door of Elisha’s house"</strong>. The worthy man as he thought came in style and others would recognize his position by his resume and surrounding.<!--more-->

What happened next would infuriate the worthy Namaan almost forfeiting what brought him to Samaria, vs. <strong>10, "And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and you shall be clean.”</strong> How dare Elisha dishonor Namaan by not showing up to meet with him but rather send a servant, a messenger and to add salt to the injury the servant brought degrading news that he should go and wash in the dirty river of Jordan. The instruction was for him to dip himself not once but 7 times in the presence of all those who had respect for his statue. Not even one of his servants was to do it on his behalf.

<strong>2Kings 5:1-19, “But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, “Indeed, I said to myself, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.’” </strong>Because Naaman considered himself worthy of the attention of the prophet for his healing, he indeed said to himself how he thought his healing would come about. He expected Elisha to treat him as a worthy man like the rest only to find that he needed to come as a beggar in need of a free gift, not as lord to demand or purchase it. Jesus said, <strong>“… whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted”, Matthew 23:12</strong>

Elisha did not need Naaman, Naaman needed Elisha. Here Elisha is the type of Christ who has the free gift but the seeker must come in Elisha/Jesus’ terms. The name Elisha means “God is salvation”

In the light of this story, we need to be reminded that the gospel is not how worthy man is, the gospel is how worthy Jesus is. The gospel is not how God needs man, the gospel is how man needs God. The gospel is not how in trouble God is for not having us, the gospel is how we are in trouble without God. “<em>The way by which a sinner is received and made holy, through the blood, and by the Spirit of Christ, through faith alone in his name, does not sufficiently humour or employ self, to please the sinner's heart</em>”, Matthew Henry.

A sinner must come because Christ is worthy and not because he is regardless what others think of him. He must come broken and humble in need of a Savior. While Naaman would have thought his success may have come by his hands, the bible says it was God who had made him successful and even his healing would have to be done by God, for God. That revelation would cause Naaman to humble himself.

The rest of the story, he humbled himself and did as he was instructed and in response, <strong>2Kings 5:17, “So Naaman said, “Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD</strong>”. He came in chariots and horses, he came with gold and expensive clothing however with the change, he took two mules (donkeys) considered humbled, what Christ rode upon. He took loads of earth as a reminder of how low and dirty he was to remind him of humility and vowed to serve the Lord in His terms.

You who is not saved and think you are worthy of attention, have you looked yourself in the light of Naaman’s story to see your sin of pride and arrogance hoping to come to the Lord in your term? You must humble yourself, see your sin in its true state, then Believe, and be saved; Repent, and be pardoned; Wash and be clean. Simple and direct to the point, you need Elisha (Jesus).

<a href="http://magnifyhisword.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/1-john-tag-cloud-1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2652" alt="1-john-Tag Cloud (1)" src="http://magnifyhisword.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/1-john-tag-cloud-1.jpg" width="300" height="196" data-originalSrc="http://joequatronejr.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/1-john-tag-cloud-1.jpg?w=300" data-rehosted="1"></a>Once we have experienced the exciting life in Christ that is real, we will want to share it with other people, just as the Apostle John wanted to “declare” it to all his readers in the first century.  Many people (including some Christians) have the idea that “witnessing” means wrangling over the differences in religious beliefs or sitting down and comparing churches.  That isn’t what John had in mind!  He tells us witnessing means sharing our spiritual experiences with others—both by the lives we live and by the words we speak.  As we read his <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1-5&amp;version=NIV">1<sup>st</sup> epistle</a>, we will discover John had in mind <i>five</i> purposes for sharing:

<b><i>That we may have fellowship (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A3&amp;version=NIV">v. 3</a>)</i>.</b>  This word <i>fellowship</i> is an important one in the vocabulary of a Christian.  It simply means “to have in common.”  As sinners, men have nothing in common with the holy God.  But God in His grace sent Jesus to have something in common with men.  Christ took on Himself a human body and became a man.  Then He went to the cross and took on the sins of the world (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A24&amp;version=NIV">1 Pt. 2:24</a>).  Because He paid the price for our sins, the way is open for God to forgive us and take us into His family.  When we trust Christ, we become “partakers of the divine nature” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A4&amp;version=NIV">2 Pt. 1:4</a>).  What a thrilling miracle!  Jesus Christ took on Himself the nature of man, so that by faith we may receive the very nature of God!

This is the first purpose John mentions for writing his letter—the sharing of his experience of eternal life.  The life that is <i>real</i> helps to solve the basic problem of loneliness, for Christians have genuine fellowship with God and with one another.  Jesus promised, “And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+28%3A20&amp;version=NIV">Mt. 28:20</a>).  In this letter, John explains the secret of fellowship with God and with other Christians.

<b><i>That we may have joy (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A4&amp;version=NIV">v. 4</a>)</i>.</b>  Fellowship is Christ’s answer to the loneliness of life.  Joy is His answer to the emptiness, the hollowness of life.  John, in his epistle, uses the word “joy” only once, but the idea of joy runs throughout the entire letter.  Joy is not something we manufacture for ourselves; joy is a wonderful by-product of our fellowship with God.  David knew the joy which John mentions; he said, “In Your presence is fullness of joy” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps.+16%3A11&amp;version=NIV">Ps. 16:11</a>).

For the most part, sin is the cause of the unhappiness that overwhelms our world today.  Sin promises joy, but it always produces sorrow.  The pleasures of sin are temporary—they are only for a season (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+11%3A25&amp;version=NIV">Heb. 11:25</a>), but God’s pleasures last eternally—they are forevermore.

The life that is real produces a joy that is real—not some limp substitute.  Jesus said, the night before He was crucified, “No man will take away your joy” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A22&amp;version=NIV">Jn. 16:22</a>).  “I have told you this so that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A11&amp;version=NIV">Jn. 15:11</a>).  In this letter, John is saying, “Faith in Jesus Christ gives you a joy that can never be duplicated by the world.  I have experienced this joy myself and I want to share it with you.”

<b><i>That we may not sin (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A1&amp;version=NIV">2:1</a>)</i>.</b>  John faces the problem of sin squarely (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A4%E2%80%939&amp;version=NIV">1 Jn. 3:4–9</a>) and announces the only answer to this enigma—the person and work of Jesus Christ, who not only died for us to pay the penalty of our sins, but rose from the dead in order to intercede for us at the throne of God: “I write this to you so that you will not sin.  But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A1&amp;version=NIV">1 Jn. 2:1</a>).

Christ is our Representative.  He defends us at the Father’s throne.  Satan may stand there as the accuser of the brethren (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zech.+3&amp;version=NIV">Zech. 3</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev.+12%3A10&amp;version=NIV">Rev. 12:10</a>), but Christ stands there as our Advocate—He pleads on our behalf!  Continuing forgiveness, in response to His intercession, is God’s answer to our sinfulness.

It isn’t <i>necessary</i> for Christians to sin.  As we walk in fellowship with God and in obedience to His Word, He gives us ability to resist and have victory over temptation.  The life that is real is a life of <i>victory</i>.  In this letter, John tells us how to draw on our divine resources to experience victory over temptation and sin.

<b><i>That we may not be deceived (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A26&amp;version=NIV">2:26</a>)</i>.</b>  More than ever, Christians today need the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, between truth and error.  The notion is widespread in our generation that there are no “absolutes”—that <i>nothing</i> is <i>always</i> wrong and <i>nothing</i> is <i>always</i> right.  False doctrines, therefore, are more prevalent than at any time in history—and most men and women seem to be willing to accept almost any teaching except the truths of the Bible.

John uses a word no other New Testament writer uses—“antichrist” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A18&amp;version=NIV">1 Jn. 2:18</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A22&amp;version=NIV">22</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A3&amp;version=NIV">4:3</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+John+7&amp;version=NIV">2 Jn. 1:7</a>).  That prefix <i>anti-</i> has two meanings: “against” and “instead of.”  There are in this world teachers of lies who are opposed to Christ and their method of “seducing” people is to use <i>lies</i>.  They offer a substitute Christ, a substitute salvation, and a substitute Bible.  They want to give you something <i>instead of</i> the real Word of God and real eternal life.

Christ is the Truth (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&amp;version=NIV">Jn. 14:6</a>); Satan is the liar (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A44&amp;version=NIV">Jn. 8:44</a>).  The devil leads people astray—not necessarily with gross sensual sins, but with half-truths and outright lies.  He began his career by seducing man in the Garden of Eden.  He asked Eve, “Has God really said?” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen+3%3A1&amp;version=NIV">Gen. 3:1</a>).  Even then, he did not appear to her in his true nature, but masqueraded as a beautiful creature (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Cor.+11%3A13%E2%80%9315&amp;version=NIV">2 Cor. 11:13–15</a>).

Satan today often spreads his lies even through religious groups!  Not every man standing in a pulpit is preaching the truth of the Word of God.  False preachers and false religious teachers have always been among the devil’s favorite and most effective tools.

How can Christians today detect Satan’s lies?  How can we identify false teachers?  How can we grow in our own knowledge of the truth, so we will not be victims of false doctrines?  John answers these questions: the life that is real is characterized by discernment.  The Holy Spirit, referred to by John as “the Anointing” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A27%29%2C+&amp;version=NIV">1 Jn. 2:27</a>), is Christ’s answer to our need for discernment.  The Spirit is our Teacher; it is He who enables us to detect truth and error and to remain (“abide”) in Christ.  He is our protection against ignorance, deception, and untruth.

<b><i>That we may know we are saved (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A13&amp;version=NIV">5:13</a>)</i>.</b>  I have already touched on this truth in <a href="http://joequatronejr.wordpress.com/category/doctrine/">past articles</a>, but it is so important that it bears repeating.  The life that is real is not built on the empty hopes—or wishes—based on human supposings.  It is built on assurance.  In fact, as we read John’s letter we encounter the word <i>know</i> more than thirty times.  No Christian, if he is asked whether or not he is going to heaven, needs to say “I <i>hope</i> so” or “I <i>think</i> so.”  He need have no doubt whatsoever.

The life that is real is such a free and exciting life because it is based on knowledge of solid <i>facts.</i>  “Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A32&amp;version=NIV">Jn. 8:32</a>), promised Jesus.  “We did not follow cleverly devised stories” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A16&amp;version=NIV">2 Pet. 1:16</a>), was the testimony of Jesus’ disciples.  These men, almost all of whom died for their faith, did not give their lives for a clever hoax of their own devising, as some critics of Christianity fatuously assert.  They <i>knew</i> what they had seen!  John is saying in his letter, “I want you to be <i>sure</i> you <i>have</i> eternal life.”

As we read this fascinating letter, we will discover John frequently repeats himself.  He weaves three themes in and out of these chapters: <i>obedience, love</i>, and <i>truth</i>.  In the first half of his letter, the apostle emphasizes <i>fellowship</i> and tells us the conditions for fellowship are: obedience (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A5%E2%80%932%3A6&amp;version=NIV">1 Jn. 1:5–2:6</a>), love (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A7%E2%80%9317&amp;version=NIV">1 Jn. 2:7–17</a>), and truth (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A18%E2%80%9329&amp;version=NIV">1 Jn. 2:18–29</a>).

Obedience—love—truth.  Why did John use these particular tests of fellowship and sonship?  For a very practical reason.  When God made us, He made us in His own image (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.+1%3A26%E2%80%9327&amp;version=NIV">Gen. 1:26–27</a>).  This means we have a personality patterned after God’s.  We have a <i>mind</i> to think with, a <i>heart</i> to feel with, and a <i>will</i> to make decisions.  We sometimes refer to these aspects of our personality as <i>intellect, emotion</i>, and <i>will</i>.  The life that is real <i>must involve all the elements of the personality</i>.

Most people are dissatisfied today because their total personality has never been controlled by something real and meaningful.  When a person is born of God through faith in Christ, God’s Spirit comes into his life to live there forever.  As he has fellowship with and is sanctified by God, the Holy Spirit is able to control his mind, heart, and will.  And what happens then?  A Spirit-controlled <i>mind</i> knows and understands <i>truth</i>.  A Spirit-controlled <i>heart</i> feels <i>love</i>.  A Spirit-controlled <i>will</i> inclines us to <i>obedience</i>.

John wants to impress this fact on us and that is why he uses a series of contrasts in his letter: truth vs. lies, love vs. hatred, and obedience vs. disobedience.  There is no middle ground in the Christian life.  We must be on one side or on the other.  This, then, is the life that is real.  It was revealed in Christ; it was experienced by those who trusted in Christ; and it can be shared today.

This life begins with <i>sonship</i> and continues in <i>fellowship</i>.  First we are born of God; then we walk (live) with God.  This means that there are two kinds of people who cannot enter into the joy and victory about which we are thinking: those who have never been born of God and those who, though saved, are out of fellowship with God.  It would be a wise thing for us to take inventory spiritually (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Cor.+13%3A5&amp;version=NIV">2 Cor. 13:5</a>) and see whether or not we qualify to enjoy the spiritual experience with which John’s letter deals.

If a true believer is out of fellowship with God, it is usually for one of three reasons: (1) he has disobeyed God’s will; (2) he is not getting along with fellow believers; (3) he believes a lie and therefore is living a lie.  Even a Christian can be mistaken in his understanding of truth.  That’s why John warns us, “Little children, do not let anyone lead you astray” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A7&amp;version=NIV">1 Jn. 3:7</a>).

These three reasons parallel John’s three important themes: obedience, love, and truth.  Once a believer discovers why he is out of fellowship with God, he should confess that sin (or those sins) to the Lord and claim His full forgiveness (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A9%E2%80%932%3A2&amp;version=NIV">1 Jn. 1:9–2:2</a>).  A believer can never have joyful fellowship with the Lord if sin stands between them.  God’s invitation to us today is, “Come and enjoy fellowship with Me and with each other!  Come and share the life that is real!”</div>";s:15:"images_mirrored";i:1;}]]></wp:meta_value>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Deuteronomy 1:37, "The Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying even you shall not go in there"</strong>

In<strong> Exodus 17:6</strong>, Moses is leading the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt to the promise land. He is leading a people who have not stopped complaining from day one even up to this every moment. Many times God wanted to kill the children of Israel because of their complains and murmuring but Moses kept on pleading with God. On this day in <strong>Exodus 17</strong>, the people had just complained as usual about something they were lacking. Already God had given them everything they cried for and this time they needed water. Instead of looking to God, they began to reflect on how they would have been satisfied in Egypt.<!--more-->

How possible it is that you can be heading to the promise land while Egypt could still be present in your life. Every time you face a tough situation, your first place to look to is Egypt, a place you come from. <strong>You can be out of Egypt but Egypt may not be out of you</strong>. Egypt represents the world God saved us from. A deliverer Moses (Christ) came to lead us out of bondage but in the process of being led, many people's eyes were still fixed on Egypt. <strong>Egypt was a land of less than enough, the wilderness was a land of just enough and God was bringing them to a land of more than enough</strong>. We have to reach at a place of not always operating in the land of just enough to which the provision is always by miracle to a land of more than enough, a land of blessings. I refuse to live by miracles everyday, yes the miracles are good for miracles are to get me from point A to point B but living under blessings is greater.

Therefore the people complained and God told Moses in <strong>Exodus 17:6, "Behold, I stand before thee there upon the rock of Horeb; and thou shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel" </strong>This is what the Lord chose for this time and that was for Moses to hit the rock for water to come out. Now let's look at another time the Lord wanted to provide water to the children of Israel in <strong>Numbers 20:8, "Take thy rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give thee forth water, and thou shall bring forth to them water out of the rock". </strong>Here we see in one instant Moses was asked to strike the rock and another instant he was asked to speak to the rock. God can do anything at any time using any means He chooses, He is God. Don’t expect Him to always move the same way He moved the first time, He is not limited to our thinking.

Amazing thing about the whole story with the children of Israel is every time they complained and God felt like wiping them out, Moses defended them. This time Moses was fed up with their cry, complains and murmur. He therefore took the word of the Lord and began to speak to the people in an anger. He disobeyed the Lord when he allowed his anger to drive him to strike the rock twice instead of speaking to it. <strong>Numbers 20:11, "And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice". </strong>Yes the Lord gave the children of Israel water though Moses disobeyed but Moses was left to suffer the consequences. <strong>Ephesians 4:26, says "Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath". </strong>It's very easy to get angry and do something you will regret. The enemy knows how to bring people your way who will try and push you to anger. Moses was on the verge of entering the promise land but because of his anger that led him to disobey God cost him the land he had waited to see in 40 years.

Be careful about how you deal with things under anger and frustrations for you could be killing what the Lord had been planning to do in your life from day one. As we have seen in the book of Ephesians, “<strong>be angry and sin not</strong>” is very true for the enemy will always look for ways to make you stumble and fall and as Moses tells us in <strong>Deuteronomy 1:37, "The Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying even you shall not go in there", </strong>people pushed him to the limit, don't allow people and situations push you to the limit for you could do something you will regret for a long time. Be cool, be still, calm yourself, don't fight fire with fire. <strong>Anger is one letter short for DANGER</strong>. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Corinthians 15:58, "Therefore my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord." </strong>

In 1938 Orson Wells showed America the great power of the media with his "War of the Worlds" broadcast. His announcement convinced multitudes that Aliens from Mars were attacking New York and New Jersey. His compelling broadcast had scores of people shaken. Harlem in NYC was one of those places that were severely shaken. "The parlor churches in the Negro district, congregations of the smaller sects meeting on the ground floors of brownstone houses, took the "news" in stride as less faithful parishioners rushed in with it, seeking spiritual consolation. Evening services became "end of the world" prayer meetings in some (New York Times, Oct. 31, 1938).<!--more-->

The Apostle Paul in <strong>1Corinthians 15:58</strong> writes too of what perhaps sounds like a "War of the Worlds" type of broadcast as he describes the rapture (the snatching up quickly) of the church at the sound of the trumpet. However God's Word is not a science fiction broadcast but a true account of what happened "In the beginning," and what will take place in the future. Therefore, as we, the Church wait for this Great Day, Paul doesn't instruct us to run around like lunatics with a big sign reading "The end is near" while we scream "Repent while you still have time." Paul rather gives sound down to earth applicable instruction of what the Body of Christ is to do as it waits for the return of Christ. He writes, "Therefore" hence because this is going to take place, "my beloved brethren" those that I love listen to me. Then he touches on three characteristics for believers to have in place as they actively wait for Christ's return as they are as follows:

1. <strong>Be steadfast</strong>. The Christian life is not a sprint but a marathon, as Solomon reminds us <strong>"The race is not to the swift... (Ecclesiastes 9:11)"</strong> As believers we need to embrace and exhibit a stick-to-itiveness spirit, an attitude of perseverance. The word quit should not be in the vocabulary of a Christian as it pertains to following the Lord. Paul said "<strong>However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me</strong>." Run the race and refuse to give up. When the going gets tough, and your spiritual leg muscles are weary wait on the Lord to renew your strength (<strong>Isaiah 40:31)"</strong> and <strong>"...be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus”, (2Timothy 2:1)</strong>

2. <strong>[Be] Unmovable. Be stable.</strong> This world is a very unstable place that can't ever seem to make up its mind. The Christian although living in the world is not of the world and therefore needs to show the world stability in Christ in their midst of the instability of this present world controlled by the god of this world (the devil).

3<strong>. [Be] Always abounding in the work of the Lord</strong>. What do you do for the Lord? Are you a Sunday Morning Christian only? Most Christians don't have the work of the Lord in their schedules because much of their work is for themselves or others. Paul employs that we abound in God's Work. Whose work are you abounding in? Are you as efficient for God as you are for your employer? When you exhibit these godly characteristics you do it for the service of the King and therefore <strong>"your labor is not in vain in the Lord"</strong> as you are spurred to serve the Lover of your soul.

Until the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 6:6-7,  “6 So the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there; and he made the iron float. 7 Therefore he said, “Pick it up for yourself.” So he reached out his hand and took it”</strong>

River Jordan though dirty is a learning ground for faith. The Jordan is where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the Son of God and Lamb of God. In biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several miracles, this was where the Israelites crossed dry land under Joshua (<strong>Joshua 3:15-17</strong>). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as "a witness" between them and the other tribes (<strong>Joshua 22:10, 22:26</strong>). The Jordan was crossed by Elijah and Elisha on dry ground (<strong>2Kings 2:8, 2:14</strong>). Elisha performed two other miracles at the Jordan: he healed Naaman by having him bathe in its waters, and he made the ax head of one of the "children of the prophets" float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water (<strong>2Kings 5:14; 6:6</strong>).<!--more-->

The mention of the river Jordan here is a reminder to us that it takes God to do the impossible for those who have faith. We ought to teach our young people not to lose sight of trust in God at all times<strong>. </strong>The sons of sons trusted God through Elisha. You even notice in <strong>2Kings 4:</strong>1<strong>, </strong>a certain widow who was a wife of one of the sons of the prophets seeking help from the God of Elisha, showing trust in God. And<strong> 2Kings 4:38-41</strong> when there was famine in the land, Elisha tells them to prepare a pot of stew. There was something wrong with the soup and they turned to Elisha. Each of the miracles, he used something available but the trust was not on what he used but in God. Jesus used a boy’s lunch to feed the multitude.

<strong>2kings 6:6, “So the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there; and he made the iron float The young man did not lose sight of where the ax head fell</strong>”. Let’s teach our young people to remember where they have failed, this is not to make them miserable but learning from those experiences and trusting God to bring them through. Elisha did not yell at him or even question him, all he did was ask where the ax head fell. And when he was shown, he did not start looking for the ax head in other words leaning on his own understanding or even asking others to look with him, he presented it to the Lord first doing his part “cutting off a stick”.

Let’s show our young people to cast their sticks (prayers) where the borrowed ax head has fallen. God takes delight in his people calling on him. What a joy to see a young person who has learnt the power of prayer and is not depending on the power of suggestions. Praying for small and big things, praying for knowledge, wisdom, purity, parents, unity, to be godly children, praying for their future careers, future spouses, etc knowing their trust is not in their parents but God and God uses the parents as one of the means to be a blessing to them.

When Elisha threw the stick, the iron did float. It’s not the stick that caused the iron to float and it’s not our prayers that cause things to happen, it’s the means by which God has chosen to hear His children while they recognize it’s His doing. Whosoever wills may call.

Elisha teaches us that sometimes the Lord would require something of us to accomplish what He has planned. He may require what is at our disposal. He has given us many things and while we use what is available, He will provide what is not available. “<strong>It’s not by might, nor by power but by the spirit of the Lord</strong>”. We are learning and teaching our young people that we are not depending on our own strength, that what we accomplish is not the source of our strength but the means by which God is at work in us. <strong>Philippians 2:13, “for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure”</strong>

Are your young people trusting in you for things or have you taught them to trust in the Lord demonstrating it in prayer? Do they look to you as the source or the means by which God provides for them. <strong>Proverbs 3:5-6, “5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; 6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths”, Psalm 118:8, “It is better to trust in the LORD, than to put confidence in man”, Psalm 20:7, “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God”, Psalm 46:1, “God <em>is</em> our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble”, Psalm 127: 1, “Unless the LORD builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, The watchman stays awake in vain”, </strong>what is the message to us and our young people? God can be trusted. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“The battle is the Lord’s” Yes, in life, there are many situations, where God Himself does the war for us . He fights for us….At times, we see that when people are working against us, God warns them even through dreams

<strong>RECONCILIATION</strong>- Classic example is of Laban, the father in law of Jacob ,who was heading to harm Jacob but was warned in a dream …Jacob was running away with fear and agony from his father –in –law along with his wives, children and the acquired property since he was being ill-treated. Genesis<strong> 31:24 “Then God came to Laban , the Aramaean, in a dream at night and said to him “BE CAREFUL not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad”</strong> <!--more-->We can imagine ourselves in this situation –very tensed , but God Himself intervening and warning our enemy, how marvelous it is. Yes, if we recede from fighting but allow God to do the same for us, we can see God planning and moving greatly … Usually, though we all know the verse well that the battle is the Lord’s , we take turn and try to fight it out ..But the plan may not be right and so is the timing and the approach. It may not even suit the situation correctly … If we rely on God to fight for us, we can see the results …Since Laban was warned he did not dare to do any harm to Jacob , though he was very angry. Laban mentions to Jacob in<strong> Gen 31:29 “I have the power to harm you</strong>”. Yes, though he had power and was heading to harm him, God fought the battle and finally safeguarded Jacob and everything he had….

<strong>SETTLEMENT</strong>- We see Mary, who was only a virgin and betrothed to Joseph, to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Joseph was shocked to hear about this, since they had not yet come together. Since he was a righteous man, he did not want to expose her to public disgrace. So he had in mind to divorce her quietly. ..But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said<strong>” Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name ‘Jesus’ because he will save his people from their sins</strong>”, <strong>Mathew 1 :19</strong> So he took home Mary as his wife .We can imagine the situation of Mary. She never requested someone to pacify Joseph or convince him or speak to him by herself and what not. There were so many ways for Mary to fight the life’s real battle…She completely depended on the Almighty for every minute details happening in her life …. God was mindful of the humble state of His servant and set right, this marriage, rather home ...Yes, God is capable of settling our lives, no matter how many fears /doubts arise. If we trust the Lord for our battle, we can be rest assured.

<strong>TESTIMONY</strong>-Another instance where God speaks to the wife of a person in authority........ Pilate was seated a judge and when he was about to pronounce judgment on Jesus, his wife sent for him this message<strong> “Do not have anything to do with that INNOCENT man for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him “.</strong>Yes , when Jesus was facing opposition from all sides –all the people in the area were shouting against Jesus, but this testimony gave comfort to our Lord…May be if any other person would have conveyed this message, he would not have considered. But it was his dear wife. So God gave him an opportunity to realize the greatness of Jesus before he could decide whether to release Jesus or Barabbas.

<strong>GUIDANCE</strong>-Peter saw heaven opened ,while he fell into a trance, and also saw something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. It contained all kinds of four footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. Then God corrected Peter in his thoughts saying “<strong>Do not call anything impure that God has made clean</strong>” Yes, he was guided to go to Cornelius, where he along with his friends and relatives assembled. The Holy Spirit had been poured out on all of them.

A dream may look simple but if God could use it to convey His message, He can do anything for His people. Even when the king himself forgot the dream he had, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Yes, the God had used a dream as a means to warn Laban while heading to harm Jacob and to reconcile them, to show Joseph the factual situation and build the home, which was going to be shattered, to inform Pilate that Jesus was Lord and totally innocent/blameless/pure, to correct Peter so that he should go to the Gentiles to preach the goodness, to exalt Daniel before the king and his entire kingdom.

So we need worry for any situation because He can warn our enemies in face of danger and safeguard us, he can fabricate /put together broken homes, He can prove a person innocent, when the entire world is against the same and He can also correct us so that we may be used for His higher purposes. What a mighty God we serve ! Praise Him that He is the same yesterday, today and forever. We are all privileged to be children of this great and awesome God! By Sarah Susan]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 11:10-11, "10 But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him." 11 These things He said, and after that He said to them, "Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up."</strong>

The Lord Jesus is with his disciples one day and someone comes to Jesus and tells Him that a good friend (Lazarus) was sick. Jesus goes to Bethany and while in route, Lazarus dies. This death so moved Jesus that He cried. God then manifested His ultimate power by restoring Lazarus to life. Through this awesome miracle, many people came to believe in Jesus.<!--more-->

God's overall intent for humanity is to have life and to enjoy it. When considering the abundance of natural and spiritual gifts He has bestowed upon us to achieve this end, we can do nothing but marvel in the excellence of His work as our hearts are filled with such transcendent joy that we can barely comprehend the full heights of His splendor. Everything God does, has done, and will do involves the furtherance of His desire that we have, enjoy, and preserve life. I want you to consider this point. Think about the commandments of God. The only things that God has forbidden are those things that will cut our lives short! Think about it. I challenge you to name a single thing that God has forbidden that does humanity any good. God only wants us to walk in the beauty of creation experiencing life without insulting His majesty by reducing our dignity through base living.

The chief priests who represented the established church of the day harassed the Lord at every opportunity despite overwhelming evidence signaling His Identity. We are not told why Lazarus was sick, but it was clear that even the last effect of sin and the ultimate condition of man was eclipsed by the love of God, which brought life. The established church witnessed God's great work and shortly decided that they would KILL Lazarus.

Imagine that. The Lord Jesus raises a man from the dead and because the chief priests were so fixated on limiting Jesus' actions and preventing Him from expelling the death that resulted from the law that the chief priests decided to assassinate Jesus and flat-out MURDER Lazarus. They wanted to kill Life itself- the Source of Life, and all things that Life impacted.

Much can be said about all of this. I want us to remember that the mission of Christ's church is to champion life and remember to value people over systems, rules, laws, and religions- all of which create and maintain death. Beloved, our agenda in this society encompasses more and is broader than our struggle against abortion. Jesus has the ability to remedy every irritant that impacts humanity and is presently restoring life and setting at liberty everything that encounters His Presence and embraces His Word. Whenever people were in danger, Jesus did not miss a single opportunity to suspend the mechanism that empowered death in order to allow life to prevail. Let us go into the world with the same mission. Our message? Receiving the gospel brings spiritual life and obeying the gospel causes natural life to take on new dimensions that will ultimately bring about the fulfillment that we all seek, as our will is conformed to His!

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 1:1-18, “15 But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord. 16 “Do not consider your maidservant a wicked woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken until now.”</strong>

To be misunderstood can be very frustrating. For people to read into things and arrive to conclusions can also be deadly because it’s like a doctor who looks at certain symptoms and prescribes medicine without thorough examination first. Wrong diagnosis leads to wrong medication, wrong medication can lead to catastrophic results.<!--more-->

And here we find Hannah who was misunderstood by her rival Peninnah, Husband Elkanah and Eli the priest (her pastor). While Peninnah was jealous of her for receiving double portion of offering, there was great longing in Hannah’s heart that was way bigger than what she was given. Peninnah misunderstood her intentions and therefore made her life miserable. On the other hand, her husband did not seem to understand the longing of her heart when he believed he gave her everything. Yes he loved her more than Penninah even when she was barren, and yes he gave her double offering, yet he could not meet the very hunger of her heart he knew about. Then we meet Eli the priest (her pastor) who could not understand how a woman with a lovely husband would come to the temple each year when she was not required to and look like she was drunk, vs. “<strong>13 Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. 14 So Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!””. </strong>He thought she was drunk and advised her to put away her wine. Eli the priest could not tell the difference between someone who was in agony and someone who was drunk. Can you imagine the thoughts in Hannah’s heart? “<em>no one seems to understand me”.</em>

In the midst of no one understanding, she poured her heart to the Lord who she knew would understand. Only God could diagnose her situation and prescribe the right medication to her dilemma. And the comforting words she received<strong>, vs. 17, Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him</strong>.” And her reaction, <strong>vs. “18 And she said, “Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad”. </strong>

Here is a specimen of the intense desire that reigned in the bosoms of the Hebrew women for children. This was the burden of Hannah's prayer; and the strong preference she expressed for a male child originated in her purpose of dedicating him to the tabernacle service to God. It was a God given burden generated through different circumstances to reveal God’s providence through means that were heart breaking and did not make sense. All these three people pushed her forward to reach the One who knew her dilemma, and more than that had the capability of making it a reality. <strong>Psalm 94:19, </strong>reads<strong> “In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul.</strong>”, why, because God knows you and understands you. He understands what you are saying even before you say them. Let that be your delight, let that be your joy and let that be a reason to call on Him at all times. Hannah knew where to go, how about you?, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 9:23-24- The He said to them all,” If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up is cross daily and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.</strong>

I would like to talk to you this morning about the life of a disciple of Jesus, the true disciple, no longer self seeking, but surrendering their will to the Father, even as Jesus did. Today’s message is very different, so I feel it pertinent to share on this topic the best I can, may God bless His word today. False teachers have crept in unawares, who have corrupted the way of truth. You see them at the bookstores, smiling from the covers. Names like Osteen, Meyer, Dollar, and Hinn have profited from a message that is leading many away from the cross to seek their own comfort and prosperity, ultimately they are being led away from Jesus.<!--more-->

The message Jesus gives us is very different here in Luke’s gospel. If anyone desires to come, He says, let him deny himself. Desires here means they have chosen, they have determined this to be truth. The individual is presented with options, to come or not, and they, upon consideration, have chosen to follow the path that leads to life, knowing the other path, the one of self-comfort and ease, leads to death. Now they must deny themselves, meaning to renounce(to give up, to reject) oneself fully in all respects, to die daily as Paul says to their own desires and ambitions, to all worldliness, to all distractions. They take up their cross daily, and follow after Jesus. A.W. Tozer used to say <strong>you knew one thing about a man with a cross, he wasn’t coming back</strong>. He was going to die. This is what Jesus is saying to us. When I decide to follow Him, it is not so I can benefit from Jesus, as if He owes me something. Christ has saved me, now my life belongs to Him. I take up my cross and go to my death, out of my love for Him. I seek to live as Christ lived, not seeking my own will, but the will of the Father.

Don’t listen to the other voices, if what they say is leading you away from the cross, stop right where you are, repent, and give your life wholly to the Lord Jesus. For Jesus says, whoever desires to save(to protect, preserve) his life will lose it, but whoever loses(to put out of the way, to destroy) his life will save it. What a paradox, and a tremendous contradiction to the popular pulpit of our day. The very thing they are desiring to save, they are going to lose. Where are we today? Are we desiring to save our lives for ourselves? Don’t be fooled friends by what you are hearing. Look at Jesus, learn from Him, He is the way, truth, and life, look to Him, desire Him above all else. Blessed, Jesus says, are those who <strong>hunger and thirst for righteousness</strong>, for holiness, for a life entirely devoted to Jesus, surrendered completely to Him, out of a love for Jesus that burns within their heart. He is the true treasure, He alone is life. Are you beaten down today? Abandon yourself to the Lord, be satisfied in Him. Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in His wonderful face, and the things of Earth will grow dim. If you would like, please share any responses you might have.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Isaiah 40:31, "But those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint."</strong>

Life's problems can be difficult for some Christians. We believe that because we are Christians that no bad thing can happen to us. When unpleasant things do happen to us - they can challenge our faith. We forget that God has not promised to keep us away from harm, but God has promised to keep us through harm. This lesson is hardest for those of us who are still just barely starting out on our Christian journey – or those of us who are restarting our Christian journey for the thousandth time.<!--more-->

Does this scenario sound familiar? You start going to church regularly again. Then you start reading the Bible and taking time to pray. You notice a change. You can feel God working in your life. Encouraged, you start working hard at listening for God's voice and giving up your old self-destructive habits. At first the results are amazing. God's voice is clear and God's blessings are abundant. You are certain that you are walking on the road that God has chosen for you.

Then you hit a snag. The road that you were so sure of takes an unexpected turn. If you are following God, isn't God supposed to take care of you? You feel abandoned by God. You feel betrayed - the safe road that you were on is now gone. You don't understand that God is still standing right beside you and that you are still on the road on which you are supposed to be.

This part of our faith journey can be like standing at the edge of a cliff beside a wide, bottomless canyon. Somehow you know that far away on the cliff on the other side of the canyon is the path where you are supposed to be. But how are you supposed to get all the way over there? When you look behind you, you see an easy path going back down the cliff. This is the path back to your old habits, back to your old life. What do you do?

When we reach this point we can become so discouraged that many of us give up and go back down the path we know. We stop going to church and reading the Bible and listening for God's voice. We never get to see the other side of the canyon. The next time that you get to this point remind yourself that the edge of a cliff is the perfect place to learn to let the Spirit carry you. Don't forget that God has given you wings. Blessings Pastor Kerry Nelson]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 10:41–42</strong>, <strong>“41 Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. 42 But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.” </strong>

Perhaps you’ve heard the old adage, <em>“if the devil can’t make you bad, he’ll make you busy.” </em>I talk to many people that profess that Jesus is their Lord and Savior, yet many of these same folks don’t seem to have or better yet make time to spend with Jesus? Many people have jobs, families, hobbies, school, homes, and a plethora of responsibilities, so since God knows our heart, He should understand right?<!--more-->

Jesus came to visit the sisters of Lazarus in their home one day and in the midst of his visit this whole issue of busyness, and serving Jesus rose to the forefront of His visitation. Jesus enters the home of the sisters and upon doing so each one responded to Jesus in a particular manner. Martha began to become cumbered (distracted) with much serving, and proceeded to question Jesus saying, “<strong>Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?</strong>” It seemed that the conversation centered on the value of sitting which is how Mary chose to respond to Jesus’ visit as opposed to serving, which is how Martha reacts to Christ’s arrival. Martha, seemingly feeling that she chose the better and perhaps more reverend option attempts to force Jesus’ hand by requesting that He tell Mary to join her and serve Jesus alongside her. Perhaps if Mary would serve the foods, sweep the floor, or perform any helpful task, this would lighten Martha’s work load and therefore, help the work move along more quickly.

There is in fact always enough time to accomplish our God given tasks, and also to spend time with God Himself if one seeks first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness (<strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>). We must have Kingdom priorities, God’s Kingdom must come, our kingdom must go. In prayer, the Twelve were instructed to pray, “<strong>Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done</strong>.” In the Ten Commandments, God wrote, <strong>“I Am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,out of the house ofbondage. “You shall have no other gods before Me</strong>.” When asked by a scribe which was the greatest Commandment, Jesus responded by saying, <strong>“29 Thefirst of all the commandmentsis:‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. 30 And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength</strong>.’ Thisis the first commandment (<strong>Mark 12:30</strong>).”

Mary to have kept these things in mind in prioritizing the things of God, showing Jesus Himself in this case amidst her choice to be with Jesus instead of doing chores for Jesus. Jesus didn’t repel Martha away, but rather attempted to use the scenario to show Martha that when Christ is present both made a decision as to how they would respond to Jesus’ presence in their home. Jesus said that “<strong>Mary chose the better decision sitting at his feet rather than Martha who served at His side”, (Luke 10:41-42).</strong> In the area of servant hood, a true servant does the will of the one that is being served. Hence servant hood must be on Christ’s terms and not ours. Let me illustrate. A father desires his child to clean his or her room, yet instead of doing the will of the father the child washes the dishes and takes out the garbage. Are you serving Jesus at this time on your terms, or His? To be continued, blessings Phil the Evangelist]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Daniel 1:8, "But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself"</strong>

We live in a world that tells us to serve the society that we live in. It’s been said that the world is discipling the church rather than the church going into all the world and making disciples.

In the book of Daniel, we are introduced to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah which are Hebrew young men exiled into idolatrous nation of Babylon which served false gods. These four Hebrew boys would have to find a way to serve God in a culture, among a people that did not normally serve Him.<!--more-->

Daniel 1 informs us that these four were “<strong>Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.”</strong> Daniel’s heart was set on serving God. It is interesting that Daniel equated himself as a servant of the king as long as it did not clash with His servant hood of God. “<strong>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself”, (1:8).</strong> Daniel chose to serve His God even when it was not comfortable him, because it was not about the servant, but about the One in whom Daniel served. Serving God led Daniel to the lion’s den, and led Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah to the fiery furnace. Many seem to feel that when one serves God, life will be smooth because God is pleased not the case of these men.

Among Daniel and his friends, the king would soon recognize the resolve of God’s servants as they serve Him faithfully, despite the consequences, even in the face of death. When a decree was made by the king, and Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah refused to worship the statue of the king, they “<strong>16 answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar,we have no need to answer you in this matter.17 If that is the case<em>,</em> ourGod whom we serve is able todeliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver<em>us</em> from your hand, O king. 18 Butif not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will weworship the gold image which you have set up.”</strong> Wow, what a resolve! They are ultimately thrown into the furnace and, “<strong>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire</strong>.” When serving the Lord we learn from their lives the following:

First God is able to bring deliverance in our most seemingly horrific of circumstances. Secondly, we must believe God, for it is in Him that we must put our trust. We may have no idea how God could deliver us from what looks like doom from our perspective, but we must not forget we serve an all-powerful God! Thirdly, we must speak to the ungodly about the deliverance of God, and our resolve in Him. We are to proclaim that no matter what, we will not bow down to cultural expectations that violate the Word of God, even when our stance will be seen by the majority as an unpopular decision. We don’t serve God to be popular with man, but to be obedient to our Lord! Fourthly, we must stay together through the trials; we really do need one another. The Hebrew boys faced the trial together, and through it together. What a great story they lived, that we now read about. Who knows our stories, read our stories, and watch our stories? Fifthly, will the ungodly recognize that we are servants of the Lord by the stands that we take in various circumstances? Will we truly refuse ungodly rules that violate God’s Word, despite the consequence! It’s easy to serve God until you are challenged by law, pressure, etc…, to violate your professed service to God. Your faith must stand trial, and when it does, whose servant will you look like, as there are only two choices. Meditate on these things, and examine if you are a servant of the Most High God.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Daniel 6:10</strong> , “<strong>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem,he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime</strong>.

<strong>Serving the Lord on His terms (According to Daniel 6)</strong>

And then there is the famous story of Daniel and the Lion’s Den. Here is what the Scriptures tell us what led Daniel to a lion’s den. <!--more--><strong>“3 Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. 4 At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. 5 Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Danielunless it has something to do with the law of his God.</strong>” Daniel’s enemies began to plot against him, manipulating the king to sign a decree stating <strong>“that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions</strong>”. This jealous plot was not unlike the effort against Daniel’s 3 friends in <strong>3:8</strong>. However Daniel was past 80 years of age at this time, yet he was still on his knees thanking God and asking for His guidance and help. A servant of Jesus seeks the Lord, communes with Him, learns from Him, and obeys Him. How can one do the will of the Lord, without seeking Him? Daniel would not allow the death sentence (being thrown in a lion’s den) deter his prayer life. <strong>Daniel 6:10</strong> reads, “<strong>Now when Danielknew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem,he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime</strong>. Notice the following:

First, he knew the writing was signed, showing he was unashamed (Rom 1:16, and steadfast (1 Cor. 15:58). Second, he opened the windows, he was bold and humble as he cried out to the Lord (2 Chron. 2:14). Thirdly, he kneelt three times a day, he was persistent in his prayer life (Luke 18), he gave thanks among the heathen (Psalm 18:49) knowing the consequence could surly be death by a lion’s den. Fourthly, he prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did AFORETIME (this was a regular practice for Daniel). Do any of these characteristics describe you? I’m sure if you are living in a free nation, and your life is not on the line (not having the fear of receiving the death sentence as the persecuted church around the world faces). If death is not a deterrent from you having a prayer life then what is your reason for staying away from the prayer closet? Is it sleep, friendships, work, household responsibilities, laziness, etc…? Now ask yourself, does even one of these compare to facing death? Do you serve Jesus on your terms or his, by examining your prayer life? Are you consistent in prayer, are you bold in your witness, do you thank the Lord? When Daniel was placed into the lion’s den, the unbelieving king , <strong>“…arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions. 20 And when he came to the den, he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel… “Daniel, servant of the living God,has your God,whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”</strong> Daniel was known by the ungodly for being a servant of God. Is this your testimony among the unsaved? How do you know one way or the other?

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Timothy 2:3–4 , “3 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of<em> this</em> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier</strong>.”

<strong>Servant of the Commander’s will</strong>
What types of events or activities do people train or practice for? I have had to train for sports, competitions, tournaments in order to prepare myself to compete against my opponents. How would our spiritual life change if we took our approach to practicing for sport or musical instrument and applied it to being trained in our faith?<!--more-->

<strong>Hebrews 5:14</strong> reads, “<strong>But solid food is for the mature</strong>—for those whose senses have been trained to distinguish between good and evil. The writer mentions for those whose senses have been <strong>trained</strong> to do something, and that something is to distinguish between good and evil. Each of us have came out of the world into faith in Christ Jesus if we are Christians, and we knew evil well, we loved it, we drank iniquity like water, we were dead in our sins and transgressions. After we were changed we began to see a great difference between good and evil, but yet there are still things that perhaps we still hold to things that the Scriptures consider evil. Do you gossip (1 Tim 5:13), are you a glutton (Proverbs 28:7)? Paul writes (<strong>Ephesians 5:3-7),</strong> “<strong>But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints; 4 neither filthiness, nor Foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 7 Therefore do not be partakers with them</strong>.” The metaphor of the Christian life as warfare (against the evil world system, the believer’s sinful human nature, and Satan) is a familiar one in the NT (cf. <strong>2 Cor. 10:3–5; Eph. 6:10–20; 1 Thess. 4:8; 1 Tim. 1:18; 4:7; 6:12</strong>). Here Paul is dealing with the conflict against the hostile world and the persecution which believers were facing (cf. v. 9; 1:8; 3:11,12; 4:7).

If you desire to serve God as your commander, then you as a good solider you will heed His leadership, His word, as He strengthens you in Christ Jesus. Yet he calls you not to take part in the affairs of this life (the evil things previously mentioned). For example, when one is gossiping at the office do you engage or disengage in the gossip, or perhaps share that you would rather not be a part of the conversion? When you are invited to a movie that blasphemes God’s name, is filled with smut and vulgarity do you accept the invitation or reject it? John MacArthur shares, “<em>A military soldier doesn’t </em><strong><em>entangle himself, </em></strong><em>because his call to duty is completely severed from the normal affairs of civilian life, so also must the good soldier of Jesus Christ refuse to allow the things of the world to distract him (cf. <b>James 4:4; 1 John 2:15–17</b>)</em> (<em>The MacArthur Study Bible)</em>.

We pull away from the things that we used to do, and replace those things with godly living, for this purpose, <strong>“[that] he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier</strong>.” Recall the account of King David’s men. “<strong>David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!" So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD. "Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!" he said. "Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?" And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men. (2Sam 23:15-17)</strong>

David was the King that had a desire, water. He didn’t give a command, he didn’t make his request part of his men’s job description, and he didn’t have an expectation that these three men should take up the task of his “craving” for water from Bethlehem. King David was in the line of Jesus Christ as reads in <b>Matt 1:1</b> “<em>A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham</em>:”

<strong>Three mighty men</strong> out of loyalty to David went well beyond “the call of duty.” They were brave and courageous with only three of them breaking through the host of the Philistine army after their twelve mile journey to get there. These men had to break through enemy lines, the Philistine garrison (outpost) in Bethlehem, retrieved the water, and brought it back to David. These men were not commissioned to do this task. They sacrificed their very lives not to gain clout or merit, not to be in the Israeli hall of fame, and not even advance the victory for their army. No these men had one thing on their minds, to bring some water to their king! Why, because this is what would please the King. With loyalty and honor they risked their lives, “counting their lives worth nothing,” just to please the King to which they longed to do, even putting themselves in “death’s way,”. <strong>Haggai 1:8</strong> reads, “<strong>Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,"says the LORD”. God is our King and desires me to please Him! Are you serving God on His terms, with the motive to please him who has called you? Make Psalm 139:23-24 your prayer this week and always, as you serve him as your highest duty, on His terms for His pleasure.</strong>
<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Phil the Evangelist, </strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Joshua 24:14-15,”14“Now therefore,fear the Lord, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt.Serve the Lord!15 And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord,choose for yourselves this day whom you willserve, whetherthe gods which your fathers served thatwere on the other side ofthe River, orthe gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. Butas for me and my house, we willserve the Lord”</strong>

<strong>Serving Jesus with your talents.</strong><!--more-->

There are so many gifted people in the world in respect to sports, the arts, philosophy, science, theology, construction, etc…. It is interesting that many that began to use their gifts in the church, at some point used it as a stepping stone to use their gifts toward the world. For example, I believe that Pop singer Britney Spears was raised in the Southern Baptist Convention, and began using her voice to sing in church. However, when one looks at her life now, the talent that God gave her has not been one that it used for the Kingdom of God, but rather for the Kingdom of Darkness. There are a number of people that have done the same thing. Why is that? Perhaps it is because there is certainly more fame and fortune outside the church, than inside. However, I would submit in light of this, it depends on who one looking to serve. Everyone serves either God or Satan (although one does not need to be a Satan worshipper to serve Satan).

Recall the challenge of Joshua who turned to the people and challenged them to make a decision as read in the following: <strong> Joshua 24:14-15,”14“Now therefore,fear the Lord, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt.Serve the Lord!15 And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord,choose for yourselves this day whom you willserve, whetherthe gods which your fathers served thatwere on the other side ofthe River, orthe gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. Butas for me and my house, we willserve the Lord” </strong>Joshua was willing to challenge people in his influence to make a decision as to who they would serve.

Once one decides to serve the Lord, one must serve Him in a manner that pleases Him, as I have shared earlier in these series. Jesus tells the parables of the talents in <strong>Matthew 25 </strong>saying, “<strong>Forthe kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country,who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them.15 And toone he gave five talents, toanother two, and toanother one,to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey.”</strong> Notice that the servants were called by the master, and it seemed that the master was the one that knew the abilities of his servants. Then he decided that the talents were to be distributed each ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ABILITY! Each one had different abilities, and the amount of talents was given in light of the responsibility that the master placed on the servant according to their own ability. Upon the return of the master, he would pronounce his approval or disapproval of each servant.

The first and second servant, who received five talents and ten talents, pleased the master and doubled their talents. The Lord said, “<strong>Welldone, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things,I will make you ruler over many things. Enter intothe joy of your lord.”</strong> These received the joy of the lord. The servant that received one talent, however didn’t please the master<strong>. “24“Then he who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Look, there you have what is yours.’26“But his lord answered and said to him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed. 27 So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents. 29‘For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”</strong>

Weeping and gnashing of teeth which are terms that describe Hell, or enter into the joy of the Lord which is a term that describes heaven. Now this does not mean that one can work one’s way into heaven, because one is saved by grace, and this not of oneself (<strong>Ephesians 2:8,9</strong>), but one will show one’s faith by how one lives, and also what one does with the talents that Jesus has given them. Even the wicked are given talents by God, but only those that invest themselves in the Kingdom of God will be rewarded by God. One day at the Judgment (Bema) Seat of Christ each believer will be judged on various things including how one used their talents to serve God. Servants of Jesus desire to bring Him joy, because in the presence of the Lord is fullness of Joy, and the joy of the Lord is one’s strength. In the parable, the talents, are actually money.

Do you serve the Lord with your finances and your abilities as well? Are the gifts that God has gifted you with for your glory or for His? Think about your talents, how are they utilized, how do they operate in service to the King?
<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Phil </strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 22:6, “Train up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not depart from it”</strong>

This is one of those scriptures I struggled to understand having observed what happens in homes including ours. One thing that bothered me was seeing children from even Christian homes go astray, walk away from God and go their way. They were raised going to church, in the word, parents prayed for them and this is what they turned out to become?<!--more-->

How is this verse then applicable when it suggests that if you train the child the way he should go, HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM THE TEACHING? Already it appears they are departing according to these statistics “<strong>88% of children raised in evangelical homes leave church at the age of 18 never to return</strong>.” That is an alarming rate. Having studied this verse, the Lord would have me understand it this way, “<em>train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, however hard he may try to run away from the teaching, it will always be present with him, he cannot depart from it</em>”. Whatever he was taught or observed at home will not depart from him. That is why it’s important that children be invested in. As a parent, you don’t want to suffer the heartache of your children rebelling against their Christian upbringing. While only God can save us and keep us, there are biblical principles you can implement to help prevent your children from tragically falling away from the faith even in their later years in life.

I remember my dad setting the best example for his children and so was mom. I learn more by observing and many of his teachings in my life came from observing his Christian walk. My dad was (is) a prayer warrior, who conquered more devils in his family on his knees. To raise up a big family sometimes making tough decisions had to be done on his knees (praying). I listened to him many times praying for our future (my siblings and I); to be used of God one day, to have godly blessed relationships, to make intelligent decisions, to be successful etc. I learnt what it meant to be in a good respectable relationship by watching him treat his wife (my mom). What I’m I saying, even in my teenage life where the urge to rebel was beginning to creep in, their teachings, their life style could not depart from me. This is why it’s important that parents live an example of grace before their children through worship, reading of the word, praying, relating to each other (husband and wife), and how you train your children. It’s sad when spouses fight before their children, disrespecting each other before their kids. Do everything with dignity, set an example to your children. At times it’s good to show tough love, it may not be popular at the time you are giving it but it will be appreciated later in life. Seeing dads become more responsible at home sets an example to the boys, its key, it’s vital. Who better teach them what it means to work hard, be responsible, have character and integrity than the parents?

I believe this could be a reason to have brought home the prodigal son in <strong>Luke 15:17-19, “17 “But when he came to himself, …! 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, 19 and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants”. </strong>I don’t think only the food and the good life at home would have driven him to go back. Love, support, the teachings he had received would bring him back home. Yes he tried to run away from them all, but they would not. The earlier teachings brought him to himself to revisit how he was raised and how he turned everything into a mess. This brought about the heart of repentance and willing to go back home because regardless of where he had been, and who would not receive him, he knew he had a father who loved him and would be willing to receive him. How did he know, he had learnt it years back. It is a tough job but you and I have a responsibility to train and therefore it starts with us. We cannot teach what we don’t know and are not willing to live. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 8:22-26, “22 Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him. 23 So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything. 24 And he looked up and said, “I see men like trees, walking.” 25 Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly</strong>

It’s a scary thing to have the blind leading where a pair of eyes is needed to lead. If you knew of a pilot who was about to fly a plane and you discovered he was blind or a driver of a car, you would be very hesitant to board that plane or get into that car. There is something special about the eyes none of us would want to take for granted. Over 570 times, the word eye(s) has been referenced in the bible.<!--more-->

The definition of eyes in a dictionary is that its is an organ of vision. It’s the window to our souls. Two things I find fascinating, is that the brain that can never be full (out of memory) and the eyes can never be considered to have seen enough so as not to receive anymore.

We now come to Mark where Jesus meets this blind man brought to Him. If you read Mark’s writing, he is fond of using the word “immediately”. In other words, every miracle Jesus did, you hear Mark saying immediately something happened. And here we see the only gradual miracle done by the Lord I’ve come across to demonstrate something.

First He leads the man by the hand out of the town away from people of unbelief. The most important in my judgment as I read this passage, He wanted alone time with this man plus only those who believed Him, (His disciples). Then He does something we would consider unusual, spat in the man’s eyes then touched it. Then Jesus asks him if he sees anything, his reply, “I see men like trees”, then He touched his eyes again and he was restored.

Christ showed in what method those commonly are healed by His grace, which by nature are spiritually blind. At first, their knowledge is confused; but, like the light of the morning, it shines more and more to the perfect day, and then they see all things clearly.

I see Five things that are related to this blind man’s eyes being opened. 1. The leading of the Master 2. The demonstration of God’s power to make His name great among people, 3. To cause a man who had heard of Him but never had the privilege of seeing Him see Him 4. To bring about a point that its Christ gradually opens the eyes of those seeking Him to see clearly what they could not see on their own, 5. To meet a physical need of one who needed it and believed that only one could make it happen.

John Gill, “<em>Christ's taking the blind man by the hand, and leading him out or the town, and spitting on his eyes, and putting his hands upon him, and then asking him if he saw ought, are emblematical of what he does in spiritual conversion, when he turns men from darkness to light: he takes them by the hand, which expresses his condescension, grace, and mercy, and becomes their guide and leader; and a better, and safer guide they cannot have; he brings them by a way they know not, and leads them in paths they had not known before; makes darkness light before them, and crooked things straight, and does not forsake them: he takes them apart, and separates them from the rest of the world; he calls them out from thence to go with him, teaching them, that, when enlightened by him, they should have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, and the workers of them; for what communion has light with darkness? his putting spittle upon his eyes, may signify the means of grace, the eye salve of the word, which, when attended with a divine power, enlightens the eyes; and which power may be represented here by Christ's putting his hands upon the man; for the Gospel, without the power of Christ, Is insufficient to produce such an effect; but when it is accompanied with that, it always succeeds</em>”, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Judges 6:11-27, "12 And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, “The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor!” 13 Gideon said to Him, “O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, ‘Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image1.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-6414 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image1.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="221" /></a> </strong>

Meditating on encouragements has opened my heart and mind to many men and women in the bible who encountered discouragements in the lives. These were normal people and their true stories are encouragement to us too that if they overcame their discouraging times, we too can.

Today I look at a man by the name of Gideon as told in <strong>Judges 6</strong>. Gideon's discouragement is a little different because he felt the Lord was against him and his people. He felt that God had allowed the Midianites to attack them year in year out. He couldn't turn to God whom he felt was against him. If you read <strong>Numbers 31</strong>, you will find that the Israelites had very much defeated the Midianites under the leadership of Moses. The Midianites were no march to them.<!--more-->

How did it come that the Midianites became a thorn in the flesh unto the Israelites? Vs 1 tells us, <strong>"Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Midian for seven years," </strong>in simple words, the Midianites oppressed Israel as a tool in God's hands. And if you know what oppression is, it is to inflict distress or dominate harshly. This drove the Israelites hiding in caves, mountains and strongholds. The Midianites would come in year in and year out to destroy their produce and their animals leaving them with no sustenance. In this we are told of Gideon who knew well that the hand of the Lord was driving the Midianites against him and his people and like others, he was hiding, distressed, confused, discouraged with no one to turn to.

<strong>Vs. “11 Now the Angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from the Midianites", </strong>looking at the way this verse and others here are presented and punctuated, you find that the Angel of the Lord is identified as the Lord Himself. Either He appeared as an Angel or Gideon would have seen Him as an Angel. Whichever way, the Lord was present with him and watching him struggle threshing wheat in the winepress to hide it. He was used to using oxen to do this kind of job, now he was doing it the hard way by hand, hiding hoping the Midianites would not recognize him or see his stuff.

<strong>Vs. “12 And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, “The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor!”</strong> How can it be that the Lord would say He is with him when the current situation painted another picture? Not only that, He called him a mighty man of valor? Doesn't make sense and he challenges it, <strong>vs.”13 Gideon said to Him, “O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us?” </strong>Right now there are people who messed up in some areas and are facing trials and are feeling like the Lord is against them and is out to destroy them. They can't turn to the Lord because of their shame. They know that Lord is dealing with them but feels like He is against them. Feeling like Gideon hiding under the wine press hoping your enemy will not find you? Let this be an encouragement, the Lord is with you and will bring you through. If He was against you, He would have had the enemy destroy you long time ago. The bible says <strong>Proverbs 3:12, "For whom the LORD loves He corrects, Just as a father the son in whom he delights". </strong>He has not forsaken the one He corrects<strong>.</strong>

How was the Lord with Gideon anyway? God prevented him from being captured, God gave him wisdom on how to keep something for himself. Even in his discouragement, he wasn't suicidal. His tribe was the weakest yet the Lord prepared a leader to be. If you feel the Lord is against you, how come you still have life? Are you going without food? Are there enemies driving you out of your home? etc. Yes we have tough times but are we seeing the Lord present even in them for us to be encouraged that He has it all under control? Gideon was wondering whether the Lord was with him because there were no miracles or victories like before. I would say they were very much present but not as he expected them. Not only did the Lord tell him He was with him, He also called him mighty in that when he was done with him he would be one. <strong>Job 23:10, “But He knows the way that I take; When He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold”.</strong>

My message this morning is this, the Lord is with you right where you are. You may feel His correcting rod, you should rejoice because the enemy does not have the rod of correction in his hands; he is a destroyer of life. <strong>Psalm 23:4, “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me" </strong>The shepherd’s club and crook are viewed as comforting instruments of protection and direction, respectively.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 25:2-35, “32 Then David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! 33 And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6205" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="276" /></a></strong>

One of the greatest asset a woman wants in a relationship is COMMITMENT, a thing that haunts many men. Someone made a joke saying, "<em>he saw a man standing there like he came out of a bad dream because he said the woman he cared for wanted something he couldn't give her, COMMITMENT</em>”. <!--more-->I know for sure that there are men who have chosen loneliness and called it freedom just because commitment wasn't part of their vocabulary. As a man, I know we are quick to making hasty decisions, something that gratifies quickly. Something more of now, then comes the woman who sees far beyond now. She evaluates, equates, weighs things to make better judgment on anything be it on spending, building a home, raising children, on the job. She is not just looking at today, she is looking at down the road. How will decisions made today affect her and her family in the near future. She is looking for stability and security.

Husbands would agree with me about this because we know that had it not been for our wives who encouraged and advised us is some areas, we would have made decisions which would have made mess of things. God made men help meet (women) because men couldn't handle it themselves as one preacher puts it. Men loose things, women find them. <strong>Women want commitment then they step in committed to make it better by helping their partners make better judgments</strong>. When men get angry, at times it becomes easier for them to make poor judgments and that is the case with David. David was in the wilderness and he encountered Nabal a very wicked man married to a beautiful woman, a woman of understanding Abigail. David had protected Nabal's servants and even protected Nabal's wealth not losing a thing. In time of need, David sent some of his men to Nabal for a favor. Nabal spoke harshly to David's men, vs. “<strong>10 Then Nabal answered ..., “Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master. 11 Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men when I do not know where they are from?”. </strong>Upon getting this message, David became angry and told his men to gird themselves with swords. Not only was David coming to destroy Nabal, he was coming to destroy the whole family, plus the servants and the wealth. Imagine Abigail suffering all these because of one man's hasty decision.

Nabal's servants knew of what would befall them and instead of going to plead with Nabal, they turned to Nabal's wife Abigail, narrated how David had been kind to them and how Nabal treated David's servants. Nabal's servants knew what their fate would be if nothing happened. They told Abigail, vs. “<strong>17 Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that one cannot speak to him.”</strong> The servants knew Abigail pretty well to know that she will make a better judgment in a situation that seemed impossible. She had a way of turning curses into blessings. If Nabal only knew the kind of wife he had, if David only knew the woman about to come his way, if we only knew the women God has put in our lives, we would thank God for them even more. They were our first supporters and committed to making our relationships better by helping us men make better decisions. God brought them for a reason and we are yet to learn more. To continue…Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 25:2-35, 32 Then David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! 33 And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand"</strong>

Going back to the text, I see two different people, Abigail beautiful and of good understanding and Nabal a fool, the meaning of his name. Abigail has regards for God, Nabal has no regards for God. Maybe in his heart he said there was no God the reason the bible says<strong>, "A fool has said in his heart there is no God</strong>" (paraphrased).<!--more--> In all this we still see a woman committed to protecting even the one who doesn't deserve to be protected letting God have His way in her life. She had opportunities to destroy her husband yet not lifting a finger. There is no indication she was in abusive relationship, all I can see is a greedy husband who had no regard for other people and he was about to be spared because of her believing wife<strong>. 1Corinthians 7:13, “... if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. 14 For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife,... (NIV)</strong>

<strong>Vs. “23 Now when Abigail saw David, she dismounted quickly from the donkey, fell on her face before David, and bowed down to the ground. 24 So she fell at his feet and said: “On me, my lord, on me let this iniquity be! And please let your maidservant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your maidservant.” </strong>Why would Abigail take the fault for what her husband did? Perhaps she saw that in marriage you are a unit in good and in bad times. If one is failing, that means the other partner is also affected. Couples can withdraw when the going gets tough, some have only stuck together in good times. Bad times really separated them hence turning around looking for faults and blaming them on each other. <strong>The enemy fights unity in marriages</strong>, if he can set the couple to fight each other, there will be no room to fight him. He is looking for ways to display dirty laundry couples will use against each other. Lack of unity has destroyed many marriages, everything is about me and mine where is ours? They say another killer in marriage is finances, my money and your money there is no our money, no unity even in finances. Remember Nabal saying <strong>my bread and my water and my meat , my shearers</strong>. Abigail takes fault to save their (our) family. <strong>If we only knew the enemy was after our unity, we would fight him who tries to build a wedge between couples</strong>.

Abigail brings food to David and his men and the first thing she does, repents seeking that all the evil to be on her. Can you see this woman putting her life on the line for her husband? I'm not sure of how many husbands would do the same for their wives and vice versa. Christ was willing to put His life on the line for the ones He loved. He said I love you, then demonstrated it by drying on the cross. If only the sinner knew and understood the sacrifice Christ had to make because of His love, a sinner would repent of his sins and trust in Christ alone with his life. His desire would be to live a life pleasing to the one who first loved him. Christ became the role model for husbands, <strong>Ephesians 5:25, "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;". To put it in another way, husbands demonstrate your love by putting your lives on the line for your wives. She should not lose her number 2 place in his life after God (He is FIRST)</strong>. To continue…blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 25:2-35, “32 Then David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! 33 And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand"</strong>

An encouraged person is alive person. Who wants to be around a discouraged person who always talks about nothing but failures and problems? I come across such people, always discouraged. You encourage them today, they will be discouraged tomorrow. When they call you, they wear you down with their discouragements. At times I'm not sure if their calling is to get encouragement or to find someone to join their pity party.<!--more-->

I for one do well with encouragements and husbands need encouragements from their wives. <strong>Behind that macho presentation there is a vulnerability shelled with macho appearance looking for an encouragement to touch it.</strong> I think that some wives feel like their encouragements will not be significant, or he doesn't need one or he appears strong enough to make it without encouragements. A wife who is the number one supporter of her husband has something inside of her that can touch her husband in a way that no one else can. Wives give their husbands a reason to move forward by believing in them and verbalizing it. <strong>Men have feelings too that need a touch from a loving wife</strong>. You've heard some wives tell their husbands how useless they are and how they will never amount to anything, this has killed them even more. They did not look forward to going home and even the need to try was shattered by a judgment already passed with no room for improvement and development. An encouragement will make him try harder and will make him a better husband.

What was Abigail's encouragement to David, <strong>28 ... ... the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, ..., and evil is not found in you throughout your days. 29 Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; .... 30 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD has done for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you ruler over Israel.”</strong> Was David not a mighty warrior? Yes he was and just like any other man, his feelings and vulnerability was shelled by macho appearance needing an encouragement to pierce through the macho appearance to touch the inner being. An encouragement to melt. Maybe he was considered a warrior with no feelings just putting a show and doing the work. Even pastors, evangelists, elders, deacons, teachers, preachers, bosses, ceo's who have excelled in their offices need encouragements. What Abigail was somehow telling David was, "<em>you don't need to do any shady business to make it to the top, follow God's ways and he will make ways for you for it's not by might nor by power but by His spirit says the Lord"</em>. Even if you've been offended and should seek revenge, calm yourself down and see how much damage you will do to your reputation, your destiny. Don't do anything you will regret.

It may be hard for a husband to admit he needs encouragement, I pray the wives will learn the signals that calls for encouragements. If only wives knew how much their husbands crave for encouragements, they would seek ways to less criticize them and encourage them more. An encouragement will keep him alive and hopeful. To continue Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 25:2-35, “32 Then David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! 33 And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand"</strong>

If we are going to make it, we need to be open to advice and counsel. The reason we have counsel is because someone else sees what we are blind to see, is experienced, or we are just ignorant of it. I would say it's hard for some people to take advice from their juniors or from the ones they feel they are superior to. <strong>Advice and counsel gives you a chance to add what you are learning new to what you already know to see far beyond what you could see with your limited knowledge.</strong><!--more-->

Husbands are going to have to humble themselves to some wise advice from their wives and not feel like it's robbing them of their position as a man and the priest of his home. A husband who is insecure within himself may not be willing to throw in the towel and seek advice, maybe because he might feel his HUMILITY will be a SIGN of WEAKNESS. <strong>Humility is not a weakness, it's strength under control.</strong>

<strong>Vs. "32 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, Who sent you this day to meet me." </strong>David could have dismissed Abigail because she was a woman, and what advice would a woman give a warrior leading over 600 other warriors, a successful soldier promised to be king? What possible reason would make David heed to the advice of a woman who is not even his wife? Simple, HUMILITY. His humility to heed to the voice of Abigail did not rob him of his manhood and position, if anything it channeled him to greater levels. He would have tried to impress his soldiers by not listening to her but the choice he made once again was out of humility. Abigail may have not realized that God sent her to meet David, David knew pretty well that it was God. Wives, do you realize God has put you in your marriage for a reason? And some of the wise advice He has deposited in you to give is to draw you closer to him as he sees how well favored he is to have such a wonderful wife who cares for his life, destiny and relationship? <strong>Proverbs 31:10, " A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. 11 Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. 12 She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life" (NIV). </strong>What a blessing to know that you are more than just a wife but a voice also that God can use to get your husband's attention. <strong>What if marriage was created by God not to make us happy as number one reason but to teach us things about God we would not learn in any other way? That through it we are shaped in the image of God</strong>. I believe there are some accomplishments be it in ministry, work, society that will never be complete without being in a marriage. Abigail that day became a voice God could use to speak to David preventing him from bloodshed and messing the victories God had in line for him. We are blessed when we take advice and we are a blessing when we do.

Humility may appear to be a setback for some husbands but I believe it tailors him to greater things, why, "<strong>God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble</strong>". A humble husband is a husband respected <strong>Proverbs 31:23, "Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land" </strong>

<strong>If only husbands would know that humility is not a sign of weakness, they would heed to those good advices they receive for they are not of men but of God, Blessings Ev</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 10:20, “Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.”</strong>

There are certain expressions used to describe people who seem to listen to one’s good news, and then upon hearing it, they find a way to kill the mood. Some additional expressions are being a “party pooper,” “a kill joy,” “a wet blanket,” etc… These types of people seem to have a “gift” of discouraging people.<!--more-->

This is precisely what I imagine the seventy disciples experienced when Jesus dialoged with them as they came in from the field of ministry. They returned after a powerful time of team ministry, and their highlight was seeing that they were used to deliver demonized people by the name of Jesus. As Jesus hears the words of the disciples he shares what I imagine initially took them by surprise when He states, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven<strong>.Luke 10:19, “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”</strong> Jesus’ focus here was most likely not on the fall of Satan from <strong>Isaiah 14</strong> and <strong>Ezekiel 28</strong>, but He rather spoke hyperbolically here, pointing out that the ministry of the disciples was a direct assault on Satan’s authority and influence upon those that were just delivered. Satan has been a problem for humanity since the Garden of Eden, with all his influential lies and deceptive tactics, which is why he is called the Father of Lies (<strong>John 8:44</strong>), who masquerades himself as an angel of light (<strong>2Corinthians 11:14</strong>) roaming around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour (<strong>1Peter 5:8</strong>).

Jesus continues sharing what He sees having happened by <strong>saying: “Look I have given you the authority in My name to trample on snakes and scorpions and over all power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.”</strong> Jesus was saying that the authority to do these miraculous exploits did not originate in the disciples, but originated in Jesus and His authority. Jesus promised protection to His disciples that are in His keeping power which is greater than Satan’s influence (<strong>Psalm 91:13</strong>).

A flee would have a better chance of defeating a heard of stampeding elephants, than Satan would have of defeating Christ and the Church by his evil influence. Jesus said, “<strong>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled</strong>”, (<strong>John 17</strong>).” The son of perdition is a reference to Judas, which was a false convert, and I believe is a representative of false converts, which are those that sit among God’s people but are really not Christian, but are goats, or wolves in sheep clothing. He was under the influence of Satan as one recalls Jesus’ words to His disciples, “…<strong>one of you is a devil.” </strong>Jesus says, “…<strong>nothing will ever harm you</strong>.” How encouraging are those words toward the genuine follower of Christ? Nothing will EVER harm you, hence wickedness from the kingdom of Satan will NEVER overtake you. Paul writes in <strong>Romans 8:34-30, “34 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</strong>

The real reason to rejoice is not that the demonic spirits are submitting to you, but rather because your name in engraved in heaven! Rejoice because the name demons submit to, is the same name that purchased your salvation! Luke writes<strong>, Acts 4:12, “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved</strong>.” How wonderful it is that God’s children have their names written in His Book of Life (<strong>Revelation 20:15</strong>). It is not that God’s children will not experience the effects of Satan’s storms, but that they will never overtake the Christian. Remember Job when Satan attacked him, God allowed him to be attacked, but He would not let Satan kill Job (<strong>Job 1:12</strong>). After going through all that Job went through he cried out, “<strong>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him</strong>: <strong>but I will maintain mine own ways before him (13:15)</strong> <strong>…For I knowthat my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 26 And though after  my skin worms destroy this body, yetin my flesh shall I see God</strong> (<strong>Job 19:25</strong>).”When one considers all of life’s experiences ultimately what could match seeing God! The disciples saw the demons submitting to them, but Jesus said their names are engraved in heaven; they would see God the Father, as they have seen the Jesus the Son. I look forward to seeing the Lord one day, even though He has done ministry exploits through my life, nothing will match seeing Him as He is. Oh, when we see the source of Gospel Himself what a day, glorious day that will be, and to see our names engraved in the book of life. I close with the words from the famous hymn, What a Day That Will Be:

What a day that will be

When my Je-sus I shall see,

And I look up-on His face,

The one who saved me by His grace.

When He takes me by the hand,

And leads me through the Prom-ised Land,

What a day, glo-ri-ous day that will be.

May you appreciate God’s gift of everlasting life, and may you seek and save the lost so others will know this same salvation.

Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Phillip the Evangelist (Acts 21:8) &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 1:10 , "10 In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD. 11 And she made a vow, saying, "O LORD Almighty , if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head." </strong>

Our society is one that thrives on ownership. There are copyright laws on movies, songs, books, and deeds for houses, and titles for cars, etc... all showing owner of things. However when one has a child to
whom does that child belong? The Psalmist wrote, <strong>Psalm 127:3, “Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward from Him."</strong> In the book of Samuel we are met by a woman in bitterness of soul because she was barren. In those days to be barren was considered to be cursed by God. Hannah would weep and fast from food because she wanted a son so bad and her heart was in deep anguish.<!--more-->

Hannah vows a vow and tells the Lord that if He will grant her a son, she will give him back to the Lord all the days of his life. Wow, if the Lord gives her what she yearns for, she will give her son away to the Lord. God takes our vows very seriously as Solomon points out in <strong>Ecclesiastes 5:4-5, "4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. 5 It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it</strong>." Hannah makes her vow in prayer to the Lord, and Eli the priest confirms the answer from the Lord, that indeed God had heard her prayer, and she would have a son. This word from the Lord lifted her spirit and she was no longer sad. God's Word met her right where she was. He met her sadness with joy, hopelessness with hope, and barrenness with a child. Her son is born, to become the prophet Samuel who would later anoint King David to the throne of Israel. Hannah's prayer was desperate, selfless, and committed.

1. <strong>Desperate prayer.</strong> Hannah was in a time of desperation. Much more can be said of women in those days bearing children, but this was her heart’s desire and she brought it to God. Where do you bring your
deepest hearts desires, your dreams, your vision? Do you bring them to the Lord, or elsewhere?

2. <strong>Selfless prayer.</strong> Hannah's prayer was answered, and "unto her a child was given." However she promised God that she would give Him to the Lord all the days of Samuel’s life. The very child she was
desperate for, she was willing to give him back to the Lord as a gift. Are you selfish in your prayers, or selfless? Jesus prayed, "<strong>not my will be yours be done</strong>." Before we can pray "<strong>Thy Kingdom
come [thy will be done]," we must be willing to pray "my kingdom go [my will be gone] ALAN REDPATH</strong>."

3. <strong>Committed prayer</strong>. Hannah did not delay in fulfilling her vow to the Lord. Hannah brought Samuel to Eli the priest and he was offered up to the Lord saying, "<strong>Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am
the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. 27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: 28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD</strong>." When God answers your prayer in a vow do your keep your end of the vow?

Are you desperate for the Lord? Is your prayer selfless and are you committed to serve Him with that which He gives you, whether things or people. Give to the Lord that which He has given you.

Until the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Peter 3:15, "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense (reason) to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear"</strong>

We appreciate messages on life enhancements, steps to happiness, how to live a successful life, how to prosper and the like. These messages are good and we should love them but the messages on holiness, righteousness, purity, sanctification, concentration, servant hood should have a greater impact in a life of a believer. The <strong>Benefactor ought to be greater than the benefits. </strong> Christ is the PRIME product so to speak, not the by product. We serve Him because He is worthy of our service.<!--more-->

A weak example I can use that might drive this point home is this, If you apply for a job in a company, the main thing is not the benefits but the job itself. As you discuss the nature of the job, the requirements, the salary, the environment, the expectations somewhere in between you will discuss the benefits. I don't think that anyone applies for a job primarily for benefits. With this in mind, the first question I ask myself, why I'm I serving Christ? Why did I come to Christ?. I believe that our understanding of why we serve Christ helps eliminates many things that we get frustrated with when we have a clear understanding of why we chose or better, why Christ chose us in the first place. Did I come to serve because He promised me life enhancement, happiness, comfort? Why are you serving Christ?

I came to Christ primarily because He offered eternal life and bring glory to His name. <strong>Hebrews 9:27, says "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this is judgment</strong>" and His judgment will not be based on the life enhancement, it will be based on whether I repented of my sins and received Christ by faith. <strong>If coming to Christ is to receive the gift of eternal life, then serving Christ is life sustenance on the gift </strong>and letting other people know that “<strong>Christ in us the hope of glory”.</strong> We become witnesses of the saving grace. If someone pointed you to Christ, should you not be compelled to do the same?

Of course serving Christ does have benefits too, <strong>Psalm 103:1-4, "…, Bless the Lord, O my soul and forget not His benefits, Who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who redeem your life from destruction, who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfies your mouth with goods things etc</strong>". So should I give up on Christ if some of these benefits are not provided? no, because my coming to Him was to receive the gift of eternal life. <strong>We need to put the emphasis on the hope to come and not on the benefits</strong> that are temporary.

<strong>Serving Christ is not about happiness but righteousness</strong>. <strong>Romans 14:17, "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost"</strong>. Meat and drink is about happiness, for believers it's more than that, it's righteousness, holiness, purity, peace that surpasses all understanding, unspeakable joy full of Holy Ghost. Happiness depends on circumstance, <strong>joy depends on the promise that regardless of what happens, I have the joy of knowing that one day when this life is over I will be with Him in heaven. </strong>

<strong>1Peter 3:15, "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense (reason) to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear".</strong> Sanctify is to set apart for sacred use, it's also to make holy and purify. The definition I love, sanctify is to <strong>make productive of holiness</strong>. The Lord is holy, because He lives in us, we have to set ourselves apart in readiness for His use. We have to desire holiness and purity. Our uniqueness will raise questions and what a joy to stand and respond confidently the reason why we serve Christ, we contend for the faith.

Are you ready to give an answer if someone was to ask you of your hope in Christ? If asked, would you answer with meekness (submissive, patient, humbleness) and fear (extreme reverence)?. I want to be different in the sight of men and when they ask what makes me different, I will not be afraid and intimidated to speak of the hope that lies within me. This serves even as a great reminder of why I serve Christ. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

The unclean will not journey on it; it will be for those who walk in that Way; wicked fools will not go about on it. 9 No lion will be there, nor will any ferocious beast get up on it; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there, 10 and the ransomed of the LORD will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away"</strong> Robert Frost wrote, "<strong>Two roads diverged in a wood, I took the one less traveled by, and I- And that has made all the difference</strong>". <!--more-->If we choose the right road it will make all the difference in life for us as well. Life has often been described as the way one lives on a way, a path, a road, or other such words that depict travel, journeying or direction. Isaiah says "a highway will be there," which is to say that there is a certain highway that is ever present. However although the highway can be seen clearly, not all see it. Even all those who do see it do not travel on it. Why not? It is because it is "<strong>called the way of holiness</strong>", as all highways have a name.</p><p>What kind of terrain does this highway have? Is it smooth, void of bumps, potholes, and sharp turns? No, it has its fair share of all of these and more. God Himself is the architect of this road. It is not an easy road to take, because this is not a highway that one can travel on in their own strength. This is a road that one must "<strong>be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus (2Timothy 2:1). </strong>Since this is a road of holiness, only the redeemed of the Lord may journey on it. To redeem (<em>exagorazo</em>) means "<strong>to buy out of slavery</strong>" by paying a price. Christ paid our sin debt by dying on the cross. The redeemed is an elect family, the body of Christ, which helps one another to walk on. It is hard to know what to do at times on this road because one must "walk in it by faith and not by sight." The road is not a wide road, but a rather narrow one because few find it in (Matt 7:14), and there is none other like it. Although many walk on this road, The Apostle Paul described his travels on this road as a race in which he ran for the prize promised. He said<strong>, "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing (2Timothy 4:7-8</strong>).</p><p>Oh yes Christian if you are on this Highway of Holiness it is because you have the power of Christ in you, because, it is <strong>"Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the LORD Almighty" </strong> Oh He knows your every trial and uses them to strengthen and refine your faith in Him, because He has called you to walk by faith and not by sight. There is a crown of righteousness awaiting your victorious arrival and "to all who have longed for His appearing, because <strong>"He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him" (Hebrews 11:6). </strong>So don’t give up and never give in. Get up after every bump you hit, climb out of each pothole that temporally may take you down, "<strong>for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again</strong>" <strong>(Proverbs 24:16), </strong>and live diligently with a reckless abandonment to "<strong>press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me (you) heavenward in Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:14). </strong>Keep your eyes on the finish line though you cannot see it with the natural eye, your eyes of faith has the vision to see "<strong>Him who is invisible" (Hebrews 11:27). </strong>And for those that are in ministry or desire to be, then keep your run in the race steady and don’t give up when your legs of faith grow weary. Keep running a good race, and "<strong>Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up", Galatians 6:9).</strong></p><p><strong>Application: Be encouraged; stay on the Highway of Holiness, even if it is The Road Less Traveled it is the road Jesus instructed on us to take (Matthew 7:14). You don’t want to travel on the alternative road, the Broad Way (Matthew 7:13)!! Blessings Pastor Phil</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>2Chronicles 30:17-20, "17 For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover lambs for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to the Lord. 18 For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the good Lord provide atonement for everyone 19 who prepares his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.” 20 And the Lord listened to Hezekiah and healed the people”</strong><!--more--> I was reading 2 Chronicles chapter 30 this morning in my devotional time, this chapter as you all know is about king Hezekiah and how he was instrumental in bringing true worship back to all Israel and Judah.... you read in the previous chapter how he went right to work with opening up the temples, and getting the Levites and priesthood to return back to true worship , chapter 29. This king did not give up, but encouraged everyone, that there was work that needed to be done. The people needed to return to God, because they went after other things and the GOD Israel was not first in their lives. In chapter 30 we read, that the feast of Passover could not be celebrated until all were cleansed, and purified, including the officiating priest..... but the verses that I want to highlight here is in chapter 30 v 17,18. Since many of the people had not purified themselves, the Levites had to slaughter their Passover lamb for them, to set them apart for the Lord., later in that verse it says that King Hezekiah prayed for them. and v. 20 says and the Lord listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.......what example of prayer, he just did not want to have a "religious rite" or "service" but knew that God hears, and knew that the condition of the heart was far more important than a religious festival or rite. May we as God’s people not fall into that snare, but may we come to God, daily on our knees, weeping, and breaking before him. We need to be a HOLY people, and to be Holy we must pray and read his word daily and live that life of holiness.....I just wanted to share this from my heart, it is not criticism but an encouragement to me. As a Holy priesthood of believers let’s make prayer top priority, I too am working in this discipline as I walk in the Lord from day to day. Love you guys,., you mean the world to me. continue to lift me up in prayer... I need to be disciplined in this area and other areas as well. MARANATHA! Blessings Bro. Jose</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Judges 15:15, "He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it"</strong></p><p>I saw “Apollo 13" movie once or twice that taught me a biblical principle. As depicted in this movie, two days after the launch, the Apollo spacecraft was crippled by an explosion caused by an electrical fault in an oxygen tank. The explosion damaged the Service Module, resulting in a loss of oxygen and electrical power. A failed mission was aborted before it became successful. <!--more-->Not only did the mission fail, to bring the men back to earth safely was a challenge. At one, the man in charge on the ground began to work with his crew to find ways to bring the astronauts to a safe landing. He reached out to one of the top guys, engineers to explain what some of the systems were designed to do only to be told they were designed for specific tasks only and could not be used for anything else. His reaction, "<em>forget everything the machines were designed to do or not do and let’s see how we can take what we have, modify them to do what we want done and bring the astronauts back home safely</em>"<em>(paraphrased)</em>. And that is what they did and it worked. God has many ways of bringing victory in situations you thought were out of reach.</p><p>If you know the story of Samson, you will understand that he was a very unique individual. Born at a very specific time in history to fight against the Philistines. If you look at Joshua and David, they were men of war, trained and had men (warriors) with them. Samson was different, not born to be a warrior, had no training of any kind yet he would be used to deliver Israel from the Philistines as a one man army. After being born, he began to grow and God blessed him. He had seven locks of hair that was not supposed to be cut. It was a sign of God’s presence and strength. The uniqueness of Samson was, he did great and mighty things when the <strong>Spirit of God moved in his life</strong>. That is what the Spirit of God does; He empowers you to do what you have no ability to do. He makes you do the impossible by taking something in the natural and using it to accomplish something in the supernatural.</p><p>Anytime the Philistine faced him, the bible says, the Spirit of God would come upon him mightily and use him to destroy the enemy. On one particular day when he was delivered to the Philistine bound, the Spirit of God came upon him. There were so many men against him; he did not have any sophisticated weapons to fight back like Rambo. What was present, <strong>"...a fresh jawbone of a donkey...”, Judges 15:15. </strong>To think about it, what can a jawbone do? God did not design it to be a weapon. It might injure one or two people, but how can you face over a thousand men with something like that? This is where the Spirit of God makes a difference. <strong>He empowers to the extent that you can take less and do much with it</strong>. <strong>The strength is not on the weapon but in the ability given to one to accomplish something</strong>. Jesus said in <strong>Luke 4:18, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon, because He (God) has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor...” </strong>Jesus being on earth in the flesh, there are certain things He was limited to do (as designed by His coming) and God had empower Him through His Spirit. He laid aside His majesty and completely yielded to the power from above, the Holy Spirit. <strong>Acts 10:38, "How God anointed Jesus Christ of Nazareth who went about doing good unto the children of man".</strong> Just like the captain taking what was designed for other things and improvising it to use to bring victory in one area, so was the jawbone Samson used. God used something that was available, a jawbone. <strong>Judges 15:15, "...reached out his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it". </strong>It's not the jawbone that killed men, it's the Spirit of God driven through the jawbone that killed men. Anyone else who might have tried to take the same jawbone to do the same job and would have failed.</p><p>I want us to know that God can use anything around to bring victory in your life. It could be something around you that was never designed for what you want to accomplish but God could use it. It may just be a jawbone, not have significance or even look stupid to use. You may be waiting to see sophisticated things before you see yourself becoming victorious. Let this be a reminder to you, it is the Spirit of God that empowers not what is around. When Samson was done with the jawbone, he did not keep it because of the work it did. I believe the reason was, he knew God had used it just as a means to destroy the enemy. It was a temporary thing to use but it did a work to remember. Pray that the Spirit of God will empower you to take less and do much with it and more so be more like Christ.

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 9:62, “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.” </strong>

Jesus Christ calls people to follow Him amidst various scenarios. When Christ calls someone, he or she may be “on top of the world” or “in the depths of despair,” or “anywhere in between”. Think for a moment of where you were when Christ called you to follow Him? I can recall that I was a young teen, an average student, heavily involved in sports, and religiously attending the Roman Catholic Church at the time. <!--more-->However upon realizing that “my goodness” would not merit eternal life in heaven, my previous understanding of God was shattered. Upon hearing the truth from the Bible for the first time, I was enlightened and convicted of my sins (breaking God’s 10 Commandments), this caused me to repent toward God and put my faith in Jesus Christ. Sometime afterwards I began ministry in my school, on the streets, and in other venues as began to unfold. Jesus had a conversation about commitment with three individuals. With that said let’s focus on the first of the three people Jesus encountered, in light of the above Scripture.

The first person we are introduced to in the context of <strong>Luke 9:62</strong> read, <strong>“And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest”. (9:57).</strong> This man makes a presumptuous claim that he would go wherever Jesus traveled. Many say they will follow Jesus, but Jesus is looking for followers not fans, not those that want to jump on the “band wagon. <strong><em>“</em>And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head”, (9:58).”</strong> Jesus travels to places that not all that say they are willing to go, actually follow when He looks to their level of commitment. There are numerous examples of this throughout the Scriptures, the rich young ruler (<strong>Mark 10</strong>), the various persons described in <strong>Luke 14</strong>, the famous <strong>John 6:66</strong>, and of course the examples given here in <strong>Luke 9:57–62</strong>. Jesus’ chief destination was to the CROSS! How many want to follow before one sees the cross? How many want to continue to follow after one sees the cross?
<strong><em>“The Son of man has no where to lay His head.”</em></strong>

<strong>This can give us a few things to note about Jesus</strong>:
<ol>
	<li>Jesus cannot be found in one sole location as perhaps a fox in hole, or a bird in a nest</li>
	<li>Jesus is the King of a moving Kingdom</li>
	<li>Jesus did not have an earthly place that He called home</li>
	<li>Jesus’ home was not of this world</li>
	<li>Jesus went where the Spirit of God directed Him</li>
	<li>Jesus’ rest was not from physical comfort, but spiritual obedience to His Father’s will</li>
</ol>
Although one may request to follow Jesus, realize he will go places that will be uncomfortable to many. I never anticipated preaching open – air on the streets while being cursed at. I never imagined having a knife pulled out on me for sharing my faith. Christ has taken me to places that were not comfortable, but He is my Lord, and Him I must follow. What about you? To be continued…

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt; </strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 9:62, “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”</strong>

Around the time of the Revolutionary War, in the United States of America, a group of men existed, called minute-men. The terms "minutemen" and "militia" are often thought of as one and the same. However, in early America-- especially in the 18th century-- there was a distinct difference. Minute-men represented a small hand-picked force selected from the ranks of local militia companies and regiments. Approximately one-third of the men in each militia unit were chosen "to be ready to march or fight at a minute's notice."<!--more--> If they were eating with their families, putting the kids to bed, bathing, sleeping, etc…, when the call came they were to immediately switch into battle mode and GO! This sounds like the commitment that Jesus was after we He calls. <strong>Matthew 11:12</strong> reads, <strong><em>“</em>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”</strong> The minute-men had the mentality that Jesus was after, those ready in an instance to obey the call and GO!

Looking back to the man with the deceased father, I envision what Jesus was saying to him, was, “Come now, not later, I have an urgent job for you, that is to go preach the Kingdom of God! Go preach this living, active, forcefully advancing kingdom. You are spiritually alive, follow me, be my disciple, and preach the Kingdom” . It sounds kind of rough reading, the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force,” however Jesus needs those that have that kind of soldiers’ mentality, ready to “violently fight” for the kingdom. Jesus was saying to this man, “I am calling you for such a time as this.” Remember Jesus said to him, “<strong>Let the dead bury the dead, but you go and preach the Kingdom of God</strong>.” I will always appreciate years back when a dear friend named Pastor Paul came to celebrate my wedding even though his dad had just died. He was able to rejoice with me in what God was doing in uniting my wife and I.

John McNeill, a well known Scottish preach of a past generation, used to tell how he found this saying directly relevant to him. When his father died in Scotland, towards the end of the nineteenth century, he was in the English Midlands, and was advertised to address an evangelistic meeting in a certain city on the very day of his father’s funeral. People would have understood had he sent a message to say that he was compelled to cancel his engagement. ‘But I dared not send it,’ he said, ‘for this same Jesus stood by me, and seemed to say, “Now, look, I have you. You go and preach the gospel to those people. Would you rather bury the dead or raise the dead?” And I went to preach”.

When Jesus told the man, “<strong>Let the dead bury the dead</strong>,” it seems that this man did not obey Jesus to go. This sounds like much of the church when this same Jesus calls you and me to go and preach the kingdom of God. When he does most make an excuse and fail to obey the call! “<em>Until we stop relying upon our own efforts, we will be unable to rely upon God</em> (James Beall).<em>”</em> Burying the dead is not a work of the Spirit, obeying Jesus to preach His Word, is a Spirit work. Let’s cast off excuse, and Go, You Go, I Go, and preach the Kingdom! Be blessed, and be obedient.

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 9:62 , “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”</strong>

Have you ever taken a fitness test? I can remember in school having to do a certain amount of push-ups, sit-ups, and various other exercises as part of testing to see if I was physically fit or not. Obviously all people are not physically fit, and in light of this all, are not spiritually fit either. The Apostle Paul wrote to Timothy these words, <strong>“For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.</strong>” The Apostle was not saying that physical fitness had NO value, but rather it did not have the same value as godliness (spiritual fitness).<!--more-->

Jesus is approached by one that said to Him, <strong>“I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family</strong>.” Jesus replied, “<strong>No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.</strong>” Like the man that wanted to first go and bury his father to which Jesus replied “<strong>Let the dead bury the dead but you go and preach the Kingdom of God</strong>,” this man desired also to go to say goodbye to his family. This seemed to be like a reasonable request as well, and respectable in nature. However, Jesus replied again in an unexpected manner. Jesus gives an analogy about plowing, and looking back as seemingly disqualifying someone from the Kingdom. This is until one knows the key word in that verse for “fit,” which in the Greek is euthetos which means “ready for use.” Lot’s family was told not to look back and Lot’s wife chose to look back and she turned into a pillar of salt. Jesus said, “…<strong>no one in the field should go back for anything. 32 Remember Lot’s wife</strong>! Why would Jesus tell this man not to even look back?

<strong>1. When one looks back, one cannot look forward</strong>. Jesus was looking for mission minded people, not mountainous minded people along for the ride who just desired to maintain the status quo. Some people follow as long as it doesn’t cost them anything, as long as it doesn’t “rock the boat,” of the nice little world one has built for oneself. Mission minded people are engaged in the mission at hand, and will pay the cost, rock the boat, all of which will create a ripple effect in the lives of those closest to them. Some of those people may not appreciate this, yet Jesus still calls us to the mission of following Him

<strong>2. When Christ calls us to work, He expects work</strong>. If you’ve ever been hired to work at a job, the boss doesn’t appreciate lazy employees. Laziness doesn’t advance his business, and laziness doesn’t advance God’s Kingdom. Jesus said to the disciples, “Come follow me and I will make you fishers of men.” The key is follow, when Christ moves forward as the leader, His followers MUST follow.

<strong>3. When one looks back one is not ready for use. </strong>As a light bulb was made to shine light, so too was the Christian made to shine the light of Christ. What would happen if a light bulb could somehow unscrew itself so that it was not connected to the socket? It would not be connected to the source that it needs to do its job, shine! When one looks back to the world one is unfit, not ready for use, disconnected to his or her purpose. Don’t look back, and definitely don’t go back. Stay focused, ready for the Master’s use, with your hand to the plow. Remember the harvest is plenty but the workers are few.

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 9:62, “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”</strong>

In Star Wars Episode 1, George Lucas did something phenomenal with his Star Wars films. He went back to the beginning and helped all those that did not read the books to understand how the whole Star War movies began. However, before George Lucas did this with film, Jesus did this sort of thing when he said “Remember Lot’s wife.” <!--more-->Before “the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens,” God gave Lot’s family a warning through the angel. The angel said “<strong>Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!</strong> (<strong>Genesis 19:17</strong>)” I read four instructions here in what seems to me, a purposed order.

1. First he says <strong>flee for your lives</strong>. Death was on its way from God, and just as God gave Noah a way of escape through the ark, Lot’s family was directed to a way of escape as well from impending wrath.

<strong>2. Don’t look back</strong>. Sometimes we are not given the why behind the command from God, but are simply told to just obey. Lot’s family knew judgment was ensuing and were told not to look back. Jesus said, Remember Lot’s wife, referencing to her looking back. For whatever reason she turned her head, I don’t know the reason for returning to house or field is to salvage possessions. The Expositors Bible Commentary says, “Lot's wife, reluctant to leave her old life, looked back to Sodom.”

<strong>3. Don’t Stop anywhere in the plains</strong>. Many times stopping and looking back go hand in hand. When one stops, their work stops, and their attention is diverted to the world.

<strong>4. Flee to the mountains</strong>. This allows one to get to higher ground, as they were in the plains. We are to flee the devil and get to higher ground, namely Jesus.

Jesus said “<strong>But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. “It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. On that day no one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything</strong> (<strong>Luke 17:29-31</strong>).”

When the Son returns, there will not be time to look back let alone go back. <strong>Luke 17:34–35</strong> reads, I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.’” Even those closely associated (in bed and at work) are separated. Those who look back now and not fit for the Kingdom, and at Christ’s return will not inherit the Kingdom, despite their close relationship to someone that will be taken by Christ. False converts don’t just look back, they go back! Paul wrote in <strong>2Corinthians 13:5,</strong> “<strong>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?</strong>” If you are saved then, look forward to the fields that are white unto harvest because <strong>the harvest is plenty but the workers are few (Matthew 9:37)</strong>. Seek and save the lost like Jesus did, there’s only a certain amount of time left.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Chronicles 22:1-5, vs. 5,”Now David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.” So David made abundant preparations before his death”</strong>

I spoke to three young guys I met in a train while going and coming back from NYC a couple of weeks ago. I felt compelled to witness to them but first thing was to find a starting point (ice breaker). Their talk about schools became my entry point to start a conversation with them. I asked them what they thought of shooting in schools and high rate of suicides among young people plaguing our society. I asked them what they believed was the cause and how to fix the broken system. After sharing with them what I will share I believe is partly the problem, they agreed with me.<!--more-->

In the present world, the rate of children coming from broken homes (divorce, single parenthood, children abandoned etc) is increasing at an alarming rate. Besides that, a number of children from certain homes are growing but shielded from things that ought to prepare them for life in the real world. And because some were never prepared for a possible hard life, they find the world hard and not fair. A number even feel its not fair that some are succeeding and not them.

Children are left to run wild in some homes with no sense of hard work, responsibility or accountability. Many parents even cripple their children when they say, “I will give my children all I never had" when some of those things they never had helped them become what they are today. I have seen parents set unrealistic expectations for their children even affirming them on what they know their children could never do or become while saying they can become anything in life, sky being the limit, eg. singing, sports etc setting them up for failure right from the start. And when professionals challenges or disagree with them, they become enemies. While we might think all these are outrageous, there are parents who side with their children even when they know their children are wrong, a recipe for disaster.

In the last 20 years or so, a lot has changed in my judgement. Back then, great discipline was huge, there was structure, hard work, responsibility, accountability etc. Parents, grownups and teachers worked together for the well being of the children. The quote "it takes a village to raise a child" was a reality. Nearly every parent supported teachers and often gave their unruly child a few more licks when they got home as good discipline. Parents respected teachers, and students listened. Today, over-indulgent middle-class parents are fueling a rise in bad behaviour in schools by failing to set boundaries for their children, and that is why I believe we see many bad behaviors that lead to violence as they escalate. The biblical principles that children lived by have been thrown out the window. The values shared and cherished at the dinner tables are now considered by many worthless and we wonder why we have high rates of shootings, suicides, crimes among other great issues affecting our young people.

In the light of our current world, I draw biblical wisdom from David who prepared his son for the life ahead with serving the Lord as priority. We will see how David prepared his son Solomon giving him charge and great responsibility. And may the Lord help us in our day. Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Chronicles 22:1-5, vs. 5,”Now David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.” </strong>

David having learnt that his son Solomon was the one to build a house for the Lord, and also knowing he may not to live long enough to see his son grow up and become all that God wanted him to be, he prepared these 4 crucial areas for the benefit of his son<strong>. 1. Physical preparation, 2. Spiritual preparation, 3. Surrounded him with skillful workers, 4. Surrounded him with good spiritual leaders</strong>.<!--more-->

1. <strong>PHYSICAL PREPARATION:</strong> <strong>1Chronicles 22:5,”Now David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.”</strong>. If David was not going to build directly, he would build through his son. And knowing his son was still young and inexperienced, he made abundant preparations before his death. All that we prepare and do with God’s help is to the praise of the glory of His grace. And parents ought to prepare both physical and material for the well-being of their children with God in mind for His glory. David wanted to make sure his son understood that the preparation was more about God than him. David had learnt that God’s work must be done God’s way and by God’s Spirit if God is to bless it. He needed his son to get that and prepare the same. <strong>Proverbs 13:22, “A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children”</strong>

2. <strong>SPIRITUAL PREPARATION: 1Chronicles 28:9-10, "9 As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a loyal heart and with a willing mind; for the Lord searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever. 10 Consider now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it.” </strong>Though time was not on his side, he worked very diligently not only preparing materials but also preparing his son spiritually for what was to come. There are parents who are more concerned about their children being successful in life (financially, family, health) than they are about their children’s spiritual life. Solomon benefited from being given great responsibility when his father passed the manhood responsibility to him and gave him charge before the Lord by first teaching him how to serve the Lord. David was not a perfect father however the bible highlights his faith. He was a man after God's own heart the same charge he gives his son. Read what Paul reminds his son in the faith of the things that shaped his manhood, <strong>2Timothy 3:10-17, “10 But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, 11 persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me”</strong>

3. <strong>SURROUNDED HIM WITH SKILFULL PEOPLE/WORKERS:</strong> <strong>1Chronicles 22:15, “Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance: woodsmen and stonecutters, and all types of skillful men for every kind of work”. </strong>Mark that he does not tell Solomon he is giving him skillful men to work for him but work with him. This is why we appreciate teachers, instructors, lecturers etc. They are skillful people parents surround their children with to help prepare them for life. Parents help their children select good skillful people and they work with them for the betterment of their children’s lives. We entrust our children to teachers, counselors, instructors considered skillful people with different gifts and talents to work alongside of us and not for us, instilling values of hard work.

4. <strong>SURROUNDED HIM WITH SPIRITUAL LEADERS</strong>: <strong>1Chronicles 22:17-19, “17 David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, “ 18 Is not the LORD your God with you? And has He not given you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the LORD and before His people. 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God. Therefore arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the house that is to be built for the name of the LORD.” </strong>David surrounded his son with great spiritual leaders to help his son walk in the spiritual charge he gave him. We must surround our children with biblically sound leadership, first knowing what we believe and why and then being in a body (church) where those sound teachings they are receiving at home are cultivated. <strong>2Timothy 3:14-15, “15 But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, 15 and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus</strong>.”

It takes a village of people to raise a child for the glory of God, but it all starts at home. We blame schools for taking out spiritual things but who took the spiritual things out of our own homes? We must go back to biblical foundation of raising children in our homes as the starting point as we also surround them with others in this journey . Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 24:7-8, “You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains…”</strong>

Some time back an earthquake hit Japan which added Tsunami tragedy. How should the church respond to such a tragedy? First Jesus tells us that we should not be alarmed. This does not mean that we shouldn’t care, pray, weep with those who weep, or send relief to the people affected by this horrific event. Jesus instructs us not to be alarmed because these things are a sign of the times. Even though we don’t desire these things to take place, we are reminded that these things are part of biblical prophecy, and can rest assure that our God is in control, in the midst of these times. We can’t explain such an event of this nature without looking to God. <!--more-->The Bible tells us that God cursed the earth because of Adam’s transgression. Weeds are a curse. So is disease. Sin and suffering cannot be separated. The Scriptures inform us that we live in a fallen creation. In the beginning, God created man perfect, and he lived in a perfect world without suffering. It was heaven on earth. When sin came into the world, death and misery came with it.

Secondly, Jesus spoke these things as "<strong>the beginning of birth pains</strong>" (<strong>Matthew 24:4-8; Mark 13:8).</strong> Not only men, but the whole creation groans with "<strong>the pains of childbirth</strong>" anticipating the revelation of the sons of God at the revelation of the Son (<strong>Romans 8:18-22</strong>). Christians look forward and we<strong>”…wait for the blessed hope-the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ</strong>.” If you’ve given birth, then you understand the feeling of birth pains. Yet think for a moment at the full picture. God brings two people together in marriage. Sometime later they desire children and so through love the wife becomes pregnant. There is much excitement as the parents look forward to the birth of the child. However during the delivery there is great pain involved, until the baby comes, and once again there is joy unspeakable as God’s gift is seen in the birth. Jesus has called those that have repented and put their trust in Him, His children. However, we live in a time of the birth pains.

Thirdly, because of the birth pain it caused us to look forward to the coming of Christ. <strong>Luke 12:37</strong> says, “<strong>Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that He shall gird Himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them</strong>.” In a moment in the twinkling of an eye He’ll return. No one was ready for the unexpected Tsunami that took the lives of thousands. But, we are commanded to have an expectant attitude for Christ’s return, and it too will be sudden! Those who understand Scripture eagerly await a new heaven and a new earth "<strong>wherein dwells righteous-ness</strong>." In that coming Kingdom there will be no more pain, suffering, disease, or death. We are told that “<strong>no eye has ever seen, nor has any ear heard, neither has any man’s mind ever imagined the wonderful things that God has in store for those who love Him (1Corinthians 2:9</strong>).” What an encouragement to us as Christians.

<strong>Application: What are we to do now, just around twiddling our thumbs and wait, no way? Be holy (1Thessalonians 3:13); be zealous for the Lord anticipating His return; be confident (Ephesians 6:12, Revelation 20:10); be an encouragement (1Thessalonians 4:16-18); and be mobilized telling others of His imminent return. The Scripture tells us, “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come (Matthew 24:14).” Are you living godly? If you or one of your loved ones are suddenly swept away by the cold hand of death, are you ready, and are they to stand before the Lord? Blessings Pastor Phil </strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mathew 23:39, "...Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord"</strong>

We all crave for blessings because blessings are very powerful. Blessings are signs of approval from someone you value their approval. For example, Kids want their parents to approve the relationships they are in and bless it. Esau was destined to receive his father's blessings but his brother pretended to be him and took it away. Esau upon hearing his lost opportunity for a blessing<strong>, "... he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me—me also, O my father!”</strong>", <strong>Genesis 27:34.</strong>Throught the bible you read of fathers blessing their children based on how they lived their lives. Blessings are very powerful!!!.<!--more-->

Why blessings? because blessings promote or contributes to the wellbeing of a person, it's a sign of approval. Blessings come with guidelines if we follow them. The fifth commandment is the only commandment with a promise, <strong>Exodus 20:5, "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God", </strong>sadly it’s commonly broken because a number have never learnt to honor their parents. God has destined this to be one means by which kids are blessed. Why do we have a generation that is into rebellion and we hear lives end young. I am convinced many people have denied the parents the honor God has set aside for them for this reason most have missed their blessings and heaped upon them curses. We cry, "Lord bless me" but greater blessings begin by keeping this promise. I know not of any parents who deserve such kind of honor due to what they did or failed to do. We honor them because God says so and not because they deserve it. This ought to be taught to all. <strong>Proverbs 20:20, "whoever curses his father or his mother, His lamp will be put out in deep darkness"</strong>. We could curse them by failing to honor them and therefore we are storing curses for ourselves, <strong>Proverbs 30:11, "There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother</strong>" and we live in that generation.

Everyone has a chance to be blessed and the blessings will come when we do what the Lord would have us do. <strong>Deuteronomy 28:1&amp;2, "Now it shall come to pass, if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all His commandments which I command you today, that the LORD your God will set you high above all nations of the earth. 2 And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of the LORD your God: </strong>". This shows that we can bring curses (forfeit) ourselves by not heeding to keep God's commandments, His Word. We cannot expect to be blessed if we violate the principles of His word

While we obey, doors of blessings will open and overtake us and we will turn the blessings back to God inform of praises. The bible says, "<strong>Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord</strong>", the only way you and I can come is because we value the commandments and we desire to keep them. Bless me-me also, O my Father. Make me also a blessing to others starting with my parents. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Corinthians 6:17, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him."</strong>

True religion is not found merely in external duties and acts of devotion. It is not found solely in intellectual understanding, nor in rapturous displays of emotion. These examples can all be faked, many of these are displayed in the most wicked of lives. Just look at the Pharisees. True religion, at its core, is what Paul speaks of here, the life of God in the soul of man. It is a union of the soul with God, a rejoining of the life to Christ through repentance and faith in the cross.<strong> Colossians 1:27</strong> says that Christ ‘in’ us is the hope of glory.<!--more-->

It is not our works, or words, but the reality of the presence of Jesus Christ within us. It is His holy life, His nature imparted within me. This cannot be faked, you either have it or you don’t. In Romans 8:16, Paul teaches us about the witness of the Holy Spirit, which this joining produces. It is the testimony of a clear conscience before God, and of an upright life. It is an inner life of holiness displayed outwardly as it defines everything we do. Simply, look at what you did last night. Did you spend your time in careful study of scripture, prayer, or Christ centered discussion? Or In front of the T.V., watching some godless program? Now one might say this is too much, but look at what else Paul says in regards to this life within us, earlier on in <strong>Romans 8, v. 5-8</strong>. He says that those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, in v. 6 he says to be carnally minded (which is to have the mind of the flesh) is death, and in v. 7 and 8 he closes this thought stating that this mind is in warfare with God, and that the individual in this state cannot please God. No acts of devotion, no outward works matter here, for those in the flesh cannot please God.

We must be joined to Him, as Peter says, being made a partaker of the Divine Nature. The life of Christ in me produces this nature, and God’s nature is holiness, not worldliness. An inner, vital spiritual union with God is the goal of the Christian, counting all as loss to attain this. I must come to the end of myself, and surrender my all to Christ. Jesus cannot merely be a part of my life, He must be my life. And I willingly forsake all else that is not of Him. All sin, all self, anything, I cast it away lest it stop me from entering His blessed presence. More than that, I cast it away, for I love God with all my heart, I love Him more than myself, and so I willingly do those things that are pleasing to Him. The true, born again experience produces this life. I cease to exist, only Christ lives. Friends, nothing in this life compares to the majesty of knowing God, and all those who have truly experienced God know this. If you lack this true experience, then seek God until He pours Himself into your life. Cast all else away, knowing God is the greatest.

In the love of Christ, and all for His glory, Brother Benjamen]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 11:28, &quot;Come to me, all ye, heavy laden and I will give you rest&quot;</strong>

In today's scenario, no one likes to meet any person, who is heavy laden or to help any such person or spend time with people who are very tensed, depressed or anxious for various reasons. <!--more-->
But our dear Lord invites such people who have heavy burdens, whatever the reason may be. Not only, it is an invitation of warm welcome followed by the assurance of PERFECT REST. <strong>1Peter 5:7, says &quot;Cast your burden on the Lord because He cares for you</strong>&quot; Yes God is bearing our burden and that too, gladly... For instance, a young child getting back from school with a very heavy bag , unable to carry it.. His/her mother or father will immediately run to the child and definitely take the heavy bag and give the child some relief ..Why ? The primary reason is love ...Yes, the love of the parents towards their children ...This is a shadow of God's love. Compared to the AGAPE love which is of God, even our earthly fathers falls short of His love.

One time I woke up only to remember the pressures I was to face during one particular day at office. I had auditors visiting and God strengthened me with this verse <strong>&quot;Praise be to the Lord, to God, our SAVIOR , who daily bears our burdens</strong>&quot; ..I immediately gathered courage for the day, miraculously witnessed God bring me out of this particular situation and every other. I praised God further for strengthening my faith to believe that He loves me and gladly bears my daily burdens...

What a blessing it is to be with the Lord who bears our burdens, who loves to listen to us, and also gives us rest despite attacks from Satan /enemies /troubles/ fears/ shocks/day today worries or whatever it is

<strong>Psalms 91 says &quot;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will REST in the shadow of the Almighty&quot;</strong> . What is this dwelling place? it’s a place where one lives/stays/resides/abides. Any person on earth goes home after the days' work ...generally ,a person loves to get back to his house/dwelling as often as possible , as early as possible.. Now let us meditate on God Himself being our dwelling ..

If we love our earthly dwelling, which is quite temporary, then how much more are we to love our heavenly, permanent dwelling -our temple Himself ? Do we love to stay in Him, reside in Him, abide in Him consistently and continuously? Not just for a season, or time period for a gain or a favor but forever and ever ...If we are inclined to spend time with Him, then we can be assured of His rest.. David states that He loves to stay in the temple of the Lord forever and ever. Yes, let us love to abide in Him and continue in Him so that we can enjoy the rest in His bosom for ever and ever... Let us all eagerly wait for the day when we , all will be in His loving fold, God Himself wiping our tears from our eyes, and providing us REST for eternity... , Sarah Susan]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 51:1 Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. PS 51:2 Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. PS 51:3 For I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me. PS 51:4 Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight,… PS 51:12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me. PS 51:13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you.</strong>

Repentance is term widely neglected in our time in preaching or sharing the gospel. <!--more-->
We say believe and you will be saved when it should be repent and believe. Psalm 51 is a beautiful passage dealing with repentance having been confronted.

What is the proper response to someone confronting us, or what kind of response do we look for in someone who has repented from their sin?

1. First someone must look immediately to the Lord. David acknowledged that only God had the mercy that he needed. Mercy is not getting what we do deserve. In other words we deserved death, hell and the grave, and the Lord gave us eternal life, heaven, and resurrection.

2. He asked God to wash him. Soap and water can clean the outside of us, but nothing but God can clean the inside. <strong>Ephesians 5:26</strong> speaks about being holy through<strong> “cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,…</strong>” <strong>John 7:38</strong> states, “<strong>Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of livingwater will flow from within him</strong>.” We need living water to flow throw and cleanse us.

3. David further says blot out my transgressions. In today’s society criminals get what is called in slang “a rap sheet” or a record of their offenses against the law. <strong>Psalm 90:8, “ You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. All things done in darkness will be revealed in the light”</strong>

4. In his search for forgiveness, the psalmist opens his sinful heart. To this end he uses the three synonyms for sin: &quot;transgressions,&quot; &quot;iniquity,&quot; and &quot;sin.&quot; David looked underneath his kingly robes to see his sinful heart. And we must look beneath our flesh at our sin as well.

5. David then professes against “<strong>Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight</strong>.” Question, is this a contradiction in Scripture? Didn’t David, because he broke all 10 of God’s Commandments, sin against more than just God alone? Didn’t he sin against Bathsheba (adultery), Uriah (murdered), and all of Israel as their king? Where is the asking of their forgiveness? Well he couldn’t ask Uriah for forgiveness, but he could have gone to the others. And I believe that his writing of this Psalm for all to read showed everyone how sorry he was for his sin. It served as a public apology. However no one that he sinned against was offended more than God, so his chief priority, as it should be ours, was to repent to the Lord and receive His forgives. Then as <strong>James 5:16</strong> states “<strong>Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective</strong>.” Going to a person that perhaps we’ve sinned against is a biblical principle as well, as long as you go in a humble spirit.

<strong>Application: Here is what we look for when confronting others, although we pray their heart is soft enough to receive it. When you are confronted repent quickly as well. Tomorrow we will look at part 2. </strong>

Blessings,
Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 51:1, “Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. PS 51:2 Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. PS 51:3 For I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me. PS 51:4 Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight,… PS 51:12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me. PS 51:13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you.</strong>

Yesterday we took a look at responding to confrontation. David pleaded for God’s mercy, cleansing, for God not to keep record (a heavenly rap sheet) He developed the godly sorrow he had of offending God personally. <!--more-->
Today let’s examine what David proclaimed he would do when he was forgiven.

Here David offers a prayer for a heart of wisdom and for full restoration to once again experience divine favor.

1. He first proclaimed that God would bring a restoration of joy. David would experience a breath of fresh air because God is in the business of restoration. Satan steals and kills lives, Christ gives it back and restores our relationship back with the Father. God's displeasure with sin brings judgment, metaphorically described as broken bones, so His pleasure brings joy of heart. The joy is more than an emotional expression; it is a contented resting in God. Once again David will experience the security of having been reconciled with the Lord and of having peace with him.

<strong>Romans 5:1-2</strong> reads, <strong>“Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God</strong>.” Peace with God is of great importance.

2. Secondly David shares that after he once again has that joy restored of salvation and peace with God that he would do something with it. David wasn’t just waiting around to die so he could be with the Lord. No, he felt a spiritual responsibility as king to teach transgressors (law breakers) God’s ways and cause sinners to turn back to the Lord. David knew what it was like on both sides of the fence, that is to say in God’s favor and out of God’s favor. But didn’t God love David you may ask? Yes, but God was sorely displeased with him. We see later in his life that God would not allow the son conceived in adultery to be born despite David’s fasting, and pleading with God.

Is our job any different? The moment you are born again (John 3:3), born of water and the spirit (John 3:5) you automatically become a missionary. Remember Jesus’ confrontation of the woman at the well in John 4? After she experienced her forgiveness the Scriptures record that she stirred up the whole town to come to Christ. Look at this spiritual baby missionary.

Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, &quot;<strong>He told me everything I ever did.&quot; So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. And because of his words many more became believers.”</strong> <strong>(John 4:39-41) </strong>Only Christ can cause an ex-prostitute to bring a whole town to the Savior. Look at this new converts heart to reach her town.

<strong>Application: If you are not at peace with God, repent quickly. IF you are at peace with God then bring all those you know to Christ, the Savior they too so desperately need. </strong>
Blessings,
Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Corinthians 13:1-13, “4 Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 5 does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 6 does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things 8 Love never fails”. </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6200" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="212" /></a></strong>

We have safes we keep valuable stuff we don’t want anyone or anything to interfere with; they are very precious to us. My wife and I have a fire resistant safe; in it we keep valuable things such as marriage certificate, passports, important documents and the like because we don’t want to lose them either by theft, misplacement and/or fire. Now a fire-resistant safe is a type of safe that is designed to protect its contents from high temperatures or actual fire. Fire resistant safes are usually rated by the amount of time they can withstand the extreme temperatures a fire produces, while not exceeding a set internal temperature.<!--more-->

And so are marriages, there are qualities that must be put in a safe because they are precious to you and unless your safe is built with fire resistant materials, it’s bound to suffer when fire comes. <strong>Proverbs 4:23, “Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life”</strong>. Don’t we hear people say, “<em>follow your heart</em>”, however the heart is deceitful above all things, it wants things for itself, we are told “<em>to keep it with all diligence</em>”. Unguarded heart is a heart that may not survive the heat that come from the fire of life even in a marriage. A heart that is surrendered to God is a heart that has been placed in a safe, <strong>Matthew 6:21, “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”</strong>. To “<em>follow your heart</em>” is setting yourself for disaster. You ought to “<i>lead your heart”</i> not follow it.

There’s a quote from the movie (Fireproof), Lt. Michael Simmons says, <strong>“Fireproof doesn’t mean the fire will never come, it means when the fire comes that you will be able to withstand it”. </strong>I believe many marriages are exposed, hearts left unattended, the things that should have been guarded have been left in the open and the enemy knows how to take what is left exposed and sets it on fire. His mission is simple in that “<strong>The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy”, John 10:10. </strong>He parades to you that you are better than the current situation, that you deserve better, that you cannot waste your life. All he wants to do and he has done many times to other people is to let people think about themselves. Marriages have been viewed by many as, “<em>what’s in it for me?”</em> and that is the driving force for love. Look at what Paul says what love is NOT, “<strong>4 ... love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 5 does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 6 does not rejoice in iniquity”. </strong>In other words, these are NOT the things you and your spouse should keep in your fire resistant safe, if you do, they will destroy from the inside. True love is not what it gets but what it gives<strong>, </strong>but you cannot give what you’ve not guarded in the safe<strong>. </strong>These are the qualities you and your spouse ought to safeguard, protect, nature at all cost because fire will come against them. Remember <strong>vs.”4 Love suffers long and is kind, love rejoices in the truth,(God’s word); 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 8 Love never fails”.</strong>

Fires of financial challenges will come, parasites inform of people, health challenges, misunderstandings, disagreements, be sure you have what is valuable in your marriage safe to withstand the fire when it comes, Lead your heart to true love as defined by God and not by the world’s definition.

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Nehemiah 8:5-6, "5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. 6 And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God. Then all the people answered, Amen, Amen! while lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground"</strong>

Many say the word Amen, but few know what it actually means! Have you ever said Amen in church, at a conference, or at a ministry training either quietly or out loud? What does the word Amen mean, why do you say it, and what does it mean when you say it?<!--more-->


John Piper writes,  "In most languages of the world where Christianity has taken root the word &quot;Amen&quot; has been taken over untranslated. Listen to a person pray in Chinese or Japanese or Swahili or Maninka or German or French or Russian or Arabic, and very likely there is at least one word you will understand: &quot;Amen&quot; - pronounced differently perhaps, but discernible. One of the reasons for this is that the Greek New Testament took it over from the Hebrew Old Testament untranslated (even though the Greek Old Testament [the Septuagint, LXX] rarely did, using &quot;let it be&quot; [] instead of &quot;amen&quot; [])."

So what we have, all over the world today is a word, &quot;Amen&quot; that is a direct transliteration - not translation - of the Hebrew &quot;Amen&quot;. Now we see from our text that the word was taken to Corinth, a Greek city speaking the Greek language which did not have a word &quot;amen.&quot; And, within a matter of weeks or months, Paul and the other missionaries had already begun to transform the Corinthian culture by grafting a brand new word onto their great Greek language. It wasn't the only one. Paul also taught them the Aramaic words &quot;maranatha&quot; (<strong>1Corinthians 16:22</strong>, Marana qa) - &quot;Lord, come.&quot; And, of course, he taught them a vision of reality that exploded many of their preconceptions.

In the Old Testament the word &quot;amen&quot; was mainly a congregational response to give a strong affirmation or agreement - to a curse or a word of praise to God. In, Deuteronomy 27:16 the Levites say, "&quot;<strong>'Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</strong>&quot;" That is, we agree with that curse, so let it be. Therefore, they affirmed curses as well as blessings. This is not something that generally goes through ones mind in the modern church service when one says Amen. Yet, we should say Amen to everything that aligns with the word of God, whether we read it, or hear it preached, and whether it speaks about a blessing or a curse, a blessing or a judgment.

Look at what took place during the time of Ezra when he was open air preaching in <strong>Nehemiah 8:111</strong> (please read the whole thing).

First, there was a gathering and a standing, to hear the Law of God. This expressed the great reverence the people had for it. Secondly, there was preaching of the Law and the blessing of the God of the Law. Thirdly, there was an understanding of the Law because of the exposition or explanation of Gods Law. Fourthly, because of the explanation of Gods Law, there was the understanding of Gods Law. This is paramount, because many understand what the text of the Bible says, but not what it means. We help people understand what it means by using hermeneutics, which is discovering the authors intent through the historical context of the text at hand. Fifthly, there was an answering that took place, showing the people agreed with Gods Law and this is where the Amen was shouted and a lifting of the hands! The agreement with the mouth and outward accompanying praise of the body (lifting the hands) took place among the people. And finally, there was worshipping, which is the proper response to Gods holy Law. This whole scene was a glorious account which you too should say a hearty Amen. Oh how we should long to see this type of reverence for Gods Word, and preaching that pierces the heart which causes people to say Amen! John Piper again shares, The &quot;amen&quot; meant, &quot;Yes, we agree with your blessing! We join in your blessing! All that you have said of God's greatness we let it echo in our Amen. We say, &quot;True, and firm and reliable is what you have said.&quot;

However, people say Amen for much lesser things, and usually when it is all about them. Perhaps I should not use the term lesser, but many do in fact Amen when it is about them and are not consistent, when it is purely about God. For example, a man gets a promotion at work, and says, Amen, but the preacher says, God is holy and there is no Amen. Yet it was the holy God that blessed me with the job, and because the job was a blessing, the man focused on the blessing and not on the One who gave the blessing, namely God! Furthermore, people say Amen to things that are totally unbiblical as well. When someone such as the famous Joel Osteen does his motivation speaking, many say Amen, even when he only tells stories and uses the Bible out of context. It is up to Gods people to study Gods Word, and to say Amen when the preacher not the motivation speaker, preaches what is in line with Gods Word. Would the people of Ezras day say Amen if he were merely motivational preaching. Yes there are many that gather to hear many of the preachers on the television, but are the things that are being preached worth an Amen? Be mindful of what you are saying Amen to. When you say Amen you are saying you agree with what you have read, or heard preached.

Would you say Amen to the first part of this message? Well that depends if it is biblical, and if you agree with the truth, or if it is unbiblical and if you are more concerned about pleasing God than hurting my feelings.

To be continuedBlessings, Phil, the evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 72:18–20, “18 Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, Who only does wondrous things! 19And blessed be His glorious name forever! And let the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen and Amen. 20The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended”</strong>

This Psalm of Solomon, son of David brings this powerful psalm concerning the <strong>Glory and Universality of the Messiah’s Reign. At the end of this psalm </strong>what was his focus?
<!--more-->

First, he focused on the Blessings. He wanted God’s name to be eternally blessed for all the wondrous things he has done. Many people long to leave a legacy behind for themselves, making a name for themselves based on the “good things” they hope to be remembered for. Solomon was known for his wisdom, his influence, his wealth, his temple, etc… Yet, in his psalm did he focus on himself? Nope! Did he perhaps focus on any of his greatness, of the greatness of his father David? Solomon wanted God’s name to be remembered more, than he desired his own name to be remembered. Not only did he want God’s name to be blessed, but he also desired that the whole earth would be filled with the glory of God. He wanted the whole earth to be filled the very glory of God. What does Solomon see the earth is filled with if not the glory of God? There is war, disease, death, burdens, destruction, etc…, but Solomon desires that “God’s glory, is to be a holy site of worship, where God makes his presence known (cf. <strong>Exodus. 40:34–35; 1Kings 8:10–11),</strong> and this prayer is that the whole earth be such a sanctuary (cf. note on <strong>Isaiah 6:3</strong>).<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>” Then he says Amen and Amen! This is to say, he agrees with this blessing and yes let him say again he agrees. I imagine he desires if you will, for the whole of creation to say amen and amen that it is filled by the very glory of God, as it was at one time, apart from any residue or presence of sin.

<strong>Psalm 72:19</strong> The filling of the earth with God’s glory will be fulfilled in the consummation <strong>Revelation 21:22–27, “22 And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. 23 And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. 24 By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, 25 and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. 26 They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. 27 But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.”</strong>

This is the picture that Solomon longs for. Amen! Is this what you long for? Do you long to say Amen, not for Solomon’s temple, but the temple of the Lord? Do you long to say Amen, to abide in a city that has NO need of the sun, for the light of the Lord and His glory will be all the light that will ever be needed or desired? Do you say Amen that all the nations will walk by his glorious light that in the Lamb of God that draws the very nations unto Himself? Do you say Amen, that all the kings and rulers of the earth will bring their glory before the Lord and that their glory will be shrouded only by the greatest glory, the Glory of the Lord Himself! All sin will be eradicated, for no sin can dwell in His presence. Even now does your heart cry out for this reality with a hearty, AMEN! Only those that are born again will be there? There will not be one detestable, false convert, false preacher, heretic, or false teacher present. Many think that their name is written in that book, and many are mistaken. <strong>Matthew 7:21-23</strong> reminds us of this grave reality. Are you truly born again, and is your name written in heaven? Are you saying Amen or ouch! Let us reach the lost so they too may know the glorious Lamb of God, and join the Church of Jesus in saying Amen and Amen! The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “<strong>Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity (2Timothy 2:14),”</strong> therefore those who have their name chiseled in the Lamb’s book of Life will be the only ones present. Will that be YOU? Are you saying Amen! Whether someone is gloriously saved or one goes to the Lake of fire, the name of the Lord will be praised and we can say Amen and Amen. Oh, how I look forward to the day when the Messiah will rule and reign forevermore and to that I say AMEN and AMEN!

Until the nets are filled….Blessings, Phil, the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Corinthians 14:13-16, “Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. 15 What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. 16 Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying (– please read the whole context starting at verse 1)?”</strong>

A great bulk of today’s continued message will come from the writing of one of our favorites, John Piper. His message on “amen”, really inspired, and I gleaned much from it, as I both read and listened to the message, I would encourage you to do the same.<!--more-->

John Piper shares “Paul would bring the word “Amen” to the Greek culture. This is a most interesting journey. Bringing the word &quot;Amen&quot; to Greece is a little microcosm of what happens spiritually and intellectually and culturally wherever Christianity comes to a new culture. It brings a vision of God and the world that keeps some things in the culture, rejects other things in the culture, and touches everything in the culture. There are no pure cultures, especially ours. Every culture needs more words and more concepts and more ways of viewing the world and deeper combinations of emotions and different patterns of behaving than is native to itself. This word “amen” has seeped into cultures all over the world, which displays that no culture, no language, no worship is complete in itself. Our vocabularies are limited and cannot fully express all the feelings, emotions, thought patterns which people attempt to convey. But let's be more specific. What did the word &quot;amen&quot; come to Corinth to do? What did this Hebrew word mean as it grafted itself onto the Greek vocabulary of Corinthian Christians?” We know that over time words change, new words are created, and this is why there is different translations of the Bible. How could most understand the Bible if it were still in Latin only, or Greek, Hebrew, or Aramaic? Most of us would be reliant on the preacher (which is what happened in Roman Catholicism, where the people were reliant on the priests, because most common people could not read Latin). Amen has become a word common to many languages, and it is Christianity with such servants like Paul, that is responsible for that blessed reality.”

<strong>&quot;Amen&quot; in the New Testament</strong>

Piper continues, “Now here comes Paul into Greek-speaking Corinth, and he teaches them about this word &quot;Amen,&quot; - just as if he were to come to us today with a new Hebrew word we didn't know. What did he teach them? Well, we can see behind <strong>1Corinthians 14</strong>. Paul is concerned that the gift of tongues is being abused in public so that people are speaking what nobody can understand. He is not rejecting the gift of tongues. But he is putting something way above it in the Christian assembly. He is saying that edification comes not by amazement at miracles, but edification comes by the understanding of God. That's why verse 19 says that five intelligible words that help you understand God are better than a thousand unintelligible words that make you tremble with amazement.

Paul is extremely zealous that public speaking (whether prayer or preaching) be an event of group understanding and group agreement - not one person doing his own thing and others boggled. Not even one person doing his own thing and others understanding and silent. What then? His answer is just beneath the surface in <strong>verses 15-16</strong>:

What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also. Otherwise if you bless in the spirit only, how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted say the &quot;Amen&quot; at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?

Paul assumes something here. He assumes that when a public prayer is made, other <strong>people besides the one praying say, &quot;Amen.&quot;</strong> Let's not miss this. It seems to matter to Paul. He could have just said: don't pray in tongues because nobody can understand you and so nobody is built up in their faith, because faith comes by an understood word of Christ. Or he could have said always have an interpretation. But he said more. He said (verse 16): If you pray so people can't understand you, how will they say &quot;Amen&quot;?”

Piper makes some powerful assessments about this passage. When we pray, we do so unto God, but in a corporate setting we also affect the body of Christ that we are gathered with at that time. It was this affect that Evans had on me when I first met my best friend as we prayed in the mornings at our church. Many silently or quietly prayed, until I heard a prayer of thunder, fervency, and zealousness. My prayer life has never been the same since beginning to pray with my best friend Evans. His prayer caused my heart to shout, Amen! I began to get more excited about prayer, and the “amen” continued to be expressed when we would pray together. This is not inspiration such as a painter that is inspired to paint a scenic horizon off in the distance. Rather this is inspiration as the Holy Spirit was working through a life changed by the Gospel! There are few that I can pray with that cause the “amen” to rise up in me. When someone mature and zealous for God is praying alongside you, do you agree in prayer, “amen” with that person? This tends to happen with those that are like-hearted toward the things of God. Hence the things that God loves we should love, and when two or more are praying it would seem a harmony is being played before the throne of grace. Yet when we pray we should be able to understand what is being petitioned concerning, God exalted, souls interceded for, etc…. <strong>To be continued…</strong>

Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Phil, the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Corinthians 14:13-16 “Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. 15 What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. 16 Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying</strong> (– please read the whole context starting at verse 1)?

<strong>"Amen" Affirms Others in the Body</strong><!--more-->

John Piper again shares, “What if someone says to Paul, "I don't care if people say "Amen" to my prayers"? Or what if someone says, "That's not my tradition or my personality to say anything out loud in a group"? What would Paul say? I think he would say, “This is not about personal taste. It's not about traditions of High-Church or low-church. It's not about culture, say, African-American culture versus Swedish-American culture. It's about God's will for corporate worship, rooted in age-old Biblical patterns of prayer and preaching, and captured in a word that crosses all cultures.”

It is awesome that people from different cultures can be drawn not by a sport, or music, or some hobby of sorts, but rather prayer toward the Living and true God of Heaven and Earth. This is what drew a guy from Kenya, and a guy from New York to become best of friends in prayer. It is preached and said that Jesus is a personal Lord and Savior, but where is the corporate Body of Christ in that description? Some treat Christ as if he is their own personally designed Savior, designed just for their needs and lifestyle. This is not a description of Christ, but of a genie. The identity of Christ MUST be drawn from Scripture first and foremost, not from your experience. There is participation in corporate worship on the biblical Christ that is why it is in fact corporate. America is very much about individualism and independence but Christianity is not about that. Christianity is about interdependence, whereby we are dependent upon our shepherd in the midst of our fellow sheep that Christ works through to strengthen one another. There are a host of terms such as “one another” in the Scriptures, therefore we can see that Christ works the Church, therefore we do not gather to be individualistic, and hence there would be no need then to gather. “<strong><a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/the.html">The</a> etymological notion underlying <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/to.html">to</a>gether is <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/of.html">of</a> ‘gathering’ <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/thing.html">things</a> into <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/one.html">one</a><a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/group.html">group</a>. <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/it.html">It</a> was formed <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/from.html">from</a> <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/the.html">the</a> prepos<a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/it.html">it</a>ion <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/to.html">to</a> <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/and.html">and</a> the element *gad- denoting ‘association, company’, <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/which.html"> which</a> <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/also.html"> also</a> <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/lie.html"> lies</a> <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/behind.html">behind</a> <a href="http://www.word-origins.com/definition/gather.html">gather</a> (<a href="http://www.word-origins.com/">http://www.word-origins.com</a>). </strong>

Piper further explains, “<em>I think Paul would say, God is calling us not to be isolated, silent, encapsulated individuals in worship. Privately coming, privately hearing, privately going, with no one able to tell what we love and cherish and long for, because we haven't expressed resonance - an echo, an empathy - with anything. I think he would say that God is calling us out of our cocoons of emotional isolation and invisible, inaudible, unshared responsiveness. <strong>I think he would say, it's God's will that we echo the excellence of God in preaching and prayer - that we express our affirmation of the truth of God in the Word, and that we resonate verbally with Godward longings and yearnings in prayer</strong>. Let me mention two more reasons for making more of this than we do, and provide some practical suggestions. Consider 2 Corinthians 1:20. This is the passage that gives "Amen" its clearest and deepest meaning. <strong>"For as many as are the promises of God, in Him [that is, in Christ] they are yes [which is a translation of "amen"]; therefore, also through Him is our 'Amen' to the glory of God through us." </strong>Now what Paul is doing here is precisely what I am trying to do this morning. He is taking the familiar word "Amen," and trying to fill it back up with the <strong>theological freight</strong> that words so quickly lose, so that it has meaning and weight and power to it when we use it.”</em>

Words lose their meaning at times over time, or the meaning changes. This all depends upon the person using the term and what they mean when they use a particular term. In the public school I work in, I fortunately and unfortunately get to hear all of the latest New York City slang, and hear firsthand concerning words. “OMG” means “Oh my God” and it is using the name of the Lord in a blasphemous manner, which I hear daily. “oh my God” used to always be used in reverence toward the Lord, however, many have simply degraded it, and take the name of the Lord in vain, thus breaking the third commandment. Let us make a BIG deal about the very words used in Scripture, such as “amen.” Let us “amen” that which the Lord would “amen” agree with. If the Lord himself would not agree then why are so many professing Christians say “amen”? I would venture to say that many don’t know the Lord, and many are biblically illiterate. I often see in churches that people don’t worship God in spirit and in truth (John 4:24), but rather in the flesh and in lies! Can you really sing songs such as “I surrender all”, really have you done so? Can you sing, “I am desperate for you”, yet you are more desperate for other things rather than Him? This is why Paul says, “<strong>I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also.”</strong>Your mind must not become disengaged and take a back seat and allow your emotions to takes center stage. No, your mind and emotions must be side by side in the driver’s seat. When you sing this week, be <strong>mindful and emotional</strong> and worship in spirit and truth, and spirit and mind. To be continued….

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Corinthians 1:20–22),“20 For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. 2 And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, 22 and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee. Christ Is God's "Amen!" (English standard version)</strong>

<em>The IVP Bible background commentary shares that f</em>rom Troas in Asia (1:8), one could sail to Macedonia, and come overland down to Corinth, as Paul had done before (<strong>Acts 16:11–12</strong>) and planned to do again (<strong>1Corinthians 16:5</strong>), and finally did later (<strong>Acts 20:1–3</strong>). <strong>1:17.</strong> Paul had been unable to fulfill his stated intention. As he says in 1:23, his decision not to stop at Corinth was to “spare” them; instead he sent Titus ahead with a harsh letter (1:23–2:11; 7:7–12). When Titus did not return to the appointed meeting place in Troas, Paul feared for him (given the dangers of traveling in antiquity) and went on into Macedonia (2:12–13). There Paul met up with Titus again, who gave him good news about them (7:5–16).<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Digressions were standard in ancient writing, and Paul here digresses (1:18–22) to assure them that he indeed had a good reason for not coming; he was a representative of the God who always kept his word, and he proclaimed a faithful gospel. “Amen” functioned as a positive affirmation at the end of a prayer, and Christ became the amen and yes to all the biblical promises of a truly faithful God<a title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><!--more-->

If you recall the promises of God throughout the Bible, also the format of (Deuteronomy 27:15-26) whereby the people shouted “amen,” now Paul pulls from this backdrop and he says: We utter out “Amen” to God for His<strong> glory. The Glory of God, is what God is all about. God is chiefly concerned with his glory. Many people that speak about God do so starting with humanity. I can think of a well known song that</strong> has as part of the lyrics, “<em>crucified, laid behind a stone; you lived to die rejected and alone, like a stone trampled on the ground, you took the fall and thought of ME above all.”</em> This may come as a shocker, but this song has inaccurate theology. Christ was thinking about glorifying His Father, and not about you or I. Perhaps you think that sounds selfish of God, but fail to realize that God exists for His own glory, and the best thing for us to do is to live for His glory as well. The Westminster Shorter Catechism asks the question, <strong>“What is the chief end of man”?</strong> It answers the question by stating, “<strong><em>Man’ s chief end is to glorify God</em></strong>, (1Corinthians 10:31, Romans 11:36) <strong><em>and to enjoy him for ever</em></strong>. (Psalm 73:25–28)”

John Piper shares beautifully how the glory of God and the “amen” meet saying, <em>“He [Paul] says first that Christ is God's "Yes" to all the promises of the Bible: "As many are the promises of God, in him they are Yes." Christ is God's Amen to all that he has spoken. Christ affirms them and even secures them by his blood. The fact that you don't deserve God's promise to pursue you with goodness and mercy all your days, is now no obstacle. Christ has taken your ill-desert on him, and put his righteousness on you. He is God's yes to all the promises in your life. For his sake you will get them if you trust him</em>.” You see God judged Christ as if He lived your life, so He can judge you as if you lived Christ’s life. How can you not say ‘Amen” out of sheer gratitude to a gracious Father! Piper continues “Then he says, in verse 20b, ". . . <em>therefore, also through Him is our 'Amen' to the glory of God." In other words, <strong>the reason we say "Amen"</strong> through Christ when we hear the promises of God preached or hear a prayer of longing for the promises of God to be fulfilled, <strong>is that Christ has said "Amen" to us. He is God's "Amen" to us</strong>.<strong> God says "Amen" to us through Christ in the cross, and we respond with "Amen" to God through Christ in preaching and prayer.</strong> So that's one more reason we should make more of this echo of agreement than we do in corporate worship and prayer</em>.”

Do you ever think about your “amen” and agreeing with God? Our “amen” should be in that which lines up with the will of God. What is God’s will and where is it found? God’s will is gloriously revealed in His life changing Word. May you look at Christ as God’s glorious “amen” on the cross, and see the eternal Christ as the one that drank the cup of the wrath of God on those that He has gloriously saved by His grace. As you sit with your Bible as see the Word of God, you should “amen” as you read its awesome truth, and see the reality of applying these truths to your life. It is amazing how many sit in churches each week, hear the truths of God’s Word, perhaps say “amen” and then go home and do NOTHING by the way of application. What does your “amen” mean to the Lord, if you allow the truth to “stay in the walls of the church” because you did not absorb it in your life? The Word of God is to be realized, savored and applied to the life of the believer. There will be a hunger to do what God’s Word says. The Jews said, “amen: if you will that they were children of Abraham, yet Christ said, “31 So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, “<strong><em>If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” 33 They answered him, “We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, ‘You will become free’</em></strong>?” We have the answer to that question, we can become free in Christ, the offspring of Abraham, to which we have become His offspring if we are in Christ having been grafted into the vine. Go and search the glories of God’s Word and as you apply it, may that be your “amen” as it displays your agreement with God.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><em>Hebrews 10:24-25, </em>“24 And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.”<em> (, NKJV)</em></strong>

This final part in our series on “amen” to say or not to say will focus on prayer and the word more directly, although it was certainly touched on in previous parts. Can you imagine if you just poured your heart out to someone, and there was no response? How would you know if your wife liked or disliked something you shared? If you were sharing something precious to you with another person, such as the birth of your new child in the world, can you imagine if they were indifferent to what you just shared, how discouraging that would be? <!--more-->Now think of the average prayer meeting. Many seem to become gossip sessions instead of prayer meetings when people say things like, “Oh Lord, help John Smith with his gambling issues, and to stop beating his wife,” when no one in the congregation knew that. Perhaps these things have only happened to me, but I doubt it. When we pray together, God should be the main focus, but you and I can certainly be “cheerleaders” and encouragers for someone that is pouring their heart out to the same Lord you pour yours out to. <strong>Where is the “amen” when we pray together</strong>? John Piper shares. <em> “As others pray, you whisper, "Amen." Whisper, "Yes, yes." Whisper, "Umhm." Whisper, "Do it, Lord." I say whisper, partly because I want to make it easy for you, and partly because you're not supposed to take over or draw attention to yourself. The murmur of quiet "Amens" and "Yes" and "Umhm" is like background music that supports the one who's praying and joins him in the prayer. And at the end of a prayer a deeply felt "Amen" in unison is a powerful moment before the throne of grace.</em>” Once again, it was this type of experience in the Lord, which drew me toward Evans. When he prayed, a volcanic eruption of agreement my “amen” began to spew forth from my heart, because there was agreement to what he was praying, and at that first encounter I did not even know Evans, but I did know the same Lord he knew. Honestly, I have a hard time really getting that sense of encouragement in prayer in most prayer gatherings, because the same heartbeat doesn’t seem to resonate. It’s easy to gather and to be routine and dead in a prayer gather, just going through the program type motions, but oh how awesome it is when people are in agreement together!

The above verse commands us to consider one another. The word “Consider” is the translation of<em>katanoeo</em>(κατανοεο) which speaks of attentive, continuous care. The exhortation is to take careful note of each other’s spiritual welfare. The purpose of this attentive, continuous care is to provoke each other to the exercise of love and good works. The word “provoke” is the translation of<em>paroxusmos</em>(παροξυσμος) which means “an inciting, incitement, a stimulation.” The word is used also in a bad sense, for instance, “irritation.” Here it is used in its good sense, that of a stimulation. Vincent says: “The new economy demands mutual care on the part of the members of the Christian community … They must stir up each other’sreligious affections and ministries. Another way to translate it it, “And let us constantly be giving careful attention to one another for the purpose of stimulating one another to love and good works. ”<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><em>Do you consider one another in when you are praying together? </em>

<strong>Where is the “amen “ when the word of God is preached?</strong> When I was looking for a church, one of the criteria I looked for was the centrality of the Word of God in exegetical preaching. This was not easy to come across. It is so much easier for pastors not to labor in study over the Word of God, but to get a sermon off the internet. How would I say “amen” when the Word was not being preached? There would be no stirring up, no encouragement to be a slave for Christ, no conviction to forsake sin, no challenge to live holy, no agreement that God’s Word really changes lives when obeyed. Thank God, Pastor Bill Kanych and John Cornachhio were both men that studied the Word. As a man that went to Bible college, and as one that studies God’s Word myself, I was able to judge if their preaching was biblical, exegetical, and God honoring.

Once again looking to the above scripture we see the word forsake, <em>(10:25) “The word “forsaking” is the translation of egkataleipo (ἐγκαταλειπο) which means “to let down, to abandon.” “Assembling” is the translation of episunagoge (ἐπισυναγογε). The word is a compound of ago (ἀγο) “to go,” sun (συν) “with,” and epi (ἐπι). Sun (Συν) and ago (ἀγο) come over into English in the word “synagogue,” the meeting place of the Jews other than the temple at Jerusalem. Alford suggests two reasons for the addition of epi (ἐπι). It was used by the writer to take away the Judaistic sound of sunagoge (συναγογε). Or, it might point to the individual meeting places of the various assemblies. <strong> Some of the recipients of this letter were, under stress of persecution, absenting themselves from the Christian assemblies.</strong> They are exhorted not to egkataleipo (ἐγκαταλειπο), that is, let down in their attendance upon these meetings, or abandon them. They are, on the other hand to exhort each other to continued attendance, and in view of the fact of the approach of the time when the Lord would come. One can translate it this way, “Not letting down on the assembling of ourselves together, even as the custom of certain is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as ye see the day drawing near.<a title="" href="#_ftn2"><strong>[2]</strong></a>” </em>We need to assemble together, like each piece of yarn to make the whole picture of the tapestry. How helpful are the pieces with being interwoven together? Imagine if a group of archeologists were on a dig, and one discovered an ancient city during their excavation. Would the others not gather around, and become excited, and want to get in on the good news. Then when a man of God is excavating the wonderful treasures found in God’s Word should we not also gather around the Word of God, and let him know that we are in agreement, and excited about the treasure he is sharing with us? We are to “stir” one another up which is the Greek word <em>paroxusmos</em> (παροξυσμός, 3948), “a sharpening of the feeling, or action” it causes the effect of irritation.”<a title="" href="#_ftn3"> [3]</a><strong>We must stir one another by the Word of God…“AMEN!”</strong>

Let us stir one another to gather <strong>ESPECIALLY</strong> as the Day is approaching (when the Lord Jesus will return). His children with all creation will say “AMEN” at His return, and His enemies will be in peril, and curse His descending to the earth! “<em>God knows this about worship and preaching. That is why for 4,000 years he has made it simple for us: he has prepared a word. "Amen." There is no talk here about shouting or dominating or distracting. This is simply the call to make preaching and praying a corporate exultation in the supremacy of God. It is a call for authentic heartfelt expressions of "Yes" and "Amen."</em> (John Piper)” May “amen” mean more to you now than ever. Amen!

<strong>Blessings, until the nets are filled…Phil, the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt; </strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 17:46, "THIS DAY the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you... that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel"</strong>

There is something about <strong>"THIS DAY (TODAY)", </strong>which is present tense that has to be addressed otherwise we start dwelling on either yesterday which is past tense or think of tomorrow which is future tense. God has given us today to make good use as we live one day at a time. There is a song we used to sing, "<strong>One day at a time sweet Jesus, that's all I'm asking from you, just give me strength to do every day what I have do, yesterday is gone sweet Jesus, and tomorrow may never be mine, Lord help me today, show me the way one day at a time".</strong><!--more-->

Over and over again the bible addresses today, Jesus said, "<strong>do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will take care of itself</strong>" in other words, deal with what you have today, what has already been supplied. Worrying about tomorrow or something that has not happened yet is not healthy for there is a possibility of wasting today. Today's wasted can never be recovered, for time is precious. I'm learning most of these the hard way. "<strong>Choose ye this day whom you will serve". </strong>

There are things we need to do that many times we neglect them thinking that we have a lot of time to do them another day. This is where the word procrastination comes in. <strong>Procrastination is to postpone or delay needlessly, to put off doing something, especially out of habitual carelessness or laziness</strong>. Someone said, <strong>procrastination is the thief of time</strong>to which I am a victim. Procrastination becomes very serious when something of priority is neglected, for example, there are people reading this who have not repented of their sins and put their trust in Jesus Christ alone for their eternal salvation. They are still procrastinating with an idea , <em>“I have a lot of time to one day do it</em>”. If tomorrow is promised to no one, <strong>today is your day of salvation.</strong> <strong>Salvation should be a priority because the day of the Lord is approaching.</strong>

To put this to perspective, let’s look at David facing Goliath. For 40 days the Israelites under the leadership of Saul had been threatened and constantly postponed or delayed needlessly their attack, later David comes into the scene and sees an opportunity to do something for there was a man who was blaspheming the name of the Living God. Remember David was not supposed to be here, he was not a warrior at this point, had no training or weapons, and had no army back up yet he is not even looking for time to go and train, build up an army and get his weapons. He understands that if he is going to fight, it's either now or never. David speaks, <strong>1Samuel 17:46, "This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you... that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel". This day, today, this hour I need to deal with this</strong>. As he is saying "this day", he has God in mind to help him overcome this day. I have so many Goliaths I have been delaying fighting because of the fear just like Saul and his people. I don't want to postpone them for tomorrow or another day, I want to face them today. You can tell that they did not mention the name of the Lord in their situation therefore for 40 days, they were afraid of facing one man. David comes to win not tomorrow but today. Not only is he planning on winning today, he has a strategy of doing it, 1. <strong>the Lord will deliver you in my hands</strong>; 2. <strong>I will strike you and take your head from you</strong>; 3. <strong>my reason for doing this is to let the whole earth know that there is a God in Israel</strong>. Imagine the time lost (40 days), they could have used that time to do better things if they had David's spirit and strategy.

Procrastination is a condition we have to deal with, certain moves and decisions need to be made, things to accomplish. Delaying them may not help resolve them. Postponing paying bills, certain duties and tasks, certain responsibilities is not healthy. Let's all begin to identify things we have been putting aside that we need to deal with, face, fight and say like David, "<strong>This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand"</strong>. The Lord is giving us grace to deal with this day, check this out,<strong> Exodus 32:29, “For Moses had said, consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you blessings this day", Deuteronomy 11:26, "Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse". </strong>If the Lord is mostly talking about this day, we too can live one day at a time dealing with things we have been postponing for so long. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Philippians 4:19, </strong>“<strong>But my God shall supply all my needs according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus”</strong>

<strong>Most worry is about things that can’t be changed (the past), things that can’t be controlled (the present), things that might not happen (the future).</strong>

Have you ever worried about anything lately? What is it that you worried about? How much did your worries do to change the situation positively? Were you better off after you worried than you were before?<!--more-->

I am sure we all have worried about something. We wouldn’t be human if we didn’t. And we wouldn’t discover that God cares about us enough to encourage us and reassure us of his ever present hand to help us in time of need. We also wouldn’t have reason to come to God in prayer and seek His guidance and will, in all matters that causes us to worry. So, in a way, worry is not totally bad and negative. There are positive aspects of worry. For example, worries may be a motivator and a jump starter in your life to get you started on doing something urgently or abandoning something because you are worried about the possible consequences or outcome of no action or poor decision. On the other hand, worry can have serious negative effects on one’s life. Worries can trigger physical ailments like ulcer or cancer or headache etc. Someone once said that <strong>“People get ulcers not so much from what they eat as from what eats them.” </strong>Worry is a silent and consistent and determined consumer of its victims. It paralyzes and in most cases hinders us from moving forward to our desired destinations. Worries also, in many cases, prevent us from maximizing our potential. We all have potential of doing or becoming anything, but evil or a failure, if we live godly life. The Scripture says in <strong>Philippians 4:13</strong> that <strong>“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”</strong> The seed of greatness and victory and blessings is hidden in all of us. That seed needs a chance to grow to its’ maximum potential for our good and for the generation to come. You and I are here because our parents allowed themselves to be stretched so they could allow the seeds in them to reach maximum potential-that resulted in you and me. Worry could have hindered or even threatened your existence. But our parents overcome some worries so we could become.

What about you? Are you ready to stop worrying and start living? Are you ready to birth something or someone or an idea or relationship that could change your life in a positive way, very significantly or permanently? Are you ready to put all your trust in God? Did you know that He loves and cares about you so much He has taken out insurance and assurance to cover your past, present and future needs? Whatever you have lost, you can recover; what you have need of now, can be provided, and whatever might be presenting future challenge or problem will equally be resolved to your favor. How do I know? Because it is stated in your “personal assurance policy” the Bible <strong>Philippians 4:19, </strong>“<strong>But my God shall supply all my needs according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus</strong>” (3 John 2). <strong>Psalms 23: 1, 6 </strong>says “<strong>The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want (meaning I shall lack nothing necessary for living”) ...Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever”</strong>. How wonderful are these assurances that God is in charge and He cares and will ensure that nothing goes wrong in our lives if we choose to put our total trust and confidence in Him as our provider, keeper and way maker. Stop worrying, therefore, and start living. God bless you. Boaz Olang]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hosea 4:6, “My people are destroyed for of lack of knowledge (in other words because of ignorance): Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee….”</strong>

What you don’t know can destroy you or deprive you of what is rightfully yours. Ignorance has no defense, someone once said.

Today, I would like to expose you to some fundamental biblical knowledge (truth) to meditate on that will help you understand and know your true self (<strong>person). Knowing who you are and whose you are is the key to your rightful position and possessions</strong> in the kingdom of God. Your life cannOt be meaningful, happy, satisfying and complete in this world without you fully understanding, from the Bible’s point of view, what God has done for you; what position God has put you and; what possessions you are entitled to as a child of God. God’s children have rights, privileges, favors, and blessings that are not available to everybody.<!--more-->

<strong>Who are you in the Kingdom of God</strong>? What is your relationship with God? If you don’t have a relationship with God, you don’t have a right to any of his blessings.

If you are born again, then you are a child of God. You have been empowered to be a bon-fide, legitimate child of God. God’s blood is running in your veins and any spiritual DNA test will reveal that you have a relationship with Christ. The Bible confirms that.

“<strong>He came to his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave the power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God”, (John 1:11-13</strong>)

<strong>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord and Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead….”</strong> (<strong>1Peter 1:3</strong>) The new relationship is a favor, privilege, blessing and honor that God has extended to all of us who were ones nothing but sinners destined for hell. For all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory (<strong>Romans 3:23</strong>).

But he has chosen you and translated you from servant-hood to sonship. Jesus said to his disciples whom he had empowered to become children of God just like you and I, “…<strong>Hence forth I call you not servants; for the servant does not know what his Lord does;…Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained YOU</strong> ….” (<strong>John 15:15-16</strong>)

Rise up today; think, walk, talk, act and live like a true child of God. Forget about your temporary misery, problems, challenges or lack. You have everything in Christ. Let not the lies of Satan confuse you. Stand and declare what is written. Praise God and rejoice over your new relationship with Him. Amen! God bless you<strong>. Blessings Boaz </strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ruth 3:8 reads, “In the middle of the night something startled the man, and he turned and discovered a woman lying at his feet.” And now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow townsmen know that you are a virtuous women.”</strong>

Boaz, who the Scriptures says was a relative of Naomi’s on her husband's side, from the clan of Elimelech, was a man of wealth spoke these powerful, encouraging and defining words of the life of this one women named Ruth. Ruth had been told by Naomi to wash and put on her best clothes although it is unlikely that an impoverished Ruth would have had best clothes; the Hebrew [word] means only a "garment." Her outer clothing was not defined by wealth by any means. This is going to be an important issue which we will see in a moment.<!--more-->

After instructing her not to fear, what did he focus on about Ruth? He focused on her character, her reputation. He said for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a virtuous women. How did everyone know this about her? This was quite a reputation to hold. Not just a few people close to Ruth had this testimony of her, but all in the town. Now we don’t know how many lived in the town of Bethlehem at that time, but we do know that her character NOT her clothing called attention to her. Why is that important? This is important to know because her character represented her heart while her clothing represented her outer appearance.

Remember when God was approving of David and disapproving of Saul. <strong>1Samuel 16:7</strong> reads, <strong>“But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.” (1Samuel 16:7)</strong> We as human beings are easily impressed--and therefore often deceived--by what our eyes tell us, while God looks at the "heart." God sees everything within us. Ruth would surely have answered the question that <strong>Proverbs 31:10</strong> poses when it asks, “A wife of virtue who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.” A beautiful woman by (her outward appearance) is easy to find. But a virtuous women is worth, is priced, or valued FAR MORE THAN RUBIES. The more rare a stone is the more precious it becomes. A woman of such high caliber is worth FAR MORE than any precious stone, diamond, gold, silver. Paul mentions in <strong>1 Corinthians 3:11, “If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones…</strong>, since valuable metals and precious stones were used to adorn ancient temples (<strong>Revelation 21:18-21</strong>), to portray that a life built with Christ as the foundation is like a life built by things that matter and are costly. Ruth’s life was built by things that really mattered, godly character, and everyone saw that godliness in her. The outer shell will fade away with age. Everything on a woman that perhaps is firm right now, will sag and become wrinkled one day. If all a woman possess was her outer beauty when that is gone, what will she have left?

It is believed that Ruth was in fact a beautiful women outwardly as <strong>Ruth 2:5</strong> tells us,” Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, "Whose young woman is that?," suggesting a beauty and an attraction toward her. But in the end when they married yes her outward beauty played a part, but it is her inner beauty that kept this man desiring to marry her. (<strong>Ruth 4:13</strong>). Ruth would become mother to Obed, father of Jesse, father of David. Wow, what a godly heritage!

<strong>Application: Perhaps you know some women of such character, but are they know by so many for their character. If you are a woman, yes, keep your beauty outwardly, but let God develop that inward beauty or keep that inward beauty if it is already present in you. When you stand before the Lord, the outward shell that caused the eyes of the opposite sex to start will be gone, and only your character will stand before God.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The word "holiness" carries with it some unwanted baggage, thanks to "religion." In the East, to be a holy man means to sit naked with your legs crossed, and having folks give you money in return for your blessing. Some holy men sit on poles for twenty years (Pillar Saints). Others stay off poles but they stay away from any contact with a sinful world, in a holier-than-thou legalism. Others live in monasteries, and have a vow of silence. Much of the Church doesn't live on poles or have a holier than thou attitude.<!--more-->They do however live in a monastery - one without walls. They, too, have a vow of silence. Few have physical contact with the world. Their association with humanity is strictly confined to the Church. Fellowship is what they have on Wednesday nights, Sunday mornings and Sunday nights. The are salt among salt, light among light.

True holiness is the opposite of the above. <strong>It does mean that we cut ourselves off from the sin, but not from the sinners</strong>. <strong>True holiness is to be like Jesus - "separate from sin" and yet He was accused of being a "friend of sinners." </strong>The Scriptures admonish us with these thought-provoking words: <strong>"I wrote to you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world. But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat", (1Corinthians 5:9-10). </strong>Can you see what the Bible is saying? If we separate ourselves from sinners, we won't be able to reach them with the gospel of salvation. The only ones we are told to separate ourselves from are hypocrites. Look at these wonderful words from George MacLeod of Scotland: <strong>"</strong><em>I simply argue that the cross should be raised at the center of the marketplace as well as on the steeple of the church. I am recovering the claim that Jesus was not crucified in a cathedral between two candles, but on a cross between two thieves; on the town's garbage heap; at a crossroad, so cosmopolitan they had to write His title in Hebrew and Latin and Greek . . . at the kind of a place where cynics talk smut, and thieves curse, and soldiers gamble. Because that is where He died. And that is what He died for. And that is what He died about. That is where church-men ought to be and what church-men ought to be about."</em>

There is nothing "spiritual" about being holy. It just means a separation from sin. God is holy - He is sinless, and we too are called to be holy: "<strong>But as He who has called you is holy, so you be holy in all manner of conversation" (1Peter 1:15) See Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 15:4. See also Romans 6:19, 22; Ephesians 1:4; Titus 1:8; 1Peter 1:15.</strong>

It's as simple as this - <strong>God has given us an umbrella in the Savior to shelter us from the rain of His wrath</strong>. <strong>God has given the covering, and we are told to stay under that covering of holiness</strong>. How may we best do that? We do this by reading God's Word daily and by the cultivation of a tender conscience. By having an obedient heart, and by living in the fear of God.

The next time you try to witness to someone you know isn't right with God, and he suddenly says, <em>"Oh, I've been born again. I know the Lord</em>," ask him if he is "<em>living in holiness</em>." More than likely he will say that he is. Then call his bluff. Ask him to define "holiness." As he is straining his brain to come up with a definition, say, The Bible says, <strong>"Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord" </strong>This means that we should be separated from sin and the world and then ask him if he thinks he's a good person. More than likely he will, so take the time to take him through the Moral Law. Blessings Pastor Phil.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalms 73:17, "Until I went into the sanctuary of God, then I understood their end." </strong>

This beautiful Psalm (<strong>Psalm 73</strong>) was written by Asaph who was one of the worship leaders in the house of God (probably at the time of king David.)..it starts with a complaint and grief Asaph expresses over his wonderful faith in God...He looks around at the conditions of the world and sees the wicked progressing, and the sinners living happily and this brings depression in his life...he questions himself and his faith in God<strong>..."Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence for all day long I have been plagued and chastened every morning". Psalm 73:13-14</strong>....<!--more-->Do we ever go through situations where we may feel all this Christian stuff is useless...I can live without it...and progress in my life...yes we all do have such feelings when we look around in the world...if Asaph who was a worship leader can have such thoughts why can't we have such negative thoughts..?...but then the latter part of this wonderful Psalm is very beautiful...vs 17 is the turning point....and this can change our thoughts too..Asaph carried his burden to the Lord in prayer and then he knew the end of all such people who do not follow the Lord<strong>..."Surely you set them in slippery places, you cast them down to destruction, Oh how they are brought to desolation as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors...", Psalm 73:vs 18-19</strong>...and this is a fact....

We can enjoy a lot in our life but the fact is as Billy Graham says<strong> "True happiness comes not by doing what we like to do but by doing what we are expected to do"....</strong>God our creator expects us to be holy ......no one in the history would have ever lavished and enjoyed as King Solomon in the Bible...even though the Lord blessed him with great wisdom, he forgot the Lord and lavished in the worldly pleasures, and what was the end his kingdom was divided and his end was miserable.. Solomon himself says in <strong>Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 "Now all has been heard, here is the conclusion of the matter, fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man, for God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing whether it is good or evil</strong>."...He enjoyed at his best but at the end he lamented for all his deeds.

We can find peace and true joy only in the presence of the Lord as Asaph did..."<strong>For it is good for me to draw near to God. I have put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all your works", Psalm 73:28</strong> ..The Bible also encourages us to believe in the Lord<strong>.." Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD. There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off. ", Proverbs 23:17-18</strong>...also it tells us the end of sinners<strong>.." Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of the wicked, for the evil man has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out", Proverbs 24:19-20</strong>

<strong>Psalms 1</strong> gives us a wonderful distinction between a person who follows the Lord and one who does not follow the Lord<strong>..."Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. ", Psalm 1:1-3...</strong>and also it wonderfully tells the end of the wicked people <strong>"Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. " </strong>

So it is always wonderful to serve the Lord and follow Him and at the end of day we will never regret of our decision of following the Lord ....in depression we can get an answer when we go into the presence of the Lord in prayer as Asaph did...He will reveal Himself to us and fill us with the joy that surpasses all understanding.... for the Bible says <strong> " In the presence of the Lord there is fullness there is fullness of Joy and in His right hand there are pleasures forevermore" Psalm 16:11.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 12:12, "...the root of the righteous yields fruit" </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5957" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

There are about 269 verses in the bible that talks about fruit. Fruits have always been known as the result of what was done before. If you plant an orange tree, your aim is to get orange fruits when the time is right and so is any other tree that you plant expecting fruits. In the garden of Eden, God had planted trees and they had fruits on them. Adam and Eve were told of the trees they could eat fruits from and the one they could not eat from. God did not just tell them not to eat from it but also gave them the reasons why.<!--more--> There is something about the fruits because they are the outcome, the result of one’s labor. I believe that the fruit is a result of what is happening behind the closed doors, behind the curtains, that which is not seen. If I plant a tree hoping to get fruits, I want to be sure that it's planted on the right soil, the ground is prepared and that it will have its roots down deep in the soil. As I continue to work around the tree, it will begin to grow and spread its leaves. However beautiful or big the tree might look, I will not be satisfied until I see the fruits.

I am amazed at how some people can call themselves Christians and when you look at their lifestyle, you can't see any Godly fruits. Too many leaves without any fruit and my first thought, are they planted by His river? how is their roots<strong>, Psalm 1:3, "He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper</strong>". You get planted by the river of the living water, your roots will go deeper and deeper as the water provides the nutrients the tree needs that it might bring fruits.

You bear the right fruits, God will prosper you in all that you do. Jesus one time was walking by and saw a tree that should have been bearing fruits, it looked healthily and nice but it was lacking the reason for its existence. When Jesus did not find any fruit on it, He cursed it and the tree dried up. God is interested in us bearing fruit because it shows who we are connected to. <strong>John 15:2, "Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes it away</strong>". The well spring of righteousness flows from Christ, the Living Water. A believer who has the root of righteousness will "<strong>bear fruits worthy of repentance" Matthew 3:8</strong>, this fruit is an evidence of growth, it tells you more about the condition of the soil and the roots.

<strong>Proverbs 11:30, "The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, And he who wins souls is wise</strong>". People ought to enjoy the fruits from your tree, I remember when God called me into ministry, He showed me that first He would transplant me from a soil I was used to to one I was not. He showed me that my leaves would wither and dry and I would look like I will not make it but that will the beginning of His work in me. The echo of truth revealed that once He was done with me, He would use me for His glory, I needed growth. This was 18 years ago which has come to pass why? the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, you give life when you give out your godly fruits. You have the fruit of salvation, are you sharing it with someone? The bible says "<strong>he who wins souls is wise".</strong>

A believer who continues to bear fruits God will give them grace and strength to bear fruit even in the old age<strong>, Psalm 92:14, "They shall still bear fruit in old age; They shall be fresh and flourishing</strong>". <em>“Lord help us lay before you the first fruit of our increase, we want tobear the fruit of the Spirit. We want to have the evidence of ourgrowth because Your word says in </em><strong><em>Mathew 7:16, "You will know them bytheir fruits</em></strong><em>".</em> Let people see your fruits and look for fruits in other people's lives. Have a fruitful day, Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Revelation 3:18, “I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see”</strong>

By secular standards, true wealth is considered to be the accumulated gain one has horded to themselves. How sad though, that such a mindset has swept up the church, to the degree that many of today’s big name TV preachers tell the deceived masses that monetary gain is God’ s plan for them, and the surest sign of his blessing. Falsehood and lies I say. Look to our Lord, he had nowhere to lay His head, are we greater than Him? Here the inspired apostle pens the words of the glorified Christ, true counsel from Jesus’ heart. Here He gives us three things of value, three things that will truly enrich the life that is earnestly seeking after God. These are worth more than all this worlds riches combined.<!--more-->

1.) He counsels us to buy from Him gold, refined in the fire. This gold is the true, intimate knowledge of God known by all who would abandon themselves and seek Him in truth, true spiritual wealth, for the one who knows God is truly rich, not in the ways of this world which is passing away, but in eternal ways, those which shall last for eternity. The refining is the burning away of every desire but Him, all of our self-seeking, all of our asking of Him to gain for ourselves, instead of out of a humble desire and love for God.

2.) Next He counsels us to buy from Him white garments. Here is the true proof of a Christian, a holy heart and life. These are the pure garments of holiness, unspotted from the world, that every Christian is to be clothed with, for it is commanded of our God (1<strong>Peter 1:15-16</strong>) and it is required to enter Heaven’s gates, for without holiness we shall not see the Lord (<strong>Hebrews 12:14</strong>). We must be clothed in the wedding garments. The life of a Christian is marked by ongoing faith and obedience, for He that is truly born of God does not sin (has no sin as an option) (<strong>1John 5:18</strong>). The life of sin has been abandoned, we now pursue a life of holiness.

3.) Lastly He counsels us to buy form Him eye salve, that we may see, true spiritual illumination, that we may see our helpless state, and that we may bow our knee humbly before His majesty, in reverence and awe, surrendering our lives wholly to Him. We are either completely His, born of His spirit and dead to ourselves, or we are still under the sway of the evil one. We mustn’t let human reason and philosophy draw us away from the truth of what God’s word says.

Now you may ask, how is it that I buy these precious gems of the Christian life, how do I obtain what it is Jesus is telling me to purchase? The price is our lives, our desires, our wills. Renouncing the world and ourselves, and offering our lives as a living sacrifice to God Almighty, that He might do with us as He pleases. Our wills must be as His will, and He alone must be our desire. We must be willing to sell all to follow Him( <strong>Matthew 19:21).</strong> Then we will truly know Him, divine intimacy with the Lord of glory, Christ reining in our hearts, now and for all eternity.

In the love and truth of Christ, and for His glory alone, blessings Brother Ben]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 19:7, "The law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul"</strong>

<strong>Forsaking the use of Law in evangelism has made the Church think that apologetics are our great weapon in the battle for the salvation of the world</strong>. One could make a convincing case for that thought in what we call "<strong>the age of enlightenment</strong>," when issues such as evolution and atheism have made these times unique in history. <strong>However, arguments come from the sinner's intellect</strong>. The ungodly mind is like a brick wall. It has been built to keep God out. It is at enmity with Him. It refuses to bow to the Law of God--"<strong>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be" (Romans 8:7). </strong>The human mind lays up arguments against God, so if you stay in that area you can expect a vicious battle. It is the mind that the Bible sites as the place of hostility--"<strong>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has He reconciled" (Colossians 1:21, italics added</strong>).<!--more-->

This wall of antagonism is hard and immovable, so make it a habit of going around it. Learn to speak directly to the conscience. This is good news. It means that we can be effective in our Christian witness without having to learn how to pronounce "Australopithecus afarensis" or define the fossil record, or know the age of the earth. When you address the conscience, these things become non-issues. It is that part of human nature that isn't an enemy of God. The conscience is God's ally. <strong>It doesn't speak against the Law of God; it speaks for it. </strong>It is the work of the Law written on their heart. <strong>It "[bears] witness" (Romans 2:15). It testifies for God</strong>. It is the trustworthy witness who points out the guilty party in the courtroom. It's mouth presents evidence of the Law's transgression. It is because of what it does that we should make room for it to speak as quickly as we can. If we want to win our case we must bring out our star witness and put it on the stand to give it voice.

We want to stop the mouth of the criminal, and that's what the lawful use of the Law does (see <strong>Romans 3:19</strong>). It condemns the guilty and drives him to give up his defense, so that he will be forced to look solely to the judge for mercy. <strong>It is simply a matter of moving from the intellect to the conscience </strong>(amazing as it sounds, although many have heard much about Jesus, the Cross, sin, and salvation, most have never heard the true gospel). Our mandate is to preach the Gospel to every creature (<strong>Mark 16:15</strong>), and it is the Gospel that is the "<strong>power of God unto salvation" (Romans 1:16</strong>). Once the Law is manifest the usual rational arguments that so often cloud the issue become irrelevant.

Kirk Cameron shared the teaching on the use of the Law one morning at a large church in Ohio. A few days later they received an email which shows <strong>the power of the Law to prepare the heart for the Gospel</strong>: "<em>I just heard you speak this morning...I'm a Catholic...have been all my life...I can't even begin to tell you how much your message affected me...I've been quite speechless all day long, which if you knew me, you'd know that I'm rarely quiet. It's been a good quiet because I am so humbled all of a sudden. I want to 'take the ball and run with it', as you put it. However, I'm confused. You see, I've never been hit that hard in any Catholic service I've ever attended. How do you minister to Catholics? I can tell you that most of them don't want to hear anything unless it's from a priest. I could be wrong and hope that I am...but I'm full of questions on what to do next... Every one needs to hear what I heard this morning. I'm just so full of.....well, I don't even know how to describe it. My life has been changed since this morning. I can't thank you enough</em>”. This passage has been pulled from the book Revival's Golden Key by Ray Comfort with Kirk Cameron, an excellent book on evangelism.

We have come to appreciate the use of law in our witnessing, time and time again, we have sinner's mouth get stopped from justifying themselves. <strong>Galatians 3:24, "Therefore the law was our school master to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith</strong>". Put together by Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 5:1-5, “1 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us”</strong>

Often when we hear teachings on faith, we think of faith as a means of expectation and it is, however there is more to faith than that. Rarely do we hear teachers, pastors tackle “Sustaining Faith or Enduring Faith”. We minimize or devalue sustaining faith because it may not promise new things, it holds in place what can easily be broken and lost. It maintains it and sustains it for long even unto the end.<!--more-->

Paul in this chapter begins with justification by faith, the state in which those who have repented and trusted in Christ alone for their eternal salvation are declared not guilty. This faith makes believers peaceable with God through Jesus Christ. Through this faith we also have access into this grace in which we stand. This grace (unmerited favor) is sustained by/through faith in every stage of a Christian life. This grace through faith produces joy because of the hope it reveals. <strong>It is the hope that sees the end result despite of the current status.</strong>

A believer who knows his end results works his ways backwards. To explain this point, think of an athlete looking forward to the finish line, his mind is not consumed with the present. He may think of it, but he is not consumed, entangled, or held by it. The thought of the finish lines gives him the ability to endure knowing that what he has to face cannot be compared to what awaits him. He has faith that the hindrances are temporal. With this truth, “<strong>3 …we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint…,” why? “…because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us”</strong>

Faith that sustains gives assurance that the prayers offered to God are not in vain. God hears and He is concerned about what we all go through, however God is in the business of forming and filling. He forms first that He may fill. The forming process is hard that is why we need sustaining faith that guides us through tribulation as it produces endurance that builds character revealing hope that develops such a greater faith. <strong>Hebrews 5:7-8</strong>, paints that clear picture, “<strong>7 During the days of Jesus’ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. 8 Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered 9 and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him”, NIV. </strong>We can see that even Jesus did not escape Romans 5.
I have seen this enduring faith sustain us during these years dealing with infertility. I have seen it sustain my brother by accident has currently been confined to a wheelchair. I have seen this faith sustain a friend who lost her husband recently.

Therefore, as we are saved by faith, we must be sustained by faith, be purified by it until the end for in this grace through faith we STAND. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One day, as an artist was down on his knees pounding with chisel and mallet at the base of his sculpture, a preacher approached and said, "I wish I could deal such changing blows to the hearts of men." The sculptor looked up at him, and with a steadfast gaze replied, "Maybe you could if you worked like me…down on your knees."</p><p> </p><p>Jesus never taught His disciples to preach. Instead, He taught them to pray. EM Bounds said, “All ability to talk to men is measure by the ability with which a preacher can talk to God (about) men.” These were the leaders who would spread the message He died for through preaching and teaching, yet Jesus taught them more about praying than He did about public speaking. Prayer was the decisive factor in spreading the gospel; prayer was the primary ministry they were called to; prayer was the guarantee they would succeed.</p><p> </p><p>Charles Spurgeon once cried, "We need red-hot, white-hot men who glow with intense heat; whom you cannot approach without feeling that your heart is getting warmer; who burn their way in all positions straight on to the desired work; men like thunderbolts flung from Jehovah's hand, crashing through every opposing thing, till they have reached the target aimed at; men impelled by Omnipotence." Such a fervent condition can only be obtained through prayer. It cannot be learned in school, although school is good. It cannot be gotten by books, although reading is good. Prayer is what soaks a preacher’s soul in the burden of God and empowers him to ignite others.</p><p> </p><p>In Acts 4:13, the religious leaders marveled at the apostles. They knew these men were “uneducated and untrained,” and yet “they marveled…and realized they had been with Jesus.” And more, they saw “the man who had been healed standing with them (and) could say nothing against it.” Peter and John had no silver and they had no gold. They had no earthly resources or human ability to rely on. All they had was what had been obtained in prayer: Holy Ghost unction. With that, they healed a cripple man, confounded the religious elite and ushered in a revival that would turn the world upside down.</p><p> </p><p>Today, however, we have plenty of silver and gold. Today, we have the most intelligent and intellectual preachers that seminaries can produce—but how many of them have truly been with Jesus. How many can persevere in prayer long enough to make any lasting difference in a culture that is rapidly going to hell.</p><p> </p><p>Without prayer, we may be able to attract a crowd but we'll never convert them into disciples.  Without prayer, we may be able to build large churches with with attractive programs, but there will be no encounter with the presence of God that melts hardened hearts, transform lives and produce men and women who are on fire for God ready to ignite the world for Jesus Christ.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 39:1-23, "And his master saw that the Lord was with him and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">that Lord made all he did to prosper in his hand</span>." </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/images.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6255 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/images.jpg" alt="images" width="246" height="205" /></a></strong>

What would you do if what you always dreamed for wasn't coming to pass?  instead of things getting better, you got  further and further away from it. Joseph is a good example, he had a dream at the age of 17 and his dream was not that one day he would fail but that one day he will be great and that his family and many people would bow to him. Talk to any teenagers today and hear all their dreams and desires of success. You must have had dreams at that age too. Joseph had a good dream but he was naive, boastful and insensitive towards his brothers. He did not even realize that the dream was not about him but a picture of Christ. In his case, a lot of character building was needed before God fulfilled all that He planned.<!--more-->

<strong>Genesis 39:1, "Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an office of Pharaoh... brought him from Ishmaelites who had taken him down there</strong>". He was brought to Egypt as a slave, bowing to someone else. What happened to the dream in which people would be bowing to him? It's not surprising that some people become careless when things are not going as they planned and expected. They misuse what they have, they envy others, they treat the position they have casually, doing a poor job because that is not where they wanted to land. Sitting down and being lazy was not Joseph’s position, he was not where he desired to be but yet he was still faithful, hardworking, honest, efficient, effective, responsible and initiative in all he did. The bible says in <strong>vs. 2, "The Lord was with Joseph, and he was successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian"</strong>. You don’t hear a voice from heaven telling him how to live but you see the effects of how he lived because God was with him and gave him wisdom. <strong>Proverbs 2:6-8</strong> reads, “<strong>For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding; He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk uprightly; He guards the paths of justice, And preserves the way of His saints”. </strong>A number wait for a voice from heaven before they do things, however how come we don’t apply the same way when it comes to putting food on the table or roofs over our heads. We go out in the light of God’s word to look for jobs, and we trust His guidance and when we get the jobs, we work hard. That is wisdom, the wisdom of God, seeking to do good while not leaning on our own understanding, <strong>Proverbs 3:5</strong>.

Joseph had every opportunity to complain yet he chose to channel those opportunities to enlarge his character by serving faithfully, <strong>Philippians 2:14, "Do all things without complaining and disputing</strong>". It's like Joseph saying, <em>"I am not where I desire to be and I don't know if I will get there or not, one thing I know, I have responsibilities to my master and I will do it faithfully, do well and make my master proud</em>". I don't believe the Lord told him what to do, he just saw an opportunity to serve and the Lord blessed him for being initiative. Later he was made overseer of the entire house of Potiphar, things were beginning to be better, he was good at what he is doing and the Lord was trully blessing the house. And then he lost his position because Potiphar's wife. Once beaten and thrown in prison, someone would think he would stop being the man of character, but even in prison, he served, he was initiative and responsible. This allowed him to have favor with the keeper of prison and once again he was made in charge. He outshined them all.

Joseph allowed people to see the Lord in him by working hard, being responsible and being a man who was initiative. Whatever he did, the Lord made it prosper and so is with us today. You may not be where you want to be in career, relationship, job wise, position but you can still be all you can for God right where you are. <strong>Colossians 3:17</strong> <strong>“And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him”,.. 23 And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men.”</strong>

Do not sit and wait for the Lord to bring you to your destiny when He has allowed you to be in a place for such as time as this to grow your character before He can enlarge you. You need to incorporate the word “Initiative” which means doing good things without being told but this begins with wisdom you can ask the Lord for. Do the best you can with all you have and the Lord will bless and prosper you in all you do. Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Kings 18:1-45, “17 Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, “Is that you, O troubler of Israel?” 18 And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and have followed the Baals.”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6106" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="206" /></a></strong>Whenever you are dealing with happenings, we need to get to the starting point, the root. Without understanding the starting point, finger pointing can easily be done. In our day, people are finger pointing politicians, mother nature, religious leaders, young people, Hollywood etc. In the midst of finger pointing, we try to deal with the symptoms ignoring to address the bigger issue lying underneath those symptoms.

<!--more-->

Elijah had proclaimed a time of draught in Israel in <strong>1Kings 17.</strong> The first question to ask is, why would a man of God proclaim a draught? It was because of the sins of the Israelites. Ahab’s father Omri was a wicked king reliving the evil ways of Jeroboam. When Ahab became the next king, he took the wickedness of his father and Jeroboam to a greater level. As Matthew Henry better highlights it, “<em>Ahab did evil above all that reigned before him, and did it with a particular enmity both against Jehovah and Israel. He was not satisfied with breaking the second commandment by image-worship, he broke the first by worshipping other gods: making light of lesser sins makes way for greater. Marriages with daring offenders also imbolden in wickedness, and hurry men on to the greatest excesses. One of Ahab's subjects, following the example of his presumption, ventured to build Jericho. Like Achan, he meddled with the accursed thing; turned that to his own use, which was devoted to God's honor: he began to build, in defiance of the curse well devoted to God's honor: he began to build, in defiance of the curse well known in Israel; but none ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered” </em>Ahab was trouble with capital T. <strong>1Kings 16:33,” And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him”.</strong>

Now that we know who he was, can you imagine what he must have told his people about the draught? Of course the draught was a symptom to something bigger lying beneath the draught to be addressed. Not according to Ahab, he considered himself the good king, the trouble maker was none other than Elijah the prophet of God. He (Ahab) was the one fighting for the people, leading them to worship, parading himself as to what he was not. Despite his thoughts of himself, Obadiah his servant knew better. He hid the righteous from being massacred by Jezebel,  Ahab’s wife who was as wicked as he was, if not to a greater level. Obadiah knew Elijah was the true man of God, when he saw him, he recognized Elijah as his lord and even bowed himself before him. Not with Ahab, he was righteous in his own eyes.

<strong>1Kings 18:1-45, “17 Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, “Is that you, O troubler of Israel?” 18 And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and have followed the Baals.” </strong>Is it not ironic that Ahab was the first to accuse Elijah of being the trouble maker? Well Elijah did not spare him but revealed to him that he was the trouble maker and why he considered him that way.

There is an assault on the word of God through movies, feminism, same sex marriages, ways to build marriages, raise kids etc. Apostle Paul is accused of being a trouble maker in addressing biblical headship, marriages etc. The church is considred trouble maker (hate speech) when speaking against certain sins. In summary, those who expose the lies of the enemy will be considered trouble makers. Those who expose the sin in the world the reason for many of the calamities we face will be considered trouble makers. While Elijah proclaimed a draught that affected the land, he was a prophet sent to restore Israel to God and the draught was part of that purging process in preparation for restoration. And we see that after this meeting with Ahab, he challenges him to prove the true God before ending the draught.

One may guess how people stand affected to God, by observing how they stand affected to his people and ministers. It has been the lot of the best and most useful men, like Elijah, to be called and counted the troublers of the land. Ahab thought to awe him into submission, but the prophet boldly and un disguisedly told the king that the national calamity was traceable chiefly to his own and his family's patronage and practice of idolatry. While he pointed a finger at Elijah, three of his fingers pointed at him.

It’s easy to look at the symptoms and blame someone else. Can we be honest with ourselves and look deeper past the symptoms and see what the true heart of the issue are and repent to God and be restored? <strong>Proverbs 28:13, “He who covers his sins will not prosper, But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.” </strong>God is not the trouble maker, we are and only in humility and repentance can we be restored.

	<li>Through Faith In His name we are healed and made strong <strong>Acts 3:16, "And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all"</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We receive righteousness by grace through faith, <strong>Romans 3:22, "even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference;", Romans 3:25, "whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed"</strong></li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
<ul>
	<li>We are justified, declared not guilty through faith, <strong>Romans 3:30,  "since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith</strong>."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>What the law we could not keep is established in our hearts through faith in Christ alone. <strong>Romans 3:31, "Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law."</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We are made heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ through faith, <strong>Romans 4:13, "For the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The blessings of Abraham (righteousness) are bestowed upon us through faith, <strong>Galatians 3:14, "that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We are made sons of God through faith, <strong>Galatians 3:26, "For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus."</strong></li>

</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We have complete access to the throne of grace through faith, <strong>Ephesians 3:12, "in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him."</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Christ dwells in our hearts through faith, <strong>Ephesians 3:17, "that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love"</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We are found in Christ and receive His righteousness through faith, <strong>Philippians 3:9, "and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;"</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We died and resurrected with Christ through faith, <strong>Colossians 2:12, "buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.</strong><strong> "</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Holy Scriptures makes as wise unto salvation through faith <strong>2Timothy 3:15, "and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We imitate Christ by looking at the heroes of faith in the bible who through faith inherited the promises. <strong>Hebrews 6:12, "that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises</strong>."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The heroes of faith demonstrate to us that through faith we are made more than conquers, <strong>Hebrews 11:33, "who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,"</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Through faith we don’t have to see to believe and we don’t have to have it for it to be a fulfilled promise, <strong>Hebrews 11:39, "And all these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, did not receive the promise."</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We are kept by God’s power through faith <strong>1Peter 1:5, "who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time</strong>."</li>

<em><a href="http://magnifyhisword.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/suffering-with-hope.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3420" src="http://magnifyhisword.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/suffering-with-hope.png" alt="suffering-with-hope" width="300" height="196" data-originalSrc="https://joequatronejr.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/suffering-with-hope.png?w=300" data-rehosted="1"></a>We rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A3-4&amp;version=NIV">Romans 5:3-4</a>).

It’s an old story. We would much rather complain about the way things are than make the sacrifice to change it, but character requires sacrifice. Those of us who know the Lord are called to make that sacrifice; we are called to live on a higher plane. Christians, above any other group, should be known as persons of character.

The references to character in the Bible indicate it’s something to be sought after. The Apostle Paul points out the unique relationship between suffering, perseverance, and character. The suffering he’s referring to are the trials and difficulties experienced by believers. He’s assuming, of course, that those who are persecuted would faithfully and courageously endure their persecutions; that they would not break under pressure and deny their faith in Christ.

It is important to recognize the difference between perseverance and character. Perseverance is something we do, but character is something we have… or don’t have. Character is all about who we are and what we’re made of. Paul’s conclusion is that those who persevere through trials are men and women of character. Their character is made evident by their response to what is happening to them. This definition of character presupposes two things.

<strong><em>First, there is an Absolute Standard by which to define right and wrong.</em></strong> People of character don’t make up the rules as they go along. They have already agreed upon the rules beforehand. When faced with any situation, they don’t ask, “What’s right for me?” Instead, they ask, “What’s right?” People of character believe in an Absolute Standard of right and wrong that overshadows the entire human race, one to which all people are held accountable. According to the Bible, God is that Standard. He determines what is right and wrong. He has already set limits on human behavior. His code of conduct never changes or shifts with a particular culture or time period.

<strong><em>The second thing character presupposes is the ability and willingness to obey.</em></strong> Agreeing with the rules of the game is one thing, but playing by the rules is something else entirely. How many of us break the law every day? Men and women of character have not only agreed to God’s code of conduct, but they also live for it.

Whereas achievement and fulfillment are the chief pursuits for many in this world, it’s different for men and women of character. They’re not necessarily opposed to achieving certain goals, but the difference is in their priorities. They are not against personal fulfillment, but for them, obedience takes priority over achievement. Self-control takes precedent over self-fulfillment. It is all a matter of priorities.

Are you willing to make character a priority? I have never met anyone who is against character, yet few people make it their priority. Men and woman are often quick to compromise their character if that is what it takes to reach the next step in whatever ladder they choose to climb. For many people, what they can do on the outside is not nearly as important as who they <em>are</em> on the inside.

<strong><em>To be persons of character, we must submit ourselves to God’s code of conduct.</em> </strong>We must agree with Him that His ways are right – whether we understand or not. We must have the attitude that says, “Lord, before You even tell me what the right thing to do in my particular situation is, I already believe You are right.” <em>Then, we must</em> <em>follow through and actually do what God says. </em>People of character do what is right simply because it is right. It is right because God says it is right.

I’d like you to try an experiment with me: think about all the places you could go to improve your outer appearance. Most stores are geared toward making us look or feel better. We’re bombarded from every direction by products designed to improve our looks and health. Just pick up any magazine and flip through the advertisements, or watch any commercial on TV.

Now, think for a moment about how many places are geared toward developing character. This list is significantly shorter than the first. Other than church, we don’t have much to choose from. There was a time when we could have put school on that list, but that’s not necessarily true anymore.

Clearly, we live in a world that is totally committed to the outer person and neglects the inner person. Yet, the social problems in this nation, the ones commentators and politicians are constantly complaining about, are not rooted in our appearance. Most of our problems stem from a lack of character among our leaders and citizens. Our biggest deficit in this nation is not a budget deficit or unemployment, but a lack of character.

If we don’t have a plan for developing our character, we simply will not. We will fall in line with everyone else. The only difference is believers will go to heaven when they die and unbelievers will not. My point is this: none of us drift into character. It takes effort; it takes a plan. Even as Christians, we’re prone to allow the cares of this world to choke out any time for working on the part of us that is most crucial to our genuine happiness and success – our character.

Character is to relationships what oil is to an engine. If we took apart the engine of a new car, we would find that each part is made to work perfectly with all the other parts of the engine. They were made for each other. Yet, if you run that engine without oil, it will eventually destroy all the other parts around it. The fact the parts are perfectly suited for each other is not enough. When there is a deficit in character, we pay for it in our relationships. It does not matter how perfectly suited we are for each other. If we don’t have character, there is going to be friction.

<strong>A Plan for Developing Character:</strong>

Part of my plan for developing my character involves a list of several traits I want to be known for. I rehearse my list mentally throughout the day. I meditate on Scripture that deals with these things. I pray every day that God would work on my character to the point where these characteristics will shape my public reputation. I want to be known as a man of godly character.

Praying to God for help developing my character is one thing, but when I get specific, that’s when I really begin to see a change. I think through the kind of person I want to be (not what I want to accomplish, but what God and others perceive me as being in my heart). Then, I work the list. I look for practical ways to work the qualities into my life.

You will be amazed at how your personal plan unfolds. You may change your list from time to time. That’s fine. But keep it going. That way, you will see your progress and you will stay involved in the process.<em> </em>

<a href="http://magnifyhisword.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/fightthegoodfight.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3461" src="http://magnifyhisword.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/fightthegoodfight.jpg" alt="fightthegoodfight" width="300" height="225" data-originalSrc="https://joequatronejr.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/fightthegoodfight.jpg?w=300" data-rehosted="1"></a>Today, we will be looking at the final section of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+6&amp;version=NIV">chapter 6</a>, where the Apostle Paul continues his instructions to Timothy on ministering to the various kinds of believers in the church (if you missed <a href="http://joequatronejr.com/2014/11/20/pauls-charge-to-timothy-part-1-1-timothy-61-10/">Part 1</a>, I encourage you to read it now).

<strong>The Pastor Himself (</strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A11%E2%80%9316&amp;version=NIV"><strong>1 Tim. 6:11–16</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A20-21&amp;version=NIV"><strong>20–21</strong></a><strong>)</strong>
<blockquote>But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To Him be honor and might forever. Amen.

Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith.</blockquote>
While caring for the needs of his people, Timothy needed to care for himself as well. “But you” indicates a contrast between Timothy and the false teachers. They were men of the world, but he was a “man of God.” This special designation was also given to Moses (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut.+33%3A1&amp;version=NIV">Deut. 33:1</a>), Samuel (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Sam.+9%3A6&amp;version=NIV">1 Sam. 9:6</a>), Elijah (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+17%3A18&amp;version=NIV">1 Kings 17:18</a>), and David (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Neh.+12%3A24&amp;version=NIV">Neh. 12:24</a>); so Timothy was in good company.

Paul gave four admonitions to Timothy that, if obeyed, would assure him success in his ministry and a continued testimony as “a man of God.”

<strong><em>Flee (</em></strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+tim+6%3A11&amp;version=NIV"><strong><em>v. 11a</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> There are times when running away is a mark of cowardice. “Should such a man as I flee?” asked Nehemiah (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Neh.+6%3A11&amp;version=NIV">Neh. 6:11</a>). But there are other times when fleeing is a mark of wisdom and a means of victory. Joseph fled when he was tempted by his master’s wife (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.+39%3A12&amp;version=NIV">Gen. 39:12</a>) and David fled when King Saul tried to kill him (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Sam.+19%3A10&amp;version=NIV">1 Sam. 19:10</a>). The word “flee” that Paul uses here does not refer to literal running, but to Timothy’s <em>separating himself</em> from the sins of the false teachers.

Not all unity is good and not all division is bad. There are times when a servant of God should take a stand against false doctrine and godless practices, and separate himself from them. He must be sure, however, that he acts on the basis of biblical conviction and not because of a personal prejudice or carnal agenda.

<strong><em>Pursue (</em></strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+tim+6%3A11&amp;version=NIV"><strong><em>v. 11b</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> Separation without positive growth becomes isolation. We must cultivate these graces of the Spirit (“righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness”) in our lives or else we will be known only for what we oppose rather than for what we propose.

<strong><em>Fight (</em></strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+tim+6%3A12-16&amp;version=NIV"><strong><em>vv. 12–16</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> The verb means “keep on fighting!” It is a word from which we get our English word <em>agonize</em>, and it applies both to athletes and to soldiers. It describes a person straining and giving his best to win the prize or win the battle. Near the end of his own life, Paul wrote, “I have fought the good fight” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Tim.+4%3A7&amp;version=NIV">2 Tim. 4:7</a>).

This “fight,” however, is not between believers; it is between a person of God and the enemy around him. He is fighting to defend the faith, that body of truth deposited with the church (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A20&amp;version=NIV">1 Tim. 6:20</a>). Like Nehemiah, Christians today need to have a trowel in one hand for building and a sword in the other hand for battling (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Neh.+4%3A17&amp;version=NIV">Neh. 4:17</a>). It is sad when some Christians spend so much time fighting the enemy that they have no time to do their work and build the church. On the other hand, if we do not stand guard and oppose the enemy, what we have built could be taken from us.

What is it that encourages us in the battle? We have “eternal life” and need to take hold of it and let it work in our experience. We have been called by God and this assures us of victory. We have made our public profession of faith in Christ and others in the church stand with us.

Another encouragement in our battle is the witness of Jesus Christ our Savior. He “witnessed a good confession” before Pontius Pilate and did not relent before the enemy. He knew God the Father was with Him and watching over Him, and He would be raised from the dead. It is “God who makes all things alive,” who is caring for us, so we need not fear. Timothy’s natural timidity might want to make him shrink from the battle. But all he had to do was remember Jesus Christ and His bold confession, and this would encourage him.

Paul gave Timothy military orders: “I charge you” (also <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+tim+1%3A3&amp;version=NIV">1:3</a>). He was to guard the commandment and obey it. Why? Because one day the Commander would appear and he would have to report on his assignment! The only way he could be ready would be to obey the orders “without spot or blame.”

It is impossible for a sinful human to approach the holy God. It is only through Jesus Christ that we can be accepted into His glorious presence. Why did Paul write so much about the person and glory of God? Probably as a warning against the “emperor cult” that existed in the Roman Empire. It was customary to acknowledge regularly, “Caesar is Lord!” Of course, Christians would say, “Jesus Christ is Lord!” Only God has “honor and power everlasting.” If Timothy was going to fight the good fight of faith, he had to decide that Jesus Christ <em>alone</em> was worthy of worship and complete devotion.

<strong><em>Take Hold (</em></strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+tim+6%3A20-21&amp;version=NIV"><strong><em>vv. 20–21</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> God had committed the truth to Paul (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+1%3A11&amp;version=NIV">1 Tim. 1:11</a>) and Paul had committed it to Timothy. It was Timothy’s responsibility to guard the deposit and then pass it along to others who would, in turn, continue to pass it on (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Tim.+2%3A2&amp;version=NIV">2 Tim. 2:2</a>). This is God’s way of protecting the truth and spreading it around the world. We are stewards of the doctrines of the faith and God expects us to be faithful in sharing His Good News.

Why should Timothy avoid the teachings of those who claimed to have special knowledge from God (the Gnostics)? Because some who got involved with them “wandered from the faith.” Not only will wrong motives (a desire for money) cause a person to wander from the faith (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A10&amp;version=NIV">1 Tim. 6:10</a>), but so will wrong teachings. These lies work their way into a person’s mind and heart gradually, and before he realizes it, he is wandering off the path of truth.

<strong>The Rich (</strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A17%E2%80%9319&amp;version=NIV"><strong>1 Tim. 6:17–19</strong></a><strong>)</strong>
<blockquote>Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. In this way, they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.</blockquote>
Paul had already written about the danger of the love of money, but he added a special “charge” for Timothy to give to the rich. We may not think this charge applies to us, but it does. After all, our standard of living today would certainly make us “rich” in the eyes of Timothy’s congregation!

<strong><em>Be humble (</em></strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A17&amp;version=NIV"><strong><em>v. 17a</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> If wealth makes a person proud, then he understands neither himself nor his wealth. “But remember the Lord your God for it is He who gives you the ability to produce wealth” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut.+8%3A18&amp;version=NIV">Deut. 8:18</a>). We are not owners; we are stewards. If we have wealth, it is by the goodness of God and not because of any special merits on our part. The possessing of material wealth ought to humble a person and cause him to glorify God, not himself.

It is possible to be “rich in the world” and be poor in the next. It is also possible to be poor in this world and rich in the next. Jesus talked about both (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16%3A19%E2%80%9331&amp;version=NIV">Luke 16:19–31</a>). But a believer can be rich in this world and also rich in the next if he uses what he has to honor God (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+6%3A19%E2%80%9334&amp;version=NIV">Matt. 6:19–34</a>). In fact, a person who is poor in this world can use even his limited means to glorify God and discover great reward in the next world.

<strong><em>Trust God, not wealth (</em></strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A17&amp;version=NIV"><strong><em>v. 17b</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> The rich farmer in our Lord’s parable (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+12%3A13%E2%80%9321&amp;version=NIV">Luke 12:13–21</a>) thought his wealth meant security, when really it was an evidence of insecurity. He was not really trusting God. Riches are uncertain, not only in their value (which changes constantly), but also in their durability. Thieves can steal wealth, investments can drop in value, and the ravages of time can ruin cars and houses. If God gives us wealth, we should trust Him, the Giver, and not the gifts.

<strong><em>Enjoy what God gives you (</em></strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A17&amp;version=NIV"><strong><em>v. 17c</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> Yes, the word <em>enjoy</em> is in the Bible! In fact, one of the recurring themes in the book of Ecclesiastes is, “Enjoy the blessings of life now because life will end one day” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+2%3A24&amp;version=NIV">Ecc. 2:24</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3%3A12%E2%80%9315&amp;version=NIV">3:12–15</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3%3A22&amp;version=NIV">22</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+5%3A18%E2%80%9320&amp;version=NIV">5:18–20</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+9%3A7%E2%80%9310&amp;version=NIV">9:7–10</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+11%3A9%E2%80%9310&amp;version=NIV">11:9–10</a>). This is not sinful “hedonism,” living for the pleasures of life. It is simply enjoying all God gives us for His glory.

<strong><em>Employ what God gives you (</em></strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A18-19&amp;version=NIV"><strong><em>vv. 18–19</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> We should use our wealth to do good to others; we should share; we should put our money to work. When we do, we enrich ourselves spiritually and make investments for the future (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16%3A1%E2%80%9313&amp;version=NIV">Luke 16:1–13</a>). Riches can lure a person into a make-believe world of shallow pleasure, but riches <em>plus God’s will</em> can introduce a person to life that is real and ministry that is lasting.

Paul’s final sentence was not for Timothy alone because the pronoun is plural: “Grace be with all of you.” Paul had the entire church in mind when he wrote this letter, not just Timothy. As the pastor and leader of the church, Timothy needed to heed the word of the apostle; but all of his church members had a responsibility to hear and obey as well.

And so do we today.

1. In what practical ways do we “take hold of … eternal life”? How will it affect our attitude and order our priorities?

2. We live in a culture in which many false ideas about God and the Lord Jesus Christ exist. How do we “guard the gospel” in this context?

3. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A10%E2%80%9318+&amp;version=NIV">Ephesians 6:10–18</a> and identify the weapons God gives us to “fight the good fight of the faith.”

<em>* This concludes our 6-week series in the book of 1 Timothy. I hope and pray you have enjoyed and benefitted from this study as much as I have.</em>

<em>Our next series will begin on Monday in the </em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1-5&amp;version=NIV"><em>Book of James</em></a><em>.</em>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Leviticus 17:11, &quot;For the life of the flesh is in the blood...&quot;</strong>

I for one believe in a Christians’ growth, I am always quick to tell whether I am growing or stagnant. It bothers me when I am stagnant and that drives me to look for opportunities to grow in Christ even more. A couple of things help me grow, prayers, teaching the word, evangelizing etc.<!--more-->

In <strong>John 15:5</strong>, Jesus said “<strong>I AM the vine, you <em>are</em> the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing”.</strong> He is always the vine, then question is, are we abiding/remaining that we may bear fruit? The bible does not say that you shall produce fruits, it says “<strong>you shall bear fruit</strong>” which I could say “carry”. <strong>If you can withstand abiding, you don't even have to struggle to bear fruits, they will flow because you are abiding</strong>.

There is something about a biding we can learn, a better picture that could make this point clear is,<strong> John 19:34, &quot;But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out&quot;. </strong>In my reading about the life of Christ, not at any given moment do I hear that He bled until the crucifixion hour got closer. As He was praying in the final hours, He sweat blood. We then see blood again when they whipped Him, and then forced a crown of thorn on His head. The final was when they nailed Him on the cross and thereafter a Roman soldier pierced Him on His side.

If you have a cut, the first thing you do or they do for you is stop the cut from bleeding by all means for there have been people who have bled to death. Jesus on the other hand was bleeding from being beaten with a whip, from the crown of thorn forced onto His head, bleeding after being nailed on the cross and bleeding from being pierced on His side. My speculation, the more He bled His precious blood, the more He was losing His strength and being that He was also emotionally exhausted, physically, mentally carrying all the weight of sin of everyman on His back, He still could not die by any means of bleeding until His hour had come on the cross. <strong>It's very clear to us that the life of the flesh is in the blood. </strong>For one to live, he or she has to have blood flowing in them. <strong>Jesus became what He was not that we might become what we were not.</strong>

With that said, the blood that was shed on the cross was for us lost souls bought with the highest price, His blood. When the Roman soldier pierced Him, out of His side came water and blood for lost and not only that, I believe the piercing on his side is a picture of away being prepared for us to abide in Him. This way was opened for us to be grafted (connected) in to Him for eternity. We can now live, grow, bear fruit, stand, overcome because we are tied (abiding) in Him for without Him we can do nothing. He lost His blood that we may have a blood transfusion, <strong>He replaced our blood with His heavy duty blood</strong>, <strong>the precious blood of the Lamb, the blood that speaks louder than Abel's blood, the blood that never ceases to lose its power. </strong>As a song goes, &quot;<strong>There is power, wonder working power in the blood&quot;. </strong>We have established the fact that the life of the flesh is in the blood, will now talk about bleeding believers.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Leviticus 17:11, &quot;For the life of the flesh is in the blood...&quot;</strong>

We looked at the bleeding Savior who chose to bleed for the sake of mankind and today we will look at the bleeding believer.

<strong>John 15:7, &quot;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you&quot;. </strong>One of the most tragic thing that can happen to humans is to have a cut, a wound and bleed to death. <!--more-->
There is something about the blood circulating in human system that has to be protected by all means. We give out blood for the saving of other patients lives. The bible indicates clearly that the life of the flesh is in the blood and the life of the gospel is in the blood, and the life of every believer is in the blood and so we need to take the blood issue seriously.

If you go back to <strong>John 15:5, &quot;I am the Vine and you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without me you can do nothing&quot;. </strong>If the blood is to continue to circulate for us to stay alive and well, we have to be connected to the source of life which is Jesus Christ. <strong>John 14:6, &quot;Jesus said to him, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me&quot;. </strong>The only way we can get to the Father is by being connected to the Son. I think many of us struggle to distinguish between who the Vine is and who the branches are. I'm not surprised for I have seen people reverse the order and they acted as though they were the Vine and Jesus was the branch. By this I mean that everything someone did, they thought they were doing the Lord a favor when in the actual sense, He is doing us a favor.

Listen to this, the bleeding believer is one who decides to be disconnected from the true Vine. For example, if you cut someone's hand, that hand will die and rot but the entire body will still live though in pain. <strong>John 15:4, &quot;... As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the Vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me&quot;. </strong>You detach yourself from the Lord you will bleed to death meaning spiritually die. If you detach a hand from the body yes it will still look like it still has life and kicking but give it some time while it’s loosing blood and you will see it die. We must stay abiding in the Vine every day. No moving forward without abiding on the Vine. To be honest, it's not easy staying attached to the Vine. You cannot have the fruit of the Spirit recorded in the bible (love, patience, kindness, meekness, long suffering etc.) without being connected to the Vine. Don't you understand that <strong>Christ in you the hope of glory</strong>? without Him we can do absolutely nothing.

The bleeding believer cannot retain anything for they are bleeding daily. You pour strength into them, tomorrow they are weak again; you encourage them today, tomorrow you find them discouraged; you tell them you love them, they don't feel loved enough; you speak destiny in their lives, they see themselves as failures, why? because everything you pour into their lives bleeds out. In as much as someone might encourage and strengthen you as long as you are bleeding, you will never retain for long. If you are the one to lift up a bleeding believer, if you see them the next day and the day after come to you with the same issue, they must be bleeding.

With God where there is a problem, He has provided a way out. Ask yourself the first question, are you detaching yourself from the True Vine? you could be attached to a vine but not the true one and in the process of being detached from the wrong one, you will bleed. The good news is, you can be grafted onto the True Vine. Ask yourself why you cannot hold that which is poured into you, is it because of sin?, wounded by someone?, offended, broken?. Bind up the bleeding wounds, purpose in your heart to stop the bleeding by abiding in Him. <strong>Phil 2:12, &quot;...work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&quot;. </strong>No one can work your salvation for you. You have to do it yourself, you have to desire to live and do everything by all means to stop yourself from bleeding to death and let someone come and help you bind up the wounds. Remember the woman with the issue of blood, she was bleeding too and she purposed in her heart to work out her own salvation by looking for and to Jesus, speaking to herself these words &quot;<strong>If I may but touch the hem of His garment, I know I will be made whole&quot;</strong>. And the moment she touched His garment, she was grafted to the True Vine and her bleeding stopped. God will send people to pour more into you but make sure you are abiding in Him the True Vine.

I will stop here for the day, one last piece on part three tomorrow, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Leviticus 17:11, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood..."</strong>

<strong>John 15:7, "If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you". </strong>Yesterday we talked about the bleeding believer who needs to abide in the vine, today I want us to concentrate on "<strong>If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you"</strong> It's good to abide which in other translations use the word “remain”, we also need to allow the Words of the Lord to abide (remain) in us. <!--more-->
The reason why the word needs to remain in us is because that is blood to sustain and fuel us to move everyday in Him. Check how John reveals to us how the Word is connected to the Lord <strong>John 1:1-5, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it"</strong>. He was and is the Word, and in Him was life and according to <strong>Leviticus 17:11, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood...", </strong>His Word is life and blood to us.

Check how He came to us in <strong>John 1:14, "And the Word became flesh (blood) and dwelt among us". </strong>When He broke the bread with His disciples at the last supper, He said eat this bread which represents my body broken for you and the bread is also known as the Word of God. He also said drink this wine which represents the blood of the Lamb shed on the cross of Calvary. Thank God that His blood can now flow in our streams because we are abiding and we can live because He lives. We are not connected to a dead Vine but a living Vine for He is life. The more we know the Word, the more we know Him. The more we can live according to His Words, the more we are imitating the Life of Christ. His words abide in you, His words would steer you in the right direction and you will not even work hard to bear fruit, they will come because you are abiding. The reason the moon shines is because it draws its light and strength from the Sun. We as believers draw our light for the Sun (Son) Jesus and we become the moon that will shine in the middle of darkness., <strong>Matthew 5:16, "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven". You will not bear fruits (shine) unless you abide in Him and His words abide in you</strong>. We try so hard to produce fruits while in actuality we needed to abide and His Blood and Word would help us grow.

I want us to understand that the Word can speak on it's own. Someone said the Word of God does not need an attorney or witnesses, it is able to defend itself anywhere at any time. The Word is powerful and cannot be changed or altered. When we have no voice and at times cannot defend ourselves, the Word of God will stand for sure. The Word will speak in us, for us and at the same time the Word will speak out of us. The moment that the Word leaves us, it does not loose the power and strength but we who have lost it will. <strong>Genesis 4:10, "... the voice of thy brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground". </strong>When Cain slew Abel, Abel died but his blood cried out to God from the ground when it could not speak from the body anymore, now in <strong>Hebrews 12:24 says, "And Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Able". </strong>I would rather have the Blood and the Word speak through and in me than from somewhere. My prayer for you is that you continue to abide in the True Vine and His Word will abide. We can be encouraged in this discouraging world. Let the blood of Jesus that speaks louder than Abel's circulate in our systems, our lives depend on Him for without Him, WE ARE NOTHING. <strong>Let's move from being BLEEDING BELIEVERS to BLENDING BELIEVERS</strong>. Blending believers will seize the opportunity to blend in the Lord.]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 18:10-14,&quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: `God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.' &quot;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.' &quot;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;</strong>

God loves parties I know that is hard to believe!. God loves to celebrate with His heavenly hosts. But what is it that causes heaven to throw a party? Well let’s look at the prayer of the tax collector. <!--more-->
He was right there with the Pharisee in the Temple. This man was on a mission to meet with God. And in the Temple he probably heard the Pharisee put him down, mock him, and compare the Pharisee’s good deeds with the unrighteous deeds of the tax-collector, their hearts were different. The tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven. Why did this man distance himself, and not even lift his head? You may have heard people say things like, &quot;If I go to church the building will fall down, or God will strike me with lightning&quot; This is a jokingly, superstitious expression, but yet it carries with it the connotation (implication) that I can’t be in the presence of God, I am not good enough. And anyone who thinks that they are not good enough is 100% correct. <strong>We are not good enough for God</strong>. This is where the Pharisee went wrong, but the tax-collector went right. Look at the repentant attitude and godly sorrow of the tax collector. It says that he &quot;<strong>beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&quot; </strong>This seven word prayer was received more than the thirty-three word prayer of the Pharisee! Why, because God is looking for an honest heart, not a self- righteous one.

In Luke 15 Jesus spoke of lost things. He told three parables which are common earthly situations told as a story to explain transcendent heavenly truths. Jesus often swung his listeners from the natural to the spiritual. And in these three parables He speaks about a lost sheep, a lost coin, and a lost son. The shepherd left the ninety-nine sheep to go after the one, the woman swept her whole house to find that precious coin, and the father of the prodigal son ran to his son when he saw him coming home from squandering his wealth in wild living. In each situation when the lost thing was found, what was the result? The shepherd, the woman, and the father ALL had the same response, they threw a party! Verse 6 says of the shepherd, &quot;<strong>And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home</strong>” Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, `<strong>Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep</strong>.' Verse 9 reads of the woman, “<strong>And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, `Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin</strong>.' And verse 23 states of the prodigal son, <strong>“Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate</strong>” <strong>This was all over the lost things being found</strong>. But here is the bigger picture. Oh yes there was a party going on down below, but it could not compare with the party going on up above in heaven. Jesus said in <strong>Luke 15:7, &quot;I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent</strong>. And again in <strong>Luke 15:10 &quot;In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&quot; </strong>

We all know what it’s like to lose something for a time, search diligently and the finally to find it. If you are not a Christian then measure your life against the 10 Commandments seeing if your broke them one by one, and then repent of your sin, receive His forgiveness, and live for God, being faithful in prayer, Bible reading and obedience. If you are a Christian then you need to be telling people about the truth of Christ. Has heaven ever thrown a party because you lead someone to Christ, or is heaven disappointed because you have been a party popper, not sharing your faith in Christ with non-believers? Who are you actively sharing the gospel with, and praying that heaven has a party in God’s honor. You share, God saves and He gets all the credit and heaven rejoices over Him who has saved a lost soul. Think about it, and obey the Lord. Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 15:25-32, “…&quot;The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, `Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!' `My son,' the father said, `you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”</strong>

Look at the perspective, and attitude the older brother had, which is similar to the attitude most of the modern church has today. The late Bill Bright reports in his book “The Coming Revival” that 98% of Christians don’t try and actively reach the lost and only 2% of Christians are doing their job. <!--more-->
The rest are like the taxi cabs that drive around “off duty”. In NYC I see tons of yellow taxi cabs, taxiing people to various destinations. I can’t imagine if only 2% of the taxi cabs drove around on duty, while 98% of them had their sign light up reading “off duty.” That would be ludicrous because why would they be calling themselves taxi cab drivers if they never try and pick people up to taxi around? They might as well get another job.

The vast majority are driving around in the nice atmosphere of worship, prayer, and praise (each necessary and important), but neglecting the sober task God has given to us to seek and save the lost. Oswald J. Smith said, &quot;<em>Oh my friends we are loaded down with countless church activities, while the real work of the Church, that of evangelizing the world and winning the lost is almost entirely neglected</em>.“

The “faithful son” wasn’t concerned about his lost brother, but focused on himself. He was similar to the Pharisee who compared himself to the tax collector (Luke 18). The Pharisee and the older son shared the same spirit, and we see their attitude in the following: Both focused on themselves, compared themselves with the one they thought less of, and had no concern for the lost. The “lost” tax-collector was calling out to God, and the lost son came home to the father, yet neither of the two men cared about the lost. The prodigal’s dad had a heart for his lost son, and rejoiced when the lost now found. The father pleaded with his older son’s, tried to deal with his anger even persuading him to change his perspective, but the older son’s stubborn ways would not be moved. I can see that grieving the father’s heart, just as that attitude grieves Father God’s heart. Imagine if God were a Fire Chief and his firefighters were polishing their fire engine outside a burning building. If they were consumed with the truck’s beauty then they wouldn’t hear the cries of help from terrified people trapped at a top floor window. There's nothing wrong with cleaning their truck, but not while people are trapped in a burning building! What would the Fire Chief think and feel about his firefighter?.

Application: We are called to rescue people from a greater fire that is why <strong>Revelation 19:15</strong> reads, “<strong>If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire</strong>”. As a firefighter on God’s force, where is your focus?, on polishing your engine of worship, prayer, and praise, or running into the burning buildings with the full armor of God, especially the gospel boots of peace to seek and to save the lost? We are to preach the gospel only two times, “<strong>in season and out of season</strong>” As a Christian you are always to be “on duty,” concerned for the lost, showing the lost their need for the Savior so Heaven can be a constant party place, as all of heaven rejoices. Be a taxi cab driver that always is on duty to taxi people to Christ. Charles Spurgeon &quot;<em>Have you no wish for others to be saved? Then you are not saved yourself. Be sure of that.</em>&quot; Just imagine, being in heaven with all those you’ve shared the gospel with, and brought to Christ, both knowingly and unknowingly. There is going to be a major Party in heaven called the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, which I believe will be a culmination of all that have been called by God and been active, if they were able, in bringing people to Christ. Get busy and have attitude like the Father for the lost, you won’t want to miss out of Heaven’s Ultimate Party with the Captain of the Host! Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 31:6-11, “I have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have commanded you : the Tent of Meeting,the Ark of the Testimony with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent-.They are to make them just as I have commanded you” </strong>

When God puts us on any task or assignment, He has already equipped/furnished us with ALL the necessary element or ingredients to complete/finish that particular task. <!--more-->
Now our success depends to how best we use the same in order to accomplish the task…There are many Christians and Non-Christians who still grumble that they do not have any talent or ability or expertise. But the above verse says that He had given skill to<strong>ALL</strong> the craftsmen to make everything He had commanded…If we try to do some tasks which are assigned or allotted to someone else, then definitely we find something lacking…But God has called us for something different. He has a specific plan for each of us…He has called some to be apostles, some teachers, some evangelists and so on .Our God is just and is not partial and does not show favoritism …His love and justice is exhibited by the very fact that the sun is the same for everyone and gives equal light to all, irrespective of whether he admires God or not and whether He understands Him or not…Though there are people who worship the creation instead of the Creator (Worshippers of Sun or Worshippers of Trees ,whom I met) ,God still demonstrates His patience by sending rain on all the people equally…It is never like a good rain for a believers field and complete drought for a wicked person…The very Creation speaks of His accommodative nature…So He has given ALL the people talents ..

We read of Noah, a blameless and a righteous person among the people of his time who were so wicked and they grieved/pained God’s heart …But in view of the planned terrible destruction through floodwaters on the earth, God commanded him to “<strong>Make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out, This is how you are to build it :The Ark 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high</strong>” …It had to made with three decks

There was never rain till then, on the entire earth. Imagining ourselves in place of Noah, how difficult it is to obey God’s command in the midst of people who were making fun of him, scorning this very idea, ridiculing that there was never a rain but he was building an ark for the floodwaters …He never had our authentic or dependable Bible, which could always give some previous references of such tough situations or examples or illustrations of such wonders performed by the Almighty….The only basis or the foundation for this gigantic/colossal task of building an ark was God’s voice...and nothing else…How much time/money /efforts must Noah have invested in this venture ??? Not knowing the result finally. All because of his strong faith /trust in his Creator…Whatever be the opposition or whatever may be the cost involved, he was ready to do it and the final result as mentioned in<strong>Genesis 6:22 “Noah did everything just as God commanded him</strong>” This also proves that God had given the skill to do everything He had commanded.. Yes, these heroes of faith have proved to entire humanity and all the coming generations that God’s word is trustworthy….…God sent the rain ,as He had promised in the six hundredth year of his life and thus he was safeguarded from the destruction by the same ark, though everything else had perished… to continue]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 31:6 -11, “I have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have commanded you : the Tent of Meeting ,the Ark of the Testimony with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent-.They are to make them just as I have commanded you” </strong>

Now what is this “tent of meeting” which the Lord had commanded about above ..Exodus 33 clearly describes it ” <strong>7 Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of meeting. <!--more-->
And it came to pass that everyone who sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of meeting which was outside the camp. 8 So it was, whenever Moses went out to the tabernacle, that all the people rose, and each man stood at his tent door and watched Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle. 9 And it came to pass, when Moses entered the tabernacle, that the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses. 10 All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tabernacle door, and all the people rose and worshiped, each man in his tent door. 11 So the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he would return to the camp, but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tabernacle”</strong>

Literally we may not be asked to build an ark or pitch a tent but we have to spiritually build our bodies for becoming a meeting place with God<strong>…”Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you ,whom you have received from God?” 1Corinthians 6:19</strong> ..So we need to build our body as the “<strong>Tent of Meeting</strong>”-a place where God’s presence can dwell …Yes, God needs to dwell there…/reside/inhabit or settle comfortably….The world cannot see Jesus Christ, rather we need to exhibit Him….God has given us the skill …He has set the conscience within us –rather the sense of right and wrong /principles/ethics … Question, are we building our bodies to become a meeting place with Almighty or with Satan ? We are indeed a temple in which the Spirit of God dwells…”<strong>Therefore I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God-this is your spiritual act of worship”, Romans 12:1. </strong>

Noah struggled but built the ark , which became a blessing to many…If we also build our bodies as “the tent of meeting” in which God dwells, then we will be a blessing and refuge for many perishing souls. No one can escape with an idea they are not given the necessary skill /talent …The parable of talents in <strong>Mathew 25:15</strong> says<strong>” To one he gave five talents of money, to another, two talents and to another one, one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey</strong> …Yes, God has entrusted/delegated certain tasks for which we are accountable, each according to our ability.. <strong>”Just and true are your ways”</strong>. There are so many, in dire poverty but why did God bless us like this ? How are we using our skills? There are many ways of livelihood/employment etc. but how are we balancing our priorities ? Since I had to spend almost three hours in traveling for work, I had asked God ”Oh Lord, you ensure that I have a job very close to my house, so that I will save time and spend time in your mighty ministry”. So He answered ”You cannot lay down conditions for me, rather obey me…In whatever time you are left with, be faithful and involve in your work…I will answer your prayers”. Though it was quite tough to obey His voice, after a tiring day, but by His grace took some time to work in His vineyard…Though it is very less, God values everything we do…May be our human authorities do not appreciate or recognize our effort/exertion, God does…”<strong>The Lord works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed “ Psalms 103:6.</strong> Soon, God taught me how to manage the work, which I used to take 11 hours earlier , now in less than 8 hours. Yes, He is the storehouse of wisdom and knowledge, He is an ever present help in times of trouble …Though my colleagues stay late, God enables me to complete my work in time, which was nothing less than a miracle ……“ <strong>4 For You, LORD, have made me glad through Your work; I will triumph in the works of Your hands.” Psalms 92:4 to finish, Sarah Susan</strong>]]></content:encoded>

To complete these series, there was a Notification by the Government regarding very few posts in APGENCO (Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation ) and my qualification was just suitable…<!--more-->
Though many had gone for coaching to pass through the Written Examination, my God had been helping me get the right study materials ( when there were so many advisers, so many books and so on) and was indeed my Tutor to solve my doubts, Mentor to lift me in case of any fears…”Just as Mary addresses him in<strong>John 20: 16 “She turned to him and cried out in Aramaic “Rabboni “(which means Teacher ) “I will instruct you and teach you the in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you.” Psalms 32:8</strong> Yes, with experience,

I can confidently say that we need ask for His promises and He will guide us in the right path…Today, there are so many people who are unable to know God’s will….If we have a close friend, will we not share our secrets and tell them our ways, If that is the case, why will God not reveal His will in our lives…Why are there so much confusion/chaos –in families/ work spots/ churches. Because we do not find time to hear God’s voice …There is a saying, ”<strong>If Satan cannot make you bad, he will make you busy</strong>” Yes, this is happening everywhere.. People do not find time for God…Work is definitely not worship for a believer,… With God’s help, we can manage our work well within the specified time targets, and that too with accuracy…Even if some error creeps in, He will enable us to overcome it…As His name suggests, He is Wonderful …Isaiah prophesies even before Jesus was born that He is the “<strong>Wonderful Counselor, Everlasting Father, Mighty God and the Prince of Peace</strong> ” God enabled me to score 82 out of 100, by which I was among the toppers and He fought the battle for me, thus helping me to perform well in the interview and group discussion. But the results were not announced. We heard that there were also attempts to bribe and buy the post (because of the benefits in the job) and also there were severe/acute political pressures and hence there was indefinite delay…through which I had to move more close to the Lord. So when I looked to Him, He answered me through <strong>Psalms 34“How great is your goodness which you have stored up for those who fear you ,which you bestow in the sight of men on those who take refuge in you. In the shelter of your presence you hide them from the intrigues of men”. </strong>God had comforted me that any conspiracy or plots of wicked men will not prosper since He is fighting on our behalf “The battle is the Lord’s. Without a single recommendation or influence, God enabled to me to secure the government job , with 50% hike in the salary ,with lesser time at work spot ( now 5 hours instead of 8 hours)..

Yes, with confidence ,I can reassure, God gives everything required to do the task He has assigned to each one of us because what God does is by the divine building plan that only comes from Him and accomplished by Him. What a faithful God He is.

What are you looking to God for today, what is the motive behind the request? Do you desire for it to be built by God’s divine plan? Is what you desire more about having more time to serve Him?

Praise the Lord for His unfailing faithfulness…. Blessings Sarah Susan]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 11:28, &quot;Come to me, all ye, heavy laden and I will give you rest&quot;</strong>

In today's scenario, no one likes to meet any person, who is heavy laden or to help any such person or spend time with people who are very tensed, depressed or anxious for various reasons. But our dear Lord invites such people who have heavy burdens, whatever the reason may be. <!--more-->
Not only, it is an invitation of warm welcome followed by the assurance of PERFECT REST. <strong>1Peter 5:7, says &quot;Cast your burden on the Lord because He cares for you</strong>&quot; Yes God is bearing our burden and that too, gladly... For instance, a young child getting back from school with a very heavy bag , unable to carry it.. His/her mother or father will immediately run to the child and definitely take the heavy bag and give the child some relief ..Why ? The primary reason is love ...Yes, the love of the parents towards their children ...This is a shadow of God's love. Compared to the AGAPE love which is of God, even our earthly fathers falls short of His love.

One time I woke up only to remember the pressures I was to face during one particular day at office. I had auditors visiting and God strengthened me with this verse <strong>&quot;Praise be to the Lord, to God, our SAVIOR , who daily bears our burdens</strong>&quot; ..I immediately gathered courage for the day, miraculously witnessed God bring me out of this particular situation and every other. I praised God further for strengthening my faith to believe that He loves me and gladly bears my daily burdens...

What a blessing it is to be with the Lord who bears our burdens, who loves to listen to us, and also gives us rest despite attacks from Satan /enemies /troubles/ fears/ shocks/day today worries or whatever it is

<strong>Psalms 91 says &quot;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will REST in the shadow of the Almighty&quot;</strong> . What is this dwelling place? it’s a place where one lives/stays/resides/abides. Any person on earth goes home after the days' work ...generally ,a person loves to get back to his house/dwelling as often as possible , as early as possible.. Now let us meditate on God Himself being our dwelling ..

If we love our earthly dwelling, which is quite temporary, then how much more are we to love our heavenly, permanent dwelling -our temple Himself ? Do we love to stay in Him, reside in Him, abide in Him consistently and continuously? Not just for a season, or time period for a gain or a favor but forever and ever ...If we are inclined to spend time with Him, then we can be assured of His rest.. David states that He loves to stay in the temple of the Lord forever and ever. Yes, let us love to abide in Him and continue in Him so that we can enjoy the rest in His bosom for ever and ever... Let us all eagerly wait for the day when we , all will be in His loving fold, God Himself wiping our tears from our eyes, and providing us REST for eternity... , Sarah Susan]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Why should we give thanks to God? King David sings in <strong>Psalm 103</strong> regarding some of the major reasons why one should praise God

<strong>“Praise God O My soul all my inmost being, praise His holy name –who forgives all your sins”</strong>A person very dear to us may somehow manage to forgive some sins but the important aspect in forgiving is “to forget”, which a mere human being cannot do…”Love keeps no record of wrongs” as per <strong>1Corinthians 13</strong> .<!--more-->
If God starts recording our wrongs/sins, then we cannot stand in His holy presence. The precious blood of Jesus is the ever ready solution for our trespasses so that immediately on confession, sins are washed out and we are justified to appear in His presence. He forgives “ALL OUR SINS” Sometimes people find it easy to forgive some sins but not all sins…We need to thank God for being so gracious for forgiving all sins, irrespective of the type or seriousness involved.

He heals all our diseases, yes God is a healer. There is no disease greater than God …”<strong>1John 4:4 says ”The one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world”</strong> So God is greater than any disease or any sickness we face. Disease may not exactly be physical but also mental…Nowadays everywhere we see people suffering with depression/stress which are also classified as diseases. As we can see in the Bible, He can cure any disease, do any surgery (As He did in Genesis 2:21 ,where God did a surgery to Adam , in His sleep )..What a wonderful God we serve.

He redeems our lives from the pit ..There are occasions where people find themselves fallen/oppressed/downtrodden ..They are in a pit …Usually people in the pit are not even noticed…They are not only fallen on the ground but they are thrown /forced into a hole in the ground ???” King David narrates “Unless the Lord has been my help, I would have soon dwelt in the silence of death. When I said ”My foot is slipping” your love O Lord supported me. When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul” Psalms 94:18,19 Really there are times when we are in a pit of anxieties/tensions/worries but His love is our only support…”

He crowns us with His love and compassion…The unchanging God is God of compassion ….2 Corinthians 1:3 says He is a God of ALL COMFORT …People may definitely comfort us for a season but they may lose hope on us at times…God is a God of all comfort in all our troubles …Today people are crowned with problems and tensions, but we are so privileged to be crowned with love from God. Satan does not allow us to give thanks, he reminds us of some difficulties instead of counting the number of blessings showered on us… The crowns in this world are temporary…Today a person may be in very high authority /position but this would not last…He cannot enjoy it throughout his life…One day or the other, he has to retire from the post…

He satisfies our desires with good things…Our God always satisfies our desires when they are right of course …Whatever it may be, whether a job or a life partner or a house ..and so on. He is mindful of the smallest desire of each person …Really we have a wonderful God who caters to all our needs though He has many people to take care of he never makes mistakes in this process of supplying/providing ..That is why the saints sing in<strong>Revelation 15:3 ”Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty, Just and true are your ways ,King of the Ages”

</strong>So that our youth is renewed like the eagle’s he satisfies our desires with good things so that we are renewed…It is not that He satisfies our desires today and not tomorrow. His supply is consistent and continuous…since He has everything in abundance…His supply will never run dry

So let us all resolve to praise Him at all times in all circumstances with all our mind and strength and soul. Amen!

Regards

Sarah Susan]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><img class="attachment-post-thumbnail alignright" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2a497106249d2950116dfb3b0a6d0bf0.jpg?w=236&amp;h=179&amp;crop=1" alt="2a497106249d2950116dfb3b0a6d0bf0" width="215" height="163" />Philippians 2:19-22, “But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I know your state. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state</span>. For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus. But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he served with me in the gospel”</strong>

We all love to work with reliable, trustworthy people, those who keep their word. As my friend Pastor Phil once wrote “<em>At one time in American history there was a saying that a man’s word was his bond</em>”, that has somehow changed over the years. I think this is why we want things written down (contracts, rules and regulations) discussed and agreed upon because man has a tendency of not following through what he has vowed to accomplish and needs to be kept accountable.<!--more-->

To count on someone is to have traits, patterns, testimony of who they are. And the thing I believe is the measuring stick is the word “consistency”. Consistency by definition is the state or quality of holding or sticking together and retaining shape. People who are consistent are not easily swayed by what is around. Some thinker penned these words <em>“Consistency is better than rare great moments. It is not perfection; it is simply refusing to give up</em>”. <strong>If you are persistent you will get it, if you are consistent, you will keep it.</strong>

Paul in writing to churches always talked about the state of some believers he worked with. You read either commendations (those he talks highly of) and/or those he discredits. Here we find that he had a soft spot for Timothy because for Timothy had demonstrated consistency in his faithfulness and reliability, and Paul could count on him. He writes <strong>Philippians 2:20</strong>, “<strong>For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state. For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus”. </strong>Timothy would be a true reflection on Paul the reason he entrusted him with this journey<strong>. </strong>Timothy had learned to think and act like Paul having taken to heart Paul’s words to the <strong>Corinthians</strong>,<strong> “Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ.” 1Corinthians 11:1. </strong>A few folks like Demas and John Mark had not demonstrated their consistency at some point therefore Paul would hesitate to send them to certain churches. Paul had confidence in Timothy something we want our bosses, pastors, leaders to think of us, however this is not a gift, this is developed over time.

We can understand how consistency is important; it allows others to provide us with seal of approval. We need to be regarded trustworthy for a cause. The last thing any man may want to do is give their word and not follow through. Often I hear children or wives says something like this, “<em>you promised to do this or take me somewhere but now you are changing your mind</em>” this comes about after changing the original plans to cater to other commitments that should not take priority over their word. Men need be counted on to be there when they say they will and set that example to others. We need to be men that work under minimum or no supervision to accomplish tasks for we have given our word. Men that can be trusted because the person assigning or involving us has considered us like minded as seen in our consistency. On our own we are unable, ask Peter who had good intentions of not denying Christ only to find his words fell short and could not be consistent with his actions.

Suppose you were one of the men that walked with Paul, would he consider you like minded entrusting you to a mission? Perhaps you will say no because you notice inconsistency in who you are and what you do.

Let’s us pray and ask the Lord to pray for us like He did for Peter that we be steadfast, immovable, always, continually, consistently doing the work of the Lord, knowing our labor is not in vain. Let us be men of our word. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>James 1:2-8, “…a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways</strong>.,"<a id="set-post-thumbnail" class="thickbox" title="Set featured image" href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-admin/media-upload.php?post_id=5679&amp;type=image&amp;TB_iframe=1"><img class="attachment-post-thumbnail alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2a497106249d2950116dfb3b0a6d0bf01.jpg?w=183&amp;h=275&amp;crop=1" alt="2a497106249d2950116dfb3b0a6d0bf0" width="140" height="210" /></a>

In continuing to deal with the word consistency, faith is another aspect that requires consistency. The disciples in a number of times lacked consistency to the point you read of the Lord asking them, “<strong>where is your faith</strong>”, <strong>Luke 8:25.</strong> Several instances he called them “<strong>O you of little faith</strong>”, <strong>Matthew 6:30, 8:26,14:31, 16:8, Luke 12:28</strong>. Unique challenges and length of time posed a threat to their faith often throwing them to doubting mode.<!--more-->

James encourages brethren who face various trials that challenge their faith to count it all joy, why, vs. “<strong>3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience</strong>”. Peter a disciples of Jesus who earlier on struggled with his faith penned these words <strong>1Peter 1</strong>:<strong>6-7, “6 In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials,7 </strong><strong style="line-height:1.5;">that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ”. </strong><span style="line-height:1.5;">Both men uses the word joy (rejoice), testing of faith, patience (endurance). </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">The testing of faith teaches men how to profit through trials instead of taking exits and trying other things.</span>

Knowing what faith needs to go through, James in some way is telling us not to rush it or be unwise. Not to ask to be brought out but rather to be brought through. And his charge<strong>, vs4. “but let patience have it’s perfect work…” </strong>and if you lack wisdom<strong> vs. 5, </strong>Ask God who gives to all liberally. He further writes that all these to be asked in faith expecting to receive otherwise such a person he considers a double-minded which is to also say unstable not in some but all his ways. He says of the doubting person that he is “<strong>like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind</strong>”

A doubter is a double-minded person. Jesus had in mind such a person when He spoke of the one who tries to serve two masters (<strong>Matthew 6:24</strong>). As such, he is “unstable,” which comes from a Greek word meaning “<em>unsteady, wavering, in both his character and feelings</em>.” A double-minded person is restless and confused in his thoughts, his actions, and his behavior. He lacks maturity in the testing of his faith. Behind him is a trail of inconsistency having missed or exited the furnace where faith is tested and tried.

Biblical manhood calls for men to be steadfast in their faith, in other words be firm in purpose, in resolution. The testing of faith matures men to stand firm in the doctrine of Christ lest they stumble, <strong>Ephesians 4:13-15, “<del></del>13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, 15 but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ</strong>”

The testing of faith teaches men to be loyal to the faith, <strong>2Timothy 1:12-13, “12 For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day. 13 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus</strong>”

All these among others are impossible without God, therefore Peter says in <strong>1Peter 1:5</strong> that we are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation. <strong>Matthew 24:13, reads “But he who endures to the end shall be saved”. </strong>This is the perseverance of the saints or as RC Sproul calls it the preservation of the saints<strong>. </strong>Only God has the power of preserving our faith until the end even when it feels like the heat is so hot and we may feel like breaking. With this thought, we must cast our eyes upon Him alone to preserve us. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5686" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2a497106249d2950116dfb3b0a6d0bf02.jpg" alt="2a497106249d2950116dfb3b0a6d0bf0" width="147" height="147" />Luke 22:39-45, "39 Coming out, He went to the Mount of Olives, as He was <span style="text-decoration:underline;">accustomed</span>, and His disciples also followed Him. ...41 And He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and prayed,..."</strong>

The Gospel according to Luke chronicles the ministry of Jesus fueled by His prayer life. Matthew mentions pray (prayer, prayed, praying) at least 19 times, Mark 13 times, John 8 times but Luke 27 times (in the book of Acts by Luke 32 times). Of the 161 mentions of prayers in the NT, 36% (59) times are mentioned by Luke either in reference to Jesus or the apostles. I believe Luke wanted us to see how effective, fervent, consistent prayer of a righteous man avails much.<!--more-->

I find it interesting that both Matthew and Mark note in the above passage that Jesus came to the garden of Gethsemane to pray, Luke adds the word "<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">accustomed".</span></strong> Luke lets us know that this was a frequent place Jesus came to pray. This was a regular pattern as Luke notes when he highlights significant times Jesus prayed at baptism, <strong>Luke 3:21</strong>, before He appointed the disciples, <strong>Luke 6:12, </strong>on the mount of transfiguration<strong>, Luke 9:18-29, </strong>as the disciples found Him praying and asked Him to teach them to pray, <strong>Luke 11</strong>.

To have the mind of Christ, imitate Him and be conformed to His image, we must learn what He considered priority and be drawn to that. Prayer was His life, when they turned temple into a business place, He turned the tables and reminded those who were there that His house was a house of prayer.

On the day of His betrayal, under pressure, in agony, travailing, in anguish, He still prayed as He was accustomed to. Nothing deterred Him in good times or in bad times. Even as the disciples who should have stood with Him to pray fell asleep after He warned them to watch and pray, they were not burdened as He was. Their state did not discourage Him from praying. Jesus would face the temptation of forfeiting the cross, yet He prayed earnestly, consistently for the will of God to be done. The bible then says angels who are made lower than Him came and ministered to Him.

As the disciples walked with Jesus, having seen and experienced what it meant to have a consistent prayer life, they learnt a valuable lesson. And while they slept and fell into temptation, they would not repeat the same once the commission was given and empowered by the Holy Spirit. They did not even think that now that they were filled with the Holy Spirit they should not pray. If anything that fueled them to pray earnestly and we see that consistency throughout the book of Acts. <strong>Acts 2:42 “And they <span style="text-decoration:underline;">continued steadfastly</span> in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers</strong>, <strong>Acts 6:4, “but we will give <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ourselves continually</span> to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”</strong> Read the accounts of Peter in Acts, he was praying everywhere.

Prayers calls for persistence and consistence. When we work we work, when we pray God works <strong>“For bodily exercise profits a little…”, 1Timothy 4:8</strong>, BUT “…<strong>The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”, James 5:16</strong>. One profits a little, the other avails much.

A man driving His family to a destination must stay awake, alert and effective on the wheels. The moment he falls asleep, he has exposed both himself and his family to danger. This is the tragedy of not being steadfast, sober and vigilant as biblical men in prayers. The enemy takes advantage of that and we must not fall asleep on the prayer wheel.  <strong>1Timothy 2:8, “I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting;”. </strong>On our own again we can’t, that is why we must come to the Lord everyday and say, <strong>“Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.”, Luke 11:1. </strong>Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 9:1-41, “25 He answered and said, “Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.”<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5895" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image3.jpg" alt="image" width="236" height="236" /></a></strong>

The story of a man born blind in <strong>John 9</strong> is one of my favorite healing stories in the bible. John dedicates a whole chapter to address the healing of this man and the response from both those who saw him healed and his own testimony. While this is a notable miracle, the emphasis here is not the miracle but the purpose of the miracle. This is a picture of salvation, the testimony that lasts. This is a picture of He who initiates the salvation process and completes it. This is a picture of being born of water and the Spirit (washing and believing)<!--more-->

Vs. 1 says, “<strong>Now as Jesus passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth”. </strong>It’s Jesus who saw him, it’s Jesus who corrected the disciples of their thinking and the Pharisees that though we are all impacted by the original sin, it was not for this reason this man was born blind otherwise it would be concluded that all those born with defects were more sinners than those who were not. His response <strong>vs. 3, “…“Neither this man nor his parents sinned, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">but that the works of God should be revealed in him</span>... 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” </strong>This statement alone is the heartbeat of Christianity, the glory of God and not the happiness of man as commonly preached.

<strong> </strong>Watch what the Lord does,<strong> vs. 6, “When He had said these things, He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. 7 And He said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing”. </strong>Unlike Naaman who first protested the means by which he would be healed, this man’s response was different<strong>. </strong>God gives grace to the humble and leads them by His ways<strong>, James 4:6. </strong>Christ cured many who were blind by disease or accident; here He cured one born blind as the man later alludes that never before was it heard of one healed born blind. This miracle was to live as a monument to the Redeemer's glory, and recommend His grace to all who desire the same precious salvation.

Of course his healing did not bring people to rejoice with him or over Jesus but rather question what had happened to him. His neighbors vs. 10 asked him how his eyes were opened. Not only did his neighbors question his testimony, the Pharisees did the same. They tried to cast doubt on the healed by labeling Jesus a sinner because He had healed on Sabbath. If that was not enough, the Pharisees sought his parents to cast doubts on his testimony too by declaring the same. Because his parents feared being excommunicated, they pushed the responsibility of giving the account back to their son. No one would stand with him only his faith in the One who had healed him and gave him a testimony, vs. 25, “…<strong>One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.”</strong>

The more they tried to cast doubt in him, the more he became bolder and bolder in giving his testimony. Vs. "<strong>30 The man answered and said to them, “Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes! 31 Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him. 32 Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. 33 If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.” </strong>None of what they said derailed him, he was consistent. All against one man with a testimony yet in all his faith and testimony got stronger. He identified the One that healed Him as Jesus, as a Prophet, as a man from God and finally as Lord when Jesus revealed Himself. <strong>vs. 35 “… He said to him, “Do you believe in the Son of God?” 36 He answered and said, “Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?” 37 And Jesus said to him, “You have both seen Him and it is He who is talking with you.” 38 Then he said, “Lord, I believe!” And he worshiped Him</strong>”. It started with Christ who saw him, touched him, sent him, found him again and revealed Himself to him.

In the work of grace wrought upon the soul we see the change, but we see not the hand that makes it: the way of the Spirit is like that of the wind, which you heard the sound of, but cannot tell where it comes, nor where  it goes. The more we stand, the more He reveals Himself. This is the testimony of God (<strong>1Corinthians 2:1</strong>), and this has become our testimony (<strong>Revelations 12:11</strong>).

Our testimony fails in comparison to His which never fails the reason we need to embrace and declare His testimony that salvation is of the Lord and nothing can cast doubt upon us who have received it by grace through faith. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>2Corinthians 4:7, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,"</b>

<b><img class="  wp-image-5708 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="205" height="140" /></b>

The new year has began, not everyone has began it on a good note. My family for one is in a trying period having finished the year with one only to open with another. The reality is that we live in a fallen world full of pain and suffering, however we as believers can be different from the world by learning to profit from trials.

When it comes to afflictions/trials, three men in new testament tells us how we should respond to them. James encourages us to count it all joy. Paul encourages to consider them light. Peter on the other hand encourages us not to think them strange. Only the grace of God enables us to speak and live in the light of such words with confidence.<!--more-->

Greater testimony is not on what you have achieved but what you have survived, something these men were all aware of. They speak from experience and we learn from them. "<b>In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials, that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ</b>", <b>1Peter 1:6.</b> Genuine faith tested is preserved through fire.

Deeper joy surfaces and becomes believers strength when we learn to profit from trials, "<b>the joy of the Lord is our strength". "Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia: that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality", 2Corinthians 8:1</b>.

Patience is a must to every wise men. Patience is mastered in the sea of life as the faith goes through different stages and matures belivers to stand through anything having been equiped lacking nothing to stand, "<b>My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing", James 1:2.</b>

Light affliction as Paul puts it enables believers to hold on tight to Christ looking forward to blessed hope which cannot be compared to the current suffering, "<b>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,", 2Corinthians 4:7. "Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy", 1Peter 4:12.</b>

May the Lamb who was slain receive the reward of His suffering as we become partakers in the fellowship of His suffering for the glory of His name, "<b>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen", Jude 1:24. </b>Blessings Ev

Some thoughts to help us through trying times

1. I am in better place than I DESERVE
2. God owes me nothing, I owe it all to Him
3. The challenges I am facing could be more worse than what it is
4. Someone else has it worse than I do and wish they were in my position.
5. I am far from where I started
6. I'd rather STAND in there than HANG in there. I get tired quickly hanging compared to standing.
7. I maintain memories of small beginnings, small and big victories, they remind me I have more to be thankful for than complain
8. There is always a big picture]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5727 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image1.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="143" /></a>Jeremiah 32:6-8, "6 And Jeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me, saying, 7 ‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, “Buy my field which is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it. ” 8 ’ Then Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD."</strong>

In our times many people equate God's invention in lives by great signs, wonders and miracles. If God is not perfoming these things then perhaps we are not experiencing God's abundant blessing as some may want us to believe.<!--more-->

This is no different from the Israelites who lived on the verge of miracles. They only rejoiced when they saw God do something extraoridanry, spectacular, supernatural. This how they tested God's provision. They looked ahead at specific things they asked for, but rarely looked back to see God's providence in their day to day lives.

Why should we value providence more than miracles? Because providence is the means by and through which we learn that God governs all things in the universe. It is the protective care of God. The doctrine of divine providence asserts that God is in complete control of all things. This includes the universe as a whole (<strong>Psalm 103:19</strong>), the physical world (<strong>Matthew 5:45</strong>), the affairs of nations (<strong>Psalm 66:7</strong>), human birth and destiny (<strong>Galatians 1:15</strong>), human successes and failures (<strong>Luke 1:52</strong>), and the protection of His people (<strong>Psalm 4:8</strong>). This doctrine stands in direct opposition to the idea that the universe is governed by chance or fate. Your life and its affairs are governed by God's providence. <strong>Acts 17:28, "for in Him we live and move and have our being..."</strong>

The providence of God is rarely preached, much emphasies are on the miracles of God which in my judgement are often very temporal. Our call is not to live on the verge of miracles even though we need them but on the realm of blessings when we understand that God governs all.

We see God's providence with Jeremiah. God tells him to a buy a parcel of land for the right price despite being in jail. The land he is to buy would also be taken by the Chaldeans as they go into exile. You and I would question the wisdom in making that move. It is clear they were going away with no sign of them coming back and even if they did, how would he recover his land or even a better question, what guarantees he would still be alive then? While we question the wisdom of this move, Jeremiah gladly did when he understood it was of the Lord. This was to encourage them that Lord in His providence would sustain them in exile as they went through a pruning process. And the Lord would bring them back and restore what they had lost.

God provided the finances, the land, the wisdom, the encouragement and Jeremiah in response extoled God's great name "‘<strong>Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You.", Jeremiah 32:17.
</strong>
God governs every aspect of our lives we enjoy, it comes from Him. The strength to wake up and go to work, ability to drive and stay on the right lane, to obey, to manage family affairs, finances, assets, wisdom to start things, make right choices, plan for retirement, have investements and the list goes on, these are all God's providence for us. "<strong>Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God", Ecclessistes 2:24.</strong>

For those consumed with pursuit of miracles, have you done an inventory as a whole to see God's providence in your life? It is good to manage even our worldly affairs in faith; to do common business with reference to the providence and promise of God the same way Jeremiah did. We constantly need to be reminded that God is ever present in the details. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 29:19-20, “Take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet… “<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5737" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog2.jpg" alt="blog2" width="275" height="183" /></a></strong>

Aaron was the high priest of Israel and Moses’ right hand man. He was a spiritual leader, and therefore both he and his sons went through a priestly ritual of being consecrated by blood. They were to have blood applied to three of their extremities which were: the lobe of the priest’s right ear, the right thumb, and the right big toe. Peter says, “<strong>But you are a chosen people, <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">a royal priesthood</span></em>, a holy nation, a people belonging to God…“, </strong><strong>1Peter 2:9.</strong><!--more-->

The priest’s ear had blood applied to it which is the organ that hears the word of God and they were to hear only the Word of the Lord. A spiritual leader needs to know what God is saying to them to minister unto God on behalf of the people. Many Christians desire to spiritual leaders, but are too busy listening to all the other voices speaking in their ear. Carmen says in His song, Not ashamed, “<em>There’s many voices in the wind, but only one that saves the soul from sin…”</em> From the media, to celebrities, to preachers, everyone wants you to listen to them. Even Evans and I want you to hear the Word of God that He speaks through us for you in the daily devotional ministry. However as a spiritual leader you need to make sure that you are hearing His voice to direct your life, your family, your community, and your ministry, because nothing compares to His Word to direct you.

Recall the account in <strong>Matthew 3</strong> whereby Jesus gets baptized by John. The Lord speaks out of heaven these words, “<strong>This is my Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased</strong>.” If there was a way to encourage Jesus or warm His heart, His Father certainly did that with His few yet powerful words. Yet just THREE verses later in <strong>Matthew 4</strong>, we see another voice speaking to Jesus, Satan himself. As a matter of fact he speaks to Jesus in three instances, and in all three instances Jesus hit the devil with the Word of God as He repeatedly stated to the devil the words, <strong>“It is written</strong>.” The enemy was relentless in trying to drown out the voice of the God the Father in the ear of His Son Jesus, but the Word of God was hidden in His heart <strong>(Psalm 119:9,11</strong>).

Aaron and His sons needed to have their ear tuned to God’s voice. In this day and age if you are a spiritual leader, or desire to be one, then you must learn how to block out the “other voices” that attempt to fill your ears with ungodly temptations, and nonsense. In Greek mythology the Siren’s were beautiful half-woman, half-birdlike creatures who sang such sweet songs that listeners forgot everything and died of hunger. The Sirens were sisters who lured sailors to their death by their irresistible song causing sailors to crash upon the reefs when they tried to reach the Sirens. Among those tempted were Jason on the Argo and Odysseus. Odysseus escaped from them by filling his crew's ears with wax while he tied himself to the ship's mast. The Argonauts were saved by Orpheus' music. The Argonauts were saved by listening to a sweeter melody, and what is sweeter than hearing the voice of our Father as the enemy tries to lead us to crash our lives upon the rocks of this world through his deceptive music. Moses sang, “<strong>The LORD is my strength and my song….</strong>” Is God’s Word that precious to you? <strong><em>To be continued…</em></strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Application</span></strong><strong>: Whose Word is in your ear more, God’s Word, or the world’s word? Are you being consistent and daily in your Bible reading? Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 29:19-2, “Take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet…”<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5740" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog1.jpg" alt="blog" width="225" height="225" /></a> </strong>

First we examined this verse and how the blood was applied to the ear lobe of the high priest Aaron and his sons. Second the blood was applied to the thumb on their right hand. What was so significant about that? well I’m glad you were pondering. Remember Peter wrote, “<strong>But you are a chosen people, <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">a royal priesthood</span></em>, a holy nation, a people belonging to God…”, </strong><strong>1 Peter 2:9</strong>. <!--more-->The priests were spiritual leaders and therefore performed priestly duties. As the ear was the organ that hears the Word of God, the thumbs were the organs by which the mediatorial work was to be performed on behalf of the people. There was certainly a right and a wrong way to serve God and God’s people. In <strong>Leviticus 10</strong> we read of how two of Aarons four sons Nadab and Abihu, profaned the sanctuary with strange fire and actually died before the Lord (vv.1-3). Judgment was very harsh for these two men, but no more so than it was for Ananias and Sapphira when the Christian church was just beginning (<strong>Acts 5</strong>). One needs to remember that “<strong>to whom more is given, more is required</strong>”; and Aaron and the congregation needed to know that God was real and that the priests were not playing a religious game.

Peter reminds us that as Christians we are all priests. And in light of that, Paul instructs us, “<strong>Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship.” Romans 12:1.</strong> I’ve always loved this verse, but there is a deep challenge within its words. A dead sacrifice can’t move, but a living sacrifice can crawl off the altar when God asks us to do something that our flesh rises up against. We are to give our lives to the Lord on the “altar of sacrifice” in simplest terms, by actively serving Him in ministry through the local church. We are to serve the Lord out of pure motives, and not out of selfish ambitions or vain conceit. This is why Paul tells us “<strong>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">faith</span>…,</strong> as he did for himself (<strong>1 Corinthians 9:27</strong>). There are so many believers that have so many gifts that God has invested in their lives. However each one needs to find, what I would call ministry SHAPE. This is in an acronym for Spiritual Gifts, Heart (passion), Abilities (natural), Personality, and Experiences. As Evans shared before in his message “<strong>Doing everything does not equal effectiveness</strong>”, ministers need others to help them do ministry. As a matter of fact <strong>Ephesians 4:11-12</strong> reads “<strong>It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare (equip) God’s people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up</strong>.” The ministry leaders are gifts to the local church, but the real ministers are to be the congregation. The ministry leader can’t do it all, they are there primarily to train others to do the work of the ministry.

Have you had the blood of Christ applied to your thumbs and found your ministry SHAPE yet? If so are you active or is ministry a spectator event for you? Can you imagine if every Christian had the biblical imperative, I was saved to serve? I can envision churches, and ministries exploding for the Lord, because He’s the One that gets the credit (glory). “<strong>Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you</strong>.” <strong>1 Timothy 4:14.</strong> The talents He’s invested in our lives, He expects a return on, Are we being wicked lazy servants talked about in (<strong>Matthew 25</strong>)?

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Application</span></strong><strong>: Ask a mature believer or perhaps a ministry leader to help you find your place in ministry, and serve God in that ministry. To continue, Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog3.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5743" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog3.jpg" alt="blog" width="263" height="156" /></a>Exodus 29:19-20, “Take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet…”
</strong>

Applying the blood to the ear, was about hearing only God’s Word, while applying it to the thumb was about rightly serving God and God’s people. Lastly, but equally important is the application of the blood covering to the "big toes of their right feet," so that the sanctified walk of the priests would be examples to the people. What priest walked here on earth in perfect righteousness?

<!--more-->Hebrews tells us, <strong>“Such a high priest [Jesus] meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens</strong> (<strong>7:26</strong>). A priest offers sacrifice on behalf of the people, and Jesus offered His very life to be the sacrifice as well. The many former OT priests died, ‘But this man [Jesus] because He continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood… “<strong>Who needs not daily, as those high priests to offer sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself</strong> (<strong>5:10; 7:24,27</strong>).” Jesus didn’t only offer the sacrifice as the priest, He was the sacrifice once and for all which is why he said, “<strong>It is finished on the cross.”</strong>

Jesus walked in righteousness as a priest proclaiming that He Himself came for this very purpose as He said, “<strong>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost</strong>.” If we are to walk in righteousness the blood of Christ needs to be applied to our big toe and the rest of our foot because God tells us<strong>, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”</strong> If we truly walk in righteousness our feet will be carrying us to preach the good news.” “<strong>But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference…”</strong> The Law and the prophets walked in righteousness to bring spoken testimony and point to Christ. Only faith in Christ can bring about God’s righteousness. The Law doesn’t make us righteous, it doesn’t help us, and rather it leaves us helpless with the need to throw ourselves at the feet of the Savior. After now being born again by the Holy Spirit, and realizing that “<strong>…you are a chosen people, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a royal priesthood</span>, a holy nation, a people belonging to God…”, </strong><strong>1Peter 2:9</strong>, we need to present our lives as living sacrifices to reach the lost for Christ. The lost need desperately to have the blood of the Savior applied to their sins to be redeemed from the curse of the Law of sin and death. God has left that mission to you and me to do. “<strong>We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us”, </strong><strong>2Corinthians 5:20</strong>.” “<strong>To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory”, </strong><strong>Colossians 1:27</strong>.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Application</span></strong>: Do you have the blood of Christ applied to your toe, and are your feet mobilized to go seek and save the lost. Are your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace (<strong>Ephesians 6:15</strong>)? If you want to be used by God then move those feet that God gave you for Him and His glory. “<em>Satan prefers 1,000,000 choir members or pew-warmers to one Christian who is prepared to obey the command to preach the Gospel (Ray Comfort)”</em> Many believers have their feet stuck it seems when its time for obeying our mission to seek and save the lost because of all the excuses and a lack of zeal and urgency. To bring common ground many have said “<em>he puts his pants on one leg at a time. However there is one group, they put their pants on two legs at a time</em>”. Firefighters live with a sense of urgency, because they must respond to the alarm that they must GO or people will die. How much more truthful can that reality be for the Christians. You’re either going or staying, but only is done in obedience and you know which that is. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Now GO!</span></strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 3:1-21, "3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God"</strong>

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog22.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5754" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog22.jpg?w=150" alt="blog2" width="150" height="150" /></a>Paul in his epistles helps us understand in details the mystery of the gospel, the power of God unto salvation (new birth). Jesus only here in <b>John 3 </b>and 4 introduces us to the nature of new birth in speaking with both Nicodemus and the woman at the well. With Nicodemus we see what must happen nd how. With the woman at the well we see it demonstrated. Most Christians know that something happened in their lives but many have little understanding of this mystery. I have often heard it quoted that “<em>salvation is as easy as A.B.C (Admit, Believe, Confess)" </em>in relations to a man making decision to follow Christ. This statement has no merit if its not made effective by an outward power none of us possesses. <strong>Salvation is impossible (not able to occur) with man, Luke 18:27</strong>.<!--more-->

To deal with this important subject, in the next few series I hope to briefly address four questions we must ask ourselves in addressing the mystery of the new birth. These are WHAT, WHY, HOW, WHO. They will not be exhaustive but rich enough to strength our faith.

Anytime you are talking of the new birth, the starting point is very important because everything is to be aligned in the light of that starting point (foundation). The gospel that starts with man will definitely tailor its continuity through the lens of man, meanwhile the gospel that starts with God will center its message through the eyes of God.

Now to set the ball rolling, I want to address these WHAT, WHY, HOW, WHO in chronological order with just a little turn of letting “WHO” do quick a cameo appearance and later get introduced as the main character of the mystery of the new birth.

The bible says, "<strong>Salvation belongs to the Lord", Jonah 2:9, Psalm 3:8, Revelation 7:10,</strong> that is the “WHO” that does the new birth. It’s not a prayer, repentance, confession etc. These are not the things that saves, they are some means to lead to the Savior. If we get this wrong, we have no hope. That is the heartbeat of the gospel, the power of God unto salvation. This helps us now study WHAT, WHY, HOW in the light of WHO.

"<strong>There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night ...", John 3:1. </strong>The Lord Jesus Christ is talking to Nicodemus, a prominent Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin (the ruling body of the Jews). As we know he was a ruler of the Jews, a teacher of the law, He came to Jesus secretly by night to talk to Him. He realized that Jesus was radically different from what he had seen. He came secretly by night perhaps not be judged, demoted or something else. His opening address to Jesus lets us know what he thought or knew. He says <strong>vs. “2 Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.</strong>” Two things jump out of this verse. First Nicodemus did not know Him as Jesus the Messiah, the Savior of the world, he only knew Jesus as a Rabbi (teacher). This is similar to the rich young ruler in <strong>Luke 18</strong>, he only addressed Jesus as "good teacher (Rabbi)". Secondly, Nicodemus only knew that He had come from God and was not God as we later read in many passages that attacked the deity of Christ. If Nicodemus was a teacher of the law, he would have taught many Jews of the coming Messiah, Jesus did not fit that profile.

The doctrine of Christ is important, the “WHO” we are addressing in this part. If Nicodemus a teacher of the law got it wrong, how many have the wrong understanding of who Jesus is. The “WHO” must be made clear as John writes <strong> "Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son”, 2John 1:9. </strong>This is important because as we will continue to tackle <strong>John 3</strong>, we come to learn that understanding is revelation and revelation leads to salvation. Salvation is nothing but “WHO”, <strong>1John 5:12, “He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life”. </strong>Keep this in mind at all times. To continue, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 3:1-18, vs. "3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_0265.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5758" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_0265.jpg?w=300" alt="IMG_0265" width="242" height="145" /></a></strong>

As we saw in part 1, Nicodemus came to Jesus by night and how he addressed Jesus gives us a clear picture he had very little understanding of who Jesus was. Our conclusion from the message was, understanding the doctrine of Christ is crucial in the new birth. The WHO is the most important in the new birth.

Watch what Jesus does with His potential convert, He cuts to the chase and addresses WHAT. <strong>"Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God", John 3:3.</strong> The weightier word the Lord uses here is "being born again". <!--more-->

The word "born" is to say the beginning or coming into existence of something. A baby being born does not effect the process, he or she responds to the process. We are born once into the world, we are then born again into the kingdom. WHY? Because we are dead in our trespasses according to <strong>Ephesians 2:1.</strong> By biblical definition, we are spiritually dead, morally bankrupt unable to do anything to become alive. This does not mean we cannot do some good things, it just means we cannot do anything good to bring us life. We like Lazarus are 4 days dead stinking with no hope in ourselves or anyone unless someone who has the capability of giving life effects it in us and we respond. In short Jesus is saying you must have new life to see and enter the kingdom of God, something foreign to Nicodemus a teacher of the law.

With this metaphor, Nicodemus is left to ponder of how possible that can be when it sounds easy and complex at the same time. "Be born again", sounds easy, not many steps. The complex part is what it means and takes for it to be. "<strong>Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”, John 3:4</strong>. By Nicodemus' response, a teacher of the law, Paul was right in penning these words, "<strong>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.", 1Corinthians 2:14.</strong> What Jesus said made no sense to Nicodemus the same with those who are dead in sin.

"<b>J</b><strong>esus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. “Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again", John 3:5-7</strong>. The phrase "born again" literally means "born from above." Two things involved in being born again, "<strong>born of water"</strong> and "<strong>the Spirit". </strong>Having studied this verse closely, I am convinced “born of water” has absolutely no reference to water baptism but cleansing, (regeneration).

When Jesus was speaking to Nicodemus of being born of water, water baptism was new and had two different meanings. He would have understood only one, pre resurrection. John’s baptism was in response to repentance, outward sign that they were clean and believed on Him who was to come. Baptism after resurrection was a public declaration to those who had been regenerated,  that they had died and resurrected with Christ. <strong>, “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance...", Matthew 3:11</strong>. As this was pre resurrection of Christ, Nicodemus would have understood the words of Christ to mean cleansing (regeneration), not starting with John but going back to the Old Testament. A better place to bring this to light is <strong>Ezekiel 36:25-27, “25 Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them</strong>”. I see Paul echoing to Titus <b>Ezekiel 36, </b>he writes <strong>, “not by works of righteousness which we have done, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">but according to His mercy He saved u</span>s, through the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">washing of regeneration</span> and r<span style="text-decoration:underline;">enewing of the Holy Spirit</span>", Titus 3:5</strong>, also as seen in <strong>Leviticus 15:13</strong>.

To make it simple, He has to cleanse before He can dwell. Born of water and Spirit involves cleansing of the old and a creation of the new. <strong>Romans 6:6</strong>. To continue, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 3:8, “The wind blows where it wishes, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and you hear the sound of it</span>, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">So is everyone who is born of the Spirit</span>.”</strong>
<p style="font-weight:300;"><strong style="font-weight:500;"><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog24.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5767" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog24.jpg" alt="blog2" width="253" height="199" /></a></strong></p>
In this part, we come to address the evidence of the new birth. True salvation (the only salvation) must make an effect on someone and there will be evidence, big or small. No one hit by truck for example can remain the same, something will definitely change due to the nature of contact/impact. When we get saved we know something has happened, there is a change but we may not understand how, we see the evidence. In vs. 8 Jesus uses another example to make His point, He says,“<b>The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”, John 3:8</b>.<!--more-->

First of all, Christ and Paul declares that the gospel is the power of God (Dunamis). Dunamis (power) is the Greek term from which our word dynamite is derived. The gospel carries with it the omnipotence of God, whose power alone is sufficient to save men from sin and give them eternal life. There is the cause and effect, God causes it, we hear the sound (Faith comes by hearing...), we see or sense the effects.

Second, the teaching of the new birth is unsettling because it refers to something that is done to us, not something we do. Justification is what God does for us. <b>John 1:13</b> emphasizes this, it refers to the children of God as those “<b>who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.”</b>

Therefore when Jesus says to Nicodemus<b> “…So is everyone who is born of the Spirit “</b>, in summary He is saying, salvation is about God, by God, for God. <b>Titus 2:11, “For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men”; Jude 1:1, “...To those who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ”</b>. God causes the new birth; we don’t. Peter stresses the same message, "<b>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he has caused us to be born again</span>”, 1Peter 1:3.</b>

I stress this point, we do not cause the new birth, God causes the new birth. Any spiritual good thing that we do is a result of the new birth, not a cause. <b>Ephesians 2:4–5, “4 But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5 even when we were dead in trespasses, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">made us alive</span> together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)”; 1John 5:11–12,  “This is the testimony, that God <span style="text-decoration:underline;">gave us eternal life</span>, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.”</b> “<i><em>Therefore, when Jesus says, It is the Spirit who gives life” John 6:63, and, You must be born of the Spirit” (John 3:5, 8), and, “Believing you may have life”, John 20:31, He means: In the new birth, the Holy Spirit supernaturally gives us new spiritual life by connecting us with Jesus Christ through faith. For Jesus is life”, </em></i>John Pipper.

It is morally impossible for the dead, dark, hard, resistant heart to celebrate the Lordship of Jesus over his life without being born again. That is why we in the new birth need creation of life in union with Christ. The work of the Spirit in regeneration is to impart new life to us by uniting us to Christ. The way John Calvin says it: “<i><em>The Holy Spirit is the bond by which Christ effectually unites us to himself"</em></i>

Those who believe that people can be saved and not be changed get it wrong because Jesus tells otherwise. There will be change and that change will be evidence that the Spirit is at work. He called Lazarus from the grave, how He did it we cannot explain but we read the effects because he came back to life. Lazarus could not hear any other voice and respond, but when Christ called him, that voice cut through the icy cold grave right to the lifeless decomposing body and caused Lazarus to hear His voice. The evidence, Lazarus responded and came back to life.

"<em>The Spirit of God is a free agent in regeneration; he works how, and where, and when he pleases; he acts freely in the first operation of his grace on the heart, and in all after influences of it; as well as in the donation of his gifts to men, for different purposes",</em> John Gill commentary.

Unless the Spirit of God moves there will be no life, lost people will be stillborn. To continue. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><strong>John 3:9-12, "9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, “How can these things be?” </strong><strong>10 Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things? 11 Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness. 12 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?"</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog25.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5770" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog25.jpg" alt="blog2" width="231" height="185" /></a></strong>

The key word in addressing these 4 verses is the word "<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>understanding"</strong></span>. This is HOW we receive the new birth. Up to this point, everything Jesus had talked to Nicodemus about made no sense, his question, <strong>vs. 9-10, "9..."HOW can these things be? </strong><strong>10 Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">do not know these things?</span>"</strong>

</div>
<!--more-->
<div>

Paul already told us that <strong>“… the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">nor can he know them</span>, because they are spiritually discerned”, 1Corinthians 2:14. </strong>Though Nicodemus was a teacher, he was in the natural, for that reason, the spiritual things made no sense. If he could not know Christ while a teacher, how is it that we hear today people claim that there are people getting saved without hearing or believing in Christ? That is impossible because there is a key, and that key is “<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>understanding</b></span>”, that understanding comes as the gospel is preached and God opens hearts to receive the message. <strong>Romans 10:14-15, “14 How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent?” </strong>

Understanding is not man generated, it is God generated. <strong>Luke 24:45, “Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures” (NIV). </strong>If it’s understanding we need, the question is not “WHAT” brings us this understanding but “WHO”, <strong>1John 5:20, “And we know that the Son of God has come and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">has given us an understanding</span>, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life”. </strong>He who has the Son has eternal life.

Jesus told the Samaritan woman in <strong>John 4</strong> that they worshiped what they didn’t know. A chapter earlier, He is confronting Nicodemus with the same<strong>, vs. “11 Most assuredly, I say to you, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">We speak what We know</span> and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness. 12 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?” </strong>Similar experience with Philip led by God to meet an Ethiopian Eunuch<strong>, Acts 8:30, “So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do you understand what you are reading?” </span></strong>The reason understanding is the key is because understanding is <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">REVELATION</span></b>. Salvation is revelation only God gives to those whom He has opened their hearts. It is revelation that comes about when God takes His spoken Word and makes it alive in a person He is saving so that they understand who they are as sinners and what He has done for them in Christ and they respond in repentance and faith<strong>, “…faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”, Romans 10:17</strong>. This does not happen apart from the preaching of the law and the gospel.

In <strong>Acts 8 </strong>as mentioned, God sent Phillip the evangelist to meet an Ethiopian Eunuch he found reading the word, and Philip asked him vs.<strong> “30…Do you understand what you are reading?”31 And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him”.</strong> This man was reading with no understanding until God sent Phillip, <strong>vs. 35 “Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him</strong>”. Only God could give understanding of the scripture through Phillip to this man because God opened His heart.

When Jesus talked of the parable of the sower, He tells us of the results of those who hear and don’t understand, their soil is not ready for the gospel,<strong> Matthew 13:19 </strong>“<strong>When anyone hears the word  of the kingdom, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not understand</span>  it, then the wicked  one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart”. </strong>This is he who received the seed by the wayside.  The good soil has one key ingredient, “<strong>understanding</strong>“. <strong>Matthew 13:23, “The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">understand</span> God’s word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!”. </strong>Wayside and good soil candidates both heard, only the good soil candidate understood and retained.

We therefore must present the gospel clearly to eagerly waiting hearts that they too may truly hear and understand God’s word and be converted. For true conversion to take place, the Holy Spirit must Convince, Convict, Convert and Contain, which is the true gospel. To continue, blessings Ev

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog27.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5800" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog27.jpg" alt="blog2" width="188" height="188" /></a>In the beginning of this chapter we saw how Nicodemus recognized Jesus a teacher from God based on the signs that He performed and His teaching, and concluded that it was not possible for someone to do such unless God is with him. He had no understanding that Jesus was more than a teacher, a miracle worker and one with and from God. Jesus was and is God, the Savior of the world. Jesus then begins to talk to him about the things of the kingdom which made no sense to him.<!--more-->

As He continues to speak with him, He helps us all understand what the gospel (good news) entails and He declares it in the next few verses. We must define the gospel for us to understand well the next few verses. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What is the Gospel of our New Birth?</span></strong>  <strong>The gospel is an announcement of good news of what <span style="text-decoration:underline;">God</span> has done in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Christ</span> on the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cross</span> by <span style="text-decoration:underline;">grace</span> to give eternal hope to those who have faith in Him. </strong>Lets see in the next few verses how He lays it out.<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blog27.jpg">
</a>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Gospel must be God centered (His kingdom)</span></strong>. In Vs. 11 To Nicodemus “<strong>11 Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen…”</strong> This refers to Christ Himself and those to whom He has revealed Himself to. Jesus establishes His deity and teaching by declaring that <strong>“13 No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven</strong>”. This is not to suggest that no one had gone to heaven when we know Enoch and Elijah from OT were taken to heaven, but rather to make it clear that no one had ascended and brought back the message of the kingdom. He is from above and in Him is life, therefore He has not sent it, He has come for He is the message. This is why He is not sending the way, the truth and the life, no, “<strong>He is the way, the truth and the life…”</strong>, <strong>John 14:6. </strong>Many of our churches today do not preach Christ and His message as He ought to be preached. Most of the messages are man (earthly) centered, appealing to man rather than Christ and have no power. The gospel that saves must be God centered.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">This gospel must be cross centered</span></strong><strong>. Vs. “14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,” </strong>The people in Moses' day were rebellious, they spoke against God and Moses (<strong>Numbers 21</strong>), for that reason God sent fiery serpents that bit many Israelites and they died. <strong>Numbers 21:8, “Then the Lord said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” </strong>God who had plagued provided a remedy<strong>, </strong>a bronze serpent lifted up by Moses on a pole that whoever looked upon it was healed and lived<strong>. </strong>

Jesus comes later in the NT and refers back to the serpent Moses made and raised up on a pole. The Israelites needed the serpent of bronze on a pole to live, we needed Jesus being lifted up on the cross to die for our salvation. But how can a serpent have similarity to Jesus? “<em>The serpent signified Christ, who was in the likeness of sinful flesh, though without sin, as this brazen serpent had the outward shape, but not the inward poison, of the other serpents: the pole resembled the cross upon which Christ was lifted up for our salvation: and looking up to it designed our believing in Christ”,</em><em> </em>John Wesley. They could not look to Moses for healing, neither can anyone look to another man for their salvation or deliverance. Jesus lifted up on the cross is the hope for everyone. <strong>“</strong><strong>For He made Him who knew no sin <em>to be</em> sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him”, 2Corinthians 5:21;</strong> “<strong>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God, “1Corinthians 1:18</strong>. The gospel that saves must be cross centered. To Continue, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/john-3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5823" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/john-3.jpg" alt="John 3" width="183" height="275" /></a></strong>

This verse by far is the most quoted in my judgment. It is one if not the most important verses in the entire bible. I also believe is one those verses abused if not looked at in its context to make it amazing. Grace is not amazing until you bring to light what enables grace to shine.

Had Jesus given Nicodemus <strong>John 3:16</strong> before addressing <strong>John 3:14-15</strong>, it would have made no sense to him or appreciated it. The same way if a doctor gave a patient medicine to cure him without first letting him understand his need for it, the patient will despise it and will not consider it precious. Jesus took Nicodemus back to <strong>Numbers 21</strong> where the Israelites spoke against God and Moses; they murmured and complained for not having water or food. <!--more-->God had blessed them but they were never grateful. They called the bread God had provided worthless. It is at this point <strong>“... the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died”, Numbers 21:6</strong>. This was judgment to a disobedient people that led to death.  “<strong>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord that He take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.”, Numbers 21:7. </strong>They did not justify their sins, or even believed they were being punished unjustly. They saw that they deserved judgment and no one to blame but themselves. In the midst of condemnation they were also reminded of the mercies of God.

When they understood what they deserved, they did not plead with God on the basis of their goodness but God's. God in His goodness did something for them without compromising His justice, He provided a way for them to live, “<strong>8 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” 9 So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived”, Numbers 21:8-9</strong>. Jesus later tells Nicodemus <strong>“</strong><strong>14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in Him should not perish but</strong><strong> have eternal life.", John 3:14-15</strong>.

<strong>John 3:16</strong> has very little meaning to sinners unless you address with them <strong>John 3:14-15 </strong>which would point them to <b>Numbers 21.</b> Without these two verses, men would have an idea that they are loveable. Men would think God saw something in them the reason He loved them and sent His Son into the world. The cross (Jesus being lifted up) is where the love of God is demonstrated. Paul helps us understand <strong>John 3:16</strong> by writing <strong>Romans 5:8</strong>, <strong>"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us”</strong>. <strong>Romans 5:8</strong> is a clearer way to see what God's love does. God acts righteously, Jesus is the act of love God demonstrated.

The gospel that brings about the new birth must be <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Grace centered</span></strong>, why? Because <strong>Grace is love in action</strong>. Our message to the world must be that they have sinned against God and are under God’s wrath/judgment as demonstrated to Nicodemus in <strong>Numbers 21</strong>. He is angry with them and the only way they can escape the fiery judgment is to look upon Jesus, believe and live, that is love. <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9, “8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast”</strong>

God is love, it is the product of God that is given by God because of who He is and not because of who we are. <em>“Love is the mutual and binding grace between God and man; it may also be said that in Christ is made God human and man divine</em>.”, McGarvey and Pendleton

The gospel that brings the new birth does not show us how special we are, we are under God's wrath. It does not show us how much God needs us or wants us.  It is not man centered. It does not begin with God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life. "T<em>he sober, biblical truth that needs to be presented to the sinner's mind is "You have made yourself an enemy of God, and in your present state of rebellion there is absolutely no hope for you." In fact, God's "plan" for the sinner at this point in his life is to separate him from His presence forever, in hell",</em> Keith Green<em>.</em> The gospel must show us how much we need God by first convincing us of how dead we are with  no ability of saving ourselves, that is when <strong>John 3:16 (Gospel, God’s pill)</strong> brings us life. <em>"…, it is an impossibility that you bring glory to God, His Christ, and His cross, because the cross of Jesus Christ and the glory thereof is most magnified when it's placed in front of the backdrop of our depravity</em>!", Paul Washer.  The dying words of one ancient saint were,<em> "Grace is the only thing that can make us like God. I might be dragged through heaven, earth, and hell and I would still be the same sinful, polluted wretch unless God Himself should cleanse me by His grace."</em>

Men will never learn the true meaning of grace and desire it unless they are confronted with what they deserve, the wrath of God, <strong>Numbers 21</strong>. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 3:17, "For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved."</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/images.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5835" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/images.jpg" alt="images" width="218" height="232" /></a> </strong>

The first mission of the coming of the Lord was not to condemn, He came as the Savior. Not the Savior of good people but bad people. He is coming the second time as a judge.

I have heard it said by some that we should not listen to what men like Apostle Paul wrote because they condemned, that we only should listen to the red letters of Christ. Those who make such arguments lack understanding that "<strong>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness”</strong>, <strong>2Timothy 3:16</strong>. What Jesus did not say in person, He said it through other men like the Apostle Paul.<!--more-->

Let’s see how Christ in person and Christ through Apostle Paul help us understand this vs. First, vs. <strong>“17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world...”</strong> He didn’t have to condemn, the world was condemned already (vs.18). In His preaching He would demonstrate that we are all under sin in need of a Savior. All He had to do was to pull the curtain of His holiness and let His glorious righteous light shine through our hearts to show how sinful and dead we are. Think of this analogy, imagine a lady is cleaning her table in the morning, she then looks at how nice and clean the table looks. Not long after, she opens the curtains of the window to let in the morning sunlight. To her horror she sees dust on the table she just cleaned. Did the light create dust? Absolutely not, it merely exposed what she could not see without the aid of the light. This is what Jesus began to do especially with the preaching of the Sermon on the Mount. He drew back the curtain that the light of His righteousness would shine through the hearts of men as He expounded on the law. He did not revise the laws; He explained and expounded on them <strong>"you have heard it said, but I say...", Matthew 5-7.</strong>

The Jews thought they had kept the laws (their tables were clean) until the Lord drew the curtains to show them it was more than actions but heart condition. Listen to what He says, <strong>"“Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill”, Matthew 5:17. </strong>Only Christ could fulfil the law<strong>. </strong>

A rich young ruler came to Jesus to ask how he could attain eternal life, <strong>Matthew 19:16-22. </strong>He called him (Jesus) good teacher just as Nicodemus did to which Jesus corrected his understanding of who was considered good, …,<strong> “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God…”, Matthew 19:17. </strong>Then Jesus told him<strong>, “…if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” </strong>to which he responded<strong> "18 ..."Which ones?”. </strong>He thought you had to pick and chose some and leave the rest. The Lord gave him five horizontal commandments, he declared to have kept by his understanding and not as the Lord outlined in the Sermon on the Mount<strong>. Vs. “20 The young man said to Him, “All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?” 21 Jesus said to him, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If you want to be perfect,</span> go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me” 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.”, </strong><strong>Matthew 19:20-22. </strong>He was given a rude awakening that to get to heaven, he needed moral perfection he lacked, he loved his money more than God. And James puts the final nail on the coffin when he says, <strong>“</strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong>For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one <em>point,</em> he is guilty of all”, James 2:10. </strong>In other words, one bad egg is enough to ruin 9 good eggs.

The purpose of the law was not to make man righteous but to reveal the condition of the heart. Paul in <strong>Romans 7:9-13</strong> says, <strong>“9 I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. 10 And the commandment, which was to bring life, I found to bring death. 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me</strong>”, …<strong>13 Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.” </strong>What he hoped to save him only condemned him because it called for moral perfection.

Despite the condemnation, God sent a perfect substitute, “…<strong>but that the world through Him might be saved”. </strong>The purpose of the law was to show us we are condemned already in need of a perfect sacrifice<strong>, “ Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith”, Galatians 3:24. </strong> We were held captive by the law until a deliverer came to our rescue.

There is nothing wrong with law, it is good and serves its purpose, however it has no ability to justify (save), <strong>“For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh”,  Romans 8:3.</strong>

<strong> </strong><em>“A sinner must see how the Law of God totally condemns him as a sinner, and then the beauty of the Gospel, the glory of the cross, the marvelous power of Christ's blood will be able to penetrate his anxious, waiting mind and heart. Only by the preaching of the Law can a man fully desire to be saved from his sin”,</em> Keith Green. The law giver was the law keeper that He might justify the law breakers (condemned).

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 3:18, "He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5851" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-3.jpg" alt="John 3" width="236" height="253" /></a></strong>

The greatest sin is unbelief. This is the sin that finally condemns. Anyone who dies in unbelief, their fate is sealed. The downfall of the Israelites was not because they were not religious enough; it is because they counted on their own righteousness. They lacked the true knowledge that would lead them to Christ for their justification by faith to secure righteousness. They had fallen from grace (<b>Galatians 5:4</b>).

I see a direct correlation between <strong>John 3</strong> and <strong>Romans 10</strong>. Here is Paul's analysis and cry to God for men like Nicodemus and his people, <strong>"1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved. 2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 3 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God</span>. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes",</strong> <strong>Romans 10:1-4</strong>. Unbelief was their downfall; their only hope was the righteousness of Christ to be received by faith.<!--more-->

A chapter ealier in <b>Romans 9, </b>Paul addresses their unbelief as he discusses how the Gentiles were made righteous while the Israelites were left behind. The Gentiles pursued (responded) to righteousness by faith, <strong>"the people of Israel, who tried so hard to get right with God by keeping the law, never succeeded. Why not? Because they were trying to get right with God by keeping the law instead of by trusting in him. They stumbled over the great rock in their path”, Romans 9:30-32 (NLT)</strong>. Their unbelief became a stumbling block that brought about even greater condemnation.

The issue here is not of happiness or trying to keep the law, the issue is of righteousness and how to attain it. Jesus says to Nicodemus, <strong>John 3:18, "He who believes in Him is not condemned...</strong>”  To believe in Him is more than head knowledge, it’s to put off the old man with its deeds and put on the new man. It’s to declare bankrupt and embrace Him who is able to make you righteous. <strong>2Corinthians 5:21, “For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him”. </strong>That is to say that God treated Jesus as though He lived our lives and treated us as though we lived His life. This is called “imputed” righteousness. To impute something is to ascribe or attribute something to someone. Through faith in Christ that comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God, the righteousness of God is given to us. When we place our faith in Christ, God ascribes the perfect righteousness of Christ to our account so that we become perfect in His sight. That is the new birth<strong>, “Therefore<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, if anyone is in Christ</span>, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new”, 2Corinthians 5:17.</strong>

What Paul counted on at some point to save him, it condemned him as he found out. Jesus said “…<strong> he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God”, John 3:18. </strong>Paul penned these words<strong> “</strong><strong>7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">9 and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith</span>;”</strong> <strong>Philippians 3:</strong><strong>7-9.</strong>

Faith in Christ is essential to salvation, it is what justifies believers. Salvation is received by grace through faith<strong> (Ephesians 2:8-9). </strong><strong>Romans 3:24-26, “24 being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">through faith</span>, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, 26 to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be JUST and the JUSTIFIER of the one who <span style="text-decoration:underline;">has faith in Jesus</span>.”</strong>

He who is righteous by faith shall live<strong>, Romans 1:17 </strong>for <strong>“In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise”,  Ephesians 1:13. </strong>

In summary, those in Christ can confidently stand on these words<strong>, “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,...”, Romans 8:1.  </strong>Those who are not in Christ Paul has something to say to you,<strong> “… the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness”, Romans 1:18. </strong>To continue<strong>, </strong>Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 3:19-20, “19 And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed”</strong>

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-31.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-5856 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-31.jpg" alt="John 3" width="188" height="188" /></a>As we have already tackled that Jesus did not come to condemn the world, but as the Light He revealed His righteousness to show that the world (men) are already condemned without believing in Him.  In these two verses above, He states clearly why men will not believe (come to the light); they love darkness (sin).

At this point would we conclude that there are wonderful people in the world if the gospel was shared with them would gladly receive it because they love the truth (light)?<!--more--> There have been debates that those in the most primitive places trying to live a godly life would be more open to receive the gospel. This has been proven not to be the case and Jesus tells us why, “...<strong> men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil”.  </strong>The Jews rejected the Messiah they were waiting for; they loved their self- righteousness than they did God<strong>, </strong>the sin of unbelief<strong>. </strong>

The apostle Paul passed by Athens where he found some very religious people,<strong> Acts 17:22-23, </strong>he says<strong>, “22…Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; 23 for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you</span></strong>:” Paul tried to introduce them to the One they worshiped without knowing. He preached Jesus that they would understand the true God, true worship, repentance, life in Christ, resurrection etc., <strong>vs 32</strong> says <strong>“And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked…” </strong>it’s interesting that out of those who were religious, only a number received the message of the gospel.

Why is it therefore hard for men to come to the light? Because sinners love their sin and they do not want anything exposing the sin in their hearts. That is the case Paul makes in <strong>Romans 1:18-3:20 </strong>why the wrath (anger) of God is revealed because men love darkness<strong>. </strong>Men suppress the truth in unrighteousness (wickedness). This brings to reality that “<i>we are not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we are sinners</i>”. That is our nature, it started with Adam (original sin) and it has impacted us all and our only hope is the last Adam.

<strong>Vs. "20 For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed”. </strong>Because by nature men hate God, their hearts are hardened hating everything it should desire.  <strong>Ephesians 2:1-3</strong> in addressing those who in the past used to hate the light says, “1 <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Once you were dead because of your disobedience and your many sins</span></strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>2 You used to live in sin, just like the rest of the world, obeying the devil—the commander of the powers in the unseen world. He is the spirit at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God.</strong> <strong>3 All of us used to live that way, following the passionate desires and inclinations of our sinful nature. By our very nature we were subject to God’s anger, just like everyone else.</strong>”(NLT).

This is to say that those who love darkness are dead, their hard hearts are dead and cannot respond to the light because by nature it hates it and cannot be drawn to it. Not even amounts of trials can make it look like men are making progress. Paul already disqualifies that notion, <strong>Romans 3:</strong><strong>9-18, “9…For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, 10 as it is written: “None is righteous, no, not one; 11 no one understands; no one seeks for God. 12 All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.” 13 “Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive.” “The venom of asps is under their lips.” 14 “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.” 15 “Their feet are swift to shed blood; 16 in their paths are ruin and misery,17 and the way of peace they have not known.”18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes</strong>.” (ESV)

Man can try to cage evil however he cannot eradicate it. We can put men in prison, but that does not change their hearts. They may just be evil men caged but not changed. The hard sin loving heart can only be surgically removed and replaced with a new heart that brings new birth. This is God’s job, He says, <strong>“26 And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules”, Ezekiel 36:26-27. </strong>New heart will have new desires; it will love the light and hate darkness. It will love what it once hated and hate what it once loved. This is a supernatural work, this is an inside job. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 3:21, “But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">that they have been done in God</span>”</strong>

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5862" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-32.jpg" alt="John 3" width="188" height="236" />

At the beginning of the series we asked ourselves four important questions in relation to the new birth, WHAT, WHY, HOW, WHO. In addressing each of these questions, the common thread centered on the question WHO. WHO is the cause of WHAT, WHY and HOW. We started with "WHO" because He is the most important in every verse covered. We said <strong>“Salvation belongs to the Lord”, Jonah 2:9, Psalm 3:8, Revelation 7:10 </strong>and the climax of verse 21 points us back to WHO.

As Jesus and Paul both declared that no one is good, no one does good, no one comes to the light, this verse <strong>John 3:21, “But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen…” </strong>This helps us see that we come to the light because we have been drawn by someone outside of us.<strong> John 6:44, “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day” </strong>Men cannot come to the light unless they are drawn by the truth of the word, the Father draws by His word. This truth helps sinners see how lost, dead, miserable they are and awakens them to the need of a Savior as we have already seen. <!--more-->

We then do truth because we have been made alive, “<strong>And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins”, Ephesians 2:1. </strong> “…<strong>that his deeds may be clearly seen, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">that they have been done in  God.</span></strong>” In what way but by understanding <strong>Ephesians 2:4, “But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">made us alive </span>together with Christ by grace you have been saved”.</strong><strong style="line-height:1.5;"> </strong>

How do we fulfil good works if we are made alive, <strong>Romans 8:3-4, “3 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, 4 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled IN us</span> who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.”</strong>

This is faith at work or faith that works. The evidence of the new birth is good works. The good works are a result of an inside job (the new heart). <strong>Philippians 2:12-13, “12 …, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">work out</span> your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">for it is God</span> who works <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in you</span> both to will and to do for His good pleasure</strong>.”, we workout (bring out) what God is doing within. <strong>“For we are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">His workmanship</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">created in Christ Jesus for good works</span>, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them”; Ephesians 2:10. “I have been crucified with Christ<span style="text-decoration:underline;">; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me</span>; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith <span style="text-decoration:underline;">IN the Son of God</span>, who loved me and gave Himself for me”, Galatians 2:20. </strong>That which is not of faith is sin.

Without the New birth through the giver of new birth, men remain dead in their trespasses, "<b>And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.", 1John 5:11 (ESV)</b>, there can be no life or hope to see and enter the kingdom of God<strong>.  “Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous. Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord</span>”, Romans 5:19-21</strong>.

This bad news for unrighteous (the wrath of God) highlights the good news of the gospel that in spite of how far man has gone, if he is awakened to his sin and his danger and is convinced of his need for a Savior, he will repent and trust Christ alone for his salvation. God will grant him His righteousness he desperately needs and his good works will be a result of God’s work in him and not his because “… <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">they have been done IN God</span>”, John 3:21, </strong>Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 119:18, “Open my eyes so that I may see wonderful things in Your law”</strong>

<strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5879" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-33.jpg" alt="John 3" width="183" height="275" /> </strong>

Isn’t it amazing at a crime scene, the crime scene investigators are able to spot things that the untrained eye would not see. These men and women are trained to look for things that others would not even consider for a moment. It is amazing that two people can look at the exact same thing and see different things.

What do you read in the following example: “<strong>GODISNOWHERE</strong>”? Did you see “God is no where?” Many people initially see this. However, can you see that it also reads “God is now here?” Perhaps you just said yourself, “WOW,” I didn’t see both statements. In the same light there can be two people that look into God’s Law, into God’s Word, and not see the same thing. The Psalmist prefaces his statement “<strong>open my eyes…,”</strong> with “<strong>Deal generously with Your servant, so that I might live; then I will keep Your word.</strong>” <!--more-->He desired that God deal liberally, open-handed, with great kindness, so that he might live, because if God is not dealing kindly with him how can he live? As God is dealing kindly and generously with him he will keep God’s Word. He calls himself God’s servant, and a servant does what the Master says. Three times, The Lord called out to Samuel and initially Samuel didn’t realize the voice of the Lord, but when it was told to him by Eli that the voice was God’s voice, he was to respond accordingly to God. Therefore the very next time this took place the Bible says, <strong>“</strong><strong><sup></sup></strong><strong>Now the Lord came and stood and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel answered, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Speak, for Your servant hears",</span></strong> (<strong>1Samuel 3</strong>).”

The Psalmist in this same humble attitude desired his eyes to be open, so that he might see the wonderful things in God’s law! Everything in God’s law in God’s Word is wonderful. Just think of the word “<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">wonderful</span></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">”<strong> which means “full-of-wonder</strong></span>.” <strong>Proverbs 30:18–19</strong> tells us, <strong>“18 There are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">three things which are too wonderful for me</span>, Yes, four which I do not understand: 19The way of an eagle in the air, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the midst of the sea, And the way of a man with a virgin</strong>”. Do you comprehend these things, I think not. One cannot put the love for his or her spouse under a microscope and understand in fullness the complexities of that relationship. God’s Word is certainly full of wonder, but when one is a servant of the Master, then the Master can point out and illuminate His Word to His servant. Why is this? Because the servant (insert your name) can say, “<strong>Speak Lord, for your servant is listening…open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in Your law</strong>.”

The spiritual senses are engaged when receiving what God desires you to hear, to see, to know, to learn, and to do in accordance and obedience to His Word. It is one thing to hear a preacher, to read a Christian book, hear a sermon, read a devotional or article based on God’s Word, but it is an entirely more intimate experience when God shows YOU in His Word apart from someone else’s echoing of God’s Word. I have learned so much through mature Christian brothers and sisters in the Lord as well as through seasoned Christian leaders who chose to stay biblical no matter where the “theological wind” was blowing at the time. However, I have learned most through spending time with Jesus in prayer, in Bible reading, in journaling thoughts, in memorizing His Word, in meditating on His Word, and in sharing His Word with others. God’s Word is like an archeological dig, there is so much to “unearth” or should I say “unheaven” beneath the pages of God’s Word, or rather within the pages of His Word. Reading through the beginning of <strong>Psalm 119</strong>, the longest chapter in the Bible, which is predominantly about God’s law, God’s Word, is when God showed me these great nuggets that you are reading today. It all started with this one verse that God seemed to illuminate off the page to me, and before I knew it, this message began to brew in my spirit, and then onto the computer screen. Is God’s Word being illuminated to you? If He is your Master and you are His servant then call out to him in the same attitude of Samuel and the Psalmist, <strong>“Speak Lord, for your servant is listening…open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in Your law.”</strong>

Seek the Lord today as a servant, when you do, I’m sure you will begin to look into God’s Word and He will illuminate things to you, that were always there, but that you have never seen before. The more I grow in God’s Word, the more this takes place. If I may, I would love to suggest this wonderful resource which will help you on this journey? Find <a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=603">Herman Who? (DVD)</a> at Wretchedradio.com. Also consider journaling the things that God speaks to you and going back to read the wonderful things he has shown you. Lastly, if appropriate, share those things God opened your eyes to with others and encourage them to do as you have done. Remember God said in <strong>Isaiah 55:11, “</strong><strong>So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me </strong><strong></strong><strong>void (empty, fruitless) But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall </strong><strong></strong><strong>prosper in the thing for which I sent it.</strong>”

Until the nets are filled…Blessings Phil The Evangelist]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 10:25-37, “36 So which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?”  37 And he said, “He who showed mercy on him.” Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”</strong>

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-34.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-5882 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-34.jpg" alt="John 3" width="225" height="224" /></a>

One of the comforting words often shared when someone is facing challenges is “<strong>if you need anything, don’t hesitate to call me”. </strong>Many times I wonder the reality of these words. Are they many times said in the moments when there is nothing to say, or something easy to say but don’t mean it or has very little meaning or people don’t just think them through?  And what does “anything” really mean? <!--more-->

The parable of the Good Samaritan gives us a glimpse of who we should be to our neighbors, the word “anything” fits here well. James would call it practical faith as we will see. Now Jesus gave this parable to a self-righteous man who was prejudice to those he would call neighbors in his quest to find an answer of how to attain eternal life, <strong>Luke 10:25-29</strong>. The scribes and the Pharisees did not like the Samaritans; they considered themselves more righteous than the tax collectors, prostitutes, Gentiles, and especially the Samaritans. They believed they had what it took to belong and be blessed and those like the Samaritans were not in their league. Jesus was about to straighten him out.

In this passage Jesus addresses in a parable who is considered a neighbor. The neighbor here was not necessarily someone he knew but someone in need. It’s been said that this road from Jerusalem to Jericho was about 17 miles stretch and the road harbored thieves and danger. In the midst of the story we are told that  <strong>Vs. 30, ..." A  certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among </strong><strong>thieves, who stripped him of his clothing, wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead</strong>". In his condition and in desperate need, help did not come from those who should have offered it, a priest vs. 31 and a Levite vs. 32. The priest passed on the other side to avoid him, the Levite somehow stopped to look and then passed also on the other side as well. He was helped by a stranger, vs. <strong>“33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had COMPASSION”</strong> This is what makes us different, compassion. Jesus was full of compassion, our desire to be like Christ is to have one of His qualities, compassion. Compassion is simply sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others. We act when we are moved, however our hearts can sometimes be so hard and rigid and our prayer always need to be “<em>God take away our heart of stone and give us a heart of flesh”</em>

The man who was wounded was slighted by those who should have been his friends, and was cared for by a stranger, a Samaritan, of the nation which the Jews most despised and detested, and would have no dealings with. Vs. “<strong>34 So he went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 35 On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, ‘Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I come again, I will repay you.’”.  </strong>Note what happened when the Samaritan stopped to help 1. He was inconvenienced- he was on a journey and this means his priorities changed. 2. It cost him money – He spent his money that perhaps was set aside for business to help a stranger who was not going to pay him back leave alone even recognize who he was. 3. It cost him time – he was delayed in his journey perhaps upsetting others. 4. He put himself in harm’s way – he had exposed himself to danger by being slowed down and now helping someone else on a road that harbored bad people.

What the Samaritan showed was a mile of excellence. He would have done minimum, but he went all out. It is the duty of us all, in our places, and according to our ability, to succor, help, and relieve all that are in distress and necessity. James addresses this extensively in James chapter 2. His opening encouragement, <b>James</b><strong> 2: “1 My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with </strong><b>partiality”, for “…</b> <strong>14 What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?” </strong>James says our faith is revealed in our works. That if you have faith, you will have works to demonstrate that you have faith. But this is rare even in our churches today, we say silently “<i>depart in peace, be warmed and filled and if you need anything call me…” </i>but sometimes those are just empty words. The Samaritan did not wait to be told what to do; he saw a need and acted on it knowing, it was the right thing to do.

Are we becoming more like that priest or the Levite that we look and sound good by our titles but stink at being filled with compassion to be Christ like? Are we afraid of helping others lest we mess things up for ourselves and get sued? Are we too busy that we somehow say bear your own burdens and we will come watch you or as Paul writes to 3 churches (<strong>Galatians 6:2, Ephesians 4:2, Colossians 3:13</strong>) and his simple message in this, “<strong>bear one another’s burden</strong>”. It starts with compassion, may Christ deal with our hearts that we become what we already are in Him by faith. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 4:10, “Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-35.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5902" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-35.jpg" alt="John 3" width="225" height="225" /></a></strong>

Do you have a brother or sister? The one thing that makes a brother or sister is having the same father or mother. However, being a brother is different from being a brother’s keeper. To be a brother requires no effort because it’s based on biology, but being a keeper speaks of a choice, care, responsibility, and a measure of ownership. God placed Abel as a keeper of sheep, and Cain as a tiller (keeper) of the soil. God gave both brothers the same opportunity of on the job training. In the Garden prior to his son’s responsibilities, Adam worked the ground and dealt with the animals. Now his sons would share in that duty, outside the Garden of course because of Adam’s sin.<!--more--> Adam failed to be a keeper of Eve. When the Serpent attacked her, he stood by and did nothing. When God questioned Adam, he blamed Eve for his fall. Now one of Adam’s offspring would follow in Adam’s footsteps by failing to be a keeper and worse off, because Cain would become his brother’s killer.

I believe that Cain priorities were misaligned. Remember that God disrespected Cain’s offering, but respected Abel’s with pleasure. If there is one thing men want is respect for their work. However God wasn’t creating a “feel good” atmosphere, but demanding a do good one that results in the feel good because of obeying and pleasing God. God is to be first (first commandment), and his Kingdom sought after first (<strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>). If our priorities are misaligned with God’s will, our lives are out of order. If one was upset seeing a toilet out of order, how much more does God hate when our lives are out of order? However when our priorities are in order we will love God and our neighbor by being our brother’s keeper. Are you a brother’s keeper or a brother’s killer?

Keepers bear one another’s burdens (<strong>Galatians 6:2</strong>), killers fail to carry and pile on more burdens. Keepers pray for one another (<strong>1Thessalonians 5:24; James 5:16</strong>), killers gossip and complain about one another. Keepers challenge, encourage, and inspire, while killers criticize, discourage, and exasperates others. Keepers help, killers hinder. Keepers forgive, killers hold grudges (<strong>Colossians 3;13</strong>). Keepers follow God’s design for marriage and family; killers take their marching orders from the world for marriage and family. Keepers love while killers hate. Keepers encourage one’s ideas; killers put a wet blanket on them and spew all the reasons why the idea “can’t” work.

“<strong>By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead", (Hebrews 11:4)</strong>.” I believe his blood cries out saying be a keeper not a killer. Can you hear it, and will you respond to it and be a brother’s keeper?

Until the nets are filled…blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 4:10, “Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" He said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?" And He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground."</strong>

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-36.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5906" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john-36.jpg" alt="John 3" width="225" height="225" /></a>

The first sin committed horizontally (human to human) is the sin of murder. Cain and Abel both brought an offering to the Lord and the Lord respected Abel and his offering, but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell. Cain instantly became upset because God did not respect what h he brought him. God knowing this didn't try to boost his self-esteem, but rather asked him three questions. First God asked, "<strong>Why are you angry</strong>?" Secondly, "<strong>why has your countenance fallen?"</strong> Thirdly, <strong>"If you do well, will you not be accepted?</strong>" Now whenever God asks a question it is never because He doesn't know the answer, because God is omniscient (all knowing). <!--more-->

God is giving Cain an opportunity to come to his senses and realize that he needs to point the blame to himself and not to God who rejected his offering. And not to his brother which he would become jealous of. Just like his father Adam who blamed his wife and the serpent (the devil) for Adam's disobedience, so now does his son Cain proves the old saying true, <em>"the apple doesn't fall far from the tree." </em>God wants Cain to get a grip on things, and to overcome the sin that is knocking at the door of his heart which desires to control him, but God commands Cain that Cain must master it. Only one was going to be the leader, either Cain or the sin. So what happened? "<strong>Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him."</strong> Cain didn't master his sin, his sin mastered him, and Abel became the victim.

God comes to Cain and asks another question, <strong>"Where is Abel your brother?" He said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"</strong> Cain wasn't his brother's keeper although he should have been, but instead he was his brother's killer. We are to be keepers of one another and not killers of one another. <strong>1John 3:15</strong> reads, "<strong>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."</strong> It’s not just the act of murder, by the spirit of murder that finds its way in our lives if we’re not discerning. The law magnified shows that God sees murder even in the hating stage of our minds. A man can be sent to prison for drawing out plans to assassinate the President, even before the plans are carried out! One must also be wise in how one treats others, especially in what comes out of ones mouth. Proverbs 18:21 tells us, “The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit. James says, “All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man, but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God’s likeness.” We kill with our words, and our actions.

God said to Cain, <strong>"What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground.” </strong>Instead of being his brother’s keeper and being responsible for him, he became his brother’s killer. May each of us ask ourselves today “<em>Am I my brother’s keeper or my brother’s killer?</em>” For further reading read the story of Jonathan and David and see how Jonathan was his brother (David’s) keeper, when he could have been his killer.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Daniel 1:8, “But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.”</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> </span>

<span style="line-height:1.5;"><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog21.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5941" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog21.jpg" alt="blog2" width="259" height="194" /></a></span>

As a Christian we certainly want to live in victory, but as you have found out there are times of temptations which test your resolve in the Lord. From the moment Daniel and his friends are taken captive and exiled, they are required to immerse themselves in the language and literature of the Babylonians (1:4), with its focus on sorcery, astrology and polytheism. This was an alien atmosphere and culture to these displaced Hebrew boys.

<!--more-->Although they were in an ungodly, foreign land, this ungodly land was not in them. They were in Babylon but not of it. Daniel and his friends had their hearts resolved in Yahweh; therefore they refused to compromise with their actions. Before a public victory comes, a private victory must take place within the heart. This can clearly be seen in the life of these Hebrews as <strong>“Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat….”</strong> Daniel’s heart was set on Yahweh, his friends followed him in this desire as well, but now this desire certainly needed to be appropriated or fleshed out. Daniel didn’t just intend to keep himself pure for the Lord, he desired it.

In his book A Heart Ablaze, John Bevere points out the difference between an intention and a desire, showing they are not the same thing. <em>Many have good and godly intentions, but when it comes time to implement that intention they don’t follow through, because it may not have been their true desire</em>. He says, “Desire is the path that a person will take, no matter how good his intentions may be.” <strong>James 1:14 reads, “But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust (desire), and enticed</strong>.” This verse speaks about desire on the negative side. <strong>Psalm 37:4</strong> shows us the positive side, “<strong>Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</strong>” Both verses show the power of desire. Our intentions are what we will do when it is convenient at the time, but our desires are what will drive us even when it’s not convenient.

Daniel’s true desire was stated when the Scripture reads, “<strong>But Daniel purposed [desired] in his heart…,”</strong> because he acted upon that desire in a time that was inconvenient for him. He made the request to the prince of the Eunuchs that he and his friends to be allowed to eat vegetables and water, and not be defiled by eating the king’s meat. Well at first the Eunuch didn’t go along with it because if the king saw the Hebrews looking worse (downtrodden) than the other young men their age, then the king would have had the Eunuchs head. However Daniel in his wisdom asked if perhaps the eunuch might allow them a test for only ten days to which it was agreed upon. Daniel true desire was to please not the king of Babylon but the King of Kings, the Lord.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 10, vs. “5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname in Peter.”</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> </span>

<span style="line-height:1.5;"><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog22.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5946" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog22.jpg" alt="blog2" width="183" height="275" /></a></span>

You’ve heard it said, never send a boy to do a man’s job. Well God says never send an angel to do a disciple’s job. Cornelius was a Roman Centurion responsible for the band of 100 men under his authority. The Scripture says, <strong>“He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly (v.2).”</strong> Yet despite all of these great qualities he still needed to hear and know the way of salvation through Christ alone. So what did God do to reach this devout Roman Centurion?

An angel of God spoke to him in a vision and said, <strong>“Cornelius!” Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked. The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">memorial offering before God</span>. 5 Now send men to Joppa to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter</span></strong>. <strong>6 He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.</strong>”<!--more--> WOW, this man’s efforts toward godliness were noticed by God, and God wishing for none to perish was going to make sure this man and his family knew what the real deal with reaching God was. Despite all of his efforts none qualified this man to earn a seat in the Kingdom of Heaven, because those seats can’t be earned<strong>. “8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9 not by works, so that no one can boast.”,</strong> <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9.</strong> The gift this man needed was Christ.

My question is, why didn’t the angel of the Lord give this man the Gospel, but instead told him to send for Peter. Doesn’t that seem like a lot of unnecessary hoops to jump through when it would seem that it would have been much simpler to have the angel give Cornelius the Gospel? Who did Christ give the responsibility to bring the gospel to others to, His disciples or His angels? This account shows us the great responsibility Christ places on you and I to fulfill the Great Commission. In the movie Spider Man, Uncle Ben says, “<em>With great power comes great responsibility</em>.” If we have the Great power of the Holy Spirit in us, then we need to fulfill the great responsibility of the Great Commission”. God could have saved Cornelius apart from Peter, but Peter was the mailman that was called to do his job, that of bringing the Gospel to this Gentile man. This should send a wake up call to the Disciples of Christ to be active in going out to seek and save the lost by being witnesses unto Him and making disciples. Christ didn’t tell us to pray for the power of the Gospel to do its work, but for laborers to take the gospel to those that need it. And if they’re breathing and without Christ then they need Him! A farmer doesn’t sit inside the farm and only pray for a harvest. He goes out to sow seed so that he may reap a harvest. Peter went to sow the seed of the Gospel in Cornelius’ life and family, because the soil of Cornelius’ heart had been prepared for the Gospel.

Thank God the disciples didn’t stay in the Upper Room and just pray for the unsaved, but they obeyed the mandate to Go and seek and save the lost. Jesus last command should be our first priority. Is that true in your life? Paul reminds us, “But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.”

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Application</span></strong><strong>: Lord send, not Peter but the one who is reading this devotion to someone that is ready for the seed of the Gospel to be planted in an unsaved life. </strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> </span>

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 10:15, “ And a voice <em>spoke</em> to him again the second time, </strong><strong>“What God has </strong><strong>cleansed you must not call common”</strong>

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/day2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5949" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/day2.jpg" alt="Day2" width="188" height="188" /></a>

Many of us have been told by our parents when we were growing up, <em>“Don’t talk to strangers.”</em> The reason for that is that our parents didn’t know what certain strangers would say or do to our children. Hence it was a safety precaution for us as kids. Perhaps you are now a parent and you have passed the same caution onto your children. However, can this same wisdom be implored when it comes to obeying God to share the Gospel? It would seem that the same sentiment has crepted into the church manifesting itself as don’t talk to strangers about Christ only those you know and trust. Hence obeying our traditional rule from our parents and bringing into Christianity has manifested itself in disobeying our Heavenly Father when it comes to obeying His Gospel.<!--more-->

Perhaps Peter was taught by his parents not to talk to strangers, and as a “good Jewish person,” he obeyed that very well. However, Jesus made it very clear in numerous encounters with Peter:
<ul>
	<li>“<strong>Go </strong><strong>therefore and </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">make disciples of all the nations</span></strong><strong>, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”</strong> Amen, (<strong>Matthew 28:19-20</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>“And He said to them, “<strong>Go into all the world </strong><strong>and</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">preach the gospel to every creature</span></strong>. “, (<strong>Mark 16:15)</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Jerusalem, and in all Judea and </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Samaria, and to the </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">end of the earth</span></strong>.”, (<strong>Acts 1:8</strong>)</li>
</ul>
The Great Commission was made clear by Jesus, as to who the disciples were to go to and where, <strong>ALL the nations</strong>, <strong>EVERY creature</strong>, and <strong>to the</strong> <strong>END OF THE EARTH</strong>. Yet, Peter had a problem with taking the Gospel to “strangers”, the Gentiles. Therefore, God gave him what may seem like a bizarre vision. Peter had gone up to the roof top to pray, <strong>“10 Then he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance 11 and saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth. 12 In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. 13 And a voice came to him, “Rise, Peter; kill and eat.” 14 But Peter said, “Not so, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.” 15 And a voice spoke to him again the second time, “What God has cleansed you must not call common.” 16 This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.”</strong>

Peter was hungry, and was in prayer, but the Lord was getting at a different kind of hunger as He dealt with Peter. Didn’t Peter remember his account with Jesus and the woman of Samaria (<strong>John 4)</strong>? Peter had come back with all the other disciples from getting lunch and they came upon Jesus talking with the Samaritan women. This was a no, no in that culture for three reasons. First, Jews didn’t associate with Samaritans and actually looked down upon them. Secondly, a man would not be caught talking with women. Thirdly, a Rabbi would not be found speaking with a woman. Jesus broke three cultural norms, all at once. He tried to use this account as a teachable moment about eating and evangelism<strong>. John 4:32-35, “32 His disciples urged Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.” 32 But He said to them, “I have food to eat of which you do not know.” 33 Therefore the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?” 34 Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work. 35 Do you not say, ‘There are still four months and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest!” </strong>There was a spiritual meal Jesus emphasized, spiritual nourishment that came from doing the very will of the Father. We all know what it is like to be full from physical food and the physical hunger that precedes it, but do be spiritually filled is a different matter from physical food.

Ravi Zacharias points out this same type of amazing reality in his book titled <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Jesus among Other gods</span>. He points out<em> “When Jesus said, ‘Take and eat; this is my body…Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant’ (<strong>Matthew 26:26-28</strong>), He was not speaking in a cultural vacuum to consign His followers to cannibalism. Rather, His words were intended to life listeners from their barren, food – dominated existence to the recognition of the supreme hunger of life that could only be filled by different bread. It was in that very journey under Moses that He had first told them that physical bread had limited sustenance. He wanted to meet a greater hunger</em>.” Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 7:19, “All too well </strong><strong></strong><strong>you </strong><strong></strong><strong>reject (set aside) the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition</strong><strong>” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog23.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5955" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog23.jpg" alt="blog2" width="225" height="225" /></a></strong>

<strong>How hungry are you spiritually? Are you driven to the Lord to fill that hunger?</strong>

Now go back to that rooftop with me, where Peter is meeting with the Lord by a vision, and the Lord is again trying to teach Peter at a pivotal moment when Peter is in prayer and is hungry, about the sustenance of true hunger. There were all kinds of four-footed animals both clean and unclean animals. To keep the Israelites separate from their idolatrous neighbors, God set specific dietary restrictions regarding the consumption of such animals (cf. <strong>Leviticus 11:25, 26) (v.12).</strong> He tells him to eat what is traditionally unclean for Jewish people to eat. Yet He is touching on a much greater truth in this account, and the bigger picture is not about the food itself, but rather the nourishment that comes from feeding hungry people, which are starved of spiritual nourishment because they have not partaken of the Gospel.<!--more-->

The fully Gentile people like the half Gentile women at the well, were part of the harvest that the Lord desired. This is why Jesus said, <strong>“What God has cleansed you must not call common.</strong> John MacArthur points out, <em>“More than just abolishing the OT dietary restrictions, God made unity possible in the church of both Jews, symbolized by the clean animals, and Gentiles, symbolized by the unclean animals, through the comprehensive sacrificial death of Christ. Apart from Christ, we can do nothing (John 15), and apart from Him “<strong>We are all like an unclean thing, And all </strong></em><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>our righteousnesses are like </em></strong><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>filthy rags</em></strong><em> (<strong>Isaiah 64:6</strong>)…</em>” Was the woman at the well really any filthier than Peter when Christ found him? Are fishermen more spiritually pure than adulterous women? Were the Gentiles really any more unclean than Peter apart from the Gospel? Our spiritual cleanliness is not contingent to our outward façade, ethnicity or culture.

Our ethnicity and culture must take a back seat when it attempts to create a roadblock for the Gospel and hence obeying Christ. Jesus Christ transcends culture! This is why unlike the religion of Islam, which is a cultural religion, and other world religions, Christianity cuts across cultural boundary lines, because Christ died for the sin of the world. Jesus will not compromise on this issue and please recall the words He spoke to the Pharisees that were saturated in this thinking when “He said to them, “<strong>All too well </strong><strong></strong><strong>you </strong><strong></strong><strong>reject (set aside) the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition”,</strong> (<strong>Mark 7:19</strong>). They should have set aside their traditions to keep the Word of God so as to please God, but instead they had things done in reverse.

It is important to note where this interaction between Peter and the Lord took place. Peter was at Simon the tanner’s house, who was also a Gentile. John MacArthur states, <em>“Peter breaks down a cultural barrier by staying with a tanner, which is an occupation despised by Jewish society because tanners dealt with the skins of dead animals. The local synagogue probably shunned Simon</em>.” Yet he didn’t always seem to be able to make this transition so easily.

Christ loved His Father and wanted Peter to glorify His Father. Unlike the mindset of the Pharisees which clung to tradition, He refused to allow Peter’s Jewish ethnicity and cultural mindset to get in the way of the Gospel going forth and thus God being glorified through Peter’s life. Jesus was pushing Peter through his prejudice issue as this was a struggle in his life, because something bigger than Peter is at stake, the Gospel is at stake. Even the Apostle Paul had to put Peter in his place over virtually this same issue, withstanding Peter to his very face (<strong>Galatians 2:11</strong>)! Peter was guilty of sin by aligning himself with men he knew to be in error and because of the harm and confusion he caused his Gentile brethren. Unfortunately, Peter was affirming the very dietary restrictions he knew God had abolished (<strong>Acts 10:15</strong>) and thus striking a blow at the gospel of grace (MacArthur Study Bible).

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Focus: Matthew 27:1-26; Mark 15:1-15; Luke 23:1-25; John 18:39-19:16</strong><strong> <a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-5978" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blog.jpg?w=620" alt="blog" width="620" height="131" /></a>

</strong>

Barabbas was a Jewish national/zealot. Hebrew custom establishes the idea that Jewish parents name their children based on certain characteristics. Barabbas means “son of the fathers”; that is, “Bar” means son and “abbas” means fathers. Growing up, I bet Barabbas thought he was something special. He was the hope of Jewish history (son of the fathers). His name suggests that the Jewish nation had a lot riding on his shoulders (son of the fathers). Barabbas was the product of the long line of Jewish wise men and sages (son of the fathers). He embodied and represented them. Little is known about his parents other than that they were political figures and did not raise him themselves. It is said that Barabbas was raised by the community- being groomed for a purpose. He was not raised with a lot of discipline. <!--more-->

Historically, Barabbas came on the scene during the interim between the old and new testaments. At that time, the Jewish people were subject to Roman power. Some said that Barabbas was a ‘robin hood’ character. He was hot-headed, quick tempered, and had little difficulty using violence to accomplish his goals. To him, the end justified the means and he didn’t mind doing whatever he wanted, whenever, or by whatever means necessary. This lifestyle got Barabbas on Rome’s top ten list of most wanted men. He had led a revolt in which several Roman soldiers were killed. He had stolen from the roman and Jewish treasuries. He was known for ambushing people and taking their belongings to finance the initiatives of his motley crew. And, interestingly, we find him (the son of the fathers) in Roman custody when he is first mentioned in the gospels.

Romans kept their notorious criminals in a jail that was located in the garrison of soldiers. This jail would be equivalent of the maximum-security prisons of today. This jail was about a half mile from the governor’s palace and tribunal.

The story opens with the Roman governor judging the case of Jesus. And, the governor gives the people a choice of choosing Jesus, the Son of God, or, Barabbas, the son of the fathers. Jesus was divine, Barabbas was not. Jesus was Son to God the Father and heir to heaven, Barabbas was son of human people and heir to a collapsed history and dejected people. Jesus represented choosing the divine while Barabbas represented choosing the least admirable qualities in us all. Truly, there was no comparison and the obvious choice of the people should have been to choose Jesus. Instead, the Jewish people chose Barabbas; the lesser figure, the substitute, the crook, the man.

But, this is not where I want us to contemplate. Let’s contemplate the story as it unfolds from the viewpoint of Barabbas. He was locked up about a half mile from where Jesus was at. From where he was located, Barabbas could hear the words of the crowd as they shouted their responses in unison.

Imagine living close enough to Yankee Stadium whereby you could hear the chants of the crowd. While you don’t hear the umpires, yet you can easily hear the crowd shouting “let’s go Yankees” or “de-fense”. You can predict what are going on because you can hear the crowds’ woes, boo’s, chants, and their cheering. Now leave Yankee stadium, if you will, and go with me to the jail cell of one, Barabbas.

So, here’s Barabbas- locked up in jail. Now, remember, he could hear the crowds shouting in unison - but he couldn’t hear the governor. He hears the crowds scream:

1.Not this man, but Barabbas; 2.Crucify him, crucify him; 3. We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar; 4. Away with him, away with him, crucify him; 5.  His blood be on us, and on our children.

Can you imagine what was going on in the mind of Barabbas? He had been in custody for a long time. He had not seen the face of another common person nor had he had a visitor in years, besides a Roman soldier. By this time, he was accustom to seeing the routine faces of the roman guards. No doubt he thought that the people had betrayed him- after all, he did all of his bad deeds FOR them, right? How dare they turn on him like this? He just heard the death sentence be pronounced on him. This may sound all too familiar, but the crowd that perhaps once supported him was not turning on Barabbas, the son of the fathers, but on Jesus, the Son of God.

Now, imagine the dread and the fear that seized his soul. Imagine what the other prisoners thought or said to their “champion” as they heard the sentence. No doubt a reverent, dreadful silence fell over the place. I imagine that there was a long wait. And then, they heard the footsteps and the keys clinging in the distance- getting closer and louder. They heard the guards returning for Barabbas. For all intents and purposes, they all, including Barabbas, thought Barabbas was going to be summarily executed. But, something happens when the doors are opened to his cell, and the instruments of death tell him that he was free to go. Imagine the fear- yet excitement he felt as the chains and the instruments of his captivity and imprisonment were removed. Then, imagine the solemnity that gripped him when he was told or came to realize that Jesus took his place!

Application: Lets’s consider how many times we chose Barabbas over Jesus in our lives. Let us not forget the significance of the story. In Barabbas’s mind- he was as good as dead. He heard the death sentence. But, Christ took his place. It is entirely possible that Barabbas went on to live a holy life after that. Perhaps, he realized the true meaning of the exchange and sacrifice that Christ made on HIS behalf- and it was enough to turn him around and truly live a life that was worth his dying for.

You may be Barabbas today locked up in the jail cell of your sins. Perhaps you will have diner today, with Barabbas, one that is chained to their own sins. Will you be like the Roman guard that released Barabbas? How you ask. Simple, show a person, a family member, a loved one a friend, a neighbor, your mother, your father, your children, that they have violated God’s Holy Law, His 10 Commandments, and therefore are on death row, deserving of God’s capital punishment, eternity in hell, because they are in bondage to their sins.

This sounds harsh. Does it? Does it not sound harsher, perhaps evil, to let one you say you say you love, die in their sin. We love getting together with family, but that is not what Easter, Resurrection Day is all about. It’s always been about Jesus, his death, his burial, and most importantly HIS RESURRECTION!

Tell your loved one, AFTER YOU HAVE HELPED THEM TO SEE THEIR SIN AND THEIR BONDAGE that Jesus died in their place to set them free. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if today, there were those that repented and put their trust in Jesus Christ. What are you waiting for, you may or may not have tomorrow and the following days to live. If you have not repented, and put your trust in Christ, today is the day. If you have not been a true and faithful witness then when you sit with your family, talk in a side room, be faithful to your Lord.

When you hear give us Barabbas, think, give us, Michael, Andrea, Anthony, my dad, my mom, my children because you desire them to be released but the Son of God, Jesus Christ.

May God richly bless you as you obey,

Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil, and David

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Timothy 3:5, “having a form of godliness, but denying its power. And from such people turn away.”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/business-object.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5990" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/business-object.jpg?w=300" alt="Business object" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong>

One of the effects of false teaching is false religion, a false security based upon a merely outward religion. Paul here speaks of a people who are laden with sinful practice, yet falsely profess to be in Christ. Last week, Brother Evans shared on the toxic gospel, I see this to be one of the results of that gospel, and something that largely plagues what calls itself the church today. Let he who has an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

The form of godliness spoken of here refers to a merely ornamental religion, a dressed up outward religion that does not touch the heart. One of pomp and ceremony, tradition and idol worship, not one of love birthed in the heart. <!--more-->This religion gives no remedy for sin, only a covering of such things. The example here is the growing amount in the church, proclaiming Christ, while they drink and revel with the world. True religion is birthed in the heart, it springs forth in flames of holy love unto the Lord. This person willingly renounces the world, willingly forsakes sin and self, and pursues God with all the desire of the heart.

Next Paul speaks of denial, a word here better translated as repudiate or renounce, which both speak of a willing turning away, one who hears the truth, but chooses to continue to follow their sinful practices. They hear of the necessity of a holy life, but they ignore this cry, choosing rather to hide behind a false theology or some empty dogma. The church today revels in this, worldly pastors preaching to worldly churches, no longer do the Pentecostal fires burn within these sacred walls. We have denied the power of the blood, shed by Jesus to cleanse us of our sin, not to cover it over. Jesus Christ came to destroy the works of the devil, all glory to His name!

Lastly Paul speaks of power. The power here is the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, birthed within the heart by faith. Holiness is the proof and result of this work, not a mere outward holiness, but a purity of heart and life, characterized by a love for God above all else, and without this, I scarcely believe one can say they have Christ. There must be a change, we must be new creations, we must be born again. Not baptized, not on our church registry, born from above, born of the Spirit, now living lives wholly given to the Lord, obeying Him, loving Him incessantly. Let us consider our ways, let us turn again to the Lord, for He will abundantly pardon, He is willing that none would perish, but that all would come to everlasting life, remaining in that place by faith.

In the Savior’s love, blessings Brother Benjamen]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Galatians 5:1-4, “1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free,  and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. 2 Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. 3 And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. 4 You have become estranged from Christ, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.”</span></strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/law-and-grace.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5993" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/law-and-grace.jpg?w=300" alt="Law-and-grace" width="300" height="199" /></a></span></strong>

In my study time on <strong>Galatians 5</strong>, I paused on vs. 4 and started working my way backwards to get a grasp as to what Paul wanted us to understand. Some  have suggested that vs. 4 is one of the strong passages to show that it is possible for one to lose their salvation. I do not believe that is what Paul is addressing here. <!--more-->

The first vs, Paul is trying to distinguish (separating) between law and grace instead of mashing them together as many do, example Catholics. He says one enslaves (law) and the other gives freedom (grace). Here the Galatians who had become brethren began to add some aspect of the law and circumcision as prerequisite to salvation. Paul reminds them they were freed from the law by grace through faith in Christ and should not put that bondage on themselves and on others because it nullifies (voids) grace.

He begins to make his case in vs. <strong>"2 Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing”  </strong>In summary, Christ alone is the hope of salvation. You add any form of works of the law, Christ will profit you nothing. This is because law cancels the grace we all desperately need.

Second case vs. “<strong>3 And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law</strong>" Here he states again that if you are seeking to be justified by the law, then you must keep them all in word, thought and deeds. Jesus told the rich young ruler in <strong>Matthew 19:21</strong> that he needed to keep the law perfectly (if you want to be perfect) if he was destined to have eternal life by keeping the law. It was not long before he realized that he loved his money more than God. He had broken first, second and third commandment, but James lets us understand how it is impossible to keep the law, <strong>James 2:10, “For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all”. </strong>If you break even one, James says you have broken them all.

Having made his case on the first three verses, now we can understand this verse "<strong>For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law, you have been cut off from Christ! You have fallen away from God’s grace</strong>”, <strong>Galatians 5:4 NLT</strong>. This verse is not for the saved backsliding but those who would chose to be saved by mashing law and grace. In other words, if you add law as prerequisite to salvation, you are cut off from Christ. You cannot be saved because salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone in Christ alone (<strong>Ephesians 2:8-9</strong>). If this is not how you view salvation, you have fallen from grace because this is the only grace that saves <strong>"…So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law”, Romans 3:28 NLT.</strong>

Again, any person who adds anything to Christ for salvation has fallen from grace. Let’s read what Peter says, <strong>Acts 15:8-11, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us, 9 and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</span> 10 Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 11 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they</span>.”</strong>

Are you counting on grace plus works to save you? If you do, you have fallen from grace and Christ will profit you nothing, He is the hope of everyone’s salvation. Therefore let the law show you that you have fallen from grace, repent of your sins and receive the grace of God through faith. The bible says Abraham believed God and it was counted for him for righteousness. Those considered sons of Abraham must come through the same door.

You may ask, is there a place for works? Yes, works validates faith but does not add to faith. This is not about faith plus works but faith at work or faith that works<strong>. </strong>Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with your interpretation. Keeping in mind the theme of Galatians, "falling from grace" just doesn't make sense to mean losing salvation. I think there's plenty of support throughout the rest of the bible to indicate that a believer cannot "lose" their salvation. But even if you just choose to isolate this section of scripture, I think it's abundantly clear the point that Paul is making. That, if you add anything to faith in Christ, you've voided grace by adding something you can boast in. Well done Evans.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Genesis 20:1-6, “3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Indeed you are a dead man</span> because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man’s wife.”</b>

<b><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6036" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="225" /></a></b>

I was talking to a young man looking with lust at this beautiful woman. He was describing what he would do to her given the opportunity. So I asked him, “<i>are you not married?</i>” Apparently his wife is fine with him looking at other women as long as he did not physically cheat on her with them. <!--more-->
A number of men have said, "<i>there is nothing wrong with looking at the menu as long as you are not ordering anything"</i> when looking at another woman. So i asked him, “<i>suppose you had a daughter and someone was describing what he could do to her sexually, would you be fine with that?</i>” to which he replied, “<i>No, in fact I would kill him</i>” he said, to which I responded, "<i>you’ve done the same with somebody's daughter and it does not bother you"</i>. He was creating what was acceptable to him, his own moral standard.

I share this because God called king Abimelech a dead man for thinking of taking another man’s wife, Abram in particular. In the midst of Abram's foolishness, God stepped in to protect His name and His daughter from harms way, the daughter He entrusted to Abram as his wife. God considers a man who eyes a woman he is not married to a dead man because she is His daughter and she is someone’s wife. What if she is not married? well she will be unless the Lord chooses otherwise. You prepare your young people for marriage not necessarily because they have someone at that age. Your daughter is someone’s wife yet to be and the one you lust after who is not your wife is someone’s wife.

The unsaved dive into sin and drink iniquity like water, believers may stumble and even fall in sin but God who is rich in mercy rescues the tempted and/or the fallen.

Abimelech knew what had happened to Sodom and Gomorrah, perhaps they purged their ways so as not end up like them. It is at this point of being a called a dead man in his dream he reasoned with the Lord. The bible says, "<b>But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, “Lord, will You slay a righteous nation also? “Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she, even she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this", Genesis 20:4-5. </b>He acted as one falling by ignorance, and not doing evil on purpose. He argued that out of the integrity of his heart he inquired first for he did not desire to sin against God.

God for the sake of His great name, for the preservation of the sanctity of marriage and for the protection of those whose hearts desire to be pure but have weakness, steps in to protect His people. "<b>And God said to him in a dream, “Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.", Genesis 20:6</b>. We all struggle with sin, we want to do what is right but some times fail, our prayer primarily should be deliverance by God for the sake of His great name. His name is on the line. I pray to be faithful to my wife primarily for the sake of His great name. God says, <b>“...I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD,” says the Lord GOD, “when I am <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hallowed in you</span> before their eyes", Ezekiel 36:23.</b>

Were it not for the restraining hand of God through our conscious, His Word, prayers, accountability, etc, we would be no different from the young man I spoke of. God withheld king Abimelech from sinning against Him, the same as we read of Joseph and the same desire we ought to have and pray for.

My prayer and I hope is yours is make <b>Psalm 23:3 </b>our prayer that God would keep us pure by leading us in the paths of righteousness for His name sake, to be faithful to His daughters through sanctity of marriage, and be a testimony to the world that mocks marriages.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“…test and approve what God’s will is-his good, pleasing and perfect will”, Romans 12:2 (NIV).</strong>

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/images.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6040" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/images.jpg" alt="images" width="259" height="194" /></a>

If you were to choose between the two: having your wish or doing God’s will, what would you choose?

Before you answer this question, you need to understand the meaning of the two words: wish and will and the difference between God’s will and man’s will. Failure to understand the difference will mean incorrect choice. And incorrect choice can result into a conflict, compounded with very severe immediate, subsequent or future consequences. <!--more-->Many people are victims of painful circumstances, frustrations, defeat, depression, confusion, worry, disappointment, failure, and losses, physical and emotional sicknesses etc. because of making incorrect and ungodly choices or decisions for their lives.

What is God’s recommendation? Note the word “recommendation”. God does not impose His will on anyone. He gives us His view, insight to His plans and His word to guide us in making choices. He also expects us to correctly, intelligently, and adequately use our mind to think and reason with Him about every choice or decision we are about to make regarding all areas of our life (Isaiah 1:18). Listen, for example, to what he says in the Bible, regarding making choices and reasoning:

<strong>“This day I call heaven and earth as a witness against you that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curses, now choose life, so that you and your children may live and that you may love the Lord your God, listen to His voice, and hold fast to Him. For the Lord is your life and He will give you many years in the land…</strong>”, <strong>Deuteronomy 30:19 (NIV) </strong>

<strong>“Come now, let us (you and God) reason together,” says the Lord…If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good from the land; but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.” For the mouth of the Lord has spoken</strong>”, <strong>Isaiah 1:18-19 (NIV)</strong>

These and several verses in the Bible clearly indicate and confirm that knowledge, reasoning and obedience to his voice, are paramount for making decisions and choices that conform to his will and ensures our blessings.

How then can we avoid confusing our wishes with His will? How can we avoid conflict between our wish and His will? How can we escape the temptation of conforming to the world’s standards instead of being transformed by the renewing of our mind by the word of God so we can meet God’s standards?

In life, whenever we are making any choices, we are either choosing God’s will or our wish. That is how life is set to operate. It is unfortunate that many people, including Christians, because of their ignorance due to lack of proper teaching and understanding the meaning of the will of God, do miss God’s best. In addition, confusion and error in judgment are major contributors to missing God’s will.

We operate on wishes most of the time. God operates on His will at all times. We keep a wish list. God keeps a will list. Often, we express our wishes and in some cases insist on them when trusting God to provide for our need. But God insist on His will; it is His will that He approves and appropriates in the lives of His children. Nothing less!<strong> </strong>

<strong>“ Insisting on getting your wishes is a sure guarantee of missing God’s will, for God may grant or permit a wish, without approving of it, for He approves and affirms His will only”.</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> </span>

Why then do we often insist on our wishes? Why is it that often we let our wishes override the will of God? Why is it that when God’s will conflicts with ours, we choose and insist on our wishes? Why do we find it hard to say “<strong>Thy will be done</strong>” when God cannot give us our wishes? Why is it that we sometimes insist on having our preference and not God’s provision? If God is all knowing and is the supplier of all our needs, why is it  that we refuse, arrogantly, at times, to listen to God’s truth and be convinced so we can accept God’s will? How, then, can one know His will? Why do we often insist on our wishes so we can please ourselves and others instead of accepting God’s will so we can please him, first, and then ourselves? Pray that God will help you know and walk in His will. God bless you. Brother Boaz Olang]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 11:24, “Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them." </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/prayer-changes-me.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6049" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/prayer-changes-me.png?w=300" alt="prayer-changes-me" width="300" height="169" /></a></strong>To tackle this vs., I open with this question, did Jesus give believers a blank check to ask for anything? It sounds straight forward "<strong>...whatever things you ask when you pray..."</strong>. This needs to be looked at in the light of who we are in Christ. We should be driven to have the mind of Christ, be imitators of Christ, be conformed to the image of Christ.
<!--more-->
Before salvation, most of our desires were wrong, selfish desires. Now in Christ, some of those still lingers and must be dealt with continuously. James writing puts us in check, <strong> "You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures", James 4:3</strong>. James says often believers ask but they don't ask for the right things with the right attitude or in faith or even with the right timing,  therefore they miss.

My study of <strong>John 15:7-8</strong> helped me understand<strong> Mark 11:24</strong>. <strong>"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. “By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples", John 15:7-8</strong>. Look at the starting point, "<strong>if you abide in me and my words abide in you...</strong>", the end result, <strong>"bearing fruit for the Father's glory"</strong>. If we abide in Him, our will, our desires, our drives are conformed to His. And what He desires for us becomes our desires. His desire is that we bear fruit. If we ask for things that will make us grow and bear fruit, more fruit and much fruit, He will grant to us those.

Jesus said, <strong>“But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you", Matthew 6:33.</strong> Mark the word "<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">added</span></strong>" not "<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">given</span></strong>" because His kingdom first is the most important. What does the kingdom of God entail, <strong>Romans 13:17-18, "for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men".</strong> In other words, we ought to seek to be more righteous, more at peace and more joyous, which in my judgement is the summary of the fruit of the Spirit in <strong>Galatians 5:22</strong>, because they hinge upon these three. Those who desire and serves Christ on these are acceptable to God and approved by men. This is more than changing things, it is more about changing us.

Lets listen more to the words of Jesus concerning those who abide in Him<strong>, "Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.”, John 6:27</strong>. Paul echoes with these words, <strong>"If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God", Colossians 3:1-3.</strong>

All these will make greater sense after we look at Solomon's prayer when God spoke to him in a dream. <strong>"At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask! What shall I give you?”, 1Kings 3:5</strong>. Solomon was given a blank check to ask for anything. What would you have asked for, more money, great health, protection? Not with Solomon, he asked for wisdom to discern (the mind of Christ).<strong>“Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”, 1Kings 3:9</strong>. Solomon who penned these words <strong>"The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable", Proverbs 10:32</strong> knew what best to ask for because he was abiding.

I love this, <strong>"The speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing. Then God said to him: “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice “behold, I have done according to your words; see, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you. “And I have also given you what you have not asked: both riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days", 1Kings 3:10-13</strong>.

This is how we should think and pray <strong>Mark 11:24</strong> by keeping to heart <strong>John 15:7-8</strong> with a great example of Solomon's prayer in <strong>1Kings 3</strong>. It always boils down to, what we desire. Will it make us more imitators, mind like and conformed to the image of Christ or our own? Lets keep this in mind, what we pray for the most will reveal what we desire the most.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Revelation 3:18-, "I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see." </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/images1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6058" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/images1.jpg" alt="images" width="271" height="186" /></a></strong>

By secular standards, true wealth is considered to be the accumulated gain one has horded to themselves.  How sad though, that such a mindset has swept up the church, to the degree that many of today’s big name TV preachers tell the deceived masses that monetary gain is God’ s plan for them, and the surest sign of his blessing. Falsehood and lies I say. Look to our Lord, he had nowhere to lay His head, are we greater than Him?<!--more--> Here the inspired apostle pens the words of the glorified Christ, true counsel from Jesus’ heart. Here He gives us three things of value, three things that will truly enrich the life that is earnestly seeking after God. These are worth more than all this worlds riches combined.

1.)    He counsels us to buy from Him gold, refined in the fire. This gold is the true, intimate knowledge of God known by all who would abandon themselves and seek Him in truth, true spiritual wealth, for the one who knows God is truly rich, not in the ways of this world which is passing away, but in eternal ways, those which shall last for eternity. The refining is the burning away of every desire but Him, all of our self-seeking, all of our asking of Him to gain for ourselves, instead of out of a humble desire and love for God.

2.)    Next He counsels us to buy from Him white garments. Here is the true proof of a Christian, a holy heart and life. These are the pure garments of holiness, unspotted from the world, that every Christian is to be clothed with, for it is commanded of our God (<strong>1Peter 1:15-16</strong>) and it is required to enter Heaven’s gates, for without holiness we shall not see the Lord (<strong>Hebrews 12:14</strong>). We must be clothed in the wedding garments. The life of a Christian is marked by ongoing faith and obedience, for He that is truly born of God does not sin (has no sin as an option) (<strong>1John 5:18</strong>). The life of sin has been abandoned, we now pursue a life of holiness.

3.)    Lastly He counsels us to buy from Him eye salve, that we may see, true spiritual illumination, that we may see our helpless state, and that we may bow our knee humbly before His majesty, in reverence and awe, surrendering our lives wholly to Him. We are either completely His, born of His spirit and dead to ourselves, or we are still under the sway of the evil one. We mustn’t let human reason and philosophy draw us away from the truth of what God’s word says.

Now you may ask, how is it that I buy these precious gems of the Christian life, how do I obtain what it is Jesus is telling me to purchase? The price is our lives, our desires, our wills. Renouncing the world and ourselves, and offering our lives as a living sacrifice to God Almighty, that He might do with us as He pleases. Our wills must be as His will, and He alone must be our desire. We must be willing to sell all to follow Him( <strong>Matt. 19:21</strong>). Then we will truly know Him, divine intimacy with the Lord of glory, Christ reining in our hearts, now and for all eternity.

In the love and truth of Christ, and for His glory alone, blessings Brother Ben]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 118:17-18, "17 I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of the LORD. 18 The LORD has chastened me severely, But He has not given me over to death”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6062" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download.jpg" alt="download" width="284" height="177" /></a> </strong>

If there was an enemy any of us would want to get rid of, most of us would say death. Death robs us of those dear to us, leaving us with such a great void. The more we also think of it, the more we all realize that we are on death row waiting for our time.<!--more-->

In the light of this elephant in the room, I pondered on this verse that I have read many times. In the past I have I had one way to look at it for application, today I see 3 more ways that can be an encouragement and comfort to us.  .

To get us started, when David says, "<strong>I shall not die, but live,” Psalm 118:17, </strong>David was not thinking that he was immortal and could never die because <strong>Hebrews 9:27</strong> reads “<strong>And as it is appointed for men to die once …</strong>.” There is significant abundant encouragement to pull us through this difficult life with knowing our life is hidden in Christ, <strong>Acts 17:28, “for in Him we live and move and have our being...” </strong>Let me therefore give us 4 encouragements.

First encouragement:  vs. 17, there is nothing in your life that can be cut short by Satan or any other means as long as the Lord gives you breath. Your life is in His hands, He gives you breath to “…<strong>declare the works of the LORD”. </strong>The Lord gave David breath to praise Him here on earth. Man's chief End is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. “<em>A good Christian is like the sun, which not only sends forth heat, but goes its circuit round the world. Thus, he who glorifies God has not only his affections heated with love to God, but he goes his circuit too; he moves vigorously in the sphere of obedience.”</em> , Thomas Watson. Paul said “<strong>For to me, to live is Christ …” Philippians 1:19</strong>. Take comfort you are in His hands and nothing can snatch you from there.

Second encouragement: Perhaps David meant to say never die meant eternal life. What a great promise, the blessed hope as we read in <strong>Titus 3:4-7,</strong> “<strong>4 But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">7 that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life</span>.”  </strong>We also read in<strong> Romans 8:11, “But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you”. </strong>In Christ we have eternal life, the afflictions in this life cannot be compared to the weight of glory that awaits us.

Third encouragement:  David may have spoken these words looking at his legacy as a man after God’s own heart and continuing to live on through his descendants until Christ was revealed years later. In <strong>Matthew 1:1, 1:20, 9:27, 12:23, 15:22, 20:30, 20:31, 21:9,21:15 </strong>Jesus is referred to as<strong> Son of David. </strong>We desire such legacy of faith to continue from one generation to another starting with our children. It’s what we have done for the Lord that will last (live on). Paul reminds Timothy of where his faith began <strong>2Timothy 1:5, “when I call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also”. </strong>What would you pass on?

Forth encouragement:  <strong>Vs. 18</strong> is the most befitting reason for not dying in reference to vs. 17. It reads <strong>“18 The LORD has chastened me severely, But He has not given me over to death”. </strong>Even in the midst of pain, suffering, chastening, no one is in control but God. His rod of correction would not kill David but made him to rejoice, <strong>Psalm 119:71, "It is good for me that I have been afflicted, That I may learn Your statutes”; Hebrews 12:6, “For whom the Lord loves He chastens, And scourges every son whom He receives</strong>”. A father who does not chasten his son does not love him. A father’s chastening is not an aim to kill but make the children become what they were born to be.  The hands that break are the hands that make, heal, restores.

When you know your father is for your joy, you know you shall not die when the chastening comes. His chastening shall make you glad when He is done with you that you may display who He is to the world. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Thessalonians 5:12</strong><strong>-16 “…And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and ADMONISH you: And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace among yourselves. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them who are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. Rejoice evermore”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/confrontation.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6065" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/confrontation.jpg?w=300" alt="confrontation" width="300" height="225" /></a> </strong>

Confrontation is not desirable. However, it is necessary and correct delivery, and reception of it is desirable. Typically, there are three ways to face confrontation: respond, react or avoid it. In most cases, the most preferred choice of many is avoidance.  That is, not willing to face up to confrontation. This is because confrontation, of any kind, is most likely to touch on something in us or about us that we fear to face or talk about because a weakness, fault, mistake, negligence, sin, etc. in us may be exposed and/or discussed, with a view to correct, instruct, rebuke, admonish or punish us.<!--more-->

Have you ever been confronted? Your friend or spouse or boss or parents or co-worker or an elder or any authority or somebody you don’t even know says to you “you blew it!” How do you feel when confronted? Embarrassed, perhaps? Defensive? Guilty? Surprised? Angry, at yourself and/or at the person who confronts you?

Why do we typically react negatively instead of responding positively to confrontation? There could be many reasons, but here are four possible reasons: First, none of us enjoys having his weaknesses or shortcomings exposed or put under spotlight. Salt added to the wound of ego or pride, ignorance or foolishness hurts. And we hate anything that hurts. Second, sometimes confrontation is painful because the spirit of the other person is haughty and insensitive. Their approach may hurt or their words may pierce through our hearts like a dagger or spear. In such cases, we tend to react by staging, sometimes, a head-to-head and nose-to-nose exchange, and that can be explosive and hurt badly. Third, sometimes the person does not have his facts straight, and his accusation may be unfair, unrealistic, malicious, or presumptuous. And forth, sometimes we think that the problem or issue is solely our own and we are not willing to open up to the possibility that we can be wrong and need correction.

No matter what the reason may be for confrontation, we need to respond positively and not defensively. Worse, we should not avoid confrontation all together. That is the godly way. Many a times we may be wrong or mislead or confused and may need confrontation from someone who can shed some light, give advise or correct us. The Bible encourages believers to admonish and to receive admonition. Simply put, it encourages believers to confront one another, in love, speaking the truth with a view to correct, advise, warn, instruct or counsel. The word <strong>‘admonish’</strong> carries the meaning of “<strong>setting the mind or heart right</strong>”-to redirect a person toward a correct behavior, attitude, action or approach to a problem or situation.

Paul, writing to the Christians in Thessalonica, urged them to receive ‘admonition’ from those elders who were laboring among them: <strong>1Thessalonians 5:12-16 “…And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and ADMONISH you: And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace among yourselves. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them who are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. Rejoice evermore”</strong>

So confrontation is appropriate and should be encouraged, given and accepted within the body of believers. Next time you are confronted or confronting, don’t be negative and selfish. You may miss the will of God and your opportunity to bless or to be blessed. Meditate on these for liberation and progression in faith. Be blessed, Boaz]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Daniel 1:17-20, “17 To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds. 18 At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. 19 The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's service. 20 In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom”.</strong>

In the past we have looked at the true desire that Daniel and his friends had in their hearts and how they manifested that desire in their request to eat vegetables instead of indulging in the King's meat. Though in the ungodly land of Babylon, they refused to be infested by it influence. <!--more-->Instead the Lord Himself was their influence, which was evident as He placed within them the knowledge, and skill, in all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. God equipped these men to be the best of the best, the cream of the crop<strong>. Proverbs 9:10</strong> shows us why this was so as it reads, "<strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding." </strong>

These men certainly displayed this, once again in their prior actions of their food choice. Only these four would manifest the wisdom and knowledge that was matchless in light of the spiritual advisory board of Nebuchadnezzar full of astrologers, soothsayers, and sorcerers. The ungodly would not stand up to the godly. King Nebuchadnezzar summoned the four Hebrews into his chambers and communed with them finding them to be ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in his realm. Because these faithful Hebrews communed with the King of Kings and had the fear of the Lord in their lives, directing their motives, thoughts, and actions, they could not help but to out shine all the others. God showed that His chosen ones were truly the best of the best. As a follower of Christ, I believe that God's people should shine as the best of the best in this ungodly world (our Babylon). We should shine as the best parents, spouses, educators, businessmen, musicians, actors, artists, writers, journalists, and leaders of our class. By class I mean as the four Hebrews boys were the best among their group and so should we be the best among ours. And what is the reason we should be the best, but to bring glory to God.

<strong>Matthew  5:14-16,  "14 You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven."</strong>

We need to covet the fear of the Lord in our lives, in order to have the same spirit manifest that shown in the lives of our four Hebrew examples. They lived in a land against their will, but thrived with that environment anyway. Perhaps you have chosen your path or perhaps it seems you found yourself in it, or it was chosen for you against your will. Whatever your scenario may be, be one that cultivates the fear of God in your life, and live in the fear and therefore wisdom of the Lord.

Application: What kind of parent, spouse, employee, teacher, etc...are you? Are you the best of the best? Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 26:28, "Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You almost persuade me to become a Christian.”  </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/confrontation3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6103" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/confrontation3.jpg?w=300" alt="confrontation" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong>

To come close but feel like it’s still far is a test we all face. This happens to me many times when I evangelize, there are people who seem to be close but in reality still far, very raw. For those who appear close, we are often tempted to close the deal, ask them to say the sinner's prayer and proclaim them believers. I see this many times when reports are given of hundreds or thousands of people making decisions to follow Christ through crusades, meetings etc. And my thought, how was the gospel presented and how many of those are truly saved (God saved them). Could it be possible that we are dealing with almost persuaded, people convinced but not changed when 80-90% of those who make a profession of faith fall away? That is the question.<!--more-->

The Apostle Paul was before king Agrippa, he had given his testimony, Festus the governor had tried to shut him down accusing him of too much learning that had made him mad. Paul had gone back to declare the same message Moses and the prophets would have agreed to making known that he was not speaking of anything new. None of these were strange or unknown to king Agrippa, in fact Apostle confirms it to him and those present in <strong>vs. 26.</strong> These were all convincing facts through history and Torah including the big one denied, the resurrection of Christ, <strong>1Corinthians 15</strong>. But is the convincing all we need to declare people saved? Paul in writing to Timothy reminds him of how the scriptures made him wise in preparation for salvation, "<strong>and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus", 2Timothy 3:15. </strong>The Scriptures does the convincing, God does the saving through that which He has convinced with.

King Agrippa was convinced even though he may have tried to silence his conscious. His eyes had been opened, what he knew made him accountable, however his actions shows he rejected it. <strong>Acts 26:28 </strong>reads,<strong> "Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You almost persuade me to become a Christian.”</strong> This was like almost being married but not. Almost is never good enough. Almost like being on the finish line but not crossing it or schooling but not graduating. The king thought this was something by his power he could make it work or not until Paul said, <strong>"<span style="text-decoration:underline;">I would to God</span> that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these chains", Acts 26:29</strong>. He appealed to the power of God to convict and convert. Salvation is the gift and the work of God but we must cast ourselves into the able hands who has opened our eyes to the truth.

<em>"A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God, Agrippa saw a great deal of reason for Christianity. His understanding and judgment were for the time convinced, but his heart was not changed. And his conduct and temper were widely different from the humility and spirituality of the gospel. Many are almost persuaded to be religious, who are not quite persuaded; they are under strong convictions of their duty, and of the excellence of the ways of God, yet do not pursue their convictions. Paul urged that it was the concern of every one to become a true Christian; that there is grace enough in Christ for all. He expressed his full conviction of the truth of the gospel, the absolute necessity of faith in Christ in order to salvation</em>", Matthew Henry.

Are you convinced of the truth and not converted? Are you almost like king Agrippa but your heart is still hard to bend your knees to God in repentance and faith for salvation?  Your hope is not on “Almost”, you need to “<strong>Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you”, Acts 8:22</strong> as Peter told Simon the Sorcerer. What is repentance?  It is taking sides with God that you are not a good person only playing religious games and turn away from your sins and place your trust in God through Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit to save you. You must humble yourself, be done with self. God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble <strong>James 4:6. </strong>Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

Once there was a pair of doves living in the wilderness, not knowing where they would get their next season of rain in the desert land where they were naturally born . This was a dry, hot and desolate place, no food, no water. Total hopelessness. They longed for a difference, for a day that would bring rain and quench their thirst. What strikes is a pair of doves lived in that desert, a rare case that not many times one hears! One day a heavy storm broke and the doves were disillusioned as to how would they go out to get their food, even if it meant dry tweeds from wild plants and worried to leave the nest with their newly born chicks. It was heavy showers of rain for hours, thunders, uncontrolled and untamed loud screaming wind blowing madly from here to there, it began to get cold and dark, the little doves were home with their chicks, sheltering them under their wings, warming them.<!--more-->

The chicks were quivering from hunger, they hadn't eaten for a few hours now, their young &amp; fragile wings were wet with rain water and the nest had been blown from its place to edge of the tree due to heavy winds. The doves were in the midst of a trauma, something like this had never happened in the desert land where they lived all their lives. This was rather phenomenal , irrespective they were heart-broken and worried, desperate for the showers to stop. Their thirst was long quenched but they were getting more severely hungry now, drooping below to cover ever so closely their children from falling off the nest.The female dove looked at the male dove, as if asking him to miraculously stop the winds- wondering and hopeful that something would happen. The male dove rose up, fluttered his wings, leaving his chicks beneath him there, and his beloved, he flew out and above to the open sky while the rain still poured. He rested on a naked branch and prayed - Lord, “<em>you are the maker of heaven and earth and all in between,
thank-you for the rain Lord for this desert became more than a graveyard, not a leaf to bring home to my children . Though it may look dark and spooky, and thunders may hurt their ears but we know you are a faithful God that loves us beyond measure and knows what he is doing and is in control, so I pray Lord and thank you again, though I'm too small before your wonders and might but I believe that where I am right now is just the right place that you have chosen me to be. For where there's the desert that's the only place where I can long for water, for where there's barrenness, that's where I hope for fruits. Lord I see that if I was not in this place, amidst this situation, I would not know what rain means. Thank-you again for hope for tomorrow Lord.”
</em>
We are like these little doves, wherever we are, we may feel like we are in a desert, we maybe panting and thirsty for something different, for a change, a hike, a job change, a boss change etc. etc but God knows us since He created us and He assured that He is "faithful". He knows what's best for us today and tomorrow.  It will be the same sun that will shine tomorrow, same moon that will light the sky. Everything will look like it was from before but its only God's blessings that renew every morning.

<strong>Lamentations 3:22 "Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.23 They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness”.</strong> Instead of waiting for tomorrow, count your blessings today, count them now for "now" is what matters! If you really have to wait then wait on Jesus.  <strong>Matthew 8:27 "Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Lamentations 3:24 I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him</strong>." <strong>Lamentations 3:25, “The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him”</strong>.  Conclude- <strong>Matthew 6:34</strong>, “ <strong>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Wait patiently for God to instruct you until you receive your rain showers</strong>.”

It is written in the Bible about what God said to Us: Matthew <strong>6:25,  "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?  … Matthew 6:28 "And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you?”, </strong> Blessings Peggy Hawk]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Leviticus 24:1-2, "The Lord said to Moses "Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually" <a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6134" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images.jpg" alt="images" width="227" height="141" /></a></strong>

What is clear oil? From is it derived from -olives? Olive has a special significance in the Bible. The oil can be extracted only if olive is pressed rather crushed /squeezed. This olive undergoes painful treatment for the core essence to get extracted, which in turn becomes the source of nourishment for many. This oil has to be used in the lamps so that they give light and can be kept burning continually.<!--more-->

Our Lord Jesus was crushed on the cruel cross of Calvary. Why? Isaiah answers according to <strong>Isaiah 53 "But he was pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities"</strong> Yes the precious blood shed by our dear Lord is the only source for our lamps to keep burning till the end. Not just few drops of oil, but it needs to be poured substantially. His blood was poured out for you and me. A lamp is only an article in which oil should be poured in order to give light. Without this oil, it cannot serve the very purpose. The blood of Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith symbolizes the clear oil of pressed olives referred above.

<strong>Matthew 25</strong> speaks about ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five of them were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps with them but not the oil whereas the wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps. Since the bridegroom was a longtime in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight the cry rang out "<strong>Here is the bride groom Come out to meet him</strong>". Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps, but the foolish ones realized only then that their lamps were going out because of lack of oil. Meanwhile before they could go and buy some oil, the bridegroom arrived and the wise could go with him to the wedding banquet and then the door was shut, thus the foolish ones could not reach. Be it a bedside light or a street light or a lantern or a table lamp or a reading light or desk lamp or floor lamp , without fuel in it, it is useless.

Importance of oil in the lamps is well demonstrated here. Yes the lamp is useful only when sufficient oil is poured into it.. Let us be like the wise virgins who realized the importance of oil, in their lamps to be kept burning continually. How does a person become wise? Let us learn the way since it is mentioned in the above parable that wise virgins could meet the bridegroom and were invited to the wedding banquet. And after they could enter, the door was shut and not opened for the foolish. "<strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy one is understanding</strong>". Well, God leads us till the end. He never leaves us nor forsake us in the middle of this life's journey. He is ALL SUFFICIENT. Our lamps need to give light CONTINUALLY, as mentioned to the Israelites. Consistency is one of the most characteristics of a believer. In spiritual terms, this moment a person cannot be on a mountain level and the very next moment fall to the ground level.

Our lamps need to filled with oil from above in order to give light in a continuous/ constant/ non stop/ unbroken/ permanent way. David was at great spiritual heights but his lamp could not give light for a season due to a break caused by desires of the flesh. Joseph's lamp was burning continually though he was put to the tests of lust , prison and distance from near and dear. Are our lamps giving light without breaks/stops?

Light is meant for this dark world. Isaiah prophesied about the birth of Lord Jesus in <strong>Isaiah 9:2 "The people walking in darkness have seen a great light , on those living in the land of shadow of death, a light has dawned"</strong><strong>
</strong>
Jesus is the light of the world. The real light, and the light that lasts forever. We as His children need to reflect his light as long as we have breathe. Are we the light to this world or are we allowing the darkness in this world to enter into us, thus putting off the light?  <strong>Matthews 5:14 "You are the light of the world. “A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven</strong>"

Are we hiding the light under a bowl? What does this bowl signify? Some tend to pretend as if they do not know the Lord. Are our job/profession/career/ family/ culture /friendship /prestige not allowing our light to shine? Are they making our light to be put under a bowl? Let us examine ourselves. Nowadays people are denying his name for some worldly benefits. "<strong>For God who said “Let light shine out of darkness" made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ ", </strong> <strong>2Corinthians 4:6</strong>;  <strong>""Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens and those who lead many to the righteousness like the stars for ever and ever",</strong> <strong>Daniel 12:3</strong>.

Yes if we resist the devil and shine out of the darkness, we will all inherit the eternal home where the Lamb is its lamp "<strong>The city does not need the sun or moon to shine on it for the glory of the God gives it light and the lamb is its lamp. The nations will walk by its LIGHT and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.", Revelation 21:24</strong>. "<strong>There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light and they will reign forever and ever" Revelation 22:5.</strong><strong>
</strong>
We are indeed privileged to be invited to the greatest beautiful city ,which words cannot describe and we will be with the Lord forever and ever

<strong>"The light of the righteous shines brightly but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out", Proverbs 13:9.</strong>  May the brilliance of the light from heaven, which flashed around Paul and transformed him from a persecutor to a preacher, also flash on us to transform us to meet the Lord in the air. by Sarah Susan]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 5:4, "When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, "<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch." </span></strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6139" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images1.jpg" alt="images" width="236" height="236" /></a></span></strong>

I love good surprises especially from God. I remember when Pastor Phil was getting engaged, he brought now his wife onto a hill surprised her there real good with an engagement ring.  Tears of joy ran down her cheeks, what a surprise. Wives, remember when your husband proposed? some of you had no clue it was coming or if you did, you couldn't tell when. When he did, you just fell apart, no words to say but shed tears of joy. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">We all love good surprises for they are things we don't expect or if we expect them, we do not know when they will drop</span></strong>.<!--more-->

Peter was surprised real good at one point in his life. As a professional fisherman, he would go out with other fishermen to fish at night and have fish by morning for the market. One day, they tried fishing all night but caught no fish. In the cold, very dark, maybe windy, exhausting night, all they went through the night was rewarded by the catch in the morning. On this morning, there was no pay for the hard work. There were people waiting for fish in the market, but no fish. Here comes Jesus, unexpected by Peter. I'm not sure if he knew who Jesus was. He may have heard about Him. Jesus comes by the lake with a great multitude. To Peter, these could have been potential customers. On this day, more consumers but no products. Peter and the rest went to wash their nets, maybe thinking of how great it could have been selling fish to the new customers. <strong>All they knew to do could not yield any fruit that morning</strong>. Someone once said that <strong>our God is the God of 11:59, He surprises you when you least expect Him</strong>. Over the years, God has surprised me real good and I was left stunned and over joyed.

He might have not known Jesus but I believe Jesus was there to surprise Peter. Yes He taught multitudes but greater miracle was to be recorded when He met Peter and the miracle was for a greater purpose. After teaching which is putting the kingdom of God first, He tells Peter, "<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch"</span></strong>. Peter perhaps would have said something like this, <em>“Let me tell you something Teacher, we fish at night the time fish is available, already we have tried but nothing happened and by the way, we are professional fishermen while you are a teacher, what would you know about fishing?” </em>Why try to fish in the hour no one expects to get a catch? That could have been Peter's thought but listen to his response in <strong>vs. 5, "But Simon answered and said to Him, "Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net." “ </strong>I have done the best I could thorough ideas, expertise I mean everything but You are the author of all things, I will cast my faith in that situation again despite what my logic mind tells me<em>. <strong>It doesn't make sense but "I will not lean on my own understanding", Proverbs 3:5</strong>.</em>

What has failed in the natural, God can accomplish it in the supernatural, we can see this with God showing Jeremiah what He can do with marred clay. <strong>Jeremiah 18:4, "...so He made it (marred clay) again into another vessel (means)</strong>". It failed you? it will not fail Him. It got broken? He can fix it. He made "<span style="text-decoration:underline;">IT</span>" the same thing, "AGAIN" one more time "ANOTHER", what you were not expecting.<strong> vs. 6, "And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking". </strong>His greatest catch in history, Jesus surprised him real good simply because that was his time. He did not deserve it, he wasn't looking for it, he didn't expect it but Jesus knew He needed that surprise cause from that day his life was changed, never to be the same again. It was about taking the Lord at His word and knowing the miracle was not about fish but what He will make him to be, fisher’s of men. Are you opened to surprise the Lord may bring your way? I recently had a chance to evangelize a guy I had been praying for opportunity to share with. It came at a time I least expected it (surprised) and what a joy it was. Lord surprise us today as you have appointed this day just to be our time to show Yourself great to those you love. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 1:1-27, "O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maid servant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life</span>, no razor shall come upon his head"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/teswting.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6168" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/teswting.jpg" alt="teswting" width="225" height="225" /></a></strong>Anything the Lord does, He does it for a reason and it's upon men to learn why He chooses to do certain things through people. Everything God does, He does it glory for His glory and men become the beneficiary of His blessings.

Here is Hannah who had a loving and caring husband. She was married to Elkanah who had another wife called Peninnah. Elkanah loved Hannah more than Peninnah for we see how they get treated when it comes to getting gifts. <strong>Vs 4&amp;5, "And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife... vs. 4 But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah"</strong>.  Now God had blessed Peninnah with children, Hannah on the other hand was barren for the Lord had closed her womb. Being that she was loved and cared for, given more attention, more material things you would think that would give her all the joy and the happiness, not in Hannah’s case.<!--more-->In life, we see people who have everything other people think should make them happy yet these are some of the most miserable folks why? <strong>Relationships are more fulfilling than possessions.</strong>

I believe she was fine in her situation until her rival Peninnah began to provoke her severely to make her miserable Vs 6. We saw this with Jacob’s wives, Leah and Rachel. Leah had children while Rachel did not. Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and therefore Leah provoked her daily and that made Rachel desire a child. Hannah was provoked so much that she desired a child of her own too. We can be provoked by people around us to desire bigger cars, houses, promotions, ministries or anything etc but the question is, what is your motive? Yes they are good things and can be desired but the motive for desiring them can be wrong. <strong>James 4:3, "Ye ask and receive not, because you ask a miss, that you may consume it <span style="text-decoration:underline;">upon your lusts</span>". </strong>At times we don't ask but many times when we ask good things we find later they were for wrong reasons. Hannah desired a child but why? Did she want a child to get back at her rival, or a child to not feel left out, or escape loneliness? This could have been her motive and therefore year in year out she prayed but God would not answer her prayers. You should not be quick to blame God for not answering your prayers when you know for sure that if He answered them, you will not go to church anymore, you will not give Him glory due to Him, your pride will take over. God will not give you what He knows will destroy you until He changes you. This is why the priority of prayer is about changing you first before changing things

Hannah perhaps came to realize that her previous prayers were selfish prayers (for self) and God would delay response until she changed the focus of her prayers <strong>vs. 11, "Then She made avow and said, "O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maid servant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, no razor shall come upon his head". </strong>This is what I call praying with a purpose, this is the type of prayer that supercedes our selfish desires and ambitions for we begin to see that anything God is going to bring our way is not for us but for His glory and to reach others. He may entrust it in our custody but it's more than for us. Her vow was for her son to be God's servant all the days of his life. After she prayed this prayer, her desire was granted. These are the prayers that pleases the Father. These are the prayers that focusses on the object of our faith rather than the outcome of our prayers. This is life transforming prayer rather than situation changing prayers.

Now I understand why many people cannot be used of God for God knows that they will love the praises of men and He will not get any of it. <strong>2Corinthians 4:7, "But we have this treasure in the earthen vessels that the excellence of the power maybe of God and not of us". </strong>The bible says that our God <strong>is a jealous God </strong>and He will not share His glory with anyone else. When I pray for a promotion, a better place to live, to be used more is because I want to glorify Him in all things and others may be blessed too, it's all about Him. My motive is to build a testimony that many may know that God is able Read <strong>Ezekiel 36:22-</strong>.

John the Baptist was told that Jesus was doing the work he should have been doing, here was his response, <strong>John 3:30, "He must increase, that I may decrease". </strong>Because of Hannah's change of prayer attitude, Samuel is born to become one of the greatest prophets of God, used to serve many. Yes the mother rejoiced to have received a male child, but God used His gift to the woman to accomplish His will. Rachel bore Joseph who became mighty, a picture of Christ. What do you desire that you have prayed for? What was your motive? Before you pray to God to change the situation, why not pray that God changes you. When He changes you, you will still have faith and confidence in Him whether He comes through or not because your faith is not in the outcome, it’s in who is in control.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Daniel 3:16-18, "16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 17, If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18, But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up."</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6180" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images3.jpg" alt="images" width="272" height="185" /></a> </strong>

Four men are brought from their land to so serve king Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. They were full of wisdom, good looking and the greatest thing, they trusted and depended on God. Everything seemed well until the king made his own gods (idols) forcing everyone to fall down and worship the gods he had made. Three men living for their true God were also challenged to bow down. What do you do when what you stand for is challenged? Situations bringing you two sides and you have to choose one. One presents you with the picture of the immediate consequences, the other promises relief.<!--more--> At one time, things were going on so well but then out of nowhere, everything you stood for was threatened. Should I blame God for bringing me to this place and then letting challenges come my way? Should I give up on God because of the new development? What is your stand? What is the truth? Are you willing to stand even if it means suffering the consequences in the hands of those who have made the decree? For Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, they were commanded to bow even given another chance to act, and they were told of the consequences (furnace heated 7 times hotter than the usual) if they did not bow. Let us see what they did.

Three things in their response in the situation, First, "<strong>our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace</strong>". No question about God's ability, He is the God of the impossibilities, the God who calls those things which are not as though they were. <strong>Jeremiah 32:17, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is nothing too hard for You</span></strong>". Second, "…<strong>He will deliver us from your hand</strong>", what a faith to see God coming your rescue when the pressure from people and things of this world challenges everything you stand for. Wonderful words, "<strong>Our God is able</strong>" and "<strong>He will deliver us</strong>" let's see their third response to the king, "<strong>But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up</strong>". To someone, the last response could mean that they were not sure God would deliver them. I look at it differently, this is the extra mile walk many don’t want to go or unwilling to go, but this is the mile of surrender, this is the mile of the garden of Gethsemane experience, where you say <strong>“not my will but your will be done”</strong>. This is the mile that says, “<em>God allow me to go through what brings You more glory</em>”. The three men desired God’s will, they said, “<strong>17, If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up</span>” </strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">If God would not deliver them from the furnace of fire, He must have counted them worthy to go through it</span></strong>., <strong>Acts 5:41, "So they departed from the presence of the council, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. </span>2Thessalonians 1:5, ".. that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer</strong>". <strong>Romans 8:18, "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us</strong>".  They obeyed God rather than men, this was an opportunity for them to shine for God. The situation got worse, the furnace was heated 7 times hotter than usual.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> <strong>The hotter the heat, the greater the glory</strong></span>. Bound and thrown into the fire. Two things to note, 1. <strong>the fire could only burn what needed to be burnt and revealed who needed to be revealed</strong>. The fire burnt the ropes they were tired with, freeing them and 2. the Son of God was revealed in the midst of the fire. I do not find anywhere in the scripture where they were quick to get off the fire. Through their stand, the decree was changed by the king himself who said, "<em>no one should worship any god apart from the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego</em><strong>" (paraphrased). </strong>Three men's stand made a difference, they were counted worthy for “<strong>greater is He that is in us, that he that is in the world”</strong>. I want to be counted worthy, how about you?, Blessings Ev, God's servant

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 1:19 “Because that which be made known about God is manifest [plain] in them, for God hath shewed it unto them (KJV).”</strong>

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6189" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images-1.jpg" alt="images (1)" width="240" height="210" /></a>

Friends come on various levels.  So of us have friends that we refer to as acquaintances, other friends are casual friends, then we have our lose friends, and lastly our intimate friends.  Just as we have different levels of friendships with others, so too are there various relationship levels when it comes to knowing God.  In <strong>Romans 1:19-32</strong>, knowing God is a key word that is repeated in the passage and its interesting to see that each of the “knows” refers to one of those relationship levels with God.

The Greek word for “know” in verse 19, is the word Gnostos which means to be an acquaintance, literally “the knowable God.”  <!--more-->Men see the attributes of God in His Creation.  I find it amazing that people can look at a building and know that a builder was responsible.  Someone can look at a painting and know there was painter, and realize that everything made has a maker, but when it comes to Creation not all use that same logic to acknowledge that Creation shows us that there is a Creator!  Nevertheless God gives everyone, the whole world an unmistakable witness of Himself.

In America 95% - 97% of people believe in a “higher power” and therefore “know God” or have knowledge of God at an acquaintance level.  Creation gives natural revelation of God that is knowledge of Him based on nature.  This is what the Psalmist knew when he wrote, “<strong>The Heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament shows His handiwork.”</strong>

The Expositors Bible Commentary points out<strong> “Natural revelation is sufficient to make man responsible, but is not by itself sufficient to accomplish his salvation”. </strong>Four characteristics are noted. First, it is a clear testimony set before the eyes of men, as the word "<strong>plain</strong>" implies. Second, from the use of "<strong>understood</strong>," the revelation does not stop with perception, but is expected to include reflection, the drawing of a conclusion about the Creator. Third, it is a constant testimony, maintained "<strong>since the creation of the world</strong>" (cf. Acts 14:17). Fourth, it is a limited testimony in that it reflects God in certain aspects only—namely,<strong> "his eternal power and divine nature.</strong>" One has to look elsewhere for the disclosure of his love and grace—i.e., to Scripture and especially to the revelation of God in His Son <strong>John 1:14.</strong>

All created beings are accountable before God whether one believes in Him or not, or follows Him obediently or not.  There are so many that have this kind of acquaintance relationship with God, and that is where everyone starts, “knowing God” as Creator only, but not as Father.  It is the difference of a boy that has seen a picture, and lives in the home provided for by his biological father, but the boy has never developed a relationship with his biological father.  With no relationship, that father is just the sperm donor, and all the boy knows about his father is what he can see when he looks in the mirror and knows that there are similar attributes to his father, but void of relationship.

Do you feel that God is a distant Creator and not your Father?  God desires that we call out to the One that has made the skies, the trees, the sun, moon stars, and you that you see daily.  God doesn’t want us to know Him merely as an acquaintance, as Creator, but as Father. This is level 1  To be continued…

Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 1:21-23, </strong>“<strong>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images5.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6195" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images5.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong>

We looked at <strong>Romans 1:19</strong> and how Paul spoke about those who “knew” God by Creation, and how this alone leaves the relationship with Him at the level of what we may refer to as an acquaintance.  This level of knowing God is sufficient to make man responsible, but is not by itself sufficient to accomplish His salvation.

Paul continues in <strong>Romans 1</strong>, about knowing God where he spoke about those that “knew God.” If these people knew God, why did they display a lack of thanks to Him, and why foolish, darkened hearts that worshipped idols? The Greek word used here for “know” is “<em>Ginosko</em>” which means to allow, be aware of, feel, or perceive, etc…<!--more--> If these people knew God they certainly had a “funny” way of showing it. When looking into the history of humanity a willful rejection of God’s revelation of Himself can be traced. Even though these knew God via Creation, humanity failed to act upon it, and thus God was not worshipped by those whom Paul is addressing here. Humanity was created to worship, and if humanity fails to worship the One True God, they will worship someone or something else certainly, and in this case their choice idol was images made to look like man, as well an the animal species.

Recall in Exodus when Moses was on Mt. Sinai receiving God’s Law. While Moses was on the mountain where were the rest of the Israelites? They were at the bottom of the mountain creating an idol, the Golden Calf. Now this strikes me with great humor on the part of the High Priest Aaron. Aaron tries to explain away the Golden Calf, even though he clearly submitted to the will of the people in their darkened imagination and desire to create a god for them to worship. After collecting gold earrings and trinkets, he melted them down and out of the pliable gold, fashioned a Golden calf. When Moses comes back form Sinai, Aaron tells him “<strong>They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. So I told them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.’ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!</span>”</strong> This excuse makes me laugh that Aaron threw some gold in the fire and like a “genie” a calf popped out!

Many people gather the darkened imaginations of others and fashion those ideas together and create a god to suit their sins, one they are comfortable with. Then they worship the god by their foolish darkened hearts. For this reason God commands us to love not the world, and if anyone loves the world the love of God is not in him. The world is a system of thinking that is opposed to the God of truth, justice, love, and holiness. Adam tried to hide on God in the trees when he sinned because his heart became darkened. It would be easier to try and cover the brilliance of sun with a blanket than to try hiding from God. David wrote, “<strong>Where can I flee from Your presence</strong>….” Filled with “intellectual pride” many “claim to be wise,” and try and justify their idol worship, just to reveal “their foolish hearts are truly darkened.” We need to be in God’s Word daily so that the light of His truth can flood our hearts daily, and leave no room for the darkness to enter in and thus worship Him! To continue, <strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt; </strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 1:28 “Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images6.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6230 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images6.jpg" alt="images" width="259" height="194" /></a></strong>

Moral perversion brings mental perversion. Paul writes about those that did not like to retain God in their minds and how their minds were affected by such a decision. The mind is a very powerful place. Perhaps the human mind is one of the most powerful things on earth next to God. With the mind, humankind has placed men on the moon, we can send information by the click of a button around the globe, we can breathe underwater using SCUBA gear, etc…. our mind controls our actions, and whoever or whatever controls our minds will certainly control us.<!--more-->

At the time when Paul was writing Paul addressed that there were those people who refused to see it to be rational and relevant to acknowledge God. If one acknowledges God then it stands to reason that the one is accountable to God as their Creator. Many do not desire to acknowledge God and therefore create idols and systems that are secular (without God). As ones conscience convicts them of breaking God’s Law, and as Creation proves there is a Creator, some still refuse to give in and submit to God, and one’s pride keeps them from retaining the knowledge of God. One can sit in a class and hear information, or read a book, but retaining information is when that information becomes part of a person. Each of us can attest to this when we have studied for our tests, and although we reviewed the material, there was some information, or formulas that we did not retain at that time, and the test revealed that to us.

What did God do because many felt it undesirable, or unnecessary to retain the knowledge of God? God “gave them over to a depraved (reprobate-KJV) mind to do what ought not to be done.” The word “reprobate” (<em>adokimion</em>) means “rejected after testing.” God would reject those that rejected him, because He gave many chances to them, notice they were rejected after testing, not prior to. Man was created in God’s image and because of sin that image has been distorted, and only through Christ can that image be restored to its rightful place whereby God intended it to be. At salvation God pronounced a divorce from us to our father the Devil that “nourished us” with the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, and called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. John writes that men stay in darkness because men love darkness rather then light, because light exposes us for who we really are. Just as the sunlight reveals the dust on the surface of a table that has just been dusted, likewise does the light of God’s truth reveal our lives, our minds in truth. <strong>Hebrews 4:12</strong> states, “<strong>For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword,…<span style="text-decoration:underline;">it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart [mind]</span></strong>.” God gave these men up to minds which held thoughts that He disapproved of to the judgment of their sin. That sinful mind will go head to head with God on Judgment and their will be no excuses to appease the Judge of the universe. These men because of their darkened minds did those acts which ought not to be done.” Through our conscience and Creation, God still has shown us right from wrong. We desperately need Christ so we can think right, about God, others, and ourselves. Is He in you! “<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus”, (Philippians 2:5).</span>” </strong>Don’t only read His Word, but obey it!

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 7:8</strong><strong>–</strong><strong>10, “8Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 9 “When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Show a miracle for yourselves,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and cast it before Pharaoh, and let it become a serpent.’ ” 10 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as the LORD commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images7.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6238 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images7.jpg" alt="images" width="216" height="146" /></a></strong>

How does one come to trust someone in the midst of trials? Who do you know you can go to when you must do something that causes you to become uneasy about the possible outcomes? Perhaps you turn to a spouse, a best friend, a co-worker, a parent, grandparent, or a sibling. Do you believe God to be trustworthy? Let’s look to Moses to discover what Moses discovered about how God builds trust for trials on the horizon.

Moses was called by God to be Israel’s deliverer. Surely God could easily destroy all the Egyptians, just as he killed the firstborn son of the Egyptians when sending the tenth plague. However, like many times, God chooses to send a man to display the His power.<!--more-->

In the desert God commanded Moses to throw down his staff. What did Moses have to loose, he didn’t know it was going to become a serpent. Then God asked Moses to pick it up by the tail. Now, perhaps Moses was not as quick to do so, after all what if he would have been bitten. Yet Moses picks up the serpent by the tail showing his trust and it became a rod once again. Soon after, Moses finds himself standing with his brother Aaron in front of the most powerful man in Egypt, Pharaoh himself. Now again God is asking for a rod to be cast down to allow it to become a serpent. Moses did it alone before God, but could he instruct Aaron to do it before Pharaoh? Moses obediently instructs, Aaron obeys, and the staff becomes a serpent before Pharaoh. Pharaoh calls in his magicians (sorcerers) and they duplicate the same miracle causing their thrown down staffs to become serpents. However, Aaron’s rod (serpent) swallowed their rods (serpents). “<em>The loss of the magicians’ rods in this fashion gave evidence of the superiority of God’s power when Aaron’s rod gulped down theirs”,</em> (MacArthur). From God in the desert to Pharaoh in the palace, why did God allow a “trial run” on this miracle and then perform it a second time? Perhaps these reasons will shed some light.

Miracle of the rod before God
<ol>
	<li>God allowed Moses to build trust in Him for trials on the horizon.</li>
	<li>God showed Moses, if he could trust God in this miracle, He can trust God in others.</li>
	<li>God showed Moses, when he throws something down before God, God can change it!</li>
</ol>
Miracle of the rod before Pharaoh
<ol start="4">
	<li>God showed Moses he could trust the Lord even when things look to be seemingly going in the wrong direction.</li>
	<li><strong>Romans 8:28</strong>, “<strong>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Hebrews 11:27</strong>, “<strong>By faith he (Moses) forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.</strong></li>
</ol>
How is God trying to build up your trust to face trials on your horizons? What is God asking you to trust him in and are you doing so? Throw it down, and pick it up changed by God. Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 17:11-13, “11 As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. 12 When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up</strong><strong>—</strong><strong>one on one side, one on the other</strong><strong>—</strong><strong>so that his hands remained steady till sunset. 13 So Joshua overcame the Amalekites army with the sword.”<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images8.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6243 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images8.jpg" alt="images" width="259" height="194" /></a></strong>

Usually people are very tensed in battles, no one knows what the outcome will be…..Their life is in jeopardy...severe danger /hazard ...In the battlefield, the men fighting are at the heights of stress and tension/ agony. Ultimate aim is to defeat and destroy the enemy..<strong>No matter what </strong>…..But the Israelites had great comfort, even in the face of the fierce battle, the savage war that they all were being supported by prayer …What a privilege, it was for the Israelites that they had a leader who was upholding them all in prayer –intercessory prayer…Though all the others were perishing in tension, these people had great source of comfort ….<!--more-->Moses said to Joshua ”<strong>Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands</span>”</strong> Moses assured Joshua and all his fighting men that he would stand on their behalf with the staff of GOD in his hands….the staff of God which parted the Red Sea; the staff when struck the rock and water gushed out and quenched the thirst of lakhs of the Israelites; the staff when stretched, God sent an east wind which brought locusts that invaded Egypt …This staff in Moses hands was anointed by God to perform endless miracles and finally God delivered Israel from bondage of Egypt….

Now we are also in continuous warfare /battle with the dark forces, <strong>"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms”, Ephesians 6:12 </strong>...Though it seems terrible, we have a great intercessor... Indeed we are more privileged than the Israelites …since we have a high priest who can sympathize with all our weaknesses, whose hands never grow tired, whose hands need not be held by any other person….This intercessor intercedes for us round the clock …<strong>Hebrews 7:25, "He was a priest not on the basis of relation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of indestructible life</strong>"... The staff in his hands -the cruel cross of Calvary on which he died, gives us great peace.

David summarizes his total life in brief and sweet <strong>Psalm 23</strong> where he narrates his experiences ."<strong>Even though I walk through the valley of shadow of death, I will fear no evil ...Thy rod and thy staff comfort me",  Psalms 23 </strong>Right, David does not speak of the valley of death but "<strong>valley of shadow of death" </strong>....It is a continuous process...The shadow of death or following of death throughout our life...Amidst this frightful/horrifying encounters also, His staff is our comfort ... While the rod disciplines, the staff comforts….A staff in the hand of a shepherd is of great importance in taking care/managing/administering the sheep..

Also it is used by people to lean upon...It is a comfort to have something to lean upon when you cannot stand the situation...<strong>Genesis 47:31</strong> speaks of an old ,exhausted person, Israel who worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff ...Yes, this staff provides endless relief and solace ..So the staff in the hands of Moses which symbolizes the Cross of our Lord Jesus is our great comfort /consolation/ solace /satisfaction and we are more than conquerors,  even in the most dreadful valley !  "<strong>But Thanks be to God! He gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ"</strong>, <strong>1Corinthians 15:57</strong> by Sarah Susan]]></content:encoded>

  <title><![CDATA[The Effectual Working, Evans Olang]]></title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Philippians 2:12-13, "12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">13 for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure"</span></strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images9.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6269" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images9.jpg" alt="images" width="236" height="236"/></a></strong>

As I continue to study closely the writings of the Apostle Paul, I discover a common thread in how he says things about himself and how they came about. If I was to use the movie setting to make his overall point, Christ is the main character/cast while he took the supporting role. This is important because the supporting cast have a role to make the main character shine by how they fit in. Apostle Paul took the supporting role depending on God through Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit to empower him to become what God had in store for him.

The tragedy of today, many believers want to be the main character in the movie, the songs are about man, the books stores are filled with "how to be" books. People even have back up plans for running their lives, marriages, churches, leading people to the Lord. In short leaning on self and not on the sufficient power of God to save and keep.<!--more-->

Apostle Paul in the verse above tells us of what is required of believers and then tells us the effectual working of God in believers to be what God requires of them. When I talk of effectual, I’m talking about the ability to produce a desired effect. Other Synonyms for effectual are effective, efficient, fruitful, operative, potent, productive.

I want drive briefly two points, Effectual calling (justification) and Effectual living (sanctification). They are all under the umbrella of the effectual working. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Salvation is the effectual calling of God, </span></strong>the &nbsp;power of God unto salvation, <strong>1Corinthians 2</strong>, <strong>Romans 1:16. </strong>&nbsp;This is the action of the Holy Spirit in producing conviction of sin and bestowing the gift of faith in Christ to those being saved, <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9</strong>. Paul acknowledging the work of God in salvation pens these words,&nbsp; <strong>1Thessalonians 2:13, "For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe."&nbsp; </span></strong>This is justification (declared not guilty) something done for us by God, <strong>“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him”, 2Corinthians 5:21.</strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Effectual living (sanctification)</span></strong> is what God does in us and we live out what He does in us, meanwhile Justification is something God does for us. Paul says “...<strong>work out your own salvation</strong>…” this is not to be confused with working to be saved but working because your are saved. Sanctification is a state of separation unto God; all believers enter into this state when they are born of God: “<strong>But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—and righteousness and sanctification and redemption"</strong>, <strong>1Corinthians 1:30.</strong>

Here are some thoughts on effectual living (sanctification):-
</p><ol>
	<li><strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">I live because He lives</span></strong>, <strong>Galatians 2:20</strong>, “<b>I</b><strong>&nbsp;have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me</strong>”; <strong>Acts 17:28, "for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring”</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> I work because He works in me,</span></strong> <strong>Galatians 2:8, “ (for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles)”;</strong> <strong>Philippians 1:6, "</strong><strong>being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ"</strong><strong>; Philippians 4:13, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”; 1Corinthians 15:10, “ But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me</strong>”</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">I know him because I am known of Him</span></strong>, <strong>Galatians 4:9, "But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?"</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">I pray because He prays through me</span>, Romans 8:26, “ Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered</strong>.”</li>
</ol>
Paul avows that he has power to "strive" in spirit for his converts only as Christ works in him and by Him , <strong>Colossians 1:29, "To this end I also labor, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">striving according to His working which works in me mightily</span></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">" </span>for “<strong>13 for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure", Philippians 2:13.</strong>

Even though it’s the Lord who keeps us from falling and present us faultless in His presence with exceeding joy (<strong>Jude 1:24</strong>), this does not mean that we have no part to play. Paul says the Philippians obeyed and should continue even in Paul’s absence (action on their part). Paul knowing that only through the effectual working of Christ did they have the ability to obey. In our lives, our marriages, family, work place, live holy life, pray, evangelize etc, we need the effectual working of the Holy Spirit to live, work, know, pray and more. Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>John 11:43, ”When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out””</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images10.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6276" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images10.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="300"/></a></strong>

This is the familiar account of the resurrection of Lazarus, sister to Mary and Martha.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lesson 1 - Jesus Timing is not always our Timing</span></strong> - “<strong>Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days (v. 11).”</strong> Isn't it puzzling to our human minds to think that upon hearing of Lazarus’ sickness, Jesus didn't treat that news like a 911 call? No Jesus stayed where he was another two days before He left to be with Lazarus. There are times when we call upon Christ in prayer and He says not yes or no, but wait. The Palmist said, <strong>“I waited patiently for the LORD? he turned to me and heard my cry”, Psalm 40:1.</strong> It’s in the waiting on God that we learn to trust Him. We live in an society of instant gratification of minute rice, e-mail, cell phones, etc…. However God lives outside of time and therefore is not bound by it. To God all time is now. Noah’s flood and your situation are not worlds apart in light of eternity. <!--more-->One day in eternity we will understand this, but now we are bound by time. When Jesus finally arrived on the scene Martha shares that if Jesus had only been there while Lazarus was sick he would not have died. Again she was thinking about human timing verses God's&nbsp;timing, but how can we blame her, after all she was human, and her faith was being tested.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lesson 2 - Jesus reveals His identity </span></strong>- <strong>“23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” 24 Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; 26 and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” 27 “Yes, Lord,” she told him, “I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”</strong> Jesus was trying to help her see that she was thinking of the resurrection as an event, and Jesus was showing her that His identity was the resurrection. Jesus was the great I AM that He proclaims in <strong>John 8:58</strong>, <strong>“before Abraham was born, I Am</strong>!” It’s crucial for us to know not just what Christ can do, but who He is, because it is because of who He is that translates to what He does.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lessons 3 - Jesus uses people to do His Work </span></strong>- Jesus gave two commands for others to do to take part in Lazarus’ miracle. First Jesus commanded them <strong>“Take away the stone,” to which Martha replied, “by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.</strong>” Secondly, Jesus said to them, <strong>“Take off the grave clothes and let him go.”</strong> Now Jesus and only Jesus could have called Lazarus back from the dead. It’s been said “<em>When E.F. Hutton speaks people listen</em>.” However death would have placed its icy hands of its ears if E.F. Hutton had said Lazarus come forth. But when Jesus cried with a loud voice “<strong>Lazarus come forth</strong>,” “<em>The words of Jesus cut through the icy grip of death like a white - hot blade through soft powered snow",</em>&nbsp;Ray Comfort. Not even death could silence the words of the great I AM, the Resurrection and the life, because death had to concede, and forfeit the victory to life. Surely if He could raise the dead, He could move His own stone. Didn’t an angel move His stone in His resurrection? Yet, Jesus commanded the stone to be moved by others. There are times when we need to preach the Law of God to the stony heart of a sinner so the stone is moved to make way for the gospel seed to be planted. <strong>Mark 4</strong> makes this clear. God told <strong>Ezekiel 36</strong>, “<strong>19 I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. 20 Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God.</strong>” Their heart needs the stone moved. And God called us to preach His Word, and if we are speaking to a prideful hearted person, their heart of stone needs to be moved and by using the Law of God to break the hard heart, and then use the gospel to heal the broken hearted. Jesus calls the dead sinner to life, and then we are to be used to remove the grave clothes. New converts will have some of the stench of the world upon them and be wrapped in the grave clothes of some old worldly habits and thoughts, and it is our job to help remove the grave clothes, that is make a disciple out of this person.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Application</span></strong>: Do you wait for His timing patiently? Do you know His identity? Are you being used by God to remove stones in evangelism and grave clothes in discipleship? Jesus prayed, “Not my will but your be done” <strong>Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Deuteronomy 2:1-4, "...You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward" </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images11.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6284" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images11.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong>

It's easy to talk about trust and be led of God but when it comes to the actual action it becomes a little bit hard because of what we have trained ourselves to think of ourselves. I don't know how many times I have talked about trusting in God to lead and then felt like I was by myself or I did not see how things were going to come out in the long run. <strong>If you've noticed, the Lord tells us things but He never explains Himself.</strong>

When God called the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, the plan was to bring them to the promise land. <strong>When the Lord begins to do something, He already has an end result for it </strong>and so <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">when He begins to do it, it's not for Him to try and see if it would work but for Him to finish what He has began</span></strong>. We can start with Him and then give up but He will not.<!--more-->

Now we see Him bring His people through the desert ultimately that He may bring them to the land He promised. Then all of a sudden there are obstacles, barriers, partitions, walls, valleys just to mention a few. God did not tell them what it will take to bring them there meaning the process. Thank God that He does not always tell us the process but the purpose. If some of us knew the process, we would give up before we even go far. David was promised that He would be the next king, God did not tell him that He would have to wait 17years, be wanted dead by Saul and face many challenges. Joseph receives a dream and he is not told that dream to be accomplished, he will have to be thrown into the pit, sold to Egypt, be thrown in jail and then receive it. If these two guys ever knew the process, I bet they would have thought twice about what they desired or rather what God desired for them.

While in the desert, the children of Israel are brought by the mount Sinai and they camped there many days. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Lord may bring you through the desert but He will not leave you in the dessert</span></strong>. That's why we always need to be reminded that we are <strong>nomadic people</strong>. If we stop somewhere, it will be just for a season and not forever. Someone once said, "<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">never build permanent decisions on temporary circumstances</span></strong>" As nomadic people, we are always packed up so that we can pass over. It's easy to settle at a place where you don't fight anymore, the same case with the Israelites, peacefully sitting by the mountain. God then says, <strong>"You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward"</strong> meaning it's time to make a stand and move forward. Yes I brought you to this mountain but this was part of the process to get you ready for the promise land. I know how I struggle with this at times because I tend to be too territorial when I know for sure that God was just using something as a bridge. He will bring me to certain places just to rest and then move me to the next level. He wants me to go Northward as there is something about Northwards, it's in His plan. Going forward would mean fighting our way through, as you read down in the same chapter, you see how they begun to fight many enemies before they possessed. They were not told that they would fight but that was part of the process.

“<em>Lord I don't know where I am at this point but I know that I need to move forward, some of the things I ever trusted you with Lord, you want to accomplish them in me. Lord speak through your word to cause me to take a stand and move Northwards and may you accomplish what you have started in me. Your word says, “<strong>being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;”, Philippians 1:6</strong>. I know how territorial I can be and how this causes my faith to be dormant but when I know that I am still on the move, I will trust you to take me to the next place (level) for Your glory”.</em> It will be tough when you know that what you have accomplished is not the end but the middle as that was part of His process to accomplish His purpose. Maybe His process is to build you up in ministry, singing, intercession, strong in the word, walking with Him etc,. <strong>If He promised, sure enough He will accomplish it but the question is, CAN YOU STAND THE PROCESS? Blessings Ev</strong>.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 5:1-11, "...Master we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your Word, I will let down the net" </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images12.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6294 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images12.jpg" alt="images" width="236" height="275" /></a></strong>

Peter and his friends were professional fishermen, their life occupation. They knew fish seasons and where to fish as experts. On this particular night, they caught nothing having fished all night long. The morning come, they were disappointed and all they can do was wash their nets. Customers were going to expect fish, they needed to make money, they needed to feed their families. I can imagine them pondering over what they will tell the people. In simple, their normal, daily routine had been interrupted and brought to a halt. Have you ever be at a place where everything you knew how to do at your job or at home all of a sudden was interrupted and those looking up to you were disappointed in you? Hang on, help is on the way.

Jesus came by and was teaching the word of God. He had great multitude listening to Him teach. Great thing about Him, He comes right when there is a need. In as much as people need a touch from Him, everyone has a different need and my need may not be yours. He saw a boat and requested to use as a pulpit to preach.<!--more--> Peter was asked to move the boat closer to the shore and he faithfully did it even in the midst of his disappointments. Jesus wanted to do something big and so He prepares everyone by teaching them. It is not mentioned to us as what He was teaching on, perhaps “faith”. Peter must have been listening carefully for the bible says in <strong>Romans 10:17, "… faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord". </strong>After Jesus did the Kingdom's work, He tells Peter to launch into the deep, meaning cast his nets again in the same place he had tried fishing last night. Listen to his response "<strong>Master we have toiled all night and caught nothing; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">nevertheless at Your Word, I will let down the net</span>"</strong>. It's easier to hear the word, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">try another place</span><strong>” </strong>but to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">try the same place???.</span> Yes you might have tried surviving in the same job and you already lost hope and instead of Him telling you to move on, He tells you to cast your nets again. You may have applied for a promotion and nothing has come through because of frustrations, instead of Him telling you to move out, He is telling you to cast your nets again in the same position. <strong>It's not about what we know, what we can do or qualified to do, it's about what God can do when we can't do it. </strong>It's being obedient to the word of God to the point where you do as He has said regardless of what you know. It may never make sense but the key word is “<strong>be obedient</strong>”. After all, many things that God say don't make sense and if you tried to make sense out of them, you will never get anywhere because while you are busy making sense out of them, your blessings will be passing you by.

Peter's obedience moved the Lord to provide the biggest catch in his history of fishing. He began to call on his friends to come out and help pull the nets which proves <strong>Proverbs 10:22, "The blessings of the Lord maketh rich and adds no sorrows with it". </strong>The blessings of the Lord overtakes as the bible continues to say <strong>“try me and see if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour you out blessings that you will not have enough room to contain all of them</strong>”. What I'm I saying? Y<span style="text-decoration:underline;">our place of misery could be your place of blessings</span><strong>, </strong>but you have to have the faith and take Him at His word. Had Peter explained how professional he was, and how he had done this for many years and refused just to apply the simply instruction, the blessing would have passed him by.

While this miracle is big, the message is not in the miracle, the message is in the bigger picture of what Christ would do through Peter by faith to bring souls into the kingdom. Even when the Lord blesses His children, there is always a bigger picture yet to be revealed. In short, the blessing is bigger than us all, its way more than for us.

If God still gives you grace to deal with something that you really would like to give up on, keep on standing and launching out in the deep. You have come too far to go back, you have gone too deep to fail. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 1:12, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right (power) to become children of God, to those who believe in His name:" </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6300" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong>

Ever had those days you just couldn't function effectively like you should? Before day break, you are tossing on your bed back and forth wondering what the day will bring. Previous days were tough and your conclusion is, <em>“today will present the same if not worse</em>”. Fear has gripped your heart and you just can't seem to get past it and move on. Don't fret for God is present in the situation with a solution. In school we would give the teacher the right answers to math question only to learn that he was interested in how we arrived at the answer more than the right answer. Most of the time the answer was right but we couldn’t tell the teacher how we arrived at it because we cheated. The process to get to that answer is more important than the answer itself. So praying that God would lead you to that destination is better than praying, God let me find myself there.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">POWER is authority, ability, right, strength, control, influence etc</span></strong>. At the point of believing, you are given rights you did not posses before the conversion. <!--more-->That right (power) is the energy one receives to do greater things they couldn't do without it. God empowers His people, in other words, gives them ability, right, strength to influence their day to day living. <strong>2Timothy 1:7, "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of POWER..." </strong>Give anyone power and they will function even more. In job or leadership positions, people are not respected much because they are people, they are respected because of their ranks (positions). Their ranks give them power to rule. The officers have power to enforce laws because of their given positions and ranks. If you are stopped, their badge is what shows you that they have power to do what is right.  If you go against it, that badge will stop your mouth from saying, "<em>You cannot do nothing to me</em>". <strong>"As many as received Him, to them gave ye POWER to become",1. A child and 2. As a child, an overcomer"</strong>. Your rank and position gives you the Power to overcome the world, the flesh and the devil.

As long as you have the power, you will lay and sleep, <strong>Psalms 3:3-8, "5 I But You, O Lord, are a shield for me, My glory and the One who lifts up my head.4 I cried to the Lord with my voice, And He heard me from His holy hill. Selah 5 I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustained me. </strong><strong>6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around”. Psalms 23:4, "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You (My POWER) are with me; Your rod and Your Stuff (badge), they comfort me". </strong>Only God can empower you and I to become what we couldn't be by ourselves and with that power, we can face and conquer fear, doubts, difficulties, and life obstacles. Often times we face the day without wearing our uniform and putting on that badge to give us power and that is why Paul writes to the Romans in <strong>Romans 13:14, "</strong><strong>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts". </strong>Without the uniform, we are exposing ourselves to stuff we could overcome if we wore our uniform otherwise we are vulnerable to attacks. Purpose in your heart to wake up, take the power given to you through prayer and His word, put it on, have your badge in a place where it can be seen and face the day under His POWER that works within you (<strong>Ephesians 3:20</strong>). Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 14:14, "If you ask anything in My name, I will do it."</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6307" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images2.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong>

It's nearly impossible to tell someone <em>"I know how you feel</em>" in a tough situation when you have not gone through it yourself. Often mistake made is encouraging someone who has either lost a dear one and say words from no experience of your own. If you have not gone through it or similar, you do not know how it feels. The best way to respond in my judgement is to say something like this <em>"I don't know how it feels but I want to let you know I care</em>". The good encouragers are the ones who have had a taste of it and can stand and encourage.

For God to create, He only had to speak, to redeem, Christ had to suffer<strong>.</strong> There are many things that accompany Jesus' life here on earth. We know His main mission was to come and die on the cross to save mankind. And while He was here, He also taught, healed, raised the dead, raised leaders etc. He became a person (Man) to identify with us. <strong>You cannot redeem what related to</strong>. <!--more-->Christ had to relate to us, bring Himself to our level yet without sin then redeem us. He was here on earth 100%God and 100% Man. Living a normal human life. He was tempted like any other man, was moved when He lost His friend Lazarus, rejected by men, lied on, hated by many, got hungry, denied, had no place to live and call His own, experienced hardships, experienced exhaustion, emotionally drained, became a servant, beaten, spat on, stripped naked, crucified on the cross etc. When Jesus says to me, <strong>"I know how it feels son</strong>", I know He does, <strong>He has been there</strong>.

Here comes the good report, after resurrection, He ascended into heaven. Before then He tells His disciples, <strong>John 14:14, "If you ask anything in My name, I will do it." </strong>Why do we pray in "Jesus name" and not in "Father’s name" directly? Jesus said, when you pray, pray in my name. Well the Father has never been flesh and blood, yes He is God but He has never reduced Himself to the level of men to feel what men feels. In the old testament they did not have abounding GRACE like we do, they did not have the level of mercy we have in the NT. All these came more as a result of Jesus experience, the ultimate sacrifice. We offer prayers to God the Father through Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus takes our prayers and presents them to Father in a way we could never do. It’s like a child who has picked flowers for his dad, he gives them to his mother and the mother preps them in a way they look presentable and gives them to the father saying, “from your son”. Jesus having been here on earth prays on our behalf when we ask something like this, "<em>Father, I know how it feels to be in their position, do not destroy them, provide for them, let <strong>GRACE</strong> and <strong>MERCY</strong> plead for them”</em>. When I pray in Jesus name, Jesus presents my case to the Father as an experienced God/Man because He has been there (both sides).

<strong>Proverbs 18:10, "The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous run to it and are safe</strong>". Praying in His name is a reminder that you are supported by a strong tower. You are safe under that name when Jesus the High Priest, seated at the right hand of God the Father is interceding for us. <strong>Romans 8:34, "Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">who also makes intercession for us".</span></strong> Anything desired in accordance with His will is released under Jesus’ name (signature, label). If we ask God through His Son's name, Jesus puts His seal of approval. Go through the one who knows your feelings. Be blessed Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:1-2 “1 I Am the True Vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6312" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images3.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

The foundational principles for knowing and living in the will of God as a Christian is to abide in Christ and bear fruit. <strong>Acts 17:28 </strong>reads<strong> "for in Him we live and move and have our being"</strong> a summary of <strong>John 15</strong> in my judgment. <strong>John 15</strong> is one of the most important chapters in all the Bible, it has wealth of treasure we will look at in the next few postings.

The opening of <strong>John 15</strong> begins with one of the Jesus’ “I AM” statements. These statements distinguished Him from others who may have used some of these metaphors He used to describe Himself. In this “I AM” statement, He wants us to understand who He is, who we are and the connection we have to the Father through Him. Jesus is encouraging His disciples as they know His time on earth was drawing near, crucifixion and ascension were not far from this time.

<!--more-->In the nature of this relationship, Jesus begins  by saying vs. “<strong>1 </strong><strong>I AM the True Vine…”</strong> , God the Father as the vine dresser (Gardner) and the believers are the branches. Jesus distinguishes Himself from any other vines. He acknowledged that there were vines, He stands alone as the True Vine which means “genuine.” Jesus is the final, real “vine,” (last Adam) as compared to Israel, a type foreshadowing the reality. Israel is called God’s “vine” or “vineyard” in the Old Testament (<strong>Psalms 80:8–16; Jeremiah 2:21</strong>). Israel is judged for not bearing fruit and Jesus does what the type signified. In the same vs. He tells us that God is the gardener who is not looking for branches but fruit

To describe the <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Nature of our relationship</span></strong> to Him He<strong> says Vs. “2 Every branch <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in Me</span> that does not bear fruit He takes away; …”</strong> Jesus desires for us to know that even though we will not see Him, we are as closely connected to Him as the branches of a vine are connected to its stem<strong>, “for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring.’”,</strong> <strong>Acts 17:28. </strong>Believers are called to bear fruit, production is of God,<strong> Philippians 2:12-13. </strong>Our source of life and spiritual fruit is not in ourselves; it is outside of us. Our life is hidden in Christ Jesus. Those who abide in Christ, the true vine are inspected by the Father (the vine dresser) for fruits. What kind? Good fruit <strong>Galatians 5:22-23, Matthew 3:8-10, Matthew 7:16-20. </strong>The well spring of righteousness flows from Christ, the Living Water. A believer who has the root of righteousness will "<strong>bear fruit</strong>”, the fruit is an evidence of growth. The fruit tells you more about the condition of the soil and the roots. We live rightly, and serve Him effectively only if we are rightly connected to Him in a faith/love relationship, <strong>Philippians 1:6, Colossians 1:10.</strong>

The process is<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Fruitful Growth in the Faith, </span>“…and every branch that bears fruit He PRUNES, that it may bear MORE fruit”. </strong>Every branch that is pruned will be like what<strong> 2Peter 1:8</strong> says<strong> “8 For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ”. </strong>Majority are stuck at bearing fruit, the Lord wants us to bear more fruit and the way to bear more fruit is by pruning.

Pruning is the practice of removing diseased, non-productive, or otherwise unwanted portions from a plant. The purpose of pruning is to shape the plant by controlling or directing plant growth, to maintain the health of the plant and increase the yield or quality of fruits. Pruning requires cutting back, cleaning, removing dead leaves for a reason (setbacks). Pruning makes you grow more in faith, patience, love, joy, peace, grace, prayer, His word, reaching the lost. Cutting back is most necessary because it propels you to grow more and more under what you would call adversities. Cutting back is not meant to destroy but build, it means the branch through the vine has potentials to grow more if pruned. How can we abide on the true vine and remain the same?

Proper pruning is as much a skill as it is an art, since badly pruned plants can become diseased or grow in undesirable ways but the Lord is the Master in pruning. He knows how best to prune each of us so as to bear more fruit and much fruit. David says, <strong>Psalm 119:71, "It is good for me that I have been afflicted (pruned), That I may learn (grow) Your statutes". </strong>Pruning can either make you or break you depending on how you respond to it.

I believe Jesus was speaking these words as he prepared His disciples for perilous times. Not long after this did Peter hear from Jesus letting him know that Satan had desired to sift (prune) his as wheat. The Lord allowed the pruning process even through an agent of destruction who had limited access to what he could do to him because Christ was in control.

Without a strong foundation where virtue, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, kindness are ingredients in your life, your growth is in jeopardy and pruning is the remedy for your growth. Only the skillful gardener knows what you need and does it for His own glory. To continue Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

I've seen this in my life recently and it is building my confidence in God's power. God doesn't allow satan to unleash total fury upon us during seasons of suffering and makes it so that we can bear it. I am so grateful for seasons of pruning. It hurts but it has so much purpose.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:3-5, “3 </strong><strong>You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you 4. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. 5 “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6317" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images4.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="241" /></a></strong>In this vs. Jesus wants His disciples to be reminded of their salvation and He uses the word “already clean”. This cleansing is effected through hearing, believing, and obeying the Word. The Word tells us what to do that we may be cleansed and saved. The word of Christ is spoken to all believers; and there is a cleansing virtue in that Word, as it works grace, and works out corruption. We have been purged from the guilt and power of sin, moved from the wild vine and grafted into the New True Vine.

Those who have repented and trusted in Christ alone for eternal salvation are already clean (made holy); the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, <strong>Romans 1:16, Romans 11:16, “For if the first fruit is holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches”</strong>.<!--more--> Believers are born of water and the Spirit <strong>John 3:5.</strong> The water here is not baptism but cleansing (regeneration). <strong>Titus 3:5, “not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit</span>”. </strong>Christ cleansed first before He could indwell, <strong>Romans 6:6, Leviticus 15:13, Ezekiel 36:25.</strong>

When you talk about sanctification, Jesus washing the disciples feet brought this to light, <strong>John 13:4-10, “8 Peter said to Him, “You shall never wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me</span>.” 9 Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head “10 Jesus said to him, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">“He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you</span>” </strong>The significance of washing their feet was to remind them that they were already clean even though their feet were dirty to show His continuous cleansing and not for regeneration. Salvation is a one-time act of justification by faith, but the lifelong process of sanctification is one of washing from the stain of sin we experience as we walk through the dusty world, <strong>Ephesians 5:6. </strong>This is the Comfort believers have, they are already clean in regeneration, and feet are cleaned in sanctification.

<strong>John 15:4, “Abide in Me, and I in you…”. </strong>If we are saved by grace, you must also be kept by grace. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Salvation is of the Lord</span>, the Father draws us to the Vine (the Son).<strong> “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him…”, John 6:44,  John 13:8-9. </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The keeping power is of the Lord</span>, vs.4 “…<strong>. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me”  Romans 11:</strong> <strong>18 </strong>strengthens this point when it says<strong>, “do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you”. </strong>And the more fruit we bring forth, the more we abound in what is good because our life depends on it, <strong>“…He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing” </strong>

To be fruitful, we must abide/remain in Christ, have union with Him by faith (relationship/fellowship), constantly keep up our dependence upon Christ, and communion with Him (<strong>Galatians 4). </strong>To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:7-8, “7 If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. 8 By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images5.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6321" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images5.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

I constantly run into believers seeking to know or discern the will of God. As I mentioned in part 1, <strong>John 15</strong> is one of the most important passages in the bible because it helps us discern the will of God for believers. In this posting we will look at discerning perceptive or revealed will of God and in the next posting we will look at closely at God's permissive or perfect will.

Before I address the two vs. above, we need to ask ourselves what does <strong>Mark 11:24</strong> mean? It reads,<strong> “Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them."</strong>  Its one of the most quoted and also highly abused vs. From looking at the vs. it sounds like a blank check does it not? “<em>God told me</em> <strong>"…whatever things you ask..."? </strong>This needs to be looked at in the light of who we are in Christ. We should be driven to have the mind of Christ, be imitators of Christ, and be conformed to the image of Christ.<!--more-->

Before salvation, most of our desires were wrong, selfish desires. Now in Christ, some of those still lingers and must be dealt with continuously in the light of our relations to the Vine. James puts us in check when he writes, <strong>"You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures", James 4:3</strong>. James says often times believers ask but they don't ask for the right things with the right attitude or in faith or the timing might be off, therefore they miss.

We can now look at<strong> John 15:7-8 </strong>to help us understand <strong>Mark 11:24,</strong> "<strong>whatever things you ask/desire when you pray</strong>." Indeed it is a blank check however we must know what it is for and how it works.  Look at the starting point, "<strong>if you abide in me and my words abide in you</strong>...", the end result, "<strong>bearing fruit for the Father's glory</strong>". If we abide in Him, our will, our desires, our drives are conformed to His. His desires becomes our desires. His desire is that we bear fruit. If we ask for things that will make us grow and bear fruit, more fruit and much fruit, He will grant those to us.

Jesus said, “<strong>But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you", Matthew 6:33</strong>. Mark the word "<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">added</span></strong>" not "<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">given</span></strong>" because His kingdom is priority. What does the kingdom of God entail, <strong>Romans 13:17-18, "17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men</strong>".  We ought to seek to be more righteous, more peaceable and more joyous, (summary of the fruit of the Spirit in <strong>Galatians 5:22)</strong>, because they hinge upon these three. Those who desire and serves Christ on these are acceptable to God and approved by men.

"<strong>Whatever you ask when you pray..."</strong> is more about changing us than changing things. Jesus said, <strong>"Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.”, John 6:27</strong>. Paul echoes with these words, "<strong>If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God", Colossians 3:1-3</strong>.

Solomon's prayer when God spoke to him in a dream is a great example of discerning His will. <strong>1Kings 3:5.</strong> Solomon was given a blank check to ask for anything, he asked for wisdom to discern (the mind of Christ). He said, “<strong>Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”, 1Kings 3:9.</strong> Solomon who penned these words <strong>"The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable", Proverbs 10:32 </strong>knew what to ask for and God added other things he did not ask for because his priority was God’s priority for him.

This is how we should think and pray <strong>Mark 11:24</strong> by keeping to heart <strong>John 15:7-8</strong> with a great example of Solomon's prayer in <strong>1Kings 3</strong>. It always boils down to what we desire. Will the desire make us more imitators, mind like and conformed to the image of Christ or to our own? Let’s keep this in mind, what we pray for the most will reveal what we desire the most. David had a simple prayer in <b>Psalm 25 (show me, teach me, guide me in Your truth and keep me). </b>To continue, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:7-8, “7 If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. 8 By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples” </strong>

<a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images6.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6330" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images6.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="195" /></a>

God’s will that we see in the Bible is His permissive or perfect will (<strong>1Thessalonians 4:3,  1Thessalonians 5:18, Psalm 143:10).  </strong>To discern the will of God we must KNOW, THINK, PRAY and ACT biblically. These two vs. will be our foundation, <strong>Romans 12:1-2, “1 Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God--this is your spiritual act of worship. 2 Do not <span style="text-decoration:underline;">CONFORM</span> any longer to the pattern of this world, but be <span style="text-decoration:underline;">TRANSFORMED</span> by the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">RENEWING</span> of your mind. Then you will be able to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">TEST</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">APPROVE</span> what God's will is--his <span style="text-decoration:underline;">GOOD</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">PLEASING</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">PERFECT WILL</span>”(NIV). </strong>CONFORMED is to act or be in accord or be in agreement with something, in this case the world (<strong>Psalm 1, Romans 8:7, Colossians 1:21). </strong>TRANSFORMED on the other hand is to change the nature, function or condition. Other word suitable is to convert.<!--more-->

We do not need improvement, we need transformation. When we come to Christ, our old nature is not improved, it is changed, made new (transformed), <strong>2Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new</strong>".  Another picture to consider, God showed Jeremiah in the potter’s house how He <strong>"…made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make", Jeremiah 18:4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>As you read the chapter, you come to learn how the potter did not improve the existing vessel, He took the same broken clay conformed to this world and transformed it into another vessel<strong>.</strong>

I find these keys to be very important in knowing the will of God, Wisdom, Discernment, Counsel. Abiding in Him and His words abiding in us there lies in the power to transform the mind. The word of God is the wisdom of God<strong>, Colossians 1:9-10, “9 For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may <span style="text-decoration:underline;">be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding</span>; 10 that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;</strong><strong>” </strong>

What is the point of praying for wisdom if God is going to tell us exactly what to do? The bible does not tell us exactly what to do in every situation as we read it. It gives us wisdom within His word to act on His permissive will with His guidance, <strong>Proverbs 3:5-6, “5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; </strong><strong>6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths”</strong>. A number say “<em>trust your heart”</em>, the truth is, you cannot trust your heart because it is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, <strong>Jeremiah 17:9, Deuteronomy 30:19 (NIV</strong><strong>). </strong>We must trust God through His sufficient word <strong>“</strong><strong>For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding; He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk uprightly; He guards the paths of justice, And preserves the way of His saints”, Proverbs 2:6-8, Proverbs 2:10-12, Proverbs 9:10, Proverbs 3:3-8.</strong>

The bible says<strong>, “He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful; And a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment, Because for every matter there is a time and judgment, …”, Ecclesiastes 8:5-6. </strong>Those seeking to know and love God must employ the word of God that gives knowledge, wisdom, ability to discern. Paul’s prayer, <strong> “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, that you may approve the things that are excellent,</span> that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ, being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God”, Philippians 1:9 -11, 1Corinthians 2:12.</strong>

Walking in wisdom means knowing, thinking, praying and acting biblically in everything we do such as who to marry, where to live, work, raise children, serving the Lord. This calls for God to show us, teach us, guide us (<strong>Psalm 25:4-5)</strong> in counting the cost, surrounding ourselves with the right people (who know, think, pray and act biblically especially on big decisions), proving, testing all things in making decisions while trusting God to carry us through..

<em>“</em><em>The true mark of spirituality is when we desire to know and live according to the will of God as revealed in Scripture, and that can be summarized as “be holy for I am Holy” (1 Peter 1:15-16). Our responsibility is to obey the revealed will of God and not to speculate on what His hidden will for us might be. While we should seek to be “led by the Holy Spirit,” we must never forget that the Holy Spirit is primarily leading us to righteousness and to being conformed into the image of Christ so that our lives will glorify God. God calls us to live our lives by every word that proceeds from His mouth”,</em> Gotquestion.org

In all we desire to do we must constantly ask ourselves, is this going to bring glory to God or self? This is why we abide in Him, His words abide in us then with wisdom we know and learn what and how to ask. To continue, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:9-12, “9 As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. 10 If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love. 11 “These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full. 12 This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images7.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6333" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images7.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong>

In my experience in the last 15 years or so, songs about God’s love in different genres have been heard and sang. What I found strange is that majority of the lyrics left out the words like “God, Jesus, Son of God etc.) and you were left to somehow figure out if they were Christian God’s love song or not. Even some of the popular worship songs sound like thinly disguised teenage crush songs. When we think of God’s love, are we to think of boy/girl type of love type (hold me, kiss me, etc.)? Most of these songs are pampering love. God’s love is perfecting, persevering love. The disciples preached the love of God by preaching Christ crucified.

Jesus said<strong>, John 15:9 “As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love” </strong>We cannot be anything apart from Him, therefore love starts with the Father who loves His Son who extended that love unto us through His son,  <strong>1John 4:8, 1John 4:16. </strong>The Father the gardener loves the Vine (His Son), and the branches He prunes, He does it to align with His love for the Vine (His character, nature). <!--more-->His love was demonstrated by laying down His life, <strong>vs. 13. </strong>Abide in My love opens us to learn about His perfecting love not pampering love. This is the love we show the world, a love that has no partiality. The Fruit of the spirit begins with<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> LOVE</span></strong>, <strong>Galatians 5:22. </strong>Apostle Paul dedicates a whole 1Corinthians<strong> 13</strong> to tell us what love is and what it’s not. It’s in the light of this definition of love that other gifts may flower but love is the only power.  In summary, Love <strong>“bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things”, 1Corinthians 13:7.</strong>

<strong>John 15:10, “If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love” </strong>We are not justified by keeping the commandments, we are recognized by living in the light of them. The world tries to keep just enough commandments to enter the kingdom of God (<strong>Luke 18</strong>), as if to say there is a minimum requirement to graduate. Jesus calls for perfection (maximum) <strong>Matthew 5:48, </strong>a righteousness far beyond the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees who were considered the most righteous religious people who did the minimum for qualification. Jesus says to us all<strong>,</strong> “<strong>…, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven”, Matthew 5:20. </strong>This is impossible with men however in salvation God works in us to live in the light of what we fell short according to His perfecting love. To abide in His love by keeping commandments is to demonstrate our delight in the law of God<strong>. 1John 5:2-3,” 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His <span style="text-decoration:underline;">commandments are not burdensome</span>”.</strong>

To keep His commandments is to go an extra mile, a mile of excellence, <strong>Matthew 5:38-. </strong> In demonstrating what we are to our neighbors, Jesus gave the parable of a Good Samaritan in <strong>Luke 10</strong>. Jesus taught that His followers must demonstrate love to all kinds of people-no matter what faith, nationality, or personality-enemies included. Perfecting love goes outside the normal circle the world would demonstrate their love. Loving those who love us is easy and even unbelievers already do that. Jesus called us to love our enemies, forgive them, pray for them, that is an extra mile of excellence. This is what makes believers different, demonstrating to the world that we belong to Jesus and our lives are hidden in Him and we are a result of who He is in us. Paul in <strong>Galatians 2:20</strong> says he lives but not him but Christ lives in him to show he can become what he could not be to others because of the new nature of relationship he has with Christ. It's only through the power of God's Spirit that His people can truly love and pray for those who intend to do them harm (<strong>Romans 12:14-21</strong>).The commandments of Jesus were not to be obeyed in the spirit of bondmen, but in that of friends.

<strong>John 15:11, “These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full”. </strong>The second item of the fruit of the Spirit is <strong>JOY</strong>, <strong>Romans 15:13, “Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit</strong>.” Joy is the fruit of a right relation with God, God is for our JOY. <strong>Psalm 104:31</strong> speaks of God Himself rejoicing in His creative works. <strong>Isaiah 65:18</strong> speaks of God rejoicing over His redeemed people who will be to Him. A person who walks with the Lord can continue to rejoice even when troubles come<strong>, John 16:</strong><strong>33, “These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will[a] have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” </strong>To continue, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:13-17, “Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends. 14 You are My friends if you do whatever I command you. 15 No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you. 16 You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you. 17 These things I command you, that you love one another.”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friendship-pictures-quotes_18053-5.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6339" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friendship-pictures-quotes_18053-5.png?w=277" alt="friendship-pictures-quotes_18053-5" width="277" height="300" /></a></strong>

Every day we hear the word “LOVE” expressed in a number of ways (people, food, clothes, movies etc.). A musician at the end of his concert would conclude with something like this “I love you all” which may mean little or nothing. If we are to understand love, we have to get the biblical definition that both Christ and Paul give us.

There are three types of love we see in the bible Eros love, Philos love and Agape love not to be confused. I will only address Agape love which fits perfectly with this chapter. Agape love is what God commanded all believers to have for everyone (believers or not). Agape love should never be determined by our feelings; it is more of a set of behaviors or actions. With agape, you do not have to actually feel it for you to give it, which means that you can be able to show love without feeling anything at all. At times feelings can follow after showing this kind of love but they are not the defining factor. Agape love is a demonstrative love, its love in action.<!--more-->

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Greater love lays down His life for His friends:</span></strong> <strong>John 15:13, “Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends”. </strong>Jesus demonstrated love in a greater way by laying down His life. This is considered the outworking love<strong>. </strong>John in his 1<sup>st</sup> epistle says <strong>“16 By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren”.  </strong>By these words our Lord shows how far love to another should extend, even to the laying down of our lives for the brethren; which is the highest instance of love among men; (<strong>1John 3:16, Ephesians 5:1-2, Romans 5:8). </strong>Jesus also demonstrated love when He washed His disciples’ feet. He stripped Himself of His garments, went down on his knees and took care of part of the body most of us would want to avoid coming in contact with, <strong>John 13. </strong>This is demonstrative love He led by example.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Greater love calls for obedience:</span></strong><strong> John 15:14, “ You are My friends if you do whatever I command you”. </strong>In<strong> Ephesians 5, </strong>Paul gives us in details what it means to follow God’s commands. His opening<strong> vs. “1 Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. 2 And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma”. </strong>He then in details help us understand what it means to Walk in Love, Walk in Light, and Walk in Wisdom. You are a friend of Jesus when you love, forgive, care for those Jesus loves, forgives, cares for etc. because you have been instructed<strong>. <a title="1Peter 1:22" href="http://biblia.com/books/esv/1Pe1.22" target="_blank">1Peter 1:22</a>, <a title="1Peter 3:8" href="http://biblia.com/books/esv/1Pe3.8" target="_blank">1Peter 3:8</a>, <a title="1Peter 4:8" href="http://biblia.com/books/esv/1Pe4.8" target="_blank">1Peter 4:8</a>. </strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Greater love defines the nature of relationship:</span></strong><strong> John 15:15, “No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you”.  </strong>We are not sons (friends) of God by RIGHT but by ADOPTION. Adoption is the giving to any one the name and place and privileges of a son who is not a son by birth, <strong>Ephesians 1:3-6. </strong>A son by adoption might not be heir of the property, whereas a son by birth certainly is, we are born again as sons/friends.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Greater love reaches out first and empowers to serve:</span></strong> <strong>John 15:16, “You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain” </strong>Many claim to have chosen Christ, that is not true. He chose us, and we responded to His choosing. We love Him because He first loved us; we know Him because He knew us first. We serve because He was the first to serve, <strong>Mark 9:35, “And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, “If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all. Galatians 5:13, “… but through love serve one another. 14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” </strong>None of us can be anything apart from His effectual work in us.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Greater love seeks to give access to His friends</span></strong><strong>: John 15:16, “… that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you”</strong> God has blessed us with every spiritual blessings in high places because He has adopted us through Jesus Christ to Himself. We have access to the throne of grace because of His finished work on the cross. <strong>Romans 8:14-17, “14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">these are sons of God </span> 15, For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">but you received the Spirit of adoption</span> by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father”</strong>

We love because He first loved us, <strong>John 15:9 “As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. 10 If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love.” </strong>Therefore Laying down your life would be a heavy price to give up; the payoff is personal growth and the opportunity to develop a wonderful and supportive relationship of Christ to others. Love is duty, (sacrificial) <strong>1Corinthians 13:7 Love "… bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things." </strong>When you live his love out loud, it shows that Jesus is real. Practical Christian lives points to the reality that Christ is real, and the Savior of the world. Let us love in deed and in truth, <strong>Hebrews 10:24, “And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works”; 1 John 3:18, “My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but indeed and in truth.” </strong>To continue, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Judges 6 "12 When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, The Lord is With You Mighty Warrior." …Vs. 25 That same night the LORD said to him, "Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. 26 Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering."</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images8.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6379" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images8.jpg?w=300" alt="images" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong>

What was the Lord doing here? The Lord first dealt with Gideon’s identity, then he spoke of the promise of His presence with Gideon, and now God is helping him to begin to make practical changes in his life so that he can be displayed as the mighty warrior that God called him to be. God first instructs Gideon to tear down his father’s altar to Baal. Baal worship was popular, however, Gideon knew he was risking his life by obeying the Lord. Gideon was pulling down strongholds and dealing with the influence of idolatry in his life<strong>. 2Corinthians 10:4 states, "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds</strong>" This was a stronghold in his life, even though there is no mention that he himself worshipped this idol, I imagine that he did as his father’s idol.  He had heard stories about the power of God, but most likely really worshipped Baal as was taught to him. Yet God was not going to allow him to continue to magnify, promote, and worship this idol. <!--more-->This idol, (stronghold) was being ripped down and a new one would replace it. God Has made Himself known as a <strong>stronghold (Psalm 48:3)</strong>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Francis Frangipane </span>describes a spiritual stronghold as a collection of thoughts that can influence a nation, a city, a family, or an individual. Here God is having Gideon set up a new stronghold, and that is the Lord Himself. He set up an altar to the Lord, not a "statue of the Lord". Why did God do this, well let’s look to a clip from a Superman Comic Book Issue #58.

In the comic books, Superman's father, Jor-El, once noted, "that when a native Kryptonian (Superman’s planet) is elsewhere, free of Krypton's unique atmosphere and tremendous gravitational pull, he becomes a superman. But superman actually once on earth received his power from the unique ultra solar rays that penetrate Earth day and night. The father Jor-El spoke words of truth about the destiny concerning his son. Listen to what God the Father said about His Son. And a voice from heaven said, "<strong>This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." Matthew 3:17</strong>

Kryptonite (the substance of the world Superman came from weakened his powers)<strong> “Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world”, 1John 2:15-17. “ The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus</strong>”, <strong>Romans 6:23. </strong>Sin has a pull on our lives if we allow it to. It must therefore be displaced. "<strong>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death”</strong>. Just as the law of aerodynamics displaces the law of gravity so does the law of the spirit displace the law of sin and death, because of the Power of Christ. That is why Jesus said in <strong>Acts 1:8, "But you shall receive power, after the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” </strong>Superman was empowered by the S-U-N, and we are to be empowered by the S-O-N!  <strong>Luke 23:44-46, “44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, 45 for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. 46 Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit."</strong> When he had said this, he breathed his last. Only one SUN / Son can shine at a time. When the Son was shinning, the Sun had to cease from shinning.

As a Christian you have like Superman left planet Krypton (the world) as you were born in sin. What is kryptonite to you (the sinful temptations of the world)? Lex Luthur (Superman’s enemy) always would place kryptonite in the presence of Superman to weaken him. When the enemy places kryptonite (sinful temptations) in front of you to influence you, use the power of the SON to overcome the temptations of this world as he always provides a way of escape from temptation (<strong>1Corinthians 10:31</strong>)

Superman had a mission to save the world from evil against the enemies. As a Christian you have a mission to seek and save the lost through the power of the SON (Holy Spirit).

Application: Be a superman (superwomen) for God. Fly strong for Christ. Watch out for kryptonite (temptations) from planet krypton (the world), be empowered by the sun (SON), and be serious about your mission.Blessings,Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 56:8, “Thou hast taken account of my wanderings; put my tears in Thy bottle; are {they} not in Thy book?" NAS. </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6382" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo.jpg" alt="memo" width="236" height="183" /></a></strong>

As you search the church history, you'll find people who have been greatly used of God have been men and women of prayer. They've learned to wait in the secret place of prayer allowing God to impart His heart to them. They've been people whose hearts have been passionate for the [same] things which God is passionate about.

George Mueller began orphanages for children in Bristol during the 1899s. He trusted God to meet their every need. He never asked for money, but he clothed, housed and fed many thousands of children. Near the end of his life he said that every person for whom he had prayed to come to Christ (with the exception of two), had come to know Christ as his Savior. After Mueller died, those two people also came to a personal knowledge of Christ.<!--more-->

David Brainard ministered among Indian tribes in the Northeastern part of the United States during the 1700s. It was said of him that the snow would melt underneath him because he prayed so long for the Indians. He was God's instrument to bring many to the knowledge of the Savior.

When our hearts beat in harmony with God’s heart, He will do incredible things to bring to pass those things for which we have prayed. God’s heart breaks for a lost and dying world. When our hearts feel the same burden, we will cry unto Him and He will hear and answer us. The Psalmist said, "<strong>Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy. He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him" (Psalm 126:5, 6 NIV).</strong>

When a mother weeps for a rebellious son, it touches God’s heart. When a father cries to God for His fallen children, it moves heaven to earth. When young people are broken over their schoolmates' salvation, the Spirit of God is released from heaven to capture that school for Christ. God holds dear to His heart the tears of His children.

God has a bottle where He stores our tears; a book where He records our heartaches. As we weep for those who are without Christ, we must never forget that God has not forgotten. One day, in His time, He will open the heavens and pour out a blessing upon us that's beyond imagination.

A pastor recently told me when his church put in new carpet for their prayer room, he made a special request of the Lord. He said, "<em>Oh God, I pray that this carpet will be dedicated to You by the tears of your people</em>." Not long afterwards, his prayers were answered. The church had a series of "revival meetings" with Life Action Ministries. God moved during those days, and the prayer room was filled with people weeping in brokenness and repentance over their sins.

Tears touch the heart of God. He understands the hurts of humanity because He gave His own Son for those injured by their own sins. Perhaps the shortest and most powerful Scripture in the Bible is the one that simply says, <strong>"Jesus wept." </strong>If God in human flesh wept, then we'll also weep when we grasp His heart. If you find yourself weeping for the souls of man, remember God is storing your tears in a bottle. One day, He will open that bottle, and out of it will flow "rivers of living waters."

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 15:18-19, "18 </strong><strong>If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you. 19 “If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6385" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo1.jpg?w=300" alt="memo" width="300" height="200" /></a></strong>

In the early verses of this chapter, Jesus talked to His disciples of the nature of His relationship to them. Towards the end, He turns to address the disciples’ relationship to the world. His relationship to His disciples was that of love and of friendship. In addressing them in vs 18, He would have them understand that the world's relationship to them will be the opposite of His. He uses a strong word "hate” which means a deep and emotional extreme dislike. It is often associated with feelings of anger, disgust and a disposition towards hostility. Hate by biblical definition is murder at heart something we are not to have as His friends.<!--more-->

He said<strong> "18 </strong>If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you". We have to understand that in this world, believers will not be treated any better. In fact Jesus from birth was already hated and wanted dead. This started with King Herod, Jesus presence threatened his kingdom. Throughout His earthly life there were those who truly loved Him, those who pretended to love Him, and those who out rightly hated Him with a passion. He was disliked by His family members, hated in His home town, hated for doing good on a Sabbath. Hated for hanging out with tax collectors, prostitutes, lepers. They wanted to stone Him for declaring that He is God from above. He was labeled a drunker; His miracle powers were accredited to Satan. They shouted Hosanna to Him one day, a week later they cried crucify Him. Judas Iscariot hated Him so much that he was willing to take anything to betray Him. They were willing to have one man who was a rebel, a thief and murderer released and have the sinless, humble, perfect Son of God crucified because of their hatred for Him, and the list continues. Jesus echoing words prophesied in <strong>Psalm 35:19</strong> says in <strong>John 15:25, "they hated Me without a cause". </strong>He went through all these and yet prayed that they would be forgiven.

If the world hated Him, be reminded it still hates Him today and His friends. In some countries predominantly in the Middle East hate Christians with a passion and are doing everything to wipe out Christians in those countries. Extreme Islamic terrorists have waged war on Christians. Recently in Egypt it was reported that Christians were murdered because of their faith. From my home country Kenya around147 were killed less than a month ago because they professed to be Christians. In Nigeria, Kenya and other parts of the world, churches have been bombed during worship services. We get newsletters telling stories of persecution in South Sudan, India in the hands of Hindus, China and other parts of the world. Here in America we hear hatred from the media, internet postings, and some leaders. Christians are labeled intolerant for standing for truth regarding sanctity of life, marriages, championing for morality, the gospel. Christians are hated for their message, even falsely accused and the reason is simple they first hated Him and His message<strong>. </strong>Believers are citizens of another country therefore they would not be loved in the present world.<strong>  </strong>We are not greater than our Master who was hated yet He was not of this world neither are His friends the believers, vs<strong>. </strong>19 “If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you". We take comfort that He knows what His friends are going through; He has been there and more so to the extreme.

What makes our message different? It’s the gospel of love, God is love, He demonstrated it by sending His Son to die for our sins. We love because He first loved and laid down His life. Without love we are considered murderers, <strong>1John 3:15, “ Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him”.</strong> <strong>Luke 6:27, “But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you”</strong>. Our message is that of hope, it’s a message that calls us to go an extra mile of excellence, it’s a message of forgiveness. Jesus on the Sermon on the Mount called us blessed<strong>, “11 “Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. 12 Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you”, Matthew 5:11-12. </strong>Jesus also in<strong> Matthew 10:22 </strong>said<strong>, “And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">But he who endures to the end will be saved.</span>” </strong>This is a message if endurance.<strong> Matthew 24:9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake.”</strong>

Our blessed hope<strong>, “7 … we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. 8 We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed— 10 always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. 11 For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh”, 2Corinthians 4:7-11. </strong>They hated Him without a cause, expect to be hated the same way, but what a friend we have in Jesus, nothing can compare…Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Numbers 33:2, "And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the Lord: And these are their journeys according to their going out"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6388" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo2.jpg?w=300" alt="memo" width="300" height="185" /></a></strong>

Many people record many things in this life. In looking at the Guinness book of world records you will discover that it records some of the craziest things that people have done.

Moses recorded all the places that Israel pitched their tents. Each place had its ups and downs, positives and negatives, yet they pitched their tents anyhow. Think for a moment of the Tabernacle of Witness, which had as its purpose to be in the middle of tribes as a witness of God’s presence as they traveled. <strong>John 1:14</strong> states, that Jesus Christ became <strong>"tabernacle among us</strong>". And what was further written of the life of Christ was that He would bring redemption paid for by His blood. Why, because His mission was to seek and to save the lost.<!--more-->

Is our mission any different? Now the whole being the Redeemer of Israel could only go to Christ, but His mission of seeking and saving the lost is still ours as a continuation of what He began. We need to go in the power of the Holy Spirit obeying the mission so that Heaven’s recordings of our lives show that we pitched our tents and shared the gospel with the lost on our way to the Promised Land of Heaven.

What will be written of you or what do you think has been written already about your pitching your tent to reach the unsaved? We are called to be living epistles read of by men. <strong>"You are our epistle (letter) written in our hearts, known and read of all men...written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart", 2Corinthians 3:2-3. </strong>Our very lives in Christ are results of God’s grace upon us giving us salvation instead of condemnation.

We have therefore become a letter for all to read, we are walking testimonials. But to bring balance let us NEVER FORGET that we are called to be <strong>"living letters" </strong>called to speak the word and truth of God, (<strong>Romans 10:13-15</strong>), because "they" can’t hear unless you speak. Now does your walk match your talk, that is to say live a godly lifestyle, but don’t take a vow of silence! Ray Comfort speaks of "<strong>monasteries without walls</strong>", to describe any Christian who leaves their church on Sunday, goes home and does nothing for Christ, then returns the following Sunday to rejoice in the Lord. Such Christians have extended their monastery without walls and keep a vow of silence about Jesus Christ in their sphere of influence. If we do this, then we deserve the evil that is coming to our nation, for we seek no way to use the only change agent, THE PREACHED GOSPEL! That is why only 2% of Christians, even 2% of you who receive these devotions actively share the gospel. You were saved! to serve, end of story.

If we claim to be a living letter, why then are we not pitching our tents (lives) daily to share the gospel with those around us? What will Heaven write about how you pitched your tent? Will your tent be pitched for food, fun, and fellowship (the great disguising mark of most churches), or perhaps your pages will be blank because this book will record what is done to further "<strong>the kingdom by force</strong>". Perhaps it will it be written of you that you pitched your tent for furthering the gospel? Israel pitched their tents in all kinds of situations, and we are called to do the same. If you like your job or not, if you like your school or not, remember, we are not here for ourselves, we are saved to serve.

<strong>Application: "Woe to me if I preach not the gospel." (1Corinthians 9:6). </strong>Blessings, Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6399" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/memo3.jpg?w=300" alt="memo" width="300" height="229" /></a></strong>

Here on earth people have various discrepancies with the Word of God. Here are the thoughts of some people that don’t believe God’s Word to be the absolute truth:
<ol>
	<li>I don’t believe the Bible to be God’s Word.</li>
	<li>The Bible has been changed.</li>
	<li>It’s just a bunch of stories.</li>
	<li>Not everything is true in the Bible.</li>
	<li>The Bible has contradictions.</li>
	<li>I tried to read the Bible, but can’t understand it.</li>
	<li>Didn’t men, NOT God, write the Bible?</li>
</ol>
And whereas all of these statements can be easily explained in away, and please e-mail us if there is one you believe and need an answer to, or one that you would like to know so as to answer another who has or may make such a statement, these statements are never heard in heaven.<!--more-->

In heaven not one of these statements is ever spoken, why, “<strong>Because forever O’ Lord Your Word is settled in heaven”</strong>. Forever speaks of eternity, yet many live for the temporary. God, and all the host of heaven (angels) and the saints present in heaven live in the eternal, spiritual realm, and are not sitting around questioning God’s Word. No, the host of heaven and saints see plainly the Word of God. The Apostle Paul said it like this, <strong>“Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known”, 1Corinthians 13:12. </strong>

We do not see clearly. Paul’s metaphor is that of the imperfect reflection seen in one of the polished metal mirrors (<strong>see James 1:23</strong>) of the ancient world in contrast with seeing the Lord face to face (see <strong>Genesis 32:30; Numbers 12:8; 2Corinthians 3:18</strong>). We have impaired spiritual vision. If Paul saw “<strong>a poor reflection as in a mirror</strong>,” how much more is our vision impaired? Have you ever tried to view the world through a medal mirror, or perhaps you remember the mirrors you saw in a fun house (which brings distortion), or even seeing through a foggy mirror? There is truly no perfect spiritual mirror here on earth, except God’s Word.

Yet even God’s Word is not crystal clear to us. Oh yes, we do our best being inspired by the Holy Spirit. And the longer you diligently serve God, mature spiritually, consistently read God’s Word, learn, memorize, and meditate upon it the more you will comprehend. But in heaven the angels and saints don’t have vision problems, they see “<strong>face to face</strong>,” and “<strong>they know fully, even as they are fully known</strong>.” Perhaps that is why in heaven instead of theological arguments they reverently cry out “<strong>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is filled with your glory</strong>. Now through the Word of God, I know in part; then, in the presence of the Lord I will know fully, to the full extent that a redeemed finite human being can know and in a way similar in kind to the way the Lord in his infinite wisdom fully and infinitely knows me. God’s glory (presence) makes everything clearly seen and makes sense perfectly. His radiance illuminates all things in Light of Truth, and so one can only cry out holy, holy, holy. Why is this so, because <strong>“Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven.”</strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Application</span></strong><strong>: </strong>How often are you reading God’s Word to settle your life in truth? Are you right with God that you cry out holy, holy, holy, and will do the same on Judgment Day, or will you cry out when you stand before Him, “Oh no Your Word really is true? Make sure it is settled. Amen Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 26:1-14, “2 Then the Lord appeared to him and said: “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land of which I shall tell you. 3 Dwell in this land, and I will be with you and bless you;…”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011011.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6410" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011011.jpg" alt="20131203-0701101" width="225" height="225" /></a></strong>

In world full uncertainties, we all want to find ways to grow, move, flourish, prosper, and be successful. We have unexhausted list of things to accomplish, achieve, however there are factors that play part in either growth or hindrance. Now some of these are not luxuries but necessities. To lose an income is not about luxury but necessity. To not have food on the table is not luxury but necessity. It becomes harder when you are the leader and the breadwinner for your household.

God in <strong>Genesis 12</strong> told Abram (Abraham) to move his family to a land where He would show him and promised to bless him there. At some point there was severe famine in the land of Canaan, Abram decided to go down to Egypt with his family to escape the famine. Years later his son Isaac runs into a similar situation, great famine in the land. He chose to follow his father’s footsteps by planning to go down to Egypt. The situations were the same, the form and the content of the Lord’s command and promise to Isaac and Abraham were the same, and the only difference was the means God used.<!--more--> God told Isaac <strong>Genesis 26:2,” Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land of which I shall tell you. 3 Dwell in this land, and I will be with you and bless you;…”  </strong>Human reasoning would say there is no way a promise could be fulfilled in a land that was barren. Logic indicated that they were better off in Egypt than Canaan as they saw his father benefited there. To stay meant death but God.

This is the struggle even believers face. When there is a famine (lack of anything considered necessity) or anticipating something changing, it’s easier for all of us to think of a plan B, and the plan B here is to run to Egypt. Relocate, start somewhere else. And there are benefits to starting somewhere else, but what happens when the truth of God’s word weighs heavy in your heart to stay because of the prompting of the Holy Spirit. You cannot see a way out, everything looks cloudy, no light at the end of the tunnel but you choose to obey the echo of truth God has placed in your heart and stay. Everyone is giving you this look like <em>“I can’t believe you are staying”</em> however your convictions overrides others opinions. Jesus told Peter to launch into the deep. To cast his nets where he had already tried fishing all night (<strong>Luke 5</strong>) sounded foolish, "<strong>5 But Simon answered and said to Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.” Luke 5:5.</strong>

God tried Isaac by His providence. Isaac had been trained to believe and depend on God. As Abraham was going to sacrifice him without him knowing, Abraham believed that God will provide a lamb. Isaac perhaps had lived under the umbrella of his father’s faith, now it was his turn to deal with God directly and trust God and he did, <strong>Vs. 6, “So Isaac dwelt in Gerar”. </strong>He had to convince his family, servants to trust God with him. Like his father, he too had a weakness in his faith. He trusted God to provide but not to protect him and his wife when he lied about his relationship to her. We sometimes trust God in some areas and not with others but God who is rich in mercy still fulfilled His promise to him and He has done the same for us.

Vs<strong>. “12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold; and the Lord blessed him. 13 The man began to prosper, and continued prospering until he became very prosperous; 14 for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants. So the Philistines envied him”</strong>. Isaac had no land of his own; he was a stranger, a foreigner in Gerar. God chose to bless him in a foreign land in the midst of great famine because He was obedient. It was to be a testimony to king Abimelech and his people to recognize a blessed man, highly favored of God and more so the providence of God. <strong>Philippians 4:19, “And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.”</strong>

If you are like me facing some uncertainties with a job situation, not knowing what else to do, my prayer for you and for me is to be calm, launch into the deep, sow in the same ground if the Lord has through His word strengthened your faith to wait on Him where there are no signs of life, abundance, or progress. Where you want to run away from could be the ground of thriving like Isaac and the testimony would be to those in your Gerar who have never learned to trust God because they always had a backup plan. God is faithful. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>JOB 2:3, “ Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ecover_-_job_book-225x225-75.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6405" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ecover_-_job_book-225x225-75.jpg" alt="eCOVER_-_Job_Book.225x225-75" width="169" height="225" /></a></strong>

What do you see the world recognizes? Money, Fame, Power, Prestige, Talent, etc…. What are some of the things that you have been recognized for in your life? Are they awards you’ve won, degrees you earned, positions you’ve raised too, a certain financial status that you’ve obtained? We must realize that what we value, and what the world recognizes is certainly NOT the same as what God recognizes. Sure almost everyone appreciates recognition for things they have done, but it’s an entirely different ball game when the God of heaven looks upon your life and measures it from his perfect perspective, which is vastly different from yours, perhaps even offensive to you. God is not recognizing Bill Gates in heaven because of a huge earthly success and the plethora of money that he earned. Yes, he worked hard, and did a lot of good with his products and software which most of us are probably using right now to read this devotion.<!--more-->

Yet in Job’s day and time, he himself was the Bill Gates. Let me explain how this I know so from a preacher that I heard on the radio although I forget his name, his word opened my eyes even further to this man called Job. He lost all his sheep - Sheep were used to make clothing at that time to which Job had more than anyone. When fire fell from heaven, HIS WHOLE CLOTHING LINE, before GAP, Tommy Hilfiger, Sean John, etc.., was gone. He lost all his camels when the Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on his camels and carried them off. Camels were used to take long journeys. Job’s TAXI CAB SERVICE WAS DESTROYED! A mighty desert wind then came in and caused the house to collapse were his sons and daughters were abiding. THERE WENT HIS CHILDREN! And if that was not enough, Satan then afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head. Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes. JOB’S BODY WAS IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN. This only added insult to injury or perhaps better said injury to insult.

Yet with all that Job had that God had blessed him with, God honored Job’s character not even mentioning his great wealth that he had when He spoke to Satan. Here’s what God pointed out.

1 - There is no one like him in all the earth. Job was many notches above the rest. When put under a microscope his life shows what no other life can show.

2 - He is blameless and upright. No one can find any dirt, deception, deceit, jealousy, pride, or crooked ways in his life.

3 - A man who fears God. Job recognized that God was in charge and he so reverenced the Lord NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. It’s easy to worship God when everything is hunky-dory (great), but to fall to the ground in worship and say: "<strong>Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away</strong>; <strong>may the name of the LORD be praised</strong>." What a statement. Most men fear other men, NOT JOB, he feared God alone. “<strong>A man who is intimate with God is not intimidated by men”. </strong>

4 - And shuns evil. Job’s heart, unlike most people’s heart, perhaps even yours, repelled sin and was not drawn to it like a moth to the flame. His heart was resolved completely with the attitude “<strong>Teach me your way, O LORD, and I will walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name</strong>."

5 - And he still maintains his integrity. <strong>Real integrity is character woven throughout the fabric of your life</strong>. It’s how you are, how you think, and what you do in the dark, when no one is looking, when no one would know. What would you try and get away with if you knew no one would catch you? Perhaps your answer to this will cause you to worship the Lord or confess, and get right with God.

Take a self-check, inventory your life, how are you measuring up to God. If you are a saint perhaps you are struggling with some sin that needs to GO. If you are a sinner, then you are not yet saved, and God is angry with the sinner daily (<strong>Psalm 7:11</strong>). What do you think God is saying right now about your character, what can he recognize in you? Blessings, Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ezekiel 37:1-3, “1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. 2 He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. 3 He asked me, "Son of man, can these bones live?"  I said, "O Sovereign LORD, you alone know." </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-0701101.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6408" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-0701101.jpg?w=300" alt="20131203-0701101" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

Ezekiel came up to The Valley of Dry Bones. Death was all around. Even the bones were dried up, which is to say that the marrow inside the bones was deceased. The marrow gives strength to our bones which make up the skeletal system of our body. Our body is held up by our bones, our support structure. What happens when the very life of your support structure is eroded, and dried up? This is when all looks hopeless, all signs of life have ceased, and it seems as if there is nothing left to do because all resources are exhausted. Here Ezekiel was staring at an impossible situation. God asks him a very probing question, when He says, "<strong>Son of man, can these bones live?"</strong> Ezekiel in his wisdom knew that his knowledge was limited, and therefore replies <strong>“…O Sovereign LORD, you alone know</strong>."<!--more-->

In a practical way God was asking Ezekiel my people Israel are dead (they are the dead bones in your vision) do you think I can bring a dead situation to life? Do you think I can make a seemingly impossible situation possible? Can I bring forth life from death?, can I bring all these people who decided to stay in "Death Valley" and died because of it, out of this valley? No wonder Ezekiel responded as such, "<strong>O Sovereign LORD, you alone know.</strong>" What was he saying? Lord You know Your power. I know I can’t do this, and I don’t see how it can happen, but there is no one on this earth that can answer this question. Imagine if God asks you a question that you can’t answer. God asks many people many questions in His Word. It would be interesting to search the Scriptures and examine the topic "<em>questions God has asked ordinary people</em>". But, here God asks Ezekiel the question that no one but God alone could answer. And perhaps he was seeing if Ezekiel would run to a human answer. When problems in this world arise, everyone has their human opinion on the subject, "<em>the lawyer says</em>", <em>"the politician promised</em>", "<em>the psychologist stated", "my mom thinks", "the self help book showed",</em> etc. And we are so quick to find an answer that suits our finite thinking, our limited perspective, our many times clouded minds. But not Ezekiel, he wasn’t going to tackle this question in his human estimation. He knew that God had infinite knowledge, unlimited, holy, and eternal perspective, and a mind that could not be clouded but that was far above the clouds.

If you read the rest of the chapter which I suggest, you must do to get the full impact and not just a taste. You will see what God does with this "Death Valley" Situation. He was not talking about an individual, but a NATION.

Think for a moment. We say can, God get me out of "Death Valley". Perhaps we say Lord, get my family out. Have we asked the Lord to get our city out, our nation out! We limit God so many times to a personal relationship and forget His desire for a corporate relationship. He sees His church as His Bride. In Cinderella the prince kissed her to wake her up from her "Death Valley" and as Pastor Dave shared, the Lord has kissed the face of His children with His divine favor. Oh we are not trial free, because if we were how could God mold us to become like Christ, the Ultimate Conquer of "Death Valley"

Application: Cry out for not only yourself, but your city and your nation to live again.Blessings,Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 26:20</strong><strong>–</strong><strong>22, “Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall betray me. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I?"</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011012.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6418" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011012.jpg?w=300" alt="20131203-0701101" width="300" height="167" /></a></strong>

At the Last Supper Jesus is eating with His twelve and speaks about betrayal. This is perhaps the worst gesture that a “friend” can do to another friend, even worse than death, because one has to live with the fact that betrayal meant a complete hardening of the heart in the midst of the relationship. Jesus makes the statement that one of his “friends” there would deny him, and when He did everyone of them became sorrowful and looked introspectively saying “Lord is it I?” No one pointed fingers at Judas as if he had a big hook nose and devilish horns coming out of his head. The Scriptures point out that two of the disciples went against Jesus at his hour of need. Peter denied Jesus and Judas betrayed Jesus, so what’s the difference, or are they not the same?<!--more-->

Well let’s look at Peter first. Jesus says to the group that “<strong>all you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad</strong>.” <strong>Peter answered and said to him, “Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet will I never be offended.” Jesus responded by saying to him, “…this night, before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.” Peter said to him, “Though I should die with you, yet will I not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.</strong>” Peter really meant to keep his word, but when he was tested he folded under pressure three times just as Jesus said. We know that later in Peter’s life he got things together and became a leader among the Apostles and wrote two books of the Bible bearing his name.

Judas on the other hand turned against Jesus a bit differently. <strong>“Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, And said to them, What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.”</strong> Judas was plotting and scheming behind the scenes with those that wanted to see the destruction of Christ, and the disbanding of his disciples. Those evil men used Judas as a pawn to work an inside job on Jesus. While in prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, Judas comes with his entourage of chief priests and armed soldiers. <strong>“And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. And Jesus said to him, Friend, wherefore are you come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</strong>” Jesus calls him friend and yet Judas still sells him out in betrayal. With friends like Judas who needs enemies?

Peter grabbed his sword when they laid hold of Jesus and cut of one of the soldier’s ears to defend the Lord. He was showing his seriousness of protecting Jesus at all costs, even death. After Peter’s denial the Scriptures says that Peter “<strong>went out and wept bitterly [in repentance].”</strong> Judas however felt the guilt of betraying Jesus for thirty pieces of silver and tried to give it back, admitting that he had sinned against innocent blood, and he threw the coins down at the feet of the priests and went forth and hung himself. Both men felt sorrow for their sin, but Peter repented while Judas committed suicide.

<strong>Application:  If you find your actions plotting against your relationship with Jesus, repent right away, because the Judas lives in us tries to rise up and take charge. If you have denied Jesus by your life in anyway also repent and move on and do great things for your Lord. Remember your faith MUST stand trial, so that it can be refined.   Blessings Pastor Phil </strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Corinthians 9:25-27,“All those who compete in a race use self-control so they can win a crown. That crown is an earthly thing that lasts only a short time, but our crown will never be destroyed. So, I do not run without a goal. I fight like a boxer who is hitting something-not just the air. I treat my body hard and make it my slave so that I myself will not be disqualified after I have preached to others” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011013.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6421" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011013.jpg" alt="Runners" width="236" height="236" /></a></strong>

Are you a winner or are you a loser in the race of life? You can’t be both.

Christian life is a lot like running a race or playing a game. It requires discipline, training, caching, determination and sheer hard work. There is a goal to be reached and reward to be won at the end of the race for those who win the race.

Just as the goal of any team or individual playing a game or running a race is to win in order to receive a crown, trophy or a reward, so should be the goal of a Christian. We are called to run our race diligently here on earth so we can live victorious life and finally receive the crown that Jesus our master and chief coach has prepared for those who will win the race. There is a wonderful party planned in heaven for the winners. That is why you and I must run and fight persistently against all odds and ends, obstacles, limitations and intimidations of the devil. In our race, the enemy of our soul and a body is the Satan. <!--more-->He has marshaled his fallen demons to resist us on the way so we can give up and accept defeat. Well, the choice to win or be defeated is yours. God has equipped us and trained us as His children for winning. The Bible says that when you train a child in the right way to, to live and run the right way, he shall not forget when he is old (<strong>Proverbs 22:6</strong>)

God is never a looser. His children should never be losers either. If they chose to follow in the footsteps of the Father and do what the Father teaches and has always done to win they too must win. Satan’s main occupation is to defeat the believers. He can only do that if we let him. If we rise up and run tough, he has no chance of winning championship.

Run to win. Only winners can celebrate victory. Joy is in the camp of winners. Happiness, jubilation, excitement, relaxation and relief, and expectation can only be found with the winners. Losers are gloomy, sad, disappointed, frustrated, and hopeless, in some cases.

I remember back in 2004 NBA how Detroit Pistons won the NBA championship, beating the Lakers. Now this was unexpected. The winning team was being referred to as underdog which stood no chance of winning. But they won. What a celebration of the victory! I watched them shout, scream, jump, hug each other and kiss their trophy. Now that is the spirit of a winner and a winning team. What about you and your team? Are you winning or losing? If you are not excited, thrilled, joyous, celebrating, optimistic and happy with your life today regardless of what happens to you, you are losing the game to the devil. Rise up and play tough. Listen to the coach-the Holy Ghost. Even Jesus depended on His father and the disciples to win. You too must support and seek the support and help of other team members. You can’t win a lone. Don’t forget the supporters and fans who are also eager to see you win. That is why they are encouraging and cheering you to run hard and not give up.  Today, meditate on the words Paul wrote about the Christian race:

<strong>“All those who compete in a race use self-control so they can win a crown. That crown is an earthly thing that lasts only a short time, but our crown will never be destroyed. So, I do not run without a goal. I fight like a boxer who is hitting something-not just the air. I treat my body hard and make it my slave so that I myself will not be disqualified after I have preached to others (1 Corinthians 9:25-27). Let us run to win! Blessings, Boaz</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Numbers 21:8-9, “8 </strong><strong>Then the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> said to Moses, “Make a fiery <em>serpent,</em> and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” </strong><strong>9 </strong><strong>So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011014.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6425" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20131203-07011014.jpg?w=300" alt="20131203-0701101" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

The book of Hebrews opens up with God’s supreme revelation, and throughout the book it establishes that Jesus and His message is above the prophets, angels, priests etc. It begins with “<strong>1 God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 2 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">has in these last days spoken to us by His Son</span>, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; “, Hebrews 11:1-2</strong>. There were some signs either through dreams, acts, audible voices that were for a time and a season. They addressed specific things in history however they were not rolled out by the Lord as normative for us to look to. God has spoken to us consistently by His sufficient trusted word. Jesus said as recorded in <strong>Hebrews 10:7, “… ‘Behold, I have come— <span style="text-decoration:underline;">In the volume of the book it is written of Me</span>— To do Your will, O God.’”</strong><!--more-->

As already mentioned, there are things that were consistent based on His promises and then there are things rarely out of the ordinary for a time, a season God did for a people to communicate, strengthen or provide. We constantly wrestle through the word to determine if what we see was for a certain people group, for certain time and for a season or a regukar pattern. We need to learn by the word if it’s a promise or a principle because there are things which were not repeated or guaranteed promises. The bible has some things described but that does not mean prescribed.

God in His anger in <strong>Numbers 21 </strong>sent a fiery serpent unto the children of Israel because they had spoken against Him and His servant Moses. They had complained of lack of food and water, and even the food God had provided, manna they considered worthless<strong>. </strong>Having been judged, the Lord sent fiery serpent as an act of judgment and they bit the people and many of them died. It is at their point of repentance that<strong>, “8... </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> said to Moses, “Make a fiery <em>serpent,</em> and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” </strong><strong>9 </strong><strong>So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.</strong>”, <strong> Numbers 21:8-9. </strong>This was a spectacular miracle, a picture of Christ dying on the cross<strong>. </strong>Jesus alludes to it in <strong>John 3:13-15</strong>. It was for a time, for a season with significance not to be repeated. Of course the memory was to stay but for what reason worship or remembrance?

In <strong>2Kings 2:18</strong>, the brazen serpent had been carefully preserved, as a memorial of God's goodness to their fathers in the wilderness. That was the way it should have been but then Hezekiah destroyed it because what was to be a memorial had been turned into an idol people worshiped, <strong>2Kings 18:4</strong>. What was a means had been turned into an object of worship. It was considered more precious than the giver. It was idle and wicked to burn incense to it. While in our time we may not be doing exactly as they did, I see many people take God’s means and turn them into idols. For example, I have had dreams about certain things and I am convinced it was of the Lord to stir me up but I cannot make the dreams the norm by which the Lord would press something into my heart. His word is sufficient, that is where I turn. If He chooses to strength something by a sign or wonder, my focus is not to shift to those things. I run into people who when God used a means to do something in their lives, that became their focus. They expect the Lord to do it the same way or else. I know of even people who want to hear “thus says the Lord” but not from the scripture but by a word of knowledge, a new revelation, close your mind and tap into the divine etc. to learn what the will of God is for their lives. Remember in these last days God has spoken to us by His Son. If you want to hear God speak, read the word. If you want to hear him audibly, read the word out loud.

All helps to devotion, not warranted by the word of God, interrupt the exercise of faith; they always lead to superstition and other dangerous evils. Human nature perverts everything of this kind, this is  why we thank God for His preserved word to keep us in line. True faith needs not such aids to build its confidence apart from the word. It is not looking to and for God’s means as normative, it is turning to the word of God, daily thought upon and prayed over, is all the outward help we need. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Galatians 1:8-9, "8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/galatians-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6439" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/galatians-1.jpg?w=300" alt="Galatians-1" width="300" height="216" /></a></strong>

It is believed by some that there are about 20 - 30 gospels that have been written. When Christians think about the gospel what comes to mind? Perhaps some words like four, good news, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, etc.... However there are writings that some non-gospel writings that some claim have been cleverly left out of the Bible because of contradictions with the four books of the gospel. The Gospel of Thomas, Judas, and Mary are three to name a few. Unfortunately many Christians don't know there Bible that well and are unfamiliar with church history. A few years back the famous book fad that came out was called the Bible Code. Now the Da Vinci Code and the Gospel of Judas are the latest fads.<!--more-->
Jesus said, <strong>"10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." </strong>Jesus said, "<strong>THIS GOSPEL of THE KINGDOM WILL BE PREACHED..."</strong> The Law of God condemns all humanity and breaks the hard heart, but it is the gospel that heals the broken hearted. These other writings are not the gospel. The Gospel of Judas doesn't even mention God's Law which Jesus referred to all throughout His earthly ministry.

There is one gospel, the gospel according to Jesus. Paul said that if a man or even an angel from heaven preaches another gospel let him be accursed! Bankers can spot counterfeit currency because they spend so much time looking at the real thing. Let's commit ourselves to looking into the real thing, and living that real thing, the gospel.  We are called to know, do, and preach His Gospel. Do you have a love for what Jesus said? The very author of life has left us a life manual called the gospel. God has trusted His children with the gospel, to magnify it among the nations. Jesus said, "<strong>The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news (gospel) to the poor [in spirit]."</strong> If the Spirit of the Lord is upon you, then you too are called to be one that proclaims this gospel. Since the world is interested in these gospel fads of Satan, why not use them as a springboard to bring the gospel to them?

If you know the gospel then may you proclaim as Paul "<strong>Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel</strong>."

Until the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 102:1-28, “1 Hear my prayer, O Lord; let my cry for help come to you. Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly……. 17 He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.”</strong>

I usually like to share the word from my experiences, I find it easy to share with people what I have already gone through just to encourage and give them energy to keep going because sometimes we feel like we are going through a lot but someone else went through worse and they survived, and so if you hear their story it gives you the oomph to push on. So my devotion today kind of ties up with what my husband shared on “God can” message sometime bac. I am sure we have all prayed a similar prayer like the one above in <strong>Psalm 102</strong> and there are times it did feels like God never answered. Have you ever prayed for something for years and years and then you prayed with someone about the same thing for God to open those doors for that someone and it happened within hours or a couple of days or weeks or just months? And here you are, been praying for years and years and nothing? <!--more-->Yes I have been there and it is quite painful but when we realize that the will of God is different for each one of us just like we are all different from each other, then we understand what it means for God to answer our prayers at His own perfect timing. Isn’t it interesting we pray to God about something and tell him God please you know my heart you know my desires, I pray that you will grant me this and that at your own perfect timing and when he takes time to give it to you at His perfect timing we give up, throw in the towel, become bitter, depressed, etc.

There are so many stories I can give here but I am going to choose one that happened recently. I graduated as a nurse in 2007 and this was quite an accomplishment for me, see all through my school years up until college, I was a very average student. My siblings were doing much better than I was in school, my two sisters were B+ students and my two brothers were C+ students and me? I’ll leave that to your imagination. I struggled with school a lot and for some reason when I came to America it seemed like school suddenly made sense and here I was graduating with my bachelors in nursing 5 yrs later. Well, the battle started when I had to sit for my Boards to get my license I thought well, I did well in nursing school and that was a lot of work so if I accomplished nursing school then Boards should be a breeze right?? Wrong!! It took me 8 trials to get my licensure and every time I went to sit for the exams I had to part with $200. I was an emotional wreck, I hated answering this question every time I met people or went to gatherings and people knew I graduated as a nurse being asked all the time so how is work and me having to tell them I’m not working and then having to answer to why, it was exhausting. But in between my, I think it was the fifth time, I was so broken I remember calling my mom and crying on the phone and asking if I was never meant to be a nurse, if I should go back to school and do something else, was God punishing me for something that I did? Why did God bring me out here and help me through nursing school only to have this tiny road block that I seem to not know how to maneuver around it? Poor mom, she has been a big part of who I am, and she encouraged me and took me back to some basics that I needed to hear and needed to be reaffirmed. So I picked up myself, my husband cried with me, we prayed and I decided that from that day on whatever happens I will love my God, I will serve Him, I will praise Him, I will trust in Him, I will not run away from Him and I will do all these with gladness and JOY in my heart. It was hard, it was very hard, I had come to a point where going to church was a struggle, I did not feel like praising God why should I when I am hurting and feeling like He forgot about me? I still cry when I remember when I made that decision but I cannot overlook my life without God in it and I knew there has to be a purpose and it will all make sense to me one day. I went and sat for my boards a 6<sup>th</sup> time and a 7<sup>th</sup> time and 8<sup>th</sup> was my breakthrough. I remember standing at the door before I entered the exam room and telling God please Lord, I don’t know where I will put my face if I don’t come out of here victorious, I know I promised to try until I get it right and I promised to be on your side no matter what but I need this Goliath in my life to die. Those were my exact words and I said if you don’t go with me Lord, I am dead and I opened the door and went through the routine I had done over and over again. I finished my exam &amp; I had no idea what to think of it. About 3 or 4 days later I received 2 big packages in the mail and I thought oh my word, they have seen my name so many times they are sending me back to nursing school or rejecting me, my heart was literally pounding off my chest, my hands were shaking so bad, I had a tremendous headache as I was opening that package and when I saw passed, I couldn’t breath, I almost called 911. And the rest is glory to God.

The Joy of the Lord was my strength, I had anxiety attacks thinking of how my friends were going on with their lives as nurses while mine is stagnant, but the Joy of the Lord kept me going. He hears our prayers brethren, he sees our hurts and when the time is right we receive our answered prayers. It might not be the way you wanted it to be but if it comes from the Lord, it will work for your situation. So whatever it is you are praying for do not and never give up, pray earnestly keep knocking and I always like reminding people and myself to leave space for God’s will to be done, we have all sorts of plans for the future but ultimately its God’s plan that prevails whether we like it or not or whether we realize it or not. And I will leave you with this keep hope alive, <strong>Romans</strong> <strong>5:5 says, “And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given</strong><strong> us.”</strong> Blessings, Judy Olang.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 23:5, “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies...” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6445" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n.jpg?w=300" alt="555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

David wrote <strong>Psalm 23</strong> toward the end of his life, and therefore it is his reflection of God’s work in the life of David. David had the following experiences: tending sheep, defeating Goliath, being chased by King Saul, anointed King of Israel, committing adultery, repenting of his sin, etc…. To say that David had a full life of vast experiences would be an understatement. Many of us are familiar with this most popular Psalm but what snapshot of David’s life was he thinking of when he wrote, <strong>“You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies...?”</strong> Was Goliath on his mind, or one of his many battles that he led? I believe that David reflected on the time his sheep were hunted by a lion or a bear that could easily devour and carry them away. However David was the sheep, and he was not being hunted by a foreign army, or even any such enemy of Israel, he was being hunted by an enemy lion, with the attributes of Satan who seeks to steal kill and destroy, that was supposed to be on his side.<!--more-->

<strong>“He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. The men said, “This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.’ ” Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe</strong> “, <strong>1Samuel 24:3-4.</strong>

Perhaps the worst enemies of all are those that you think are on your side, but that pursue your demise. There may be any number of reasons such as jealousy or bitterness, which in the case with David and Saul seemed to be the prevalent reasons. David learned how to dodge Saul’s spears time and time again, and now David is hiding out far back in a cave. Interestingly enough though while David and his men were at the back of the cave, guess who laid down to rest near the front of cave? Saul! God had prepared a table for David in the presence of his enemy Saul. David had Saul in the palm of his hand as David was standing over a sleeping Saul he raised his blade over Saul. WOW, God had given David’s enemy into his hands for him to deal with as he wished. David being more honorable man than Saul chose to spare Saul’s life by bringing the blade down and cutting off a piece of Saul’s robe to show that he could have taken Saul’s life.

<strong>“…The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their cry;”</strong> God’s favor rested with a righteous David as he brought his enemy to him and placed David’s enemy in a vulnerable state. God has a way of bringing down our enemies, and preparing a table of blessing before us in their presence. David could have killed Saul, but he didn’t. David implored what we now read as Christ’s words, “<strong>Bless your enemies.”</strong> Are their perhaps those that are seeking your demise because God is looking with favor upon you? Do not fear because God has a way of bringing your enemies to your feet and preparing a table before you in the very presence of your enemies.

<strong>Application: Have you been following the world’s advice of “don’t get mad, get even?” “Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord. On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, Romans 12:19-20. Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 6:8-23, “21 </strong><strong>When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?” </strong><strong>22 </strong><strong>“Do not kill them,” he answered. “Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master.”</strong><strong>23 </strong><strong>So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel’s territory.</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6449" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n2.jpg?w=300" alt="555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

The world is hostile. We have enemies in every corner and greater enemies against believers. Other religions are more tolerated than Christians in dealing with challenges that face Christians. While the fierce battle against Christians is to wipe them out of the map, the strategy God has often given believers is not to engage the enemy with the same battle plan as they do but fight God's battles God's way. God’s given strategies are many times unconventional in our judgment, they don't make sense but they are mighty through God and we must learn by the word of God how best to fight.<!--more-->

The story in <strong>2Kings 6</strong> is of Elisha and his encounter with the Syrians. Naaman a captain of Syria had earlier been healed by Elisha; however that did not stop his people from waging war against Israel and their prophet. This is a picture of how the enemy can be blinded even when you do good to one of their own. Elisha the prophet was able to see in the spiritual realm their plans and warned the king of Israel of Syrians pending plans, exposing their plans leading to failure. The fact that Elisha knew their plans and could advise the king of Israel to set up a troop against them was a form of demonstrating that God had delivered the Syrians in the hands of the prophet and his people. They had in every way by God's divine providence dodged their enemies plans. God in more than once had delivered them in their hands, however they did not raise their weapons to destroy.

The enemy was persistent, worked hard to find the mole that exposed their plans only to be told it was Elisha the prophet. Elisha was deemed dangerous and was to be captured by a great army. They sent an army by night to surround the city and Elisha the prophet slept through the night knowing there was an enemy there to capture him. Those who were with them were greater than those who came against them. While they had power over the Syrian army, God did not command them to destroy them, if anything; Elisha prayed that God would strike them with temporary blindness. In one case his servant’s eyes were opened to see the greatness of God, but unto the enemy, they were blinded and sought help. Elisha then led them right into Samaria where he prayed that their eyes would be opened.

<strong>Vs. 21, “Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”</strong> What a great opportunity to destroy the enemies of Israel and here we see the king very eager to destroy them, asking for permission. Elisha answered, <strong>vs. 22</strong> <strong>“You shall not kill them. Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.” </strong>The invisible army to supporting Israel did not destroy the Syrian, Elisha who could ask the Lord for anything including the death of the enemies did not, and when the king of Israel asked for permission, he would not let him. He did something Jesus would preach about later in the NT. He told the king to set food before them and water and the king <strong>vs 23. “…prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel.</strong>

This was a mile of excellence, the second mile, not only forgive, but set a great feast before those who sought to destroy them. The first mile is the minimum most may sign up for, with Christ believers go the second mile, the mile of excellence, the mile that distinguishes us from the rest. <strong>Romans 12:20, “Therefore "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; If he is thirsty, give him a drink; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head."</strong> Jesus teaching<strong>, “43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47 And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? 48 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.” </strong>The first mile is forgive, the mile of excellence is love, bless, and pray for your enemies. If He said let go, that might be a little bit easy but not only let them go, love them, bless them, and pray for them? This is impossible unless you have drawn from the one who forgave, loved, blessed, and prayed for his enemies who put Him on the cross.

With the leadership of Elisha, they shut the mouth of the enemy not with a sword but by their action, a mile of excellence. They did good to those who did not deserve it, those who wanted to destroy them and sent them away <strong>“For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men”, 1Peter 2:15.</strong>

Can we as believers pray to God to baptize us with such great compassion that we forgive, love, bless and pray for our enemies? That we win them by love they desperately need, <strong>Proverbs 10:12, “Hatred stirs up strife, But love covers all sins”. </strong>Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jude 1:3 “…contend earnestly for THE faith which was ONCE for ALL delivered to the saints</strong>”<strong>.</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6452" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n3.jpg?w=300" alt="555220_10151734928587345_1128779646_n" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

In the last couple of years, there have been stories about people from the middle east getting saved through dreams without hearing the gospel or the name of Jesus. While I may not limit anything the God of creation can do, I believe when I read scripture that He has chosen to limit the means by which He will save His people. I do not find anywhere in scripture where God saves by dreams and even visions and I will by scripture present a case.

The natural revelation helps men see that God has created everything.  David heralds this in <strong>Psalm 19:1, “The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork”</strong>.  And Paul in <strong>Romans 1:20</strong> echoes the same <strong>“20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse”. </strong>God never chose the natural revelation to be the means to save men but prepare men for the supernatural or special revelation. The natural revelation can create a  desire for special revelation, however the natural has no power of its own.<!--more-->

Paul declared that the Gospel (good news) is the power of God unto salvation, <strong>Romans 1:16</strong>, for in the Gospel is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, <strong>Romans 1:17</strong>. And Paul who penned these words, he made sure we understood by what means the power of God came about. It is by preaching the gospel that people respond by calling on Him. In <strong>Romans 10:13,</strong> He declares how we are saved “<strong>For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.” </strong>But then he brings about a dilemma that must be addressed, he says<strong> vs. “14 How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?”</strong> Paul is stating clearly that for one to believe, they must hear to believe and it must be done by preaching (sharing the gospel). The gospel that is preached produces faith, <strong>Romans 10:17, “ So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”. </strong>The voice of God is His word, this is the special revelation. “F<em>aith comes by hearing the word and not by studying the nature. Nature drives us to scripture for true understanding of God and His ways, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">it’s the word of God that gives birth to faith</span>”</em>, Phil Johnson.

The sufficiency of scripture prepares man for salvation. Paul reminds Timothy of the process of his salvation “<strong>and that from childhood you have <span style="text-decoration:underline;">known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith</span> which is in Christ Jesus”, 2Timothy 3:15. </strong>Timothy did not come through any other means but by the truth of the scripture.

Cornelius in <strong>Acts 10 </strong>received a vision of an angel of the Lord who brought good tidings of God’s acceptance of his alms and prayers. Instead of God by the angel declaring him saved or preaching to him, Cornelius by vision he received sent for Peter who when he came preached Jesus (gospel) to him and his household and there they received the gospel. Similar to the experience of the Ethiopian eunuch, he did not receive an angel visit like Cornelius but his heart was eager the same way as Cornelius to learn and serve. God sent an angel to speak to Phillip to go and meet him, <strong>Acts 8:30-32, “30 So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do you understand</span> what you are reading? 31 And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” …35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him”.  </strong>The understanding is informed by the word of God, faith comes by hearing…Jesus called a person who hears the word and understands it good ground or good soil, <strong>Matthew 13:23.</strong> Understanding is special revelation.

The natural revelation is important and most necessary just like the law, the reality is, the scripture has superior power to bring to light special revelation that leads to salvation through the preaching of the word. Dreams and visions may be a means of awakening, but they are not the means for salvation, <strong>Hebrews 4:12, “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” </strong>

Jude encourages believers to <strong>“…contend earnestly for THE faith which was ONCE for ALL delivered to the saints</strong>”, <strong>Jude 1:3. </strong>We must stick to the word, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 39:1, "I said, “I will guard my ways, Lest I sin with my tongue; I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle, While the wicked are before me.” </strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-shepherd-sermon.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6475" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-shepherd-sermon.jpg?w=300" alt="The-Shepherd-sermon" width="257" height="193" /></a></strong>

Our tongues are great, God made them to be used for His glory. It becomes lethal if untamed. It's a very small thing but has such great power. This makes me wonder whether the Lord gave us two ears and one mouth so that we will be inclined to hear more and speak less. I know the power of the tongue because I've said things I wished I did not, they cut deep like a sharp knife. It's like a gun, once fired; it's gone and cannot be retrieved. I hear people say, “Take back what you just said” as a figure of speech. I also hear some say, “speak your mind”, very dangerous request. <strong>Proverbs 18:21</strong>, tells us <strong>"Death and life are in the power of the tongue,...". </strong>This verse is often used by prosperity preachers to tell their listeners that they can create their reality by how they speak, that you are what you speak. This is not correct, all the verse is saying is that a man may do a great deal of good, or a great deal of hurt, both to others and to himself, according to the use he makes of his tongue.<!--more-->

James (Jesus half-brother) is the only one I find in the Bible that describes greatly the power of the tongue. James provided several analogies that show how the tongue, even though small, has the power to control one’s whole person and influence everything in his life. He says <strong>"And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell", James 3:6. </strong>The tongue is like a wild fire seeking to be unleashed. It is never satisfied, it is always looking for ways to be out of control. You may feel like I do sometimes to have the last word in a conversation showing exactly its drive. It is by the tongue that we blame and it is by the tongue that we justify ourselves even when we are wrong. What has been used the most to try and get people out of trouble? lying lips. The bible says, <strong>"Lying lips are abomination to the Lord"</strong>. It is by the tongue we speak error. We backbite and contaminate or ruin other people’s lives by it. Sometimes we say nice things but how we say them defiles even with good intentions. It is by the tongue that we boast the more, <strong>Luke 18</strong> records of a Pharisee boasting in his prayer despising a publican praying too.

Can anyone put their tongue under control? James says <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">no man can tame the tongue</span></strong>. He says people have tamed wild animals but have failed to tame their tongue. And the reason is simple, no one has the ability on their own to tame the tongue, only God by His power can do this. When we guard our ways as the Psalmist says, God's power is present in us to overcome sinning with our tongue. To be conformed to the image of Christ and Him be formed in us (<strong>Galatians 4:18-20</strong>) is the means to bring our tongues under control. The psalmist says, "<strong>I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle"</strong>, a muzzle is a device that is placed over the snout of an animal to keep it from <span style="text-decoration:underline;">biting </span>or <span style="text-decoration:underline;">otherwise opening its mouth</span>. The muzzle is put in the mouth of an animal the times it needs it the most and our prayer to the Lord is help us muzzle our mouths so as not to sin. God’s word is a muzzle. <strong>Psalm 119:11, “Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You</strong>”.

How do we do it, <strong>James 1:19, “So then, my beloved brethren<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak,</span> slow to wrath; 20 for the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God</span>". </strong>We need wisdom from above,<strong> James 1:5, "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him". Proverbs 12:18, "There is one who speaks like the piercings of a sword, But the tongue of the wise promotes health". </strong>How much more do we need wisdom to know when to be quite and when to speak encouraging words that build? <strong>Proverbs 15:2, “The tongue of the wise uses knowledge rightly, But the mouth of fools pours forth foolishness</strong>”

Under frustration and anger, people often say things they wish they could take back. Husbands say things that hurt their wives and vise versa. Parents say things to their children, and we say things to our bosses, colleagues at work, and members of the body of Christ that hurt. On our own we are unable tame our tongues the reason to pray always to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves in how we hear, respond, speak. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Our tongues untamed by the Holy Spirit is deadly on their own</span></strong>. Paul encourages Timothy his son, <strong>2Timothy 2:23-25 “23 But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. 24 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, 25 in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth</strong>”, All these are cultivated by the fear of God we should crave for.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6498" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nature-4975498_1920.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="190" height="190" />Luk 7:38</strong><strong>...And she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil. 39  Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, "This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner."</strong>

There are circumstances that reveal the true conditions of the heart. The 36th verse reads "one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him".  Did the Pharisee need to be close to Jesus or did he think it would help his reputation to have such a great guest at his table? Remember the centurion, he declared his unworthiness to have Christ’s company in his own house. Did this Pharisee imagine he was worthy of Jesus’ attention? He calls Mary a sinner but not himself. According to him, if Jesus was a true prophet, he would not let such a woman tend to Him. We always grapple with our purpose for coming to Christ. Was He worthy of our worship or did we come of our own merit? Do we think we deserved His attention or feel that we are better than others?

Simon, the Pharisee, represents the unloving and self-righteous. He represents  those who are ignorant of God. Those are the people God has a heart for. They may be respectable in life but rigid in morality. He despised the woman, and now, Jesus, who received the woman. He was quick to judge others than himself. "A Pharisee is hard on others and easy on himself, but a spiritual man is easy on others and hard on himself.", A.W. Tozer.]]></content:encoded>

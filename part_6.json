              "<strong>Matthew 4:1-11, “1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 2 And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry”\r\n</strong>\r\nAnother subtle way satan works among believers is to disguise himself with the temptation of presumption. Presumption is a behavior perceived as arrogant, disrespectful, and transgressing the limits of what is permitted or appropriate.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Satan tempted Jesus with presumption, <strong>Matthew 4:5-6, \"Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: and, ‘He shall give His angels charge over you,’ ‘In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone.’</strong> ” Satan, by divine permission, and with the consent of Christ had power over his body to move Him from place to place. He took Him to holy city to Jerusalem as commonly called, being the place God had peculiarly chosen for Himself. And here again the call was to question His Sonship on the basis of misusing the provision and God's ability to advance Self. Jesus was not about advancing Himself, He said, <strong>Hebrews 10:7,\"..., 'Behold, I have come-- In the volume of the book it is written of Me-- To do Your will, O God.' \"</strong>\r\n\r\nNot to long ago a pastor fond of handling snakes was killed by one of his snakes. He took the passage in <strong>Mark 16:18, \"they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; ...”</strong> and foolishly used it to put God to test. While we think this is outrageous, don't we many times do similar things? Many run from one conference to another hoping for a zap to take away everything that is troubling them. Some give away all their money foolishly because God will provide double or even triple. A number of sick people cease to use God given medicine (providence) because God will heal them through a faith healer. Some neglect their wives and children chasing one thing after another because God will provide, all in the name of being in high places. Some leaders abuse their offices to advance themselves instead of God. This is like saying, \"<i>you jump and God will send His angels to catch you\"</i> and <strong>He does, but should believers abuse the provision of God for self gratification?</strong>\r\n\r\nAll high places are slippery places; advancements in the world makes a man a mark for Satan to shoot his fiery darts at. Satan's words appealed to Jesus to be more religious; to put more trust and reliance upon the promises of the Father; and he puts Him in the place--the temple--where He might argue that God could not at least afford to let His promise fail. <strong>As a rule, the greater the desire the greater the temptation.</strong>\r\n\r\nJesus in addressing this temption responded, <strong>Matthew 4:7, \"... “It is written again, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</strong>’ ” <em>as if He should say, \"True, it is so written, and on that promise I implicitly rely; but in using it there is another Scripture which must not be forgotten.\" <strong>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</strong> \"Preservation in danger is divinely pledged: shall I then create danger, either to put the promised security skeptically to the proof, or wantonly to demand a display of it? That were 'to tempt the Lord my God,' which, being expressly forbidden, would forfeit the right to expect preservation.\"</em>, Jamieson, Faussett, and Brown.\r\n\r\n<strong>The danger here is to presume God's provision based on half quoted scripture to suit a good thing pursued in a bad way</strong>. When Satan quoted the verse, \"<strong>He shall give his angels charge concerning thee</strong>\", the enemy, like a false adviser, quotes from <strong>Psalm 91:11</strong> to justify his request, but he garbled the Scripture, leaving out <strong>\"...to keep thee in all thy ways,</strong>\" which follows the first clause. The promise is limited to those who walk in the way appointed to them not those who create their own and presume to use God's provision.\r\n\r\nWe have enough false advisers out here calling themselves pastors, teachers, prophets subtly used by the enemy to give half verses, taken out of contexts to cater for believers craving wants. Jesus knew the word, rightly divided it and rightly applied it. Good soil is always equated with he who hears and UNDERSTANDS. <strong>Understanding is the means by which we have good application and good application battles the subtle ways of Satan</strong>.

              "<strong>Matthew 4:1-11, “1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 2 And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe third temptation in my judgement is the most subtle work of satan so clearly working among believers and yet so blindly received. In the age of feelings and emotions, vast majority do not plumb line feelings and emotions by God's word and that is a recipee for disaster. Satan appears as an angel of light pretending to fight for believers however his aim is to turn men against God, rebel against God like he did. While pretending to be an angel of light and even using people in authority, he speaks fluttery words to create an appetite. <strong>2Corinthians 11:13-14, \"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><strong>Matthew 4:8-9, \"Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him, “All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.”</strong> Satan took Jesus to the highest mountain and showed Him everything he would give Him if He worshipped him. He tempted Christ to idolatry with the offer of the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them. The glory of the world is the most charming temptation to the unthinking and unwary; by that men are most easily imposed upon. This is humanism which declares that the chief end of all beings is the happiness of man.\r\n\r\nThis is the temptation to be satisfied with temporal things which takes focus off God and places it on believers. The temptation is to turn away from the path of self-denial, the cross and the tomb, and to establish an outward, worldly domain.\r\n\r\nNotice that in this temptation Satan does not quote scripture as before because there is not one to quote or rather misquote. There was no passage to say \"worship me\" so he defaulted to providing men's heart felt needs rather than bring God as he earlier quoted. The devil is not content to be worshipped by men, but seeks for adoration from the Son of God: this opens at once his proud, ambitious, and aspiring views, to be as God himself; for with nothing less can he be satisfied.\r\n\r\nSatan wants us to be satisfied with here and now, with the present kingdom and forfeit eternity. What does he do, he appeals to man with what his ear is itching for with a promise to provide. His mission, \"<em>don't seek God's kingdom first and His righteousness and everything will be added, no, but seek how I have made the world successful when it turned to me and I will do the same for you\"</em>. How many churches are building by the ways of the world and are even successful but not according to the ways of God? How many people are turning to self help materials, gurus of some sort for healing, prosperity etc and are not turning to God? How many are elevating some preachers because of their status and fame? God's kingdom cannot be secularized and that is what satan wants. If he can get believers focus off Christ and dwell on what they could gain, he has succeeded. <strong>Romans 14:17-18, \"for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 4:10, \"Then Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.’ ” </strong> Here Satan clearly shows who he was. Accordingly Christ answering this suggestion, calls him by his own name, which he had not done before. While Satan had no scripture to quote, Jesus used all SUFFICIENT word readily available at all times to combat even that which was not misquoted.\r\n\r\nOur safeguard against temptation is the word, used by the discernment of a perfectly pure heart, which lives in the presence of God, and learns the mind of God in His word, and therefore knows its application to the circumstances presented. It is the word that preserves the soul from the wiles of the enemy. Our feelings and emotions can fail us and many times have, however rightly dividing the word of truth will not.\r\n\r\nIf we seek only the glory of God, that which presents no other motive than my own power, status, wealth, or our own gratification, whether of body or mind, will have no hold upon us; and will shew itself in the light of the word.\r\n\r\nParis Reidhead defines temptation \"as <em>the proposition made to the mind to satisfy a good appetite in a bad (forbidden) way, and sin is the decision of the will to satisfy a good appetite in a bad way”</em>. Jesus was tempted with good things in a bad way, but because He knew the word, He rightly divided and rightly applied defeating satan in His game.\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 4:11, \"Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him\" </strong>That is, they brought Him food of their own preparing and dressing, as they formerly did to Elijah, <strong>1Kings 19:5</strong> to satisfy His hunger, and refresh His animal spirits; which had underwent a very great fatigue during this length of time, in which He fasted, and was tempted by Satan. That which He never sought to have was given to Him because He needed it, this is similar to when God gave Solomon a blank check to ask for anything. Instead of Solomon asking for temporal, he asked for important thing \"wisdom\" to discern. For this reason God gave more, <strong>1Kings 3:11-13, “11 Then God said to him: “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice, 12 behold, I have done according to your words; see, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you. 13 And I have also given you what you have not asked: both riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days...”</strong>. May we seek wisdom to discern and apply God's word rightly, in that we will silence the subtle works of satan and the Lord will send His ministering angels to minister to us on those things we did not seek as priority but need for day to day sustenance.

              "<strong>1Corinthians 1:18, “For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.” </strong>\r\n\r\nIn the landscape of religion and politics the art of preaching is a key component used to persuade people. When the cross of Christ is preached however, it is not preached to promote religion or politics, but true relationship with the Prince of Truth. However, when those that are perishing hear the cross preached, they respond to it as foolishness. Josh McDowell wrote, “<em>It seems to me that either the resurrection of Jesus Christ is one of the most wicked, vicious, heartless hoaxes ever foisted upon the minds of men, or it is the most fantastic fact of history.</em>”<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThere are only two choices when it comes to looking at the cross, either Christ was foolish for His willing submission to the cross, or those that refused to believe (those that were perishing) were foolish. Christ rose on the third day and defeated death hell and the grave. Jesus did what He said He would do, rise from the dead. Therefore those that are perishing, living in rebellion toward God and therefore sit under condemnation are foolish, because Christ is their only way out. The Christ upon the cross is the only ransom (payment) for their sins, and without Him one remains in their sins. One will live and die standing before God upon one’s own righteousness which will not persuade the Judge, or one will stand upon the righteousness of Christ, having trusted in the cross. When one trusts in the cross to them the cross is the power of God. The transference of standing upon our righteousness switches to standing upon Christ’s righteousness, which is perfect, holy, and just, in the sight of a holy God. The issue remains in God’s sight as righteousness, not happiness.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>“</em>The preaching of the cross is foolishness…”</strong>Are you preaching the cross? Are you sharing the truth about Jesus Christ? Many will hear your words as intolerant upon hearing that Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven. Are they not being intolerant by calling you intolerant? Either way God does not tolerate sin and rebellion.\r\n\r\n“…<strong>to them that are perishing…”</strong>God’s will is for none to perish but for all to come to repentance. People are perishing; do you as a Christian care about this fact? What are you doing about it. Paul wrote that is was not Bible study, prayer, Sunday morning church service, etc…, but the preaching the cross that God implores.\r\n\r\n“<strong>For us which are saved it is the power of God</strong>.” Paul wrote I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God unto salvation for everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek (Gentile). If you have the power of God because of your salvation, then use that power unashamedly to bring the message of salvation and plant it in the heart of one that is ready for God’s truth!\r\n\r\nWhen we forsake our duty, our mandate, then perhaps we are being even more foolish than the perishing, because we are being knowingly disobedient to the God we profess to love and follow. Go and reach the perishing today.\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 1:19, “For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent”</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>“Imagine for a moment that you are standing on the seashore gazing at a large ocean liner. The sun is shining. There is no wind and the sea is calm. To your amazement, about thirty people suddenly dive off the end of the ship and cling to a lifeboat. You shake your head in disbelief at their foolishness. Then without warning, the great ocean liner strikes an iceberg and suddenly sinks, taking all on board with it. Those who looked like fools in abandoning the ship were actually wise, and those who seemed wise by staying on board were, in truth, fools. The world scoffs at those who abandon the ship of this world and cling to the lifeboat of the Savior. But Christians know that this great pleasure-cruiser will eventually come into contact with the immovable iceberg of the Law of God, sink into hell ... and take all those on board with it (The Evidence Bible).”<!--more--></em>\r\n\r\nRecently we examined the verse, “<strong>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God”, </strong>Now Paul introduces a quote from the Prophet <strong>Isaiah (29:14),</strong> “<strong>Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder; the wisdom of the wise will perish, the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish</strong>.” Paul is showing that God dismisses the wisdom of men as a means of salvation. These people were giving God lip – service but their hearts were not converted. In vs. 13 Isaiah says, “<strong>The Lord says: “These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men. Man-made precepts and mouthing of words for salvation</strong>”, <strong>Isaiah 29:13</strong>, will not move the heart of God. He will set aside man’s wisdom and understanding as a means of finding favor with him. God makes two promises that Paul has written:\r\n\r\n<strong>First, “…I will destroy the wisdom of the wise”</strong>. Humanity cannot strive for salvation through their wisdom. If humanity thinks for a moment that God can be swayed by the wisdom of man, God will destroy that wisdom, and show it to really be the foolishness of humanity. In <strong>Matthew 16</strong>, Jesus is speaking with His twelve and asks, “<strong>Who do you say that I am?” </strong>Peters answers Him saying<strong>, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</strong>” Jesus responds to Peter saying, “<strong>Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven<em>.</em></strong>” It was not man’s wisdom that led Peter to this knowledge, but rather revelation from the Lord. David the Shepherd slayed Goliath the Warrior, as God destroyed the wisdom of man.\r\n\r\n<strong>Secondly, “…I will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent”</strong>. God has a way of crushing the understanding of the prudent. Jesus confounded the Jews, He was the Messiah that most of them missed, and they couldn’t understand who Jesus really was. Now most of the Jews follow the word of man, instead of the Word of God. God calls us to preach His Word, which may be foolish to many, but God uses His Word that we preach to bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. <strong>Romans 3:19</strong> reads, “<strong>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God</strong>.” There is no escape, no matter how intellectual someone may think they are. Not submitting to the Lord is complete foolishness. How is your submission factor? Are you preaching His Word, despite the fact you may look foolish to the world?\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>2Chronicles 14:1-15, “11 And Asa cried out to the Lord his God, and said, \"Lord, it is nothing for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no power; help us, O Lord our God, for we rest on You, and in Your name we go against this multitude. O Lord, You are our God; do not let man prevail against You!\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAsa succeeded his father Abijah and was one of the kings who did that which was right in the sight of the Lord demonstrated by what he did, (<strong>2Chronicles 14:2)</strong>. He aimed at pleasing God, studied to approve himself to Him. In his days, God had given him peace and rest. Even in the midst peace and rest, vs. “<strong>4 He commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandment”. </strong>How easy it is to relax in the time of peace and not seek God. How easy to wait until the day of trouble to figure out what to do. That was not with Asa and his kingdom.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn the days of peace and rest, Asa and his people prepared by reforming their kingdom. This preparation was not to rely on their strength or confidence in their ability, their preparation was to be instruments by which God will make His name great as we will see shortly. He removed high places, he built fortified cities, towers, gates, raised an army because they sought the Lord <strong>vs. 8</strong> and the Lord directed their steps.\r\n\r\nAs the days of rest and preparation progressed, <strong>vs. 9, “… Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah. 10 So Asa went out against him, and they set the troops in battle array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah</strong>” Zerah’s army doubled against Asa’s army, nevertheless Asa still went against them but not in his own strength. <strong>Vs. “11 And Asa cried out to the Lord his God…”.</strong> He that sought God in the day of his peace and prosperity could with holy boldness cry to God in the day of his trouble, and call Him his God.\r\n\r\nHere is where Asa had confidence in His God rather than his preparation,<strong> vs. 11 “…\"Lord, it is nothing for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no power</strong>” He gives God the glory of His infinite power and sovereignty demonstrating how God works in His own strength, not in the strength of man's instruments. He acknowledged that God can accomplish anything His way.\r\n\r\nAsa continues<strong> vs. 11, “…help us, O Lord our God, for we rest on You, and in Your name we go against this multitude…”. </strong>He takes hold of their covenant-relation to God as theirs referring to God as their God, resting on God in the day of trouble as they rested in the Lord in the days of rest.\r\n\r\nThe underlying motive for victory?, “…<strong>O Lord, You are our God; do not let man prevail against You!\" </strong>Note that he does not pray “…<strong>do not let man prevail against US but against YOU”. </strong>If they were defeated, the enemy would not boast to have defeated Asa but rather boast in defeating God. Think of Moses, Joshua and others, the primary reason for ever seeking victory was because <strong>God’s great name was in the line</strong>. God’s drive He declares in many areas especially in <strong>Ezekiel 36</strong> in rescuing His people is for the sake of His great name. And Here is Asa’s motive primarily for God’s great name.\r\n\r\n<strong>It is for God’s great name will He for Himself fight for His people and in that we should have confidence</strong>. In that Asa prayed and trusted God; and in that they rejoiced when God gave them victory. Because they had confidence in their God, He gave them rest in the days of no wars and the days of wars. The Ethiopian army did not prevail, if anything, Asa and his people received double for their trouble. God fought for and through them, and they gathered the spoils of the enemy.\r\n\r\nA man who seeks God,  God gives him rest from trouble and is confident in seeking Him in the days of trouble too because there is a relationship already established there. <strong>Hebrews 4:16, “Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”</strong>Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Chronicles 12:38, “All these men of war that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel, and all the rest of Israel were of one heart to make David king.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>All these Men of War: </strong>There were about 341,000 men of war, ready for battle. That was no small group of guys. These men were prepared and gathered for war, for battle, for right now. In this day and age it is easier to get men together for pizza and football, than for spiritual battles.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Keep rank: </strong>To get a rank, a position, one must prove themselves in some capacity. That is why our US military has boot camp. This is the front door that just gets you onto the team; it is the tryouts for the military. Then there is the OJT, (on the job training), all designed to see if you have what it takes to advance in ranks. As a martial arts instructor, I am one of those who have kept rank. I had to train very hard to get to the level that I am at. I am now more on the other side of the system, testing students to see if they have what it takes to excel up the ranks to black belt, and beyond. Some students keep rank, that is they earn a certain level and seem to stay there, while others continue to strive to advance to their ranks. Where do you want to be, just holding on or advancing forward? <strong>John 11:12</strong> reads, “<strong>From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it</strong>”. That hardly sounds passive. Where are you in the ranks, at a plateau, on the downward spiral, or advancing?\r\n\r\n<strong>Came with a Perfect Heart: </strong>Their hearts were unspotted in their pursuit of the task at hand. Sin, and divisiveness, could not be found abiding and having a part in their hearts. These men needed focus, purpose, direction, and ultimately victory. Before these men could have corporate public victory though, they had to have private victory in their own hearts. Half the battle is won in the boxing ring of your own heart and mind. We cannot expect to have public victory when we have private defeat in our hearts and minds. A gauge to use for this in the 10 Commandments. Why, because <strong>Romans 7:7</strong> says I would not have known sin except by the law. How do you measure up? Take a good self- check and examine yourself. <strong>Psalm 139:24-25</strong> is a great tool to use.\r\n\r\n<strong>To make David king over all of Israel</strong>: A godly leader is what was needed once private victory has been won, and your team has been assembled. The right leaders are needed. David a man after God’s own heart was the chosen leader.\r\n\r\n<strong>One Heart: </strong>Again unity is crucial in the battle. How can two walk together unless they be in agreement? A house divided against itself cannot stand. Abe Lincoln quoted this verse when trying to keep the North and South together which resulted in the Civil War. But these men became a team. <strong>Hebrews 10:25</strong>, tells is to assemble together. Too many Christians gather, but never assemble with the team. They live like an individual puzzle piece, when it’s obvious that there is a place in the puzzle that needs to assemble, aka “some assembly required.” No man is an island! There are all too many Scriptures that prod us to assemble in unity, to which <strong>John 17</strong> greatly shares on, the heart of Christ.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Battle: </strong>The men had a physical battle, and we have a spiritual one. We fight against the world, the flesh, and the devil. We also fight to win the lost unto Christ. That is the main reason we are left here, we are saved to serve God. That is why Jesus said in <strong>Matthew 9:36-37, “The harvest is truly plentiful, but the laborers (soldiers) are few”</strong>. Pray to the Lord of the harvest that he will send out laborers that he will send forth laborers in the harvest.\r\n\r\nAre you God’s warrior, tested and tried? How is your heart (clean/unclean)? Who is your spiritual leader? Are you unified in the local church, and are adding value not complaints to the ministry? Who keeps you accountable? Blessings, Phil"

              "<strong>2Chronicles 15:1-19, \"2 And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him: “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you. 3 For a long time Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law; 4 but when in their trouble they turned to the LORD God of Israel, and sought Him, He was found by them.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nTo grasp and understand the words of the prophet to Asa after God gave them great victory over Ethiopian in the previous chapter, we journey backwards to the book of Judges. In the last chapter as demonstrated in the last message, Asa had “<strong>Confidence in God</strong>”, the next chapter was to learn of the blessings that come about in the lives of those “<strong>Abiding in God</strong>”. The Book of Judges is a tragic account of how Yahweh [God] was taken for granted by His children year after year. Judges is a sad contrast to the book of Joshua which chronicles the blessings God bestowed on the Israelites for their obedience in conquering the land. In Judges, they were disobedient and idolatrous, leading to their many defeats.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn Asa's time, he chose to seek God and God gave him victory. To continue to enjoy God's faithfulness and blessings, he received this prophesy, <strong>vs. 2\" ...The LORD is with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you</strong>\". This was a promise with a condition. If you steadfastly adhere to the cause of God, you may expect a continuance of His favor; but if you abandon it, you will soon reap the bitter fruits of apostasy. This is no different to Jesus words <strong>in John 15:7, \"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you\"</strong>\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate that God always heard the cry of His people even in the midst of their rebellion, the prophet continued to remind him of these things, vs. “<strong>3 For a long time Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law;...”</strong> Israel had no true God because they exchanged the worship of God to worship of Baal, <strong>Judges 2:11-12, “11 Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the Baals; 12 and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; and they followed other gods from among the gods of the people who were all around them, and they bowed down to them; and they provoked the Lord to anger”</strong>. The Lord raised up judges, who saved them out of the hands of these raiders. Unlike their fathers, they quickly turned from the way in which their fathers had walked, the way of obedience to the LORD's commands when the priests were gone, <strong>Judges 2:16. </strong>Whenever the Lord raised up a judge for them, He was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived, <strong>“Yet they would not listen to their judges, but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers walked, in obeying the commandments of the Lord; they did not do so.”, Judges 2:17.</strong> The people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their fathers, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.\r\n\r\nAnd even with all their turning away, God never failed to open His arms of love to His people whenever they repented from their wicked ways and called upon His name, “vs. 2…<strong>but when in their trouble they turned to the LORD God of Israel, and sought Him, He was found by them”</strong>\r\n\r\nGod demonstrated His faithfulness when His people turned back to Him in repentance. And as a reminder to Asa of God’s faithfulness, God rescued him from the Ethiopians when he sought God. And God was promising to continue to do the same if he continued to seek him.\r\n\r\nToday marks the 12th anniversary of that fateful day 09/11/2001. The tragedy awakened America to their need for spiritual guidance, provision and protection. Churches were filled for a time, however soon after, many went back to their old ways. Around that time our nation cried to God to bring unity, peace and strength. Over the years that has been forgotten. In 2011 New York mayor Michael Bloomberg banned clergy and prayer at tenth anniversary commemoration ceremony of 9/11, which is a clear indication of not wanting God’s hands in the lives of people, government, nation. We need the hand of God as in the days of Asa, however we need to listen and keep the words of the prophet.<strong> Psalm 33:12 says, “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, The people He has chosen as His own inheritance”.</strong>\r\n\r\nAsa was going to be and remain blessed as long as God was the Lord of his kingdom and the same can be applied to our nation, it will be and stay blessed if God is the Lord of it. <strong>Jeremiah 2:13 \"My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water” (NIV). </strong>Do we want God’s way or our way? Our nation is currently demonstrating we want it our way but not with Asa, <strong>vs. “8 When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage…”</strong> and acted in what would keep him in the Lord by destroying what was a stumbling block and building that which was right.\r\n\r\nThat is our hope, tearing down what has stood in the way by the help of the Lord and building that which bring us closer and keeps us abiding in the Lord for there lies in our blessings.

              "<strong>2Chronicles 16:1-14, “7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him: \"Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the Lord your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand... 9 For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him. In this you have done foolishly; therefore from now on you shall have wars.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the last message we saw how God promised to give king Asa and the people of Judah peace and victory over their enemies if they remained with and in God<strong>. 2Chronicles 15:12, reads \"Then they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; ...15 - And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with all their soul; and He was found by them, and the LORD gave them rest all around</strong>\". This is God's promise to those who remain (abide) in Him.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nChapter 16 takes a strange turn, after 35 years of peace from and reliance on God, a threat was made to his kingdom by Baasha king of Israel, <strong>vs. “2 Then Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus,…”</strong>. Instead of turning to the Lord as he did in the days they were attacked by the Ethiopians who had double the size of the army he had, and having promised to turn to seek God when a prophesy was made, he took that which had been consecrated to the Lord and used it to get help from another king. Compared to what he faced with the Ethiopian army, this was way small. A man who learnt to trust God in the days of trouble, chose to go a different way. God is displeased when He is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on more than His power and goodness. God is displeased when men choose the way of the world to try and accomplish His started work. And more and more we learn of this even with churches that started small, trusting God by seeking Him but as years have gone by and have become successful, they become less and less dependent on God choosing other means to keep the ministry going, keep the people going. Same with many in business, family etc.\r\n\r\nIt is a foolish thing to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. And the message we would receive as that which was delivered to Asa vs. “<strong>7 … \"Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the Lord your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand”. </strong>This is like a child who has always relied on his father to help him cross the busy highway. Sooner or later, he feels like and insists he can do it by himself and uses other means and the father lets him do it. That is pure tragedy. And any man, nation, church that chooses to take its focus off of God and put it on the Syria of this world has exposed themselves to every danger. But see how deceitful our hearts are, we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when needs drives us to Him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them.\r\n\r\nIn the first message we saw how they built buildings, tower, gates, armies as a means by which God could use none, all or a portion of these for His glory. Here what would have been a means was turned into the object of deliverance. They needed to be reminded of this vs. \"<strong>9 For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him. In this you have done foolishly; therefore from now on you shall have wars.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe help of every creature must be used with an eye to the Creator, and in dependence on Him, who makes every creature that to us which it is, without whom the most skillful and faithful tools and people fail. It is not the size of your skills, back up or faith that is important, it is the object of your faith that really counts. To continue, Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/09/10/confidence-in-god-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Confidence In God, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/abiding-in-god-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Abiding In God, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>2Chronicles 16:1-14, “10 Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, for he was enraged at him because of this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time. ... 12 And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady was severe; yet in his disease he did not seek the Lord, but the physicians”</strong>\r\n\r\nIf there was anyone who could have made use of God’s provision by allowing himself to be an outlet, channel, instrument by which God would glorify Himself was Asa. Yet in some of the later decisions he made in his life cost him dearly. The bible says vs. <strong>“9…In this you have done foolishly…” </strong>perhaps to indicate that what he did was not necessarily sin because even at the end he was still considered a righteous man, but because he chose some things God had provided over God being the object of his living he finished poorly.<!--more-->The heart center of a Christian life is found right in the middle of the bible, meaning from Genesis to Revelation after putting all books and chapters in place, it's been said that <strong>Psalms 118:8</strong> is found right at the center of the bible. The same distance between Genesis to <strong>Psalm 118:8</strong> is the same distance from this verse to the book of Revelation. And it says <strong>“It is better to trust in the Lord Than to put confidence in man\", Psalm 118:8.</strong>\r\n\r\nAsa became angry when reproved, something he should have cherished. On the other hand, David humbled himself when reproved by Nathan and he repented allowing his relationship with God to be restored. In Asa’s anger, he put the seer in prison and those who held the same position as that of the seer. How well we are bent towards oppressing others who are instruments God uses to reprove us instead of accepting them as agents of change. Some become angry and leave or find ways to oppress the reprover. This rebuke was pungent and, from its truth and justness, ought to have penetrated and afflicted the heart of such a man as Asa. But his pride was offended at the freedom taken by the honest reprover of royalty, and in a burst of passionate resentment. If the Lord is no longer in charge, expect things to get out of control. That was the state of Saul when the presence of the Lord departed.\r\n\r\nThe Lord being gracious and slow to anger gave him another chance when he was sick, “<strong>12 And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady was severe; yet in his disease he did not seek the Lord, but the physicians”. </strong>He ended up dying almost two years later. He shows that it is useless to seek the physicians unless we first seek God to purge our sins, which are the chief cause of all our diseases, and later use the help of the physicians as a means by which God also works.\r\n\r\nAsa’s later days robbed God of the glory He would have enjoyed being God to Asa and his kingdom. Moses forfeited entering the promised land because He robbed God of the glory He would have enjoyed. Instead of speaking to the rock to provide water, he became angry at the Israelites and struck the rock twice. Read what happened, <strong>Numbers 20:12, “Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, \"BECAUSE YOU DID NOT BELIEVE ME, TO HALLOW ME IN THE EYES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nFor the sake of God’s great name, we ought to make <strong>Psalm 118</strong> our daily cry<strong>. Psalm 118:1 “Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever. 2 Let Israel now say, \"His mercy endures forever.\" 3 Let the house of Aaron now say, \"His mercy endures forever.\" 4 Let those who fear the Lord now say, \"His mercy endures forever.\" 5 I called on the Lord in distress; The Lord answered me and set me in a broad place. 6 The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? 7 The Lord is for me among those who help me; Therefore I shall see my desire on those who hate me. 8 It is better to trust in the Lord Than to put confidence in man. 9 It is better to trust in the Lord Than to put confidence in princes. 10 All nations surrounded me, But in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. 11 They surrounded me, Yes, they surrounded me; But in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. 12 They surrounded me like bees; They were quenched like a fire of thorns; For in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. 13 You pushed me violently, that I might fall, But the Lord helped me. 14 The Lord is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation. 15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation Is in the tents of the righteous; The right hand of the Lord does valiantly. 16 The right hand of the Lord is exalted; The right hand of the Lord does valiantly. 17 I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of the Lord. 18 The Lord has chastened me severely, But He has not given me over to death. 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go through them, And I will praise the Lord. 20 This is the gate of the Lord, Through which the righteous shall enter. 21 I will praise You, For You have answered me, And have become my salvation. 22 The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone. 23 This was the Lord's doing; It is marvelous in our eyes. 24 This is the day the Lord has made; We will rejoice and be glad in it. 25 Save now, I pray, O Lord; O Lord, I pray, send now prosperity. 26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! We have blessed you from the house of the Lord. 27 God is the Lord, And He has given us light; Bind the sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar. 28 You are my God, and I will praise You; You are my God, I will exalt You. 29 Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever”</strong>\r\n\r\nGod plagued both Asa and Moses' rebellion and by this declared that it is nothing to begin well, unless we continue to the end, that is, zealous for God's glory and put our whole trust in Him. God says, “<strong>23 And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord,\" says the Lord God, \"when I am hallowed in you before their eyes”, Ezekiel 36:23. </strong>You leave God out and you have no chance. And involving Him is not for your name sake but His “<strong>For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him.\"</strong> , <strong>2Chronicles 16:9. </strong>Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/mans-reliance-on-god-is-for-gods-glory-part-1of2-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Man's Reliance On God Is For God's Glory, Part 1of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/abiding-in-god-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Abiding In God, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/09/10/confidence-in-god-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Confidence In God, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "I know that the title of this article will possibly raise some worried eyebrows. At first glance, some might say to themselves, \"Oh no, Keith has gone too far this time!\" But let me quickly put those possible reactions to rest. To the question, \"What's wrong with the Gospel?\" <strong>I can easily answer, \"Absolutely nothing!\" That is, of course, if you're talking about the Gospel of the Bible - the very message that Jesus preached - what the apostles Peter, Paul, John, and the others devoted their very lives (and deaths) to. <em>(Phil. 1:20-21)<!--more--></em></strong>\r\n\r\nNo, there's nothing at all wrong with this message from heaven. But what about the stuff that's being preached today? Is it truly \"gospel-preaching\"? Are the evangelists that preach in churches and arenas, on radio and television - are they preaching what Jesus called the Gospel?1 And what about the mountains of modern \"gospel literature\"? You know, the tracts, pamphlets, comic books, newspapers, etc. Do they really contain the same message - the whole message - about the salvation that Jesus offered? How are we answering the awesome question that people are still asking the Church, as they asked on the day of Pentecost, \"<strong>Men and brethren, what shall we do to be saved?\"</strong>2\r\n\r\n<strong>Is Our Gospel The Gospel?I believe with all my heart that Jesus would be ashamed of most of the \"gospel\" messages and sermons that are being preached today, mainly because they lack almost every major point He Himself preached on. <em>(Mark 8:38; Rom. 1:16; II Tim. 1:8) </em>How dare we try to change the Gospel. </strong><em>We remove most of its vital parts, and replace them with artificial limbs of our own. (Gal. 1:6-7)</em>\r\n\r\nIsn't Jesus the master evangelist? Shouldn't we judge our evangelism by His example?3 Was His message anything like what we're hearing today? It is my intention to try to briefly cover in Section 1 each of the major parts of the Gospel that have been \"surgically\" removed in most of today's preaching. And in Section 2, we will go over each of the \"new additions\" that have become a very part of our modern gospel.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Removed Parts Of The Gospel</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1. The Blood of Jesus.</strong> It's a fact that the very word <strong>blood</strong> scares people. It's also a fact that the blood of Christ scares the devil, because it is the only cleansing agent for a sin-sick soul.4 Can you imagine what the preaching and writings of Paul would have been like, if he had been as squeamish in proclaiming the magnificent power and beauty of the blood of Jesus as our generation of preachers are? <strong>What we have now is a bloodless gospel!</strong>\r\n\r\nToday, people are afraid to think and preachers are afraid to make them. The whole concept of Jesus being the Passover Lamb of the Old Testament5 has been lost - \"It takes too much time and thought to explain,\" you will hear some say. <em>(Heb. 5:11-14) </em>\"<em>We need to simplify the Gospel so that we can reach the masses</em>.\" Oh, what logic! <strong><em>Remove the blood from the preaching of the Gospel, and you remove the power to conquer the devil for the souls of men!</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. The Cross of Jesus</strong>. Paul said, <strong><em>\"</em>I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.\"<em> (I Cor. 2:2</em></strong><em>) </em>Nowadays it's \"<strong>Jesus Christ and what He can do for you!\"</strong> You cannot have more exact opposites than the <strong>Bible's Christ-centered Gospel,6 and our modern, cross-less, me-centered gospel.</strong>\r\n\r\nToday, if anyone preaches self-denial as a condition of discipleship, you can hear the comments afterwards: \"old-fashioned,\" \"harsh,\" \"legalistic.\" I dare say that our Lord would have as much trouble finding acceptance among our preachers as He had among the religious leaders of His own day. <strong>Here's what A.W. Tozer says about the cross...</strong> <em>\"The cross is the most revolutionary thing ever to appear among men. The cross of Roman times knew no compromise, it never made concessions. It won all its arguments by killing its opponent and silencing him for good. It spared not Christ, but slew Him the same as the rest. He was alive when they hung Him on that cross. and completely dead when they took Him off of it. That was the cross the first time it appeared in Christian history.With perfect knowledge of all this, Christ said, 'If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself take up his cross and follow Me.' So the cross not only brought Christ's life to an end, it also ends the first life, the old life of every one of His true followers...this and nothing less is true Christianity. We must do something about the cross, and there's only one of two things we can do - </em><strong><em>flee it or die upon it!\"</em> to continue</strong>\r\nReference\r\n\r\n1) Matt 4:23; Mark 1:14-15; Luke 3:16-18.  2) Luke 3:10,12,14; Acts 2:37,16:30 3) Eph. 5:1, I Peter2:21; I John 2:6  4) Matt. 26:28; Acts 20:28; Rom. 3:25, 5:9; Eph. 1:7, 2:13; Col. 1:20; Heb. 9:14,22, 10:19, 13:12; I Peter 1:2; I John 1:7; Rev. 1:5, 5:9, 12:11, 19:13. 5) Exodus 12:23-24; Isaiah 53:7; Luke 22:15; John 1:29,36; I Cor. 5:7; I Peter 1:19; Rev. 5:6,12, 7:14, 22:1,3. 6) Matt 10:38; Luke 14:27; I Cor. 1:17-18; Gal. 6:14; Eph. 2:6; Col. 1:20; I Peter 2:24"

              "<strong>Continued Missing Parts,</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>3. The Threat and Terrors of Hell, and the Guilt of Sinners.</strong> We often hear people say, \"I'm tired of hell-fire and brimstone preaching!\" \"Well,\" I often reply, \"when was the last time you heard any?\" It is true, very few people preach on hell anymore - it is no longer in vogue. We shouldn't scare the poor sinners, no, that wouldn't do. <strong>They're just unfortunate, misguided souls, right?</strong> Wrong! The Bible clearly shows that they are rebels who have robbed and dishonored the living God, infinitely offending Him.7 They have no right to look at themselves in any other light.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nBut we, smart as we are, have decided to help God along. He doesn't understand our generation as well as we do. The things Jesus emphasized in His preaching were all right for the Jews, but our generation needs a more gentle, loving tone. \"Tell 'em about heaven!\" We talk about heaven, about the \"rewards of being born-again,\" but we completely neglect the other side of the \"two-edged sword.\" <em>(Heb. 4:12) </em>What right do we have to remove things from the Gospel that Jesus Himself gave great place to in His own preaching?8\r\n\r\n<strong>4. The Law of God Preached to Convict One of Sin.</strong> Pages could be written on this subject, but there is room for only one brief example. When the rich young ruler came to Jesus, he asked a very direct question: \"<strong>Good Master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?</strong>\" Can you imagine what our preachers would answer him today? <strong>\"Just admit you're a sinner, accept Jesus as your Personal Savior, go to church, pay your tithes, try to be good, and you're in!\"</strong> But what was Jesus' answer? \"You know the commandments... if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.\" <em>(Matt 19:17; Mark 10:19) </em><strong>The commandments?? </strong>Why they went out with Cecil B. DeMille! Isn't this the \"age of grace\"?\r\n\r\n<strong>Well, the truth is Jesus wasn't preaching the commandments to him as the way of salvation, He was using the commandments to specifically convict him of his particular sin - greed</strong>. That rich boy loved the bucks, and Jesus knew just how to flush him out of the bushes - <strong>preach the Law! </strong>And that's exactly what the Law is for- <strong>\"For <em>through the Law comes the knowledge of sin\" (Rom. 3:20</em></strong><em>), </em>that's what Paul said. <strong>The Law must be preached - not as the way of salvation, but as a searchlight put on the sinner's heart, so he can see how utterly rotten he is, compared to the way God requires him to be. <em>(Gal. 3:24)</em></strong>\r\n\r\nBut today again, we are wiser than God. Our preaching isn't filled with \"dos and don'ts.\" No, we don't want to scare the \"liberated generation\" away. Why, if we said that fornication was wrong, or drugs, or abortion, or any other specific sin, people would feel all condemned and then how could they get saved? But that's just it, <strong>Jesus preached the Law to the rich young ruler so that, after feeling condemned about his greed, he could turn and obey Jesus and find true treasure in heaven. <em>\"Go and sell all you possess and give it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven, and come, follow Me.\" (Mark 10:21)</em>Unless people are truly convicted of sin, if they do not fully see that they are totally condemned by the requirements of God's Law, then it is virtually impossible to show them the need for a savior.</strong> Why, what would they need to be saved from? <strong>Fun?</strong>\r\n\r\nThat is why our modern gospel must dwell on \"all the good things God will do for you if you'd just accept Him!\" We can't convince a sinner that he needs a savior by just getting him to admit that, \"Well, generally, yes, I am a sinner<strong>.\" He must see how the Law of God totally condemns him as a sinner,9 and then the beauty of the Gospel, the glory of the cross, the marvelous power of Christ's blood will be able to penetrate his anxious, waiting mind and heart</strong>. <strong>Only by the preaching of the Law can a man fully desire to be saved from his sin</strong>. For,<em> \"I would not have come to know sin except through the Law. \"(Rom. 7:7).

              "<strong>Continued Missing Parts,</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>5. The Fear of God and the Judgment Seat of Christ.</strong>Instead of the awesome majesty of Jehovah, today the Lord is presented as a sort of \"ice cream man-Santa Claus.\" And the Church is the \"candy store\" where you can get \"every goodie your heart desires.\" Jesus Himself is portrayed as \"a sweetie pie,\" so good, so loving, so forgiving, and so gentle, that you can almost hear the preacher whisper, \"Aw, He wouldn't hurt a fly...\" But what happened <strong>to <em>\"It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God\" (Heb. 10:31) </em>or <em>\"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom'? (Proverbs </em>9:10)10<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nThe wise, new editors of modern preaching rhetoric have conveniently wiped out every reference to the Almighty's severity while emphasizing only His kindness. <strong>This they do, ignoring the balanced, biblical view of Paul, <em>\"Behold then the kindness and severity of God.\" (Rom. 11:22)</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Repentance as Necessary for Forgiveness. </strong>Ithas always amazed me how the Church could have evolved to such a state as it is in now, with such clear, direct teaching from the Lord Jesus as to what is necessary to be right with God. Please read the first five verses of the 13th chapter of Luke. Here, Jesus is told the news about some Galileans who were executed by the Romans. He then says, <em>\"</em><strong><em>Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish</em></strong><em>.\"</em> Using another example, He then repeats the same exact sentence.\r\n\r\n<strong>I cannot conceive of conversion without repentance</strong>. The teachings of Jesus and the apostles are full of commands to \"<strong>repent and be saved</strong>!\"11 <strong>Repentance is not just \"being sorry\" - that is only conviction. Repentance is not merely a change of heart and a change of mind, it is a change of action</strong>! God requires that if we are sincerely convinced that sin is wrong, then we will turn from it to God, and commit ourselves to not take part in sinful deeds any longer. <strong>God blesses such decisions and commitments with abundant grace. And it is by that grace that we can fulfill the desires of the Spirit within us.</strong>\r\n\r\nBut because there is so little real conviction of sin brought about by the preaching of our modern gospel, we cannot truly require repentance anymore. If we did, no one would \"come forward\" at all. <strong>For repentance is easy to him who sees how ugly and horrible sin is, but repentance is impossible where the Law does not convince the sinner of his wicked heart, compelling him to turn from his sin into the arms of a waiting, compassionate God</strong>. <strong>You see, all these removed parts of the Gospel are connected. In God's wisdom, every aspect of the appointed way of salvation is irreplaceable</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>It is true that without God loving us first, we could not be saved. He made the first move, He always does. But He will not do what He requires of the sinner himself to do - and that is to repent!</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>7. God's Sorrow and Broken Heart Over Sin</strong>. The picture of God as presented today by evangelists is that of an optimist - a positive-thinking good ole boy who lives in heaven, high above the trouble on earth, where everything is rosy, \"and the skies are not cloudy all day.\" Why, how could anything bother the living God? He isn't really troubled by all the mess down here, He has <strong>everything under control!</strong>\r\nBut again, the Bible paints a different picture of our King. Just look at Jesus weeping over Jerusalem <em>(Luke 19:41), </em>or the pleadings of God with the nation of Israel through the prophets Isaiah or Ezekiel.12 This God, the one in the Bible, is continually striving with men through His Spirit. It says in Proverbs, <em>\"</em><strong><em>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, watching the evil and the good.\" (Proverbs 15:3)</em></strong>That means that God saw every rape committed today, He saw every murder, every person that starved to death, every pornographic film and book, every abused and battered child. <strong>How can anyone believe that He sees this and does not grieve? </strong>Of course God can grieve. Doesn't the Bible implore us not to <strong><em>\"grieve the Holy Spirit of God\"? (Eph. 4:30)</em></strong>\r\n\r\nYou see, God is the most hurt and dishonored being in the universe. He could stop all this mess, all the perversion and crime and corruption any time He wishes, but He doesn't! Why? Because He waits for the souls of men and women. <em>\"</em><strong><em>Regard the patience of our Lord to be salvation,\" </em>Peter said. <em>(II Peter 3:15)</em></strong>But the Church, which doesn't have one millionth of the compassion that God has<strong>, has turned around and created a god in its own image and likeness</strong>. A carefree, cheerful, above-it-all God. And then the Church has conveniently removed from the \"gospel\" it presents all reference to the pain and sorrow in God's heart. The Church doesn't want a God who's grieved with sin, because then this God would be grieved with them... (and He is!)13 To Continue\r\n\r\n10) See also Deut. 5:29, 10:12; Joshua 24:14; II Kings 17:39; Psalm 2:11, 15:4, 19:9, 25:14, 31:19, 33:18, 34:7,9,11, 52:6 60:4, 67:7, 72: 5, 85:9, 86:11, 103:11,13,17; 111:5, 112:1, 147:11; Proverbs 8:13, 10:27, 13:13, 14:26-27, 15:16, 16:6, 19:23, 23:17, 28:14, 31:30; Isaiah 8:13; Jer. 32:39-40; Malachi 3:16, 4:2; Matt. 10:28; Luke 1:50; Acts 10:35, 13:26; II Cor 7:1; Eph 5:21; Phil. 2:12, Heb. 12:29; I Peter 1:17; Rev. 14:7\r\n\r\n11) Psalm 7:12; Isiah 30:15; Ezek. 18:32; Matt. 3:2; Mark 1:5, 6:7,12; Acts 2:38, 3:19, 8:22, 17:30, 26:19-20; Rev. 2:5,16, 3:3,19\r\n\r\n12) Isiah 1:18, 54:7; Exek. 18:23,32, 33:11; Hosea 11:8.\r\n\r\n13) Psalm 78:40-41; Mark 3:5."

              "<strong>Continued Missing Parts,</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>8. The Necessity of Holiness to Please God.</strong> Hebrews says <strong>without holiness <em>\"no one shall see the Lord.\" (12:14)</em></strong>It is true that Jesus commands us to be perfect. <em>(Matt. 5:48) </em>It is also true that you most likely have never met a perfect person, nor do you probably ever expect to be perfect yourself. Nevertheless, we still have those uncomfortable words of the Lord, <em>\"</em><strong><em>Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect\"</em></strong><em></em>\r\n\r\nNow, because of our dilemma in finding ourselves to be such numskulls, and seeing the demands of Jesus, we have invented some pretty interesting and <em>caraaazzeey</em> doctrines. Some Christians have said, \"Well, when God looks at us, He doesn't really see us anymore, He sees Jesus instead. And when there's ever sin in our hearts, if God should happen to look at the wrong moment, He'll see a smiling face of Jesus there, instead of seeing our sin. So God sees me as holy - even though I'm not! But...I really am...er, well, you know what I mean!\" (I don't happen to believe that God is that easily fooled, not even by Christians.)<!--more-->\r\nAnother stranger-than-truth doctrine is that blessed refuge of backsliders called \"the carnal Christian.\" In this example of pretzel-logic, we are led to believe that any \"believer\" who isn't really \"walking with the Lord\" at the present time, and is indulging in the things of the world and the lusts of the flesh, can still be considered a \"Christian,\" but not a Christian of the 1st class, no, a Christian of the 2ndclass... a \"<strong>carnal </strong>Christian.\" Here we have a case of the \"believer\" who doesn't believe. Oh, he still \"believes\" that God is God, and that there is a heaven and hell, and so on (<strong>but don't forget, the devil believes all these things too!-James 2:19</strong>). He knows all the right things to say to convince granny, the pastor, and his Christian friends that he's still hanging in there. He even sort of believes it himself. Seems he's got everybody fooled - everybody that is, except God! The Bible is clear that <strong><em>\"If we say we' have fellowship with Him, and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. \" (I John 1:6)</em>14</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Today, possibly the greatest insult to the Gospel has been the almost total neglect of the preaching of holiness for the Christian. Jesus doesn't want to make believe that we're holy, He wants to impart His holiness to us by the Holy Spirit. But because people are not being driven to the cross, convicted by His Law to repentance and real rebirth, then we have to spend hours in our seminaries trying to find suitable, complicated ways to explain away the obvious meanings of Scripture.</strong>\r\n\r\nTo all this you might be saying, \"<strong>But what about all those people getting saved by the efforts of good men and ministries out there?</strong> They're not preaching the way you say they should, and they <strong>still</strong> have converts!\" Well, the immediate answer to that question is, \"<strong>THE PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING SAVED BECAUSE</strong> <strong>OF THEIR MESSAGES, THEY'RE GETTING SAVED IN SPITE OF THEM.\"</strong> But unfortunately, many of the people who make \"decisions for Christ\" through large evangelistic crusades, do not even attend church regularly in the years that follow. (And as you probably well know, \"attending church regularly\" does not guarantee that one is a true believer.) But let's take a closer look at what kind of \"converts\" today's gospel usually produces. To continue"

              "<strong>What's Specifically Wrong With Our Modern Gospel?</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1.It's Me-Centered Instead of Christ-Centered.</strong> First and foremost, it is the gospel that appeals to the selfish. Instead of honoring God, it places the sinner at the center of God's love and plan. But the Bible places Jesus at the center of God's plan, <strong>not</strong> the sinner.\r\n\r\nOne of the most well-known phrases of modern evangelism is \"<strong>God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life!\"</strong> But the sober, biblical truth that needs to be presented to the sinner's mind is \"<strong>You have made yourself an enemy of God, and in your present state of rebellion there is absolutely no hope for you</strong>.\" In fact, God's \"plan\" for the sinner at this point in his life is to separate him from His presence forever, in hell. However unpopular or unlovely that may sound, it is the only truth and reality about anyone who is an enemy of God through sin.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe whole line of reasoning in our modern gospel continues on and on in this mistaken way. \"Sin has separated you from God, 'and His wonderful plan for your life.' Jesus came and died on the cross, so that you may experience 'His wonderful plan for your life.' You must accept Jesus now, so that you will not miss out on 'His wonderful plan for your life!'\" <strong>You, you, you, you!!! It's all for YOU! </strong>I'm not sorry to say this, but Jesus did it all in obedience, for His <strong>Father's </strong>glory.<em>(Phil. 2:8-12) </em>Of course, it infinitely benefits those who love, serve, and honor Him, but that was a secondary consideration, not the primary one. (Please read Ezek. 36:22-32.) If people come to Jesus mainly to <strong>get</strong> a blessing, or only to <strong>get</strong> forgiveness, they will ultimately be disappointed. But if they come to <strong>give</strong> Him their lives in honor and worship, then they will truly have forgiveness and joy - more than they could ever imagine! <em>(I Cor. 2:9)</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. It's Shallow, Cheap, and Offered as a \"Bargain.\"</strong>Our gospel reduces the good news to a \"come and get it while you can\" sale. We make every effort to take all the bones out - everything that might offend someone, might make them hesitate or put off their decision. Jesus didn't do this. <strong>He never lowered the requirements for anyone</strong>. <strong>One had to be completely sincere, totally humbled, having counted the cost, willing to leave everything, family and property, \"count all things loss\" so that they might \"gain Christ.\"</strong> <em>(Phil 3:7-8) </em>When that same rich young ruler <em>\"</em><strong><em>went away sad, for he had many possessions\" (Matt. 19:22</em></strong><em>), </em><strong>Jesus didn't go running after him shouting, \"Hey, wait a minute! Let's talk this thing over, it isn't as bad as it might sound. Maybe I was a little too harsh!\"</strong>\r\n\r\nMaybe we're so eager to \"see the converts,\" to publish \"how many got saved at our last concert\" in the bulletins to our supporters, that we'll do anything to rush someone into a \"decision\" before he's had a chance to really make one. The problem is, if you have to rush him into it, he probably will change his mind later anyway. For as a friend of mine says, \"If somebody can talk them into it, somebody can talk them out of it!\" <em>(I Cor. 1:17)</em>To continue"

                  "Thank you for these comments.  It is one of my major concerns with what we often call \"prosperity gospel\" as opposed to the true Gospel and it is so prevalent  in many of our Megachurches, popular Christian music and  televangelists here in the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a very young Master of Divinity student, younger than all my classmates, at a Lutheran seminary the professors used to talk about this as the need to preach \"law and Gospel\", one of the unique historic focuses of Lutheran theology dating back to the works of the historic founder, Martin Luther, in Europe of the 1500s, the founder of what most see as what became the \"Protestant\" movement.\r\n\r\nAll of us fall short of the Love of God for all of us sin daily so that none of us can boast (to paraphrase the famous passage in Romans) and we must consciously make a choice, an effort,to turn to Christ instead of away from Him, but it is in that state of sin  -- those things WE do and think -- that separate or harm or relationship with God and with our neighbors, -- that we need God's mercy for without it we would surely burn in hell.  We cannot save ourselves for no matter how good we believe we might be and no matter how focused we are on the \"persona aspect\" of Salvation today, we are all sinners, whether the President of a nation,a laborer, a farmer, a business person or an ordained minister of The Gospel.  As an old European hymn was titled, \"Chief of Sinners Though I Be, Christ's Blood Was Shed for me\" -- there's the \"Me\" word again but the context is not feel good, often materialistic praise music, it is the image of pain and suffering of our Lord which each of us and our ancestors and or children and grandchildren caused.  If we're going to get \"personal\" as people do so much, forgetting the \"sin\" part of our modern Gospel in our preaching and in our songs (and don't  get me wrong, I love some modern Christian music having spent a number of years as a Partner, Program Director and Presenter at a U.S. Christian broadcasting network), then we need remember that we are responsible, each of us collectively and individually, for the horrible crucification of Christ, our Lord as sure as if we had beat Him on the way to the Cross,hung him on the Cross ourselves and put the nails in his wrists ourselves.\r\n\r\nThank you for reminding us of the core of the Gospel!"

              "<strong>What's Specifically Wrong With Our Modern Gospel?</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Salvation is Shown as a Barter or Trade, Instead of the Result of Obedience by Faith.</strong> We offer forgiveness of sin like Monty Hall on \"Let's Make a Deal.\" I've even heard, \"<strong>You give Jesus your sin, and He'll give you salvation in return!\"</strong> <strong>No one in the Bible ever thought so low of the grace of God to talk about the gift of eternal life like it was for trade</strong>. <strong>It is a gift!</strong> You can't earn it, or buy it, or give anything in return for it. How it must offend the Holy Spirit to hear people talk of His Jesus so. <em>(Acts 8:18-23)<!--more--></em>\r\n\r\n<strong>4. It Produces Selfish, \"Blessed,\" and Feelings-Oriented \"Converts.\"</strong> Anyone who is made to believe he becomes a Christian under such preaching will seldom bring forth the true fruits of a real convert. He will remain just as selfish as he always was, only now his selfishness will take on a religious form. If he wants something for himself, he will say he \"has a burden\" for something, or he will say, \"It is the desire of my heart,\" or some other religious-sounding phrase like that. He will pray selfishly, desiring blessings for himself, and even if he does pray for others, it usually will be for selfish reasons. After all, when he \"accepted the Lord,\" he was told how much Jesus wanted to bless him and how much God had stored up for his account, and how the Bible was like \"a checkbook full of promises, just waiting to be cashed!\"\r\nSuch a person always seeks to \"feel\" good about himself, his own church, his own pastor, etc. His whole world is built on <strong>feeling blessed</strong>. <strong>He was never shown how he was created to bless God... God was not created to bless him. <em>(Psalm 149:4; Phil. 2:13)</em></strong>\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the \"converts\" described above are not like those pictured in the book of Acts, when the Church was new and the fire was hot. Take a look at <em>Acts 2:41-47 </em>and <em>4:31-35, </em>and you will see the tender spirit of love, and the mighty spirit of power that prevailed among the brethren in those early days. I believe that one of the great reasons that <em>\"</em><strong><em>everyone kept feeling a sense of awe\" (Acts 2:43),</em></strong>was because <em>\"</em><strong><em>they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to prayer. \"(vs. 42)</em></strong>Ibelieve that Peter and the others made every effort to convey the whole message of the Gospel when they preached and taught, and that is why the Spirit of God could anoint and bless the new converts so powerfully- <strong>GOD ALWAYS ANOINTS THE TRUTH!</strong> <em>(Isaiah 55:11)</em>"

              "<strong>Mark 9:14-29,\"...But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAs we know no one has everything together, we all have things we are dealing big or small. I want us to remember, <strong>where there is a will, there is away; where there is a problem, there is the solver of the problem; where there is hope, there is life; and where there is faith there is trust.</strong> Often times people don't excel because of what they believe a lie leaving them condemned. All they have left is to nurse all the failures and defeats they encountered previously. As long as I have breath in me, I'm going to keep pumping life in Christ and knowing that regardless of what I have gone through as long as it did not kill me, it gave me an opportunity to understand that greater things have been deposited in my spirit not to be terminated prematurely. You and I did not come this far to call it a quit, we still need find God given ways to stand through the test of time <strong>“for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring.\", Acts 17:28.<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nA loving father in <strong>Mark 9</strong> had a child who was deaf and dumb. Many diseases Jesus healed, He did not get into details trying to figure out when it started, what the symptoms were etc. but for some unknown reasons He asked in details on this particular case. He tried to get some information about who this child was and what he had.\r\n\r\nJust before Jesus appeared in the scene <strong>vs. 14, \" ...one of the crowd answered and said, \"Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a mute spirit... So I spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they could not\"</strong>. We see a caring father out to get help for his son, he brings his son in search for Jesus. Instead of finding Jesus, he met some of His disciples and I can imagine the father of the child thinking that since these people had been with Jesus, they must have seen what Jesus regularly did and therefore they could perform the same miracles, unfortunately they were unable.\r\n\r\nThe question I pondered on was this, was it because they were never equipped to do the job or was it a job just for the Master? Jesus tells us in <strong>John 14:12, \"verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than this shall he do</strong>\", with this verse, it's very clear that Jesus would have loved to see His disciples do what He had been doing, the things He had been teaching them. <strong>Mark 9:19, \"He answered him and said, \"O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you?</strong>\" this would imply that He needed not to be there for the healing to take place for He had already given them power however that power needed to be fueled by prayer and fasting.\r\n\r\nWe need to have faith that He who is in control is bigger than the situation and the circumstances around you and I. The reason why many cannot trust God with their situation is because they limit God. To increase your faith, begin to praise Him, magnify His name, talk about His names, His nature and you will see how your faith elevated to a greater level. With faith elevated, what you are dealing with will be too small in your eyes as you see the Lord bigger than it. Understand that whatever is impossible with man is possible with God; whatever gets out of man's control does not get out of the Lord's control. Have faith in God and the signs of victory, rain, joy, peace shall follow because what intimidates you does not move Him. All the disciples needed in this case was faith accompanied by prayer and fasting to complete the job. We too need the faith and prayers and in many times fasting added. To continue"

              "<strong>Mark 9:14-29,\"...But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIf there is a being that loves to put up a show to intimidate people is non other than Satan. And for God to show His great power, He lets Satan in many cases display his powers only to be crushed by God’s. We saw this with Moses in Egypt when Aaron cast Moses’ rod on the ground and it turned into a serpent, did not God let the magicians do the same?, however Moses’ rod turned into a serpent swallowed theirs.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Mark 9</strong> we see the same trick as a father brought his son to Jesus after the disciples failed to heal him. The father said, <strong>Mark 9:17&amp;18, \"... Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a mute spirit. Vs. 18 And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. vs. 20, \"Then they brought him to Him. and when he saw Him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming at the mouth. vs. ...22, \"And often he has thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him\".</strong> This father is describing the condition of his son. It must have broken his heart to be helpless to save his son already in a helpless stage. This was not something that recently started, it had been with him since he was young . I believe that there were occasions when he was okay and then there would come times when he would be seriously attacked.\r\n\r\nFathers want to see their children become somebody in life when they grow up, all this father was trying his best to do was to keep his son alive especially from harm’s way. I don't know about you but I see this kind of thing happening in my life often times as a child of God. There are times I feel so fine and there are so many victories coming my way and then there comes times when I am thrown on the ground by the attacks from hell, at times I have been thrown into the fire and water with the aim to destroy me, there have been times where I wasn't sure of what was going on. Then there came times when the thing I was battling left me for a season and I kind of rejoiced that I wouldn't have to deal with it anymore, before long it came back again. Have you felt an attack that left you helpless?\r\n\r\nAnd Jesus said, <strong>Mark 9:19\"... Bring Him to Me, vs. 20, Then they brought him to Him. And when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming at the mouth\"</strong>. Just because we are in the presence of God does not stop the enemy from doing his dirty work. The moment they brought the boy to Jesus, instead of the evil spirits leaving, they put a show. They did the same things they had been doing to him before they brought him to the Lord. The things the enemy used to do to you before you became saved, he is still doing it today especially now that you belong to the kingdom if you are saved. If he was on your case with bitterness before you crossed over, check again and see if it left you. How about pride, lust and even fear. You know what amazes me about the story is that when all these things were happening, Jesus just stood there still and watched, not even moved an inch, not even intimidated and yet it was severe site to watch. You and I have to remember that <strong>Jesus is moved by our feelings when we are in tough situations, but He is not intimidated or moved by the issues that come against us. </strong>He does not leave when the going gets tough for us.\r\n\r\nWe have this joy that no matter what the enemy does, as long as we are in God's presence, all will be well. Even if the situation does not change His presence alone gives us comfort that He has all under control. <strong>He is touched by our feelings and not moved by situations, there is nothing impossible with Him.</strong> To continue, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Mark 9:14-29,\"...But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us\"</strong>\r\n\r\nA father had faith for his child to be healed the moment he brought him to Jesus. Once His disciples could not do anything for his son and looking at the condition of his son and how worse it was getting. Then looking at how the spirits were terrorizing his boy even in the presence of Jesus, his faith from his request to Jesus suggest that he had very little hope, he says \"<strong>But if You can do anything have compassion on us and help us</strong>\". The word \"IF\" sounded like a doubt in Jesus' ability to heal. If you doubt someone's ability, then how will you have faith in them? \"WHEN\" is the word of assurance, that is the word of faith this father needed. He needed help for his son, however, he also needed help to believe that it could be done. My prayer is that we will take our faith off \"IF\" and move it to \"WHEN\" for that is where the Lord would have us put our faith. He can do it period, it's just a matter of WHEN. The bible says that, \"<strong>He makes all things beautiful in His time\"<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Mark 9:23,</strong> \"<strong>Jesus said to him, \"If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes\".</strong> <strong>The Lord's power mixed with the gift of faith He gives us produces victory</strong>. I don't know how people can receive something if they don't believe that the one they are coming to has the capability to do it. Here the Lord is telling him that all he has to do is believe, not analyze, try and see what is around that can be used to make it happen. All things are possible to him that believes. To confirm this, many times when Jesus reached out to people, what did He say? <strong>\"Your faith has made thee whole</strong>\" It's our faith in God that makes all things possible. <strong>Hebrews 11:1, \"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen\"</strong>, we all hope for something from the Lord that hasn't been revealed or seen yet. In the midst of it, we are trusting and believing that with time it will come. What people hope for, they look forward to receiving as opposed to someone who is not sure. However big or small the thing you hope for, just remember that the size does not intimidate Jesus for there is nothing too difficult for Him. <strong>Jesus may ask you to push a huge rock but that does not mean He expects you to move it.</strong> <strong>You push, He does the moving, you enjoy the victory and He gets all the glory (credit).</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Mark 9:24,</strong> \"Immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, \"Lord, I believe; help my unbelief\" , NIV translation reads the last portion this way \"<strong>I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief\"</strong>, this line sounds confusing for one instant he says he believes and then says help my unbelief. He believed the healing could happen at the same time he was not so sure to what extent. He also believed it could happen but he was not as calm as Jesus and so his prayer was that Jesus would boost his faith to the level of His, to see things the way Jesus did. I have the faith in God to know that He can, now I need my faith to be elevated to a greater level where I can be calm about it, no be intimidated by situation any more for I have faith that negates the facts. If you have unbelief, ask the Lord to help you overcome it for whatever you requested of Him is already settled, now faith is the vehicle the Lord will use to bring it to pass. Can you see how this father was so open to admit his weak faith and asking for help? his admission and seeking resulted to something greater than what he had before meeting Jesus. <strong>Faith established is not just for today's miracle but even greater things to come.</strong>\r\n\r\nI can now see why Jesus was not too quick to heal the boy till he established faith in his father. So don't freak out when what you prayed for is delayed, you could still be in \"Faith Class\" being prepared for something bigger than the current situation. The current situation is a faith booster, it's an eye opener. It also teaches you that Jesus cares that is why He is moved by our feelings....

              "<strong>Mark 9:14-29,\"...But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us\"</strong>\r\n\r\nTo conclude, let's see the man's faith and Jesus power did.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mark 9:25, \"... He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, \"Deaf and dumb spirit, I command you to come out of him and enter him no more!”.</strong> There are some things you can ask to leave. Anything terrorizing you and I have to be commanded to leave. The enemy cannot be begged to leave, he has to be commanded. In the case of Joshua, <strong>Zechariah 3:1-2“1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him. 2 And the Lord said to Satan, \"The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! “. </strong>Jesus rebuked and commanded. <!--more-->\r\nRebuke is to turn back or keep down which makes me believe we need to send back the delivered package by the enemy. vs. 26, <strong>\"Then the spirit cried out, convulsed him greatly, and came out of him\"</strong>, the command was so strong that all the junk began to terrorize the young boy for the last time as they gathered all their belongings to leave. There are some things that don't leave without a fight, the bible says in <strong>2Corinthians 10:4, \"the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds\"</strong>, this is why the word of God is powerful, it battles strongholds especially lies. The things that were in this boy were strong holds. No word shall return void that proceeds from the mouth of Lord. Jesus had spoken, the unclean spirits had no choice but to leave and the young boy had no choice but to be free.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"And when the unclean spirits left, he became as one dead and so many said, \"he is dead\",</strong> the child looked dead, the people around him passed judgment that he was dead. It’s not recorded what went through the mind of the father of the child. At least when he was being terrorized he was alive, now he appeared dead. <strong>Philippians 1:6, \"Be confident in this very thing, that He which hath began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ\".</strong> What people thought and what looked dead did not intimidate Jesus. He might have been the only one with a different look at things yet he was not moved by what people thought. He knew what He had started, He was able to complete it. Do not be intimidated when you have believed God for something and it looks like it's not going as desired, and everyone around you is telling you not to believe in the Jesus stuff. Linger longer, Jesus has never FAILED?\r\n\r\n<strong>Mark 9:27, \"…but Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose\"</strong>, AMEN, AMEN. Is the Lord wonderful. He did not touch the boy in the beginning, even at the time of rebuking the spirit. But when everyone thought he was dead, He reached him and took him by the hands and lifted him up. His complete restoration came as a result of Jesus touching him and raising him up. Isn't it amazing to see that the Lord will raise His people and not leave them down.\r\n\r\nA father's son is restored, his faith is boosted even more, his son is healed, and has a sound mind. The best thing that could ever happen to both is encountering with the Savior and the Lord. In conclusion, if Jesus was not moved by your past situation and the present condition of this boy, and then He was not intimidated by the request of the father when the disciples could not do it and finally He was not intimidated by the comments from the crowd saying that the child is dead, why not begin to trust Him with your past, present and future for He is the same yesterday, today and forever more He changes not. He is moved by your feelings and not intimidated by your situations. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Luke 10:38-42, “40 But Martha was DISTRACTED with MUCH serving, and she approached Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.” 41 And Jesus answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. 42 But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIf each of us was to take time to closely look at our lives, we will find that we have too many distractions. And distractions bring about detachment, moving your attention away from what you should be concentrating on, very important things. Sometimes we get distracted even by good things but not necessary at a given time.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe see this example in <strong>Luke 10:38</strong> after Jesus entered into a village and Martha welcomed Him into her house. It was Martha’s idea to welcome the Son of God; her sister did not have part in it. If you welcome someone or a distinguished guest, presentation is very important right. And I can see Martha working hard to give a good presentation; cooking, cleaning, setting things up because she had a guest in her house. Then here comes Mary, Martha’s sister who instead of helping her, sat at Jesus feet to hear His words. Whereas one was busy prepping the natural food, the other was busy sitting to feed on spiritual food.\r\n\r\nIs it not amazing that we too can be busy prepping things for the Lord but forget the most important thing, sit at His feet and feed on His word, be in prayer? By many means we easily get distracted doing everything else for the Lord but have no time for Him. Yes, Jesus was in Martha’s house but I believe it’s not so much about what Martha could give to the Lord but rather what the Lord could give to her and her household if she was not distracted. At the point of distraction and waiting for her sister to come and help, I can imagine frustrations began to creep in and that is when she turned to the Lord to ask Him to tell her sister to come and help. Instead of Jesus asking Mary to go and help her sister, He said <strong>“Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things.”</strong> Any time in the bible the Lord calls a person twice; I believe it was to get that person’s undivided attention. The Lord noticed that she was worried and troubled by many things trying to please the Lord. What she would have learnt was that pleasing the Lord meant sitting at His feet to hear Him teach why?, <strong>John 4:34, “Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work</strong>” and for Mary <strong>Romans 10:17, “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” </strong>and Mary chose the best thing, Jesus continues to say, “<strong>42 But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you were to take a moment right now and scan your life, would you find anything distracting you from being in His presence and listening to His voice? Do you have too many things going on that has shifted your focus from what is important that even reading His word and praying are not appearing to be your priority? Martha was distracted that she missed the food for her soul, Mary chose the best. Are you going to be a Mary or a Martha? Don’t let distractions shift your focus. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Ezekiel 37:1-14, \"And He said to me, \"Son of man, can these bones live?\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s easier for me to talk to someone about hope, peace and faith. It's easier to encourage someone who is going through hard times and even see them coming out of it but when it comes to me facing the same things, I find it hard to encourage myself.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTalking about prophet Ezekiel, he preached a message of hope to the exiles in Babylon yet the people he spoke to did not see things the way he spoke them. Ezekiel 37 is a very familiar passage about the valley of the dry bones. A place anyone would want to avoid. No one wants to go to the valley or live in the valley. People would rather live in a plain land or more so live up the hill. Celebrities love to build houses up the hill, a place where everyone can see their property. God in this case brings Ezekiel to the valley and not just any valley but a valley full of dry bones. Valley often times is associated with death, <strong>Psalm 23:4, \"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...\", </strong>a place of no hope, a dry place, a creepy place, in simple, a place with no life. I will submit that greater miracles happen in the valley. I tend to see more of God's greatness through my times in the valley. Not that I want to be in the valley but I appreciate the times that I have been in the valley, it was a place of preparation for me. I did not like it, but it was vital. The Spirit of the Lord led Ezekiel in the valley, caused him to pass by all the bones, saw how they were so many and very dry. Look around you and see so many dry bones, dry marriages, dry community, dry churches, dry relationships, dry city, dry life. Very discouraging when you see all these and can do nothing about them.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ezekiel 37:3, \"And He said to me, \"Son of man, can these bones live?...\"</strong> what would you say if you were asked the same question. Can this marriage survive, relationship, life, the lost, backsliders you name it, can they be restored? It puzzles me when I face myself with these questions. We have prayer requests that come in, people who need healing, people who need their jobs restored and I ask myself the question, can it be done? how about you, can you see a desire that has been dead for many weeks, months, years being restored?\r\n\r\n<strong>Ezekiel 37:3, \"...so I answered, \"O Lord God, You know\". </strong>What a wise answer, if he said they could live and God did not do anything, Ezekiel would have been a liar; and if he said they could not live and God made them live, he would have still been a liar. What I'm I saying?, <strong>the outcome of a situation depends on what He does.</strong> I don't know whether people will be healed, He knows and so is a marriage, job and all things that you have given up hope on. Could it be the answer God was looking for? probably. God knows what dilemma you and I are in and the answer of it lies in His hands. This is what I call \"HE CAN\", whether He is going to do it or not is not an issue, the issue is \"CAN HE?\" ,can I trust His hands to know what to do? There are people who come to God to ask for something but don't believe HE CAN do it, they are just giving it a try to see if He has the ability to make it happen.\r\n\r\nIf God is going to do it, He is going to have to use something to make it happen. Martha and Mary sent a message to Jesus to come and heal their brother who was sick, Jesus did not show up until Lazarus was four days dead . They understood that the outcome of the situation lied in the hands of Jesus, <strong>John 11:22, \"But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You</strong>\". Jesus called Lazarus out of the tomb, God spoke through Ezekiel. <strong>Ezekiel 37:4,” Again He said to me, \"Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord! vs. 5, Thus says the Lord God to these bones: \"surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live</strong>\". What would you do if you were told to speak life into what you can't see life in? This prophet who said God knows is asked to prophesy life into these bones. Mark this, <strong>IT'S THE WORD OF GOD AGAINST THE CURRENT SITUATION</strong>. \"<strong>Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God</strong>\" and this is what He is basing his faith in, what God had spoken. It did not matter what had happened and how he could not see them come back to life, the instruction was simple, prophesy in My name.\r\n\r\nYou can try and make some sense out of your situation and not see it work out, leave it in the hands of God and when God gives you a word, speak life into it. Remember it is His word and not yours. If it backfires, shift the blame on Him but I heard Him say, \"<strong>My word shall not return void...\" \"I am not a man that I should lie...\"</strong> I see so many dry bones around me, the life of those dry bones are in His hands, all I can do is prophesy (proclaim) according to His word, do the same.

              "<strong>Numbers 13,1-2, 17-20 “16 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, everyone a leader among them.” 17 Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way into the South, and go up to the mountains, 18 and see what the land is like: whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, few or many; 19 whether the land they dwell in is good or bad; whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds; 20 whether the land is rich or poor; and whether there are forests there or not. Be of good courage. And bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe<strong> Battle of Hamburger Hill</strong> was a battle of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War\">Vietnam War</a> which was fought between the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">United States</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Vietnam\">Democratic Republic of Vietnam</a> from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_10\">May 10</a> - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_20\">May 20</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969\">1969</a>.<!--more--> Although of little strategic value, US command ordered assaults to clear the area around AP Bia, which led to pitched battles on the heavily fortified Hill 937. As the battle was primarily carried out by infantry using small arms fire, the fighting was akin to WWI trench warfare with the US Airborne troops moving up the highly sloped hill against experienced and well equipped entrenched troops. Attacks were repeatedly repelled by weather, friendly fire, accidents, and especially the highly effective PAVN defenses. Nevertheless the Airborne troops took the hill through direct assault, causing extensive casualties to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAVN\">PAVN</a> forces, and taking such in their own units. The backlash due to the high casualties over a strategically unimportant point led to dramatic changes in the conduct of the war, and Hamburger Hill would be the last major US ground assault of the war.\r\n\r\nIt is amazing that men gave their very lives to take over a hill in the midst of a war. This tells me that the hill was of great value to them, this tells me that someone commanded the men to do so; this tells me that these men placed their very lives on the line to obey the command. I would imagine that taking the land would be an important victory in the battle against the enemy, and that it would please the one that called for the Hill to be taken. The enemy was not going to just give up the hill, the soldiers had to take it from the enemy by being proactive, moving forward, risking their lives, being resolute and mission minded, no one could deter them from the mission, defeat was not an option.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Numbers 13, </strong>God had promised that He was going to give The Promised Land to His people. However, he still called Moses to send forth spies to spy out the land. What was the condition of the land, were the people strong or weak, was the land good or bad to dwell in, were the cities like camps or strongholds. As the spies took inventory of the land and the people, they were to finally bring back some of the fruit of the land to show Moses. There were two different reports that returned, one team of ten brought back a fearful report, and the team of two brought back a faithful report. Verse 32 states of the ten fearful spies “And<strong> they brought and evil report…to the children of Israel.” </strong>The ten (the majority) reported that the land was good; however the people were allegedly giants to be feared, and the cities were a stronghold. The two faithful spies returned (Joshua and Caleb), and Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, and reported <strong>“We should go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it</strong>.” Do not fear and faith oppose each other? Which report would you have believed? It is interesting to note, most Christian can name the two spies from memory, Joshua and Caleb, but cannot name the ten spies from memory.\r\n\r\nDid you know that God too has called us to look out over the land, and believe that although the enemy, Satan is the god of the world (land) we can go and possess the land by winning the lost to Jesus Christ? However, just as most of the spies, ten, did not see the need to reality of taking the Land, but only two did, so too are 98% of professing Christians not seeing the necessity of sharing their faith, but 2% only obey Christ’s command to take the land by seeking and saving the lost by His hand. The two saw what the ten did not and perhaps would not see victory. Paul wrote, “<strong>What then shall we say to these things? If God<em> is</em> for us, who<em> can be</em> against us (Romans 8</strong>)? Can the “giants” really have any effect on us when God is on our side? It seems that the giants of fear, lack of zeal, feeling unequipped, lack to compassion, media, political correctness, etc…, have really scared off so many professing Christian from taking the land to reach the lost. Jesus spoke to His disciples in <strong>John 4</strong>, and said, “<strong>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and<em> then</em> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest”</strong> The land has people ready to be harvested, so what is the problem? Jesus said in <strong>Luke 10, “2The harvest truly<em> is</em> great, but the labourers<em> are</em> few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. 3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.”</strong> Jesus has called the few laborers (Joshua and Caleb were among the minority) to go face the land, despite the possible “giants” in the land. Jesus calls us to be proactive<strong>, “…And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force”, Matthew 11:12.</strong> The force that we are to take the land by is <strong>“Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts</strong>”, (<strong>Zechariah 4:6</strong>).” If soldiers can give their lives to take a hill, should we not give our lives to serve the Lord?\r\n\r\nAre you obeying Jesus, by faith, and are resolved to go in and TAKE THE LAND NOW!\r\n\r\nBlessings, until the nets are filled….Phil the Evangelist"

              "God is surely a God of provision. Christ took a little boys lunch and fed 5,000. Christ directed Peter to fish for a coin to pay taxes to the government of that day. And God’s ultimate provision is when Christ paid for our transgression in His life’s blood. Israel experienced the provision of God as they wandered in the wilderness for those forty years. There were some specific things that God commanded Israel to do on their way to possess the land.\r\n\r\n(Deut. 8:1 – 5)God said, “<strong>Every commandment which I command you today you must be careful to observe, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land of which the Lord swore to your fathers</strong>.” It is crucial that a follower of Christ takes Him at His Word. If one does not believe God’s Word, one is calling Him a liar, and we know God cannot lie. Israel was commanded to obey the commandments of God. There are professing believers who treat the Bible like Thomas Jefferson, who ripped out every account written of a miracle in the Bible. <!--more-->As believers, we must not pick and choose what commands we will follow, and which we will neglect. One area many neglect is evangelism. Why is that? Perhaps one reason can be found in the following verse. <strong>Deuteronomy 8: 2“And you shall remember that the Lord your God led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you and test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.”</strong> Many believers seem to forget what the Lord did to pull them out of their sin when they were converted to Christ. The Lord wants His children to be humble before Him, and this is made manifest in times of testing. How one responds in various situations (tests) reveals what is in one’s heart, and if someone is obedient to the Lord or not. How do you measure up when tested? I have found that there were times in my life that when I was tested, pride rose up in my heart instead of humility. It is always better from one to humble oneself, or God will step in and make sure that He humbles you. Each plague sent hardened Pharaoh’s heart, instead of humbly letting Israel GO! It wasn’t until his son was killed that he released the Israelites, and even then he would chase after them to kill them. After God killed the Egyptian army, and the Israelites were in the desert, they began to complain about their situation in the desert, especially in terms of what they ate in Egypt (even though they were being physically abused in the process), comparing their current food, manna, to the leeks and onions of Egypt. <strong>Deuteronomy 8:3, “So He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord”. </strong>Jesus quoted this very verse when tempted of Satan in the desert.\r\n\r\nDo you hunger for the Word of God, like Job who said “<strong>I esteemed the Words of His mouth more than my necessary food</strong> (<strong>Job 23:12</strong>)?” Paul writes of the armor of God in <strong>Ephesians 6</strong>, and the Word of God is the offensive sword used to attack. The breastplate of righteousness was worn to protect the vital organs (heart and lungs). Do you love the Lord with all your heart; is He the focal point of all your affections? Moses mentioned wrote of the Israelites, <strong>Deuteronomy 8:4, “</strong> <strong>Your garments did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years”</strong>. We are to rest in the righteousness of Christ, as His righteousness does not and cannot wear out. Paul writes to believers to have their feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. We are to stand in the authority of Jesus Christ, and to carry this great gospel to areas and people that are going to Hell. These shoes are unlike any others because with them we can go into the enemy’s territory and preach the gospel that others may walk out of the enemy’s camp in freedom, no longer a prisoner of sin and Satan. The Israelites FEET DID NOT SWELL for forty years, yet many Christians’ feet are swollen with pride, laziness, and disregard for the lost, and prejudice. They are like Jonah whose feet took him in the complete opposite direction to the direction God commended him to go in. His feet were swollen with the things previously mentioned, and God just didn’t let him off the hook (no pun intended). Moses wrote of the Israelites,<strong> Deuteronomy 8:5, “ You should know in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so the Lord your God chastens you”</strong>.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if you’re feet are swollen for failing to share your faith, then God is chastening you unto obedience today. Don’t rely on “professional ministers” to do the work, be obedient to the work. “<em>For four hundred years the Christian church had no great preacher by rhetorical standards. The first great preacher was Chrysostom. Yet during those centuries, Christianity conquered the Mediterranean world by the faithful witness of the common believer</em>.” (Warren Wiersbe and Lloyd Perry). While there were no professional missionaries devoting their whole life to this specific work, every congregation was a missionary society, and every Christian believer a missionary, inflamed by the love of Christ to convert his fellow men.… <em>Every Christian told his neighbor, the laborer to his fellow laborer, the slave to his fellow slave, the servant to his master and mistress, the story of his conversion as a mariner tells the story of the rescue from shipwreck (Philip Schaff, about the early days of the post-apostolic church). There is no plan B that Jesus has in place! Consider the following: According to a legend, when Jesus returned to heaven following his death on the cross and resurrection from the tomb, the angels gathered in amazement. They gazed at the wounds in his hands and feet, and shuddered to recall his suffering. Finally Gabriel spoke: “Master, you suffered terribly down there. Do they know and appreciate the extent of your sacrifice.” “No,” said Jesus. “Not yet. Right now only a handful of people in Palestine know.” “Then what have you done to let everyone else know?” asked Gabriel. “I’ve asked Peter, James, and John, and a few others to spread the news. They will tell others who will tell others until the message spreads to the ends of the earth”. ”But Gabriel, knowing the nature of human beings, asked, “What is Plan B?” “I have no Plan B,” replied Christ. “There is no alternative strategy. I’m counting on them</em>.” Twenty centuries later, he still has no other plan. He’s counting on you and me. <strong>Romans 10</strong> reads, <strong>“14</strong> <strong>How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things</strong>!” You are called to take the land now! Are your feet beautiful or swollen before the sight of a holy God to who you have to give an account of what you did with the glorious Gospel of Christ?, Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Phil the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Joshua 14:11 – 12, “11 As yet I am as strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me; just as my strength was then, so now is my strength for war, both for going out and for coming in. 12 Now therefore, give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and that the cities were great and fortified. It may be that the Lord will be with me, and I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said” </strong>\r\n\r\nWe live in a day and age whereby one will work and work for somewhere between fifty five to sixty five plus years and then move into retirement. The thinking is that after giving the best years to work; now, one can sit back and enjoy the fruit of those labors. However, when does one “retire” from serving the Lord? Is there an age that one should say, “<em>Well Lord I have put my time in these many years, and now I will rest from ministry?</em>” When Moses sent out the spies to spy out the Land, Caleb was a much younger man at the time, with much strength and vigor. <!--more-->\r\nAt Kadesh Barnea Caleb was 40 years old and the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for thirty eight years, then the conquering of the Land took seven years (ca. 1405–1398 b.c.). In the above Scripture Caleb is now eighty five years old, and says, “<strong>Now therefore, give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day…”</strong> Did Caleb retire from moving forward, did he hang up his ministry belt, did he sit back and decide to rest at this point, NO! He was determined, at eighty five years old to move forward in all that God had for him. However, sadly in this day and age I see many older folks in churches sit back reflecting on the former years, yet failing to create new memories and continuing to minister unto the Lord, and serve people now. Paul writes, “1 <strong>But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine: 2 that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience; the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things— 4 that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 5 to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. 6 Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded, 7 in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, 8 sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you. 9 Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back, 10 not pilfering (thieving), but showing all good fidelity (honesty) , that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things”</strong> (<strong>Titus 2:1 – 10</strong>).” According to Paul, and in light of Caleb, when one becomes older, it is not time to just rest, because it is only in this time of ones’ life that one is able to pass on certain things, impart certain things, train the younger in specific things that one would not have been able to because the wisdom and experience for the most part, would not have been present to impart. Perhaps one of my most favorite testimonies about an older man serving the Lord is called “I got off at George Street.” Click here and listen soberly to the eight minute testimony-<strong>[youtube http://youtube.com/w/?v=0rXhHhNwHZk&amp;feature=gv]</strong>. WOW, wasn’t that an incredible testimony?<strong> This man was willing to do in his condition, what many are not willing to do in their “healthy” condition. </strong>Perhaps that is why Samuel said that<strong> “...The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart (1Samuel 16:6),” </strong>speaking of young David.\r\n\r\nDavid wrote the famous <strong>Psalm 23</strong> in his golden years, not as a shepherd boy in the field. After he slayed Goliath, was on the run from Saul, committed adultery, made a leader over all the downtrodden and destitute in Israel, took a census, and was betrayed by Absolom, etc…then and only then did he pen the famous Psalm. Caleb was ready still to take land, “<strong>So Moses swore on that day, saying,‘Surely the landwhere your foot has trodden shallbe your inheritance and your children’s forever, because you have wholly followed the Lord my God</strong>”. Wow, this blesses my heart abundantly to hear this great news that Caleb was such a great example to follow as he WHOLLY followed his God, and would leave inheritance to his children as God’s blessing upon him. His servant hood into his older age was blessed by the Lord. The older ones must<strong>wholly follow the Lord</strong>, and not just in the younger years of their lives, and must disciple the younger ones or else how will they grow, as<strong>the Great Commission has no expiration date on it</strong>. Pass this one to those in your church that are perhaps in this era of life, and have the retirement mentality, and encourage them that there is still much work to be done, and they are needed for such a time as this.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to retire or TAKE THE LAND in your older years? Blessings, until the nets are filled….Phillip the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 2:1, “When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God 2 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 3I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling” (NIV).</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe one of the things that cripple human beings is the battle with fear to which I am no stranger of. I have battled fear all my life. Fear of doing wrong, rejection, fear of ending up in hell, fear of deceiving. Of course some of the fear are healthy and then most of the fear I deal with are not. <!--more-->Think about it, what is one of the things God dealt with in the bible, \"FEAR\", He said \"FEAR NOT\". Fear is a distressing emotion aroused by impending danger, evil, pain, etc. God told Hagar the mother of Ishmael in <strong>Genesis 21:17</strong> to fear not, <strong>Isaiah 41:10</strong> tells us to fear not, so was Joshua told to fear not, Jesus spoke to the disciples in occasions to fear not and it goes on.\r\n\r\nThen comes Paul who is responsible for most of the New Testament whom you would think was bold all his life comes and tells us in <strong>1Corinthians 2:1, “When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God. 2 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified”. </strong>Paul like any other believer was no stranger to fear but something inside of him continued to battle fear and that is the love, passion and zeal he had for the Lord to do His will. He says he did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom though he was a very smart guy, well learned. What I have learnt that when fear comes, it drives away things in you that could even help you stand. In as much as he was well learned, anytime he stood to speak to people about the things of God, fear would come upon him and God had to strengthen Him and give him words to speak. <strong>Matthew 10:19, \"But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak\". </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 3 “I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling” (NIV). </strong>We can see that Paul came in weakness, fear and much trembling which if you look at it carefully are the qualifications of a born again Christians God uses daily. Do you qualify? I do, I have much weakness, fear and trembling every time I step out to do the work of God. We can see that the work of the Lord is not left for those who are bold (of course God uses the bold), <strong>He has lowered the qualifications that we would all qualify</strong>. If there is one guy who is bold in doing the work of God is Pastor Phil. I am amazed and challenged by his love, zeal and boldness to preach and witness to strangers on the streets. That boldness rubs on me to deal with my weakness, fear and much trembling that I too may be used of God on the streets as a true and faithful witness.\r\n\r\n<strong>2Timothy 1:7,\" For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.\" </strong>Because we have fear, God has given us three things to battle and conquer fear, “POWER”, “LOVE” and “SOUND MIND”. In talking about \"<strong>POWER</strong>\", Paul could only preach under God's power, that always battled his fear, the reason he preached, taught and wrote to many churches boldly. On the other hand, \"<strong>LOVE</strong>\" compelled him to swallow his fears and preach the gospel with boldness because he did not want anyone going to hell, <strong>1John 4:18, “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love\". </strong>And by<strong> \"SOUND MIND\" </strong>did he haveclear conscious to understand that the captain of fear is the devil and some of the fears he plants are JUST IMAGINATIONS to stop us from obeying God. In other words, fear tries to exalt itself against the knowledge of God, <strong>2Corinthians 10:5, \"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; “(KJV). </strong>I believe we can fight scared because we qualify and we have what it takes to fight fear. I fight it every day and I am gaining victory day by day what about you? Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 8:28, \"And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI'm honored and humbled to be used of God to reach many. Many years ago I would have never imagined what God would plant in my life as His servant weaknesses and faults. When I tell people I used to be shy and intimidated, it blows their mind and they find it hard to believe that was me. I remember even joking about it and telling my family that the day they will put me in front of a congregation, they better have an ambulance outside to drive me to the hospital for I knew for sure I would pass out. After many years of looking at myself that way, God began to give me confidence by looking at other people who were moving forward and I told the Lord that if they can, I too can. Not because I was jealous of them but because I believed there was more do too for the Lord.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFrom experience, few people can move forward by themselves without the inspiration of others. Over the years I have learnt to encourage myself in this journey because not always will you have people around you to help you with that. On the other hand God has brought around me people to provoke and challenge my current position and it’s upon me to decide whether I want to remain where I am or challenge myself to move to the next level. As long as there is nothing to challenge or provoke you, you will feel that you have arrived but the moment something begins to come your way as a reminder that where you are could be a stepping stone, you will purpose in your heart to think twice. Pastor Phil challenges me in the area of witnessing, the Word and discipleship. I have grown more in these areas through him. I challenge him in prayers and encouragements because I find myself stronger in these areas.\r\n\r\n<strong>1Samuel 1:1-28</strong> is an interesting story. We are told of three people, Elkanah, Penninah and Hannah. Elkanah is the husband to both Penninah and Hannah, Elkanah loved Hannah more than Penninah as the bible says. Elkanah always gave bigger portion of gifts that he had to Hannah and less to Penninah. Penninah on the other hand was blessed with children because God opened her womb while Hannah's womb was shut. In the Old testament to have children especially boys was a sign of a blessing. A man was considered blessed if his wife could give him boys. Here we see how Elkanah loved Hannah more than Penninah and yet Hannah had no children. If you remember, Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and yet Leah had many children while Rachel did not until at a later time.\r\n\r\nOne thing about the story of Hannah that fascinates me is that she was okay until Penninah had children and she desired her own, to make matters worse in <strong>1samuel 1 vs. 6 says\"… her rival (Penninah) also provoked her severely, to make her miserable\".</strong> Yes Hannah was loved more than Penninah, and yes she received more gifts than her but yet she realized there was more she could have desired. Her desire was not to compete against her rival or get even, her desire was to gain more from the Lord. God had allowed Penninah to provoke her as Leah was allowed to provoke Rachel. She decides to go to pray to God, a prayer of desperation, praying earnestly and constantly the only thing that made her prayers to be answered is when she vowed that the child God would give her, she would dedicate him back to God serving Him all the days of his life. Samuel is born, became a prophet and what a mighty man he was. Also, Rachel bore Joseph who later became the number two man in Egypt. Through his life, Israel was saved from a severe draught.\r\n\r\nSuppose there was nothing to challenge and provoke these women to move to the next level, what an opportunity many would have missed. “<strong>All things work together</strong>” whether it be frustrations, someone provoking you, or through what you see and get challenged by. I would pray that we will evaluate and examine the reason why we would desire more than what we have.\r\n\r\nI thank God for this far He has brought me but with the new things that are provoking and challenging me, I am going after them. No need to be frustrated when people are provoking and challenging you, they are doing you a favor and I would say those are loyal friends. Judas betrayed Jesus, but it worked for our good as God’s pre-arranged plan for our salvation. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 10:13,</strong> <strong>\"No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation, He will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it (ESV)</strong>\r\n\r\nThis past Sunday’s teaching on temptation, one of the things James emphasizes, was enlightening, challenging, and eye opening. Not only is temptation the cause of all trials and tribulations experienced since the beginning of time, daily, it’s our spirits' greatest nemesis. In fact, Paul highlights this battle in <strong>Galatians 5:17</strong>, where he discusses the unending conflict between the spirit and the flesh. Although temptations' power is present everywhere we go, as Christians, we take comfort in knowing that we have power over it<!--more-->. In <strong>1Corinthians 10:13,</strong> Paul says, <strong>\"No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation, He will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it (ESV).\"</strong> Amen! Although combating temptation is a consistent battle for us, knowing that God provides ways of escape, so that we may be able to endure it is comforting. How does He do this? For starters: through submission. By our own strength, we cannot defeat temptation. In fact, the moment Christians succumb to such false notions is the moment they become even more susceptible to its seducing power. To overcome temptation, we must first submit to God as highlighted in <strong>James 4:7</strong>. In this context, I understand submission to be recognition of our inadequacy, inefficiency, and inability. And only through this recognition that comes as a result of God's grace, can we see our need for reliance on strength greater than our own.\r\n\r\nThrough submission, we can utilize the many tools the Lord has given us to combat temptation, mainly: prayer, the Bible, wisdom, and more. The words in The Lord’s Prayer, <strong>\"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,\"</strong> summarizes how powerful prayer can be for resisting tempting situations. The word of God, the other vital resource, gives us the essential tools needed to combat temptation. In <strong>Psalms 119:9-11</strong>, David makes the following proclamation: <strong>\"How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word. With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments! I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.\"</strong> This passage and many others, highlight how effective being in the word, and as James clearly emphasizes in <strong>James 1:22</strong>, <strong>\"doing the word,\"</strong> assists in overcoming temptation. Armed with prayer and the word, wisdom is another imperative tool needed to overcome temptation. The fear and seeking of the Lord through prayer and the word sets the backdrop for wisdom. Any Christian can pray and read the word, but wisdom, which can be a consequence of these actions, must be exercised to overcome temptation. We fail to exercise wisdom when we go to places we shouldn't go, watch things we shouldn't watch, or even become unequally yoked together with people we shouldn't be, because in doing, we make provisions for the flesh to fulfill its lusts (<strong>Romans 13:14</strong>).\r\n\r\nA lack of Biblical wisdom can set the stage for even greater temptation, so like Joseph who fled when he was sexually tempted by Potiphar's wife, we must \"flee\" situations that escalate temptation. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (Fourth Edition) defines fleeing as, \"Running away, as from trouble or danger.\" Clearly, temptation is trouble and dangerous. It’s often loaded with repercussions that can be colossal, so it's no surprise that in <strong>2Timothy 2:22</strong>, Paul uses the same word when he says, <strong>\"So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace…”</strong> As Christians, we are tempted every single day, but knowing that God has provided a way of escape, so that we may be able to endure should give us immense peace.

              "<strong>1Corinthians 1:2-.. to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints…</strong>\r\n\r\nPaul addresses his letter to the church of God in the beginning of v.2. This is an important word, as it encompasses all those who have placed their faith in Jesus. The word for church in the Greek is ‘ekklesia”, which means, the called out ones. What have they been called out from? They have been called out from the world <strong>(John 17:16</strong>). What do they do? They take up their cross and follow Jesus <strong> (Matthew10:38). </strong>How do they do this? By denying themselves, serving Christ in holiness and righteousness <strong>Luke 1:74-75</strong>). I find it increasingly important to differentiate between what the popular voices say and what the scriptures say.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nMany individuals make up their own religion by their own reasoning. They decide for themselves what they will and will not follow. We live like the world, in drunkenness and fornication, and then we enter God’s house as if all is normal. The divorce rate goes higher and higher in the church, couples live together out of wedlock, worldly entertainment is reveled in, all things the scriptures call sin, but many engage in them anyways. How many churches held super bowl parties? How many held prayer meetings? Think about it, we celebrate some idolatrous game, on the Lord’s day nonetheless, and we neglect what the scriptures describe as what a true disciple does. Friends, I declare to you, in the great apostles words, the true church of God is comprised of those who have heard the call and have responded. For this call is an invitation, ‘called out’, in the Greek, means invited. This is not some un refusable call, it is the divine declaration of the Almighty, to whosoever would come after Him, and follow Him upon the road that leads to everlasting life. They have been separated unto God, consecrated wholly to Him. Separated from the world, for the scriptures tell us that the friend of the world is the enemy of God(<strong>James 4:4).</strong> The friend of the world is the one who loves the things of the world. They desire and revel in the things of the world. This one has not the love of the Father(<strong>1John 2:15</strong>).\r\n\r\nThe true disciple is called a saint, and they are , in reality, what they are called. They are commanded to be holy(<strong>1Peter1:15-16),</strong> and they are, in fact , holy. They are personally involved, not merely in profession, but in practice. The righteousness of Christ is imparted within them, they are partakers of His holiness. I believe this to be so important to understand, this life is not some ideal we look at, it is to be the life we live. We are called to ‘be’ saints, in reality, in actual practice and experience. It involves our effort, our will, and it is our privilege. So, will you hear the call?\r\n\r\nHearing His call, Brother Benjamen\r\n\r\nbrotherbenjamen"

              "<strong>Acts 20:7–9, “7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. 8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead\"\r\n</strong>\r\nPerhaps you are all too familiar with this famous American nursery rhythm:\r\n\r\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall,\r\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall.\r\nAll the king’s horses,\r\nAnd all the king’s men,\r\nCouldn’t put Humpty together again.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhen meditating upon this nursery rhythm I wondered why this egg (Humpty Dumpty) was sitting on a wall to begin with. Also why were the kings horses and king’s men expected to put him back together? Perhaps the One that should have been summoned with THE KING! This story seems to parallel the account in <strong>Acts 20</strong>, whereby a young man by the name of Eutychus also had a great fall, except from sitting upon a window sill instead of a wall. Perhaps Eutychus had some good excuses for dozing off:\r\n\r\n1 Paul’s sermon was long.\r\n\r\n2 The many lights no doubt made the room hot.\r\n\r\n3 He was a young man staying up until midnight.\r\n\r\n4 He was “overcome” by sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen you hear God’s Word are you lulled to sleep or awakened by its truth. If the stale air of this world’s influence makes us sink into a sleep of apathy, we must seek refreshing from the presence of the Lord. When God’s Law was lost and then found in the days of King Josiah, he read it for the first time and it awakened him so much that he called all of Israel to follow it’s commandments. It is the midnight hour, we sit on the window of eternity. We can fall into eternity in a heartbeat. Seek the Lord while He may be found when times of refreshing come from the presence of the Lord. When our Christian life seems to be a dry and lifeless sermon without end, and the joy of feeding on God’s Word is no longer in our hearts, we must get on our knees and return to our first love. Many “go to all of the Kings horses and all the kings’ men,” by Jesus the KING is calling His people to seek Him. <strong>“If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land</strong>.”, <strong>2Chronicles 7:14</strong>, blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Matthew 6:9, \"...Our Father in heaven, HALLOWED BE YOUR NAME”</strong>\r\n\r\nPrayer always begins with God and ends with Him. When was the last time you worshipped Him for who He is, magnified His name, His attributes, His nature in your prayers? While it’s easy to come to prayers with our “give me list”, Jesus taught His disciples to first hallow God’s name.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHe is our <strong>Abba Father, Jehovah Yahweh, Jehovah Jireh, Jehovah Shammah, Jehovah Shalom, Jehovah Nissi, Jehovah Elshadai, Jehovah Adonai, Jehovah Tsidekanu, Jehovah Ebenezer, Jehovah Rapha, Jehovah Mkadesh, Jehovah Rohi, King of kings, Lord of lords, Bright morning star, Lion of the tribe of Judah, Prince of Peace, Everlasting Father, Maker of the universe, Jesus Christ, Lily of the valley, Rose of Sharon, Emmanuel, Messiah, Majesty, the great I Am, the Porter, The Excellent One, The Mighty One of Israel, Powerful God, Mighty God, Glorious One, Holy God, Magnificent God, Deliverer, Precious Lord, Beautiful Savior, Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the End, First and the Last, Mighty Warrior, Exalted One, Auspicious God who sits on the circles of the earth, Unchanging God, The Lord who reigns forevermore, our Councilor, Living Word, Living Water, Living Bread, the Way, the Truth, the Life, The light of the world, Rock of ages, Solid Rock, Anchor of life, Firm Foundation, Rock of Salvation, Awesome God, Lover of our soul, Consuming Fire, Anointed One, True Vine, our Refuge, our Fortress, A strong Tower, the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of men, Baptizer of the Holy Ghost and Fire, Jealous God, Sovereign God, Lord of all, Good Shepherd, Teacher- Rabbi, the only Wise God, the all knowing God, the chief planner, Way Maker, Ancient of Days, Master, Redeemer, Rabboni, Omniscient, the balm of Gilead, God of wonders, God of Justice, Merciful God </strong>and the list continues.\r\n\r\nThe more hallow God’s name, the more your faith in prayer increases. It builds your faith to see God far beyond what I you are dealing with at any given time. Read Jeremiah’s hallow God’s greatness, “<strong>'Ah, Lord God! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You”, Jeremiah 32:17.</strong> I see God bigger than my problem when I hallow His name. When I see Him as my Father, it reveals to me that I am not just one of the children of God but I recognize my relationship with Him is personalized and therefore I am encouraged to know that He has called me His son. The bible says that <strong>He has curved us in the palm of His hands, Isaiah 49:16</strong>. The same bible also says that He knows us in and out and to prove it, <strong>the very hairs on our heads are numbered and not counted, Matthew 10:30</strong>. What a way to show that He is concerned about our affairs as His sons and daughters. People will fail us, but our Father in heaven will never leave us nor forsake us. <strong>He is the friend who sticks closer than a brother</strong>, Proverbs 18:24. As I talk about Him, I am reminded that He is everything good I could ever think about.\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 6:9, \"...Hallowed be Your name\",</strong> His name is sacred, holy, consecrated, blessed, and sanctified. What a name!!!! no one has and no one will ever have such an introduction like God because no one disserves it like He does. Know God as He is for He is the One and only, let your faith increase as you see God as God in your situation, Hallowed be His name. Blessings Ev\r\nCheck out \"That's my King\", [youtube http://youtube.com/w/?v=yzqTFNfeDnE&amp;feature=related]"

              "<strong>Mark 10:35-37, “35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Him, saying, \"Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.\" 36 And He said to them, \"What do you want Me to do for you?\" 37 They said to Him, \"Grant us that we may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your glory.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nIn talking about the disciples, there is no one’s life detailed as that of Peter followed by that of James and John the sons of Zebedee. Interestingly, when Jesus called these two brother’s to be His disciples, He gave them the name Boarnerges which means <strong>Sons of Thunder</strong>, (<strong>Mark 3:17) </strong>because of their fiery temperaments. It appears that this is the only place in scripture where they were referred to by this title. <!--more--> We then wonder why the Lord would call them by this title as though He knew them from the time they were growing up or knew their hearts because He is God. Anyway, we come to learn that they somehow exhibited thunder like qualities in their dealings. They seem to have been very competitive brothers. Three things in <strong>Luke 9</strong> gives a glimpse of how they dealt with things as sons of thunder. In the early chapter of <strong>Luke 9,</strong> James and John as disciples among others were sent out by Jesus to preach the kingdom and heal the sick. They were present and partly used in the feeding of the 5 thousand. They were present when Peter declared that Jesus is the Christ and they were brought in as part of the inner circle to the mount of transfiguration leaving the rest of the disciples behind.\r\n\r\nPerhaps all these connections and experiences made them feel a little better than others, more worthy, more deserving and even more belonging. This led them to have disputes among themselves of who was considered the greatest, “<i>was it Peter or one of them, James or John</i>”. This drove them to the extent that when they saw a man casting out demons in Christ's name, they forbade him because he was not following them, (<strong>Luke 9:49). </strong>It appears they decided who could and could not perform miracles unless they were part of the 12 that walked with Jesus. And if that was not enough, when the Samaritans failed to show hospitality to Jesus and rejected Him as the Savior, James and John asked Jesus for permission to call fire from heaven to consume them, (<strong>Luke 9:54)</strong>. These are the realities of life when man is self-driven, very ambitious to the point of having a drive to misuse God given grace, power to advance self or exploit others. Every time they said something that demonstrated their nature, the Lord stepped in to provide a teaching to correct them but sooner or later they forgot and acted in some other way, and the other disciples at one point stepped in to rebuke them. This nature provoked Jesus to explain that the true greatness consists rather in serving others, as He was doing. Jesus said, \"<strong>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many”, Mark 10:45</strong>.\r\n\r\nIt troubles me when I see those who should serve others behave like the sons of thunder. They want to use their influence, power, office, position to oppress others and serve themselves. We don't need CEO preachers; we need Shepherds who tend to the sheep. We don't need the untouchables, we need those like Jesus who are touched by our infirmities. <strong>John 13:3-5, “3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God, 4 rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. 5 After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded”</strong>. Jesus had been given all things, He had taught and was about to demonstrate right before being taken to be crucified what it means to be great. After dinner when rest was so much needed, He laid aside His garments of glory and went down on His knees to wash the disciples feet. What a sight for the sons of thunder to learn the means of greatness. Servant leader is the spirit each believer should desire. That God given abilities are not to be used for abuse (exploits) but to serve others as He did. That is why He is our Master and we follow His footsteps. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Numbers 21:4-9, vs. \"8 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” </strong>\r\n\r\nThe story of the Israelites gives an account of how the Lord brought them out of the land of Egypt. There are times they trusted God, and then moved from trust to murmuring and complaining. Always comparing their current situation to the old. I don't think of any people God performed miracles in their midst like the Israelites.<!--more--> The miracles God performed for them were not small miracles. If anything, the big miracles should have boosted their faith to believe God even for greater things, but as we know, it only did for a short time before they forgot and went back to murmuring and complaining. It's interesting to note that whatever they asked of God, God provided. One instant appears in <strong>Numbers 21</strong> where the Canaanite's fought against Israel taking some of them as prisoners. Having been oppressed, Israel made a vow to destroy their cities if God delivered them in their hands to which God hearkened to their prayers and they utterly destroyed the Canaanites.\r\n\r\nAs they journeyed, once again the people became discouraged, spoke against Moses and God over no water, no food even though they had food. The once upon a time treasured food they now referred to as worthless food. God Almighty had provided, had worked miracles, and had gone before them by night as a pillar of fire and by day as a cloud of wind. What else would God do for them? From the beginning they spoke against Moses but as time went by, they moved from just speaking against Moses but also against God. <strong>Vs.</strong> “<strong>6 So the LORD sent fiery serpents</strong> <strong>(venomous snakes</strong>)<strong> among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died”</strong>. They may have faced some challenges on the way but not challenges that took away life. I'm yet to come across where they sat down to thank God for everything He had done for them.\r\n\r\nI was wondering why serpents, it was as if God was saying, \"<em>If you think your situation is bad, I can make it worse, I'm in control of everything</em>\", the fiery serpents bit the Israelites and they died in great numbers. So what happens, vs. \"<strong>7 The people came to Moses and said, \"We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you.\" Pray that the LORD will take the snakes away from us.\" So Moses prayed for the people</strong>\", (NIV). In looking at the way God treated the Israelites, I will say they were like little brats. Anything they wanted and asked for, God provided but watch this, this time when they admitted they had sinned against both God and Moses, they asked Moses to pray that God takes away the snakes from them.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 8 \"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live</strong>.” This is a clean indication of God sending the Israelites back to basics of faith. In Egypt for 400 years they believed God would send a deliverer. That was the faith they had and stood on. There was no clear indication of God coming through for them but they held on. The things God did later for them did not boost their faith and I can imagine the Lord taking them back to the days of humble beginning. The message from the Lord to Moses was simple, the situation would not change (the snakes would continue to bite and kill), however the Lord made a way of escape through a bronze made serpent hanging on a pole. Anyone bit would recover if they looked on upon it. Simple faith, God taking the foolish thing, something that is humbling and using it to humble a stubborn people.\r\n\r\nLike the Israelites, we may not complain and murmur audibly but our actions speaks it clearly. Our eyes are so closed to what God has done that is why we complain about what we have  even calling it worthless and getting discouraged on the way because we want things our way. You can point to the days the Lord did exactly what you asked of Him, what happens when He changes the way He answers your prayers? When will we learn that God owes us nothing, as a matter of fact, we owe it all to Him. He has blessed us in spite of, we complain and murmur but He is patient with us. We speak against those that lead us like Moses but God is gracious, slow to anger. May the Lord help us. To continue. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Numbers 21:4-9, vs. “8 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” </strong>\r\n\r\nSimple instructions to the Israelites, if bit, look to the bronze serpent on the pole and you will live. It does not make sense but that is the simple instruction, faith in the basics. They didn't have to do anything, only look and you will live. Killed by serpents or delivered by a serpent both from God.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhat puzzles me is why God would use a bronze serpent when in the bible often times the serpent is in reference to evil. Remember in the garden Satan in the form of a serpent was cursed. We can easily tell that the killing serpents are in reference to our sins. There is nothing good in us, in fact the bible says, <strong>\"The heart is deceitful above all things, and DESPERATELY WICKED\", Jeremiah 17:9. </strong>Which would mean, we are destroyed by cursed evil poisonous venom already sipping through our system chocking out whatever life left. The bible continues to say, <strong>\"…a soul that sins shall die\", Ezekiel 18:20. </strong>Is this not clear that we die slowly having been bitten by the serpent sin and the only way to live is to look at another serpent lifted up on a pole? We can understand the serpent that kills, the dilemma we have is the serpent hanged on the pole. Would we say God is associating Himself to a serpent? Of course we know the serpent on the pole is a symbol of deliverance but why a serpent lifted up on a pole?\r\n\r\nJesus comes later in the NT and refers back to the serpent Moses made and raised up on the pole. <strong>John 3:14-15, “vs. 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life\". </strong>Now the symbol of the serpent on the tree is becoming clear, the Israelites needed the serpent of bronze on the pole to live, we needed Jesus being lifted up on the cross and dying for us to be saved but how can a serpent have similarity to Jesus? “<em>The serpent signified Christ, who was in the likeness of sinful flesh, though without sin, as this brazen serpent had the outward shape, but not the inward poison, of the other serpents: the pole resembled the cross upon which Christ was lifted up for our salvation: and looking up to it designed our believing in Christ”, </em>John Wesley\r\n\r\nThe first serpent talks of evil, the made serpent talks of judgment and it hanging on the pole symbolizes Jesus hanging on the cross as the One who bore all our sins. <strong>2Corinthians 5:21, \"For He made Him who knew no sin TO BE SIN FOR US, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him\". </strong>Not that He became a sinner as some teach<strong>, NO, </strong>God treated Him as though He had sinned<strong>. </strong>He identified with us, and on the cross He became sin for us without sinning that we would be saved. The reason the Father could not look at Him directly was because of our sin on him identifying with us. While on earth, Jesus always referred to God as His Father, I don't recall reading that He ever referred to Him as \"My God\" until when He was crucified that you hear it, <strong>Matthew 27:46, \"...Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” that is, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”. </strong>This shows us a picture of how sin separated us completely from God, it took away His presence for us. For our sin to diminish and live, Jesus in the image of a man had to be lifted up on the cross (pole). In <strong>John 12:32, \"And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to Myself.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Numbers 21:9 \"So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, he lived\". </strong>We have all been bitten by the fiery serpent of sin (our nature of sin) and some of us have already looked to the serpent on the pole (Jesus who knew no sin made to be sin for us) and we have been saved by repenting of our sins and putting our trust in Jesus alone for our eternal salvation, what about you who has not done that? What are you waiting for? Tomorrow is promised to no one, today is the day of salvation. If you died in your sins, God will be forced to give you judgment unless Jesus on the cross bore your sins. Under the killing serpent you have no hope, under delivering serpent, there is hope for eternity for Christ is the delivering Savior. <strong>Christ in you, the hope of glory. Blessings Ev</strong>"

              "<strong>Numbers 22:1-41, \"The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nI constantly struggle to know the will of God in a situation and not miss it. I also struggle to know whether I am acting in the flesh or I am led of the Spirit. There are times I am not sure whether what is standing on my way is of the Devil or of God. One time when prophet Elijah was waiting for God, there was great earthquake which would be a sign of God, God was not in earthquake, I believe it was followed by thunder but still He wasn't in that, then finally a still small voice and that was of God. May be it's just me but at times I find it hard to know when God is moving, I might see the results in the end, but I missed the opportunity to see Him move. I thank Him for His word, the best way to know Him, to know His ways and His will for my life.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nToday let's look at who is standing in the way. Many times we blame the devil when things are not going right but who really is behind all these? We know his mission from <strong>John 10:10, \"The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy...\". </strong>We know that very well but I would submit to us that he will only finish what we have started in our lives. You give him a little room, he will be the master. <strong>Temptations are not evil by themselves, what is done with them can be turned evil</strong>. This why we need to submit to God first, then resist the devil for him to flee. So before we are too quick to blame the devil, let's see who started the whole thing.\r\n\r\nIn my text this morning we are introduced to the children of Israel, Balak the son of Zippor king of Moabites, Balaam who the Lord speaks to and God Himself. The Israelites have left Egypt, they have subdued nations that stood on the way because God was with them, they are now close to Moab. Every nation was terrified at the mention of the Israelites and something has to be done real quick before they step in to take Moab. First mistake the king made was send for Balaam, <strong>Numbers 22:6, \"Therefore please come at once, curse these people for me, for they are too mighty for me...for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed</strong>\". Could it be possible that he made his living through blessing and cursing? perhaps we are not sure of that. The more I walk with God the more I realize that what God has blessed can no man's curse change it. He that God has blessed is blessed in the field, at home, at work, when driving, in the community. Everything that person touches, gets blessed because what God has blessed can no man go against. Listen to this response in <strong>vs. 12, \"And God said to Balaam, \"You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed</strong>.\" I could stop there because I am blessed already so are you. We are not blessed when we have it, we are blessed on the verge of waiting for it. What God has said can no man terminate.\r\n\r\nBalak was persistence, even after the Lord had refused Balaam from cursing the Israelites, he sent a message again giving promises of how he will honor Balaam, give him whatever he wanted. Very tempting but his stand was sure (or at least for now), he would not go beyond the word of the Lord. What disturbs me is that when the message from the king came again, he sought the Lord. Didn't Balaam know that God would not go against His word when it comes to doing good? What was his motive of seeking the Lord again. He sought to know the will of God again in the situation hoping the Lord would change His mind. This time the Lord told him to go with them but only speak what He would put in his mouth. Immediately after he left God's anger was aroused against him and this left me scratching my head. If God told him to go, why would God be angry with him? Remember I said that temptations are not evil but what we do with them can turn evil. Balaam has been tempted to bring curse on the Israelites and he will be honored (this was a benefit to him). He was torn in between as to who to listen to, God or Balak, if God gives him an okay to curse, then he will gain out of that curse. God evaluates, both motives and actions. <strong>Individuals inner heart attitudes, such as Balaam's desire for power and money, will eventually be revealed no matter what outward disguise they use</strong>. He must have been quick to leave the place to go and meet the king. <strong>Vs. 22\"...and the Angel of the Lord took His stand in the way as an adversary against him\". </strong>\r\n\r\nTo get the series rolling, who do you blame when things are not going well? Do you feel blessed? Who is leading you? we will talk more about Balaam. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Numbers 22:1-41, \"The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the last message, temptations are not evil, what is done with them can be. I also mentioned the fact that we always struggle to know whether we are led of the Spirit or the flesh. Prophet Samuel in <strong>1Samuel 16</strong> almost made a big mistake when God asked him to go to Jesse's house to anoint the next king. He picked the wrong man who looked more of a king type. <!--more-->Prophet Samuel, a man of God, a man who hears from the Lord almost anointed the wrong man because he looked on the outside, God looks on the inside. God had to stand in the way and stop the oil from running and then directed him to the right man David. I wonder if he tried to cast out demons since the man he wanted to anoint oil would not flow on him however in our day a number exercise this. If this can happen to a prophet of God, we are not exempt.\r\n\r\n<strong>Numbers 22:23, \"Now the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road\". The Angel of the Lord here is some manifestation of God Himself</strong>. At times it refers to the Angel of God and at times the Lord, in all, God is the One in the picture. Of all, it's the donkey that saw the Angel of the Lord, showing God reveals Himself to whoever He wants to. Here is Balaam hurrying to get to Balak, already the Lord said he will not curse the Israelites, twice he sought the Lord in regards to it and twice he received the same answer. Finally the Lord allows him to go to Balak but the instructions are to wait for the words of the Lord to be put in his mouth. Why would the Lord stop him on the road if He had sent him? Here is what I believe, he was impatient, he was not going for the Lord but for himself. He was not a true prophet of God, he was a profit.\r\n\r\nThe Angel of the Lord standing on the way was really to his benefit as we can tell he is going to sin. God would not want us to sin so He will stand in the way, but at times we try so hard to push our way through casting demons thinking they are in our way when in the actual sense it's the Lord's doing. You might be riding on something to a destination, to a higher level and if things are not moving fast as expected, what do you do?, do you try and abuse everything that has always been beneficial to you? Under frustrations many people tend to do stupid things, some smash their walls, what they have in their houses or around them because they are mad. The same happened to Balaam, at his frustrations, he began to abuse what had always been beneficial to him, the donkey.\r\n\r\nSomething to think about, from day one to this very day, the donkey had never disobeyed the owner, couldn't he stop, think and check why the animal was not moving? he didn't care about what was happening to his donkey, all he cared about was reaching Balak for selfish reasons. There are people who will not care about their valued assets such as people around them, all they will care about is reaching the top but God knows how to stop you and I on our track when the evil is beginning to surface and prevail. It started with temptation, an enemy given a room and now he is in control. One thing to note, everything evil you could ever think of is already in each and every one of us. If the Lord was not controlling the thermostat (standing in the way), there are things that could have manifested by now. I thank God that He has prevented us from doing the worst to ourselves.\r\n\r\n<strong>Numbers 22:28, \"Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, \"What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?\" </strong>If the Lord can't get your attention through things He is doing, He will get your attention through extra ordinary stuff. Balaam did not discern that the Lord tried to stop him because he was concerned about where he was going, then God opens the mouth of the donkey to speak. For a few minutes, he argues with the donkey but not clicking in his mind that this donkey was speaking. Why is he stubborn to see that the Lord has stopped him? simple, <strong>his heart is not on what the Lord is doing, he is blinded by it because of his motives</strong>. It is possible to have dreams, ambitions, desires cloud the path God would want to take us. It could be on the same way, but Him standing on the way could mean things like, have faith in me, don't lose focus; be patient I am the one leading you; lean not on your own understanding; real motives of desires? What could be a blessing to you could be a curse because of the way it is handled. Starting perfectly in the spirit but progressed in the flesh. Starting in the spirit means starting with God, ending in the flesh means God is no longer present in it.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to start with God and as things begin to fall in place, and you see yourself succeeding forget God knowingly or unknowingly and it's because what you wanted to accomplish has consumed you to the extent that you don't need God. If God interrupts, stop and seek God, \"<em>what do you want me to learn from this Lord, what I'm I doing wrong? what is the condition of my heart? what is really my motive for pursuing this?\". </em>You could be casting God thinking it's the devil.

              "<strong>Numbers 22:1-41, \"The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nWhat we've been sharing on has some real day to day practical lessons, and the more I read this story, the more it's becoming clear in understanding what God is doing. Three chapters in Numbers touch on Balaam dealing with God thereafter you don't hear of Balaam again until much later when he is killed. One lesson we want to get out of today's word is, <strong>\"If you won’t humble yourself, God will\". I would rather humble myself than have God do it. <!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nA thought came into my mind from yesterday’s message and it made sense. God told Balaam that He will put His words in His mouth so as to speak them and then He also puts His words in the donkey's mouth to also speak. I learnt this, even in the midst of your weaknesses and failures, if God appointed you to be the person to use, He will preserve you all through. If He could cause the donkey to speak, He could have used the donkey to convey the message to Balak in this case, Balaam was chosen to speak.\r\n\r\n<strong>Numbers 22:28-29, \"28 Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, \"What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?\" 29, \"And Balaam said to the donkey, \"Because you have abused me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you!\". </strong>Shifting blames ruins lives because it does not permit taking full responsibility by admitting and desiring to be healed. Bitter breakups always have both parties blaming each other for the failure of a relationship. Balaam is accusing the donkey of abusing him when in the actual sense, he is the one who is abusing the donkey. The reason is simple, the donkey is not doing what he wants (it’s about him) but what God wants. Why do we have WAR? because <strong>WAR </strong>can be used as an acronym \"<strong>W</strong>e <strong>A</strong>re <strong>R</strong>ight\". It could be true that you are right, but how about if you are wrong? If eye can trick us to think that on a hot sunny day you can see water on the highway when there is none and if the eyes can trick us that the sky is blue, there is a possibility that you could be wrong yet feel right. You can win an argument but loose the truth, you can also win an argument by your facts and loose a relationship. Our friend Balaam is so furious, mad, raged because he feels he has been wronged, that leads him to inflict more pain to his donkey and we know that he was the one who was wrong.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 31, \"Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand; and he bowed his head and fell flat on his face\". </strong>Encountering with God will show you who is wrong, hence creating an atmosphere of repentance. Don't be surprised if God uses other people especially the called to advise you on what you shouldn't do. They could be the people He is using to stop you on your truck from making the biggest mistake of your life. They could be used to warn you about the person you are about to marry, or a job you are about to take, or a group of people you are about to hook up with or something you are involved with that will drive away His presence<strong>. If you insist, God may permit you to go ahead and not approve of it or be part of it</strong>, the choice is yours and mine. We can see that finally Balaam understands who was standing in the way and that drove him to fall on his face and repent (not true repentance though). He was asked why he struck his donkey three times to show that what God has blessed you with is not subject to abuse. <strong>vs. 31, \"...Behold, I have come out to stand against you, because your way is perverse before Me</strong>\", the Lord searches the heart and tries the mind, He knows every motive whether be good or bad. It's revealed to us that Balaam had a perverse heart which means directing away from what is right or good. In other words, obstinately persisting in error or fault (stubborn). <strong>An opportunity can test your integrity remember that</strong>. His opportunity to be used by God tested his integrity thus causing the inner things in his heart he might have not known were there surfaced. You will agree with me that there are people who really changed with time as they gained more, became successful. They became arrogant, stubborn, prideful etc.,<strong> their one time humility that everyone admired had been swallowed by what they had gained and no one mattered anymore</strong>. When God is taking you to greater levels, also pray that He will enlarge your character to stabilize your integrity. No one wants His blessings turn into a curse. <strong>Proverbs 10:22, \"The blessing of the Lord makes one rich, And He adds no sorrows with it\".</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 33</strong>, \"<strong>The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live\". </strong>The donkey knew the Lord and feared him, how much more is the person created by God should see Him in situations and fear Him. Balaam almost died while the donkey would have lived but I believe that what God has started in a person, He will be faithful to complete it. Balaam was to speak God's words, though he stumbled, God had to humble him and instead of giving him justice, he gave him mercy, a chance to start again. That is the God we fall in love with, God of second chances. To continue Evans"

              "<strong>Numbers 22:1-41, \"The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nIf you will not humble yourself, God will. Let's see what the Lord has for us as we finish. <strong>Vs. 34. \"And Balaam said to the Angel of the LORD; \"I have sinned; ... Now therefore; if it displeases You; I will turn back.\"; 35, \"Then the Angel of the LORD said to Balaam; \"Go with the men; but only the word that I speak to you; that you shall speak.\" </strong>We said God is a God of second chances, here we have a man who acknowledges his sins, how selfish, stubborn and arrogant he had been<!--more-->. Declaring “not my will but yours be done”. If you look at it from the beginning, it was about him, now that he has been humbled, he is ready to do whatever pleases the Lord even if it means terminating the mission but not with a perfect heart though. <strong>He is ready to sacrifice what he desires for what the Lord requires</strong>. <strong>Psalms 51:17, \"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, A broken and a contrite heart-- These, O God, You will not despise\". </strong>And anyone who comes to the Lord in this manner, the bible says God will not despise him. It does not matter how many times you have fallen, if you are willing to come to Him with a repentant heart, He is waiting for you with open arms. David says, \"<strong>Let us fall into the hands of the living God</strong>\" for He is a God of mercy and second chances. His humility, repentance and decreasing channeled to be led of God and not himself.\r\n\r\nA chastised Balaam ready to do the will of God comes to Balaak with a different motive. He knows God will not curse the Israelites and by now he knows that whatever the Lord will put in his mouth will be in favor of the Israelites and not for the Moabites. As you read in <strong>chapter 23</strong>, God used him to speak more blessings upon the Israelites. The more he did, the more Balaak became angry. The more Balaak asked him to curse the Israelites the more God spoke blessings over the Israelites through Balaam. The more God used Balaam, the more he learned God's nature and character and the more he also preached the same to Balaak. <strong>Numbers 23:19, \"God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good? 20, \"Behold, I have received a command to bless;\". </strong>In other words, “I <em>tried twice to have Him reverse what He had done and He did not and I am here to tell you as His mouth piece,</em><strong><em> GOD WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND WHEN IT COMES TO DOING GOOD</em></strong><em>\"</em>. He does not say one thing and do something else therefore we shouldn't see Him the way we see man. Man can make promises they can't keep, God will keep His promises. Man will lie, God is the author of truth. God will not repent, because He never makes mistakes. Perfect is HE!. This was a message Balaam was bringing to Balaak but because of the hardness of Balaak’s heart, none of these messages were getting to his heart. He still desired Balaam to curse Israelites.\r\n\r\n<strong>Numbers 24:1, \"Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times, to seek to use sorcery, but he set his face toward the wilderness\", </strong>My greatest desire and zeal is to please the Lord. Learning what He requires of me and doing it will please the Lord. If I can please the Lord, I would have accomplished what He requires of me. The more Balaam walked and spoke God's words, the more he discovered what pleased the Lord and the more he performed them. He would always go before God and inquire only to learn that God will always bless so why not just go ahead and bless the people. God said, <strong>\"I will write my laws in their hearts that they will know what to do without me even telling them</strong>\"(paraphrased), <strong>Proverbs 10:32, \"The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable</strong>\". That is what walking with Christ is all about, climbing from glory to glory, learning more of God and becoming like Him. <strong>John 1:12, \"As many as received Him, to them gave ye the power TO BECOME the sons of God</strong>\". What does this mean, the more you walk with Him, the more you are becoming like Him (not there yet but getting there). As for Balaam, he now understood what pleased the Lord and that is to bless Israel and not only that, he discovered a secret, <strong>Numbers 24:8, \"...Blessed is he who blesses You, and cursed is he who curses You\". You bless God's people, His people will be blessed, you will be blessed and He will be pleased</strong>. What Balaak had offered Balaam could not be compared to what God was doing, though Balaak was angry against Balaam, none of that could change what he had destined to do for the Lord.\r\n\r\nWhat are his beginning words and ending words, <strong>Numbers 24:12, \"So Balaam said to Balaak, \"Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, 13, \"If Balaak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD, to do good or bad of my own will. What the LORD says, that I must speak'”. </strong>He said this in the beginning but almost compromised his integrity, he started poorly but finished this race gracefully. There is so much I could share about Balaam but I hope you have learnt something just like I have. Few lessons, we need to know who is standing on the way. Also it does not matter how you start, how you finish matter's a lot; God will not curse or let you curse what He has blessed; if you can't humble yourself, God will; as you walk with God and know what pleases Him, you will perform it even when He does not speak; the more you bless His people, the more you are blessed; do not abuse what God has used to be a blessing to you. Balaam had great flaws, yet God used him and so will He use us, Have a blessed weekend Evans"

              "<strong>Numbers 25:1-18, vs. “10 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 11 “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned back My wrath from the children of Israel, because he was zealous with My zeal among them, so that I did not consume the children of Israel in My zeal</span>. 12 Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him My covenant of peace; 13 and it shall be to him and his descendants after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood,because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.’”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5983\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image5.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nRecently I penned a number of messages from the book of <strong>Numbers 21</strong> dealing with the bronze serpent (<strong>Title:</strong> <strong>Killing Serpents, Delivering Savior</strong>), and <strong>Numbers 22-24</strong> dealing with Balaam (<strong>Title: Who is standing on your way?</strong>) As I continued to read through <strong>Numbers 25</strong>, something struck me from this passage in line with a recent conference I will mention in the message.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->After Balaak the king of Moab could not get Balaam to curse God's people because God would not let him, the Moabites came up with a strategy to entice the Israelites to sin against God. The Midianites also bought into this strategy because of its effectiveness. <strong>Numbers 25:1, reads,</strong> \"<strong>Now Israel remained in Acacia Grove, and the people began to commit harlotry with the women of Moab\" </strong>and how did the Moabite and the Midianite women do this?,<strong> vs. \"2 They invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. 3 So Israel was joined to Baal of Peor, and the anger of the LORD was aroused against Israel\"</strong>. The biggest sin here was idolatry because it opened doors to other sins. The local Moabite and Midianite women enticed many of the men to join them in sexual rituals in worship of Canaanite god Baal. Not that they abandoned God, they mixed Him in with the other gods, something Elijah also had to deal with at a later time.\r\n\r\nAnd the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel; for no sin is more provoking to God than idolatry, that being so directly opposite to his nature, honor, and glory, as well as to His will and worship. In the midst of this perverse act of the Israelites, the Lord was fed up and at His command ordered Moses to execute all the leaders of those people who had taken part in the rituals. While the command was given, a man by the name of Zimri walked by with a Midianite woman past all the leaders including Moses, past those who were wailing perhaps in repentance and went in to a tent to sleep with her.\r\n\r\nWe must understand a little bit about Zimri, a man who defied all the leaders to do such acts in the presence of everybody. We are not told exactly of who he was until later in vs.<strong>“14 Now the name of the Israelite who was killed, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father’s house among the Simeonites</strong>.” Zimri was a leader, and more than that as the Matthew Henry the commentator writes, he was a prince of some sought perhaps having been appointed by Moses to be captain over 100 or over a 1,000.\r\n\r\nHis act led another man to do something, <strong>Numbers 25:7-8, \"7 Now when Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand; 8 and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stopped among the children of Israel</strong>\"\r\n\r\nWhat drives a man to take such drastic action that would be condemned by anyone but Phinehas the son Eleazer? Phineas was Aaron's grandson a priest having come from the lineage of priests. What drove him to act the way he did?, simple <strong>the zeal for God</strong>. He saw the perversion, he received the command and with readiness, he acted because God's great name was on the line. While others may have been slow to act including Moses, something was boiling inside Phinehas perhaps remembering what happened to his two uncles Nadab and Abihu who offered strange fire before God and God consumed them, (<strong>Leviticus 10</strong>) and realized God's name, His doctrine, His worship will not be mocked.

              "<strong>Numbers 25:1-18, vs. “10 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 11 “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned back My wrath from the children of Israel, because he was zealous with My zeal among them, so that I did not consume the children of Israel in My zeal</span>. 12 Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him My covenant of peace; 13 and it shall be to him and his descendants after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.’”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image6.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5986\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image6.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nPhinehas act in killing Zimri turned God's wrath from the Israelites from more people dying. At this point about 24,000 had died. Who knows if Moses confronted him on his action and God had to come on Phinehas' rescue. Vs. 10 says<strong> \"10 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying: 11 “Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned back My wrath from the children of Israel, because <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">he was zealous with My zeal among them</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">so that I did not consume the children of Israel in My zeal\"</span>. Phinehas had God's zeal and in that he acted.</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->God called Phinehas' zeal His zeal to show it originated with Him. “<em>Though he did no more than it was his duty to do as a judge, yet because he did it with extraordinary zeal against sin, and for the honour of God and Israel, and did it when the other judges, out of respect to Zimri's character as a prince, were afraid, and declined doing it, therefore God showed himself particularly well pleased with him, and it was counted to him for righteousness”,</em> Matthew Henry.\r\n\r\nToday more and more leaders in the Christian circles have committed idolatry by perverting the gospel (introducing heresy), mixed with metaphysical stuff, advanced in the worldly ways of doing things etc. While many leaders who should stand and speak against such have been quite which in some ways have given seal of approval or empowered such to continue in their perverse ways.  In the midst of it all, there have been a few Phinehases who have had the zeal of God to thrust the javelin (God’s word) at the heart of the perversion. This past week there was a conference \"<strong>Strange fire Conference</strong>\" led by Pastor John McArthur at Grace Community church dealing with this perversion especially in the charismatic circles that has taken over most of the Christian television network with bizarre teachings and actions. While I did not agree with everything that was said at the conference<strong>, I applaud men who are willing to stand and defend the gospel and it's truth from those who have hijacked it at all costs</strong>. These men at the conference joined men like David Wilkerson, Leonard Ravenhill, Carter Conlon, Dr. Walter Martin among others who with such great zeal have spoken against those in this movement who have perverted the gospel. This only happens when the zeal of God consumes you.\r\n\r\nPhinehas’ <em>“spirit was stirred up, he was filled and fired with zeal for the glory of God, and with an holy indignation against the sin and sinner, and with a just concern for the honour of the righteous law of God; and, to prevent others from falling into the same sin, led by the public example of so great a personage, as it appears afterwards this man was:</em>”, John Gill.\r\n\r\nThis same zeal is seen when Jesus in <strong>Matthew 21</strong> went into His house only to find that His house of prayer, house of worship had been turned into a house of trade. He said they had turned it into a den of thieves. A place where leaders of the day did business, used His house to make merchandise off God’s people. When He stepped in with holy anger to drive away these people and restore the house, <strong>“ … His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for Your house has eaten Me up.</strong>”, <strong>John 2:17</strong>, echoing <strong>Psalm 69:9. </strong>\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?, because Phinehas here is a type of Christ, whose zeal for the house of God, for purity of the doctrine, Godly discipline, and worship of it, for the salvation of His people, and the glory of God thereby, ate him up and had to do something and for that he was commended for.\r\n\r\nThe act of Phinehas not only saved the present generation, it also preserved the purity of priesthood for the future generation. <strong>Numbers 25:12-13, \"12 Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him My covenant of peace; 13 and it shall be to him and his descendants after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.’”</strong>\r\n\r\nIf we don’t step up now and speak boldly against those perverting the gospel, who will? Those who have zeal for God should take the true gospel as the javelin and pierce through the heart of the perversion to stop it from living and doing more harm. If we don’t fight for our children by exposing the charlatans and cleaning up the house now, how will they stand when we are gone or are in no position to defend them?\r\n\r\n<em>“It is requisite that ministers should be not only for God, but zealous for God. It is required of them that they do more than others for the support and advancement of the interests of God's kingdom among men”, </em>Matthew Henry. Moses kept silent so were the other leaders, Phinehas chose to rise up and challenge those who defied the truth and the honor of God. <strong>Matthew 11:12, “ And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force</strong>” May the Lord help us. <span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">, Blessings Ev</span>"

              "<strong>John 8:12, \"Then Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIt happened one time, one Thursday August 14, 2003, about 5 pm for me, with no warning, and no solution when a blackout came. At first I thought it was just where I was, but then I looked outside and realized that the block where I worked in White Plains had black out too. I then learned that a huge part of NY was out of power. Then news came to me that the blackout had further reaching implications than I had thought, it affected most of the North East region. What would you be doing at a time like this or thinking, and how would you be affected? Maybe the Word of God can shed some \"light\" on things in our lives and serve as an intense implication. <strong>John 8:12, \"Then Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\"<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>I am the light of the world</strong>: Jesus had an identity, He surely knew who He was and His purpose. He was the light for the entire world. He came into the world to shine upon the darkness of it. <strong>And what is darkness, but simply the absence of light</strong>. And Christ was not going to be light for a small community, or just for Israel, but for the WHOLE WORLD. Jesus came in more important than the sun, because the spiritual darkness of this world needed a great light. The \"candles\" of judges, prophets, and patriarchs throughout history were not complete in that the \"wicks\" of their times were light for a time, but would go out with the death of the prophets. BUT NOT WITH JESUS! He was the light that would shine for the whole world to experience, because it was the whole world that needed Him, even unbeknown to themselves. So why is not the light of Christ shinning throughout the hearts and lives of ALL in the world?\r\n\r\n<strong>Whoever follows me will NOT walk in darkness</strong>: The key is in the following Christ. <strong>Are you a fan or a follower </strong>is a message I heard once by a preacher Pat Mesiti. A fan is someone who when the Yankees, or their team are winning stay with, and support the team as long as they are winning. But the followers are the ones that stay with their team, win or lose, good and bad times. A follower follows no matter what happens. They will paint their car, or their body with the symbols of their favorite team. There are some who are only fans of Christ: whenever; things don't go their way, they jump off the ship. Then there are the followers, no matter what happens they will stick it out. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were followers. When the king said to bow to the idol, they refused, saying God can save them, but even if He does not they still would not bow. WOW, now that's a follower. Daniel would not allow a lion's den to keep him from his prayer time. That's a follower. And Job refused to curse God in his tough times, but rather stay committed no matter what. That's a follower.\r\n\r\nThe rich young ruler when invited to follow Christ, chose his riches, his idols, instead of following Christ. He stayed in darkness. Is it all contingent upon following Christ? Yes!\r\n\r\nWhat keeps us from being a follower? Sin! \"<strong>The soul that sins it shall die</strong>!\" A.N. Martin said, \"<strong>The moment God's Law ceases to be the most powerful factor in influencing the moral sensitivity of any individual or nation, there will be indifference to Divine wrath, and when indifference comes in it always brings in its train indifference to salvation.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAre you in a spiritual blackout?\r\n\r\n1. Are you living in sin (vs. 34) \"...whoever sins is a slave to sin.\"\r\n2. Are you a fan or a follower?\r\n3. Is the light of Christ in your life shinning before others that they may see? SEE Mt. 5:16\r\n4. Do you continually plug into the power source of light through prayer to keep the light on?\r\n\r\nBlessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Acts 8:30-31, “30 So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?” 31 And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>GO</strong>! “<strong><em>Philip ran to him</em></strong>”. There is a term that I heard in the past called INSTANT OBEDIENCE. Jesus commanded us to, <strong>“The angel of God told Philip “’Arise and go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.’ This is desert.</strong>” <!--more-->\r\nThere was a specific direction and place that Philip was commanded to go in. This is desert refers to a deserted place. Old Gaza was a deserted town whose ruins lay near the now culturally Greek cities of Askalon and New Gaza. Philip might have no one to preach to on a little-traveled road that would lead by a deserted city, and after the revival in Samaria this command must seem absurd to him; <strong>but God had often tested faith through such commands</strong> (e.g<strong>., Exodus 14:16; 1 Kings 17:3–4, 9–14; 2 Kings 5:10</strong>) (IVP Bible Background Commentary). This deserted town was going to be filled by an Ethiopian eunuch and his entourage, Philip, and the Holy Spirit. God would bring all these together so that one man may receive the Gospel. What a great and kind God He is!\r\n\r\n<strong>Listen</strong>. Philip heard him. “<strong><em>Philip….heard him reading the prophet Isaiah</em></strong>” Do you listen to people? Philip had his ears open. Although taught along with reading aloud in modern times, the skill of reading silently was not developed in antiquity; those who could read nearly always read aloud. God used this reading style in the situation here to obviously divinely arrange this encounter (cf., e.g., <strong>Genesis 24:13–27</strong>). In <strong>John chapter 4</strong>, in His encounter with the women at the well, Jesus first asks the women for water thus <strong>relating</strong> to her. Then He explained to her that He offered living waters thus <strong>creating</strong> an opportunity to swing from natural water to spiritual water. As Philip was listening to this man, he heard this.\r\n\r\n<strong>Initiate conversation</strong>. “<strong><em>Do you understand what you are reading?</em></strong>” We have been raised with the notion that says, “Don’t talk to strangers.” Some keep to that when they become Christians, but this is a horrible display of obedience to the Lord who commands us to “<strong><em>Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature</em></strong>,” many of whom will be strangers. The Gospel is simply not limited to those that we know. Philip didn’t know this eunuch yet he started the conversation with this man and rightfully so, otherwise his obeying God to run after the chariot would have been pointless. However if you run after someone, you better have something to say to them about God. When Philip asked the question he was insinuating that he could explain the passage of Scripture. That could have perhaps been taken as a very offensive question. This man was probably a high official of the Queen of Ethiopia at that time, and I would venture that he was a very intelligent man to be the treasurer for the queen. He could have responded that he could interpret this passage himself; after all he was a man that was a man of great status. How well would this go over in our relativistic culture, where is it acceptable that everyone can interpret the Bible in the manner they see it. This is called isegeses (bringing your own meaning to a text). However, the science of biblical interpretation is called exegeses, which means that the Bible speaks for itself, hence the preacher just echoes what the author wrote; what did the author mean (not what do you think he meant) when he wrote his passage? I recommend a great resource called Herman Who available at <a href=\"http://www.livingwaters.com/\">www.livingwaters.com</a> to help you learn how to do this process for yourself.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sit with them</strong>. Philip sat with him. Have you ever sat down to engage a complete stranger with the sole purpose of sharing the Gospel with him or her? It is an awesome thing no matter the result. For every person that has given me the courtesy of in witnessing to them one-to-one each one of them have been led to Christ. Perhaps you are thinking that is impossible! Not really because the path that I pointed to was that Christ was the ONLY way of salvation and since they are condemned already apart from Christ (<strong>John 3</strong>) I can’t possibly lead them away from Him. We are simply called to be faithful and point people to Jesus Christ to which some will respond in repentance and trust in the Savior, while others will pridefully reject the kindness of Christ and stay in their condemnation. Jesus was called a friends of sinners (<strong>Matthew 11:19</strong>), which is a title that no doubt the religious people gave to Him. However, how does one get such a name unless one is with sinners? However Jesus purpose of sitting with sinners, was because He shared in their common interest in sin, but to reach them with the Gospel, as the Gospel (Christ Himself) so they might be soundly saved in Christ! When is the last time you sat with an unsaved person to share the Gospel with them. To continue, Blessing Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Acts 8:30-31, “30 So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?” 31 And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Explain the Word of God to them</strong>. Philip explained the Word of God to him. As a physical eunuch, he would have been denied access to the temple (<strong>Deut. 23:1</strong>). If this man was to be reached with the gospel it would have to be outside the temple, which is the plan which God set up, using His servant Philip for this man. <!--more-->\r\nIsn’t it great that God does not dwell in buildings made with human hands. Philip didn’t run to the chariot and then decide to abandon his evangelistic mission. He was determined to be a faithful ambassador as Paul wrote, “<strong>Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ’s behalf, be reconciled to God</strong>.” How did Philip know how to explain the passage that the eunuch was reading? In <strong>Acts 6</strong>, seven men were to be chosen for ministry and the men needed to possess certain qualifications for ministry. The qualifications were the following: “…<strong>men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom,</strong>” to which Philip was chosen as one of the seven. Philip had a good reputation among the Church. He was also full of the Holy Spirit; he didn’t operate on his own but was rather guided and obedient to the Holy Spirit which was upon his life. And finally Philip had wisdom, knowing the Word of God and the God of the Word! It’s no wonder why he was able to explain the Word of God to this man. Ray Comfort often says there are only two times to share the Gospel, “<strong>in season and out of season</strong>,” to which Philip exemplified this reality.\r\n\r\n<strong>Preach Jesus</strong>. Perhaps this sounds like a no brainer, but there is something that can easily be missed here. Philip preached Jesus, because the man he spoke to was humble and therefore ready for the Gospel of Christ. Although Philip finished with preaching Jesus, he did not start there. He started with the prophets, specifically the book of <strong>Isaiah chapter 53</strong>. Philip realized how to take this passage and point to the man to Christ with it. Would you have been able to do the same? It is wise to be able to start with the Law and the Prophets, they both point to Christ and we should learn how to take people from there to Jesus as Philip did. Some people are not ready to hear about Christ yet however, because they are not broken over their sin by the Law of God nor does the one you may be witnessing to see by the Old Testament prophets that the prophets all pointed to Christ and the coming of the Messiah. In this Isaiah passage it reads, “<strong>He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before its shearer is silent,So He opened not His mouth.33In His humiliation Hisjustice was taken away, And who will declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Isaiah 53:7</strong> points us to Jesus who was the sheep lead to the slaughter during His crucifixion (John 10). Following this the prophet wrote, “As a lamb before its shearers is silent” Recall when Jesus was being accused, and remember his response in <strong>Matthew 27</strong> which reads, “<strong>12 And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing. 13 Then Pilate said to Him, “Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?” 14 But He answered him not one word, so that the governor marveled greatly. In his humility His justice was taken away</strong>. <strong>Luke 23:1-25</strong> records the fulfillment of this. “<em>And who will declare His generation?</em> For His life is taken from the earth,” <strong>Luke 23:33–46</strong> displays the fulfillment of this aspect of the prophecy in the life of Christ. Philip knew this and began to explain these things to the eunuch he share the Gospel with, because he knew the truth. Once again, would you be able to explain such a thing? Philip was not a pastor, but a deacon of the Church, yet he was equipped to stand for the Gospel and this crucial moment. I encourage you to also get equipped to share the Gospel with the lost. If you met a Jewish person this passage of Scripture is an excellent one to point out to them as it talks about Jesus Christ. Furthermore, many Jewish people they also accept the Law of Moses. Did you know that most of the witnessing done in the New Testament was when a follower of Christ shared the Gospel with a stranger as opposed to a follower of Christ only sharing their faith with someone they had a previous relationship with? Please visit our website and click on the pie graph for an explanation of this, which can be found at <a href=\"http://www.soulfishinministries.org/\">www.soulfishinministries.org</a>.\r\n\r\nReaching people for Christ is the highest calling anyone can have, and if you are a Christian then He has commanded you to share your faith with lost sinners, so that they might come to know Him. We are called to know God and to make Him known. It is simply not enough to talk to God about the unsaved in prayer, but we must also talk to the unsaved about God. Now go and be faithful.\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Phil Sessa, Evangelist – Soulfishing Ministries &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Genesis 1:1,\"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\", John 1:1-5, vs. 1, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/images.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6281\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/images.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"images\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nTo read the bible, you have to believe everything that is written. There are people including Christians who choose what they can believe in the bible and reject the rest. In their mind, they don't see how such and such a thing could happen and so they sum it up as good stories to teach us something but not necessarily what happened. How many people find it hard to believe God parting the red sea or Noah and the ark? They conclude they are too good to be true. For me to understand that all things are possible, I have to go back to the beginning.\r\n\r\nGenesis starts with this line, <strong>\"In the beginning GOD…\" </strong>and In the gospel according to John, he does not begin with Jesus' birth, or his genealogy or the beginning of his ministry, he takes us back to creation.<!--more--> If I can go back to the beginning and see how things began, I can understand the future for I know who has it in His hands. John begins his writing with <strong>vs. 1, \"In the beginning was the Word\", </strong>in other words, in the beginning GOD. Before anything was created, God was already existing. Not restricted with time for He is eternal. God is the beginning and your life and my mine starts and ends with Him. If \"<strong>in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God</strong>\", then the truth is the bible and His Word has no lies or errors, we can trust His word.\r\n\r\nIt all started with God who is the Word, He spoke His Word to what did not exist that it may exist. Only God in and of the beginning could create things out of nothing the concept many have a problem with. People can make things out of something or some things, God made things out of nothing. As the Word, He spoke things into existence, that is creation, In <strong>Isaiah 55:11</strong>, the bible says , \"<strong>So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it\". </strong>He created everything and there is nothing too difficult for Him.\r\n\r\nHe created us (man) meaning created our spirit out of nothing but then did something that he did not do with any of His other creation and that is, He formed us out of something, <strong>Genesis 2:7, \"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being\". </strong>Of all the creation He spoke into existence, He further reached to the ground and formed man which distinguishes us from any other creation. His hand has been on man from the beginning till now. That He was so mindful of man that He picked dust from the ground formed which I would say designed, breathed into His nostril the breath of life and man became a living being (soul). What an amazing beginning, this should throw out any doubts you may have had about God of His word. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Creating you was a miracle, saving you was the greatest miracle, His hand on your life is a continuous miracle</span>. The beginning changes my destiny for <strong>\"I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day\", 2Timothy 1:12. </strong>If you ever find yourself doubting whether things are possible, whether His hand is upon your life or whether His word is true, just take a trip back to <strong>Genesis 1:1, “In the beginning God…”, blessings Ev</strong>"

              "<strong>1Timothy 4:12, \"Let no man despise your youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in purity\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to the dictionary definition,<strong> an ambassador is a diplomatic official of the highest rank appointed and credited as representative in residence by one government or sovereign to another</strong>. Also an ambassador can be defined as an <strong>authorized messenger or representative</strong>. Let's look at how it is presented to us in the bible, this name is used by the apostles <strong>as designating those who are appointed by God to declare His will\".<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nTo sum it, an ambassador is <strong>a representative </strong>mostly for a country in another nation. An ambassador is not APPOINTED and not ELECTED. By that I mean, there are no ballots cast to be one. Within the fences of ambassador’s offices in other countries are considered as the country they representing. We have been allowed an awesome opportunity as Christians to be Ambassadors for Christ here on earth, it's a high rank. We are representing the Kingdom of God. We have not been elected but appointed by God, <strong>1Peter 2:9, says \"9 But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;\".</strong> We are chosen to represent the Kingdom of God everywhere we go and we have been allowed to have some type of dwelling that those who are running looking for shelter can find refuge in our midst for there is safety within. Paul writes to Timothy and shares with him a few things that he needs to keep in mind as a representative. As a representative, what you portray out there is what people will think of the kingdom you are representing. Paul encourages him number one not to allow any man to despise his youth. When we understand that we are not called on the merit of age or knowledge, we begin to look at ourselves the way God does. When God approached Jeremiah and told him that He had appointed him to be an ambassador, what did he say, <strong>\"I am just but a child\" </strong>and God tells him in <strong>Jeremiah 1:5, \"5 “ Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet (ambassador) to the nations\".</strong> He already predestined each of us and He tells him not to be afraid for the calling was already .\r\n\r\nAfter Paul's tells Timothy not to allow any man to despise his youth, he encourages him by telling him to be<strong> an example of the believers in other words, be a model, a pattern of the believers</strong>. It is hard to represent the kingdom when your life is not right with God and that is because you will not know what is accepted by Kingdom of God. The bible says that <strong>a man's ways are right in his own eyes but the end is destruction </strong>and that is why my prayer as an ambassador is, <strong>Psalm 25:4&amp;5, “Show me Your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths. 5 Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation; On You I wait all the day.”, Psalm 86:10, “Teach me Your way, O LORD; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name.\" </strong>If we are going to be representatives, we need to be learners of the word of God. We need to be taught in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in purity. A heavenly representative should have these qualities to back up what they confess<strong>. It's one thing to confess, it's another thing to live in the light of your confession.</strong> I know that even at Awards people talk about the Lord and all that, but I come back to look at their lifestyle and some lead other’s astray and I say, <strong>Matthew 7:16, \"Ye shall know them by their fruits\". </strong>We too cannot just speak what is right, we have to live by our confession otherwise we will have no fruits to show and we will be deceiving ourselves and others. With your confession, I want to see the fruit to back it up and the same is expected of me. I am an ambassador for Christ therefore I will represent Him and His kingdom down here on earth through the word, in my conversation, in charity, in spirit and in purity. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Timothy 4:3, \"For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear\" (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nThe builders have stumbled upon on a biblical principle called foundation, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">they know that foundation is everything</span>. Every building must or should have a foundation. Foundation is the basis on which a thing stands, is founded upon, or is supported. In a building, foundation is a structure that transfers loads to the earth. Foundation is not on top, it's at the bottom holding the weight of what is to be built on it. Strong and deeper foundation goes down past the weaker upper layer of soil to reach the concrete. <!--more-->How deep and strong a foundation is determines what it can withstand and what is to be built on it. The foundation is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>THE</strong></span> basis or groundwork of anything. A Christian life also begins with a foundation, the question is, which one. Have you ever wondered why you serve Christ? Why you came to Him? Why you go to church? Why you listen to such and such teachings or preaching? As I talk with people, I usually go back to address their foundation because it gives the scope of what kind of foundation they have and what they may be building on it.\r\n\r\nIt's amazing to me of what I hear and see as the means of many church successes. The measure of success appears to be the size of the congregation. To see the size of the congregation continue to increase is looked at as a sign of growth. Search for series used to grow churches today and find it different from what we see in the book of Acts, the same as what has been taught and preached in the past few centuries. As the world uses sex to sell, some churches are using topics such as sex series to build the church, draw the world in, borrowing materials from the world to reach the world. Is Jesus not enough? Is He not the firm foundation? shouldn’t the success of anything be measured by His will? Many churches are becoming more secular and Christians are falling into the trap without discernment. The church has become a self-help place, books are about how you can be happy, how you can achieve your goals and potentials (nothing wrong with these they are put in proper place), question again is, why serve Christ?. I have listened to some people being interviewed going to bible school to become ministers who did not even understand the plan of salvation (the message of the bible), that shows no foundation. And some confessed that it was a good field to make money, wrong foundation. There are churches beginning to have set ups for discussions like talk shows, redefining foundation. Is the church not supposed to set a standard for the world?\r\n\r\nPaul addresses the state of the church to come and here we are today plagued by it and some have fallen right into it without discerning. He says <strong>\"For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine ...\"</strong> and the reason is simple, no strong foundation of faith to define a believer. Easy and expedient Christianity appealing to men rather than God. I believe the church should be done  for believers and the lost can come in and see believers in their God given habitat, lives changed for His glory and they themselves desire their lives changed. I believe the church ought to be a powerhouse not an entertainment field. <strong> A church pleasing to God begins with the believers, we are what makes a church</strong>. Our foundation in Christ determines what kind of church we will have, it must be based on SOUND DOCTRINE. Today because of how foundation is laid, to quote <strong>John MacArthur</strong>, <strong><em>\"Professing Christians, nominal believers in the church follow their own desires and flock to preachers who offer them God’s blessings apart from His forgiveness, and His salvation apart from their repentance. They have an itch to be entertained by teachings that will produce pleasant sensations and leave them with good feelings about themselves. Their goal is that men preach “according to their own desires. Under those conditions, people will dictate what men preach, rather than God dictating it by His Word.” </em></strong>Read what General William Booth the founder of Salvation Army had to say when he foresaw the danger that was coming. He said<strong>, \"<em>The Chief danger of Christianity in 20th century will be…Religion without the Holy Ghost; Christianity without Christ; Forgiveness without repentance; Salvation without regeneration; Politics without God; And heaven without hell”. </em></strong>If any of these are missing on a Christian’s foundation, only time will tell. Wrong foundation cannot last for long, trying to patch it up and support it with other things will not make it stand. Everything has to be taken out of the way and proper foundation is laid, a foundation of truth on God's word.\r\n\r\n<strong>2Timothy 2:15 \"vs. 15Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.... Vs.19 Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.” T</strong>he faithful preacher must proclaim the Word when it is popular and convenient or not, and when it seems suitable to do so or not. The dictates of popular culture, tradition, reputation, acceptance, or esteem in the community (or in the church) must never alter the true preacher’s commitment to proclaim God’s Word and the student of the word must be open to receive the whole counsel of proclaimed word of God all beginning on this foundation. Those who have a wrong foundation will fall on the danger of <strong>2Timothy 4:3</strong>. The chief danger of a Christian life is to have wrong foundation. On what foundation is your Christian life built upon? What kind of teachings are you craving for? Where are you plugged in? blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Genesis 26;19-22, “19 Also Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found a well of running water there. 20 But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek [meaning quarrel], because they quarreled with him. 21 Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that one also. So he called its name Sitnah. 22 And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, because he said, “For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land”</strong>\r\n\r\nAfter Isaac’s servants uncovered the wells, they also dug new wells. The servant’s continued to dig new wells, but for each new well, there were arguments concerning the new well that had been dug. <!--more-->The herdsmen of Gerar and Isaac’s herdsman argued with each other both laying claim to the water in the well. After this they dug another well, but argued over that one too, and they named that well Sitnah, meaning opposition. <strong>“And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth [meaning spacious], because he said, “For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn this day and age, there are many that are arguing about different areas of the Gospel, about people in ministry, about areas of ministry, and about styles or methods of ministry. There are certainly times that the argument is productive and other times it is destructive. Each of us needs to learn how to choose our battles, carefully and wisely, so that God is glorified. There are times to engage, and times to disengage in arguments. In <strong>Acts 15,</strong> there are two conflicts that arose, one concerning over the question of having to be circumcised to be saved, and Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputed with the men from Judea. These men were Judaizers—false teachers who were self-appointed guardians of legalism, teaching a doctrine of salvation by works. Should Paul and Barnabas have argued about this issue, or just walk away and let it go? Well, many would have walked away and would have perhaps “agreed to disagree.” However, this is an issue to go to the mat on (to use a wrestling term), because it is a Gospel issue. As Christians we must determine which issues we are going to go to the mat over and which ones are not worth battling over. The issue here was clearly salvation by works, and therefore would make null and <strong>void Ephesians 2:8-9, “8 For <em>by grace you have been saved through faith</em>, and that not of yourselves; <em>it is</em> the gift of God, 9not of works, lest anyone should boast</strong>.”\r\n\r\nLook at the word of Jude who wrote, <strong>Jude 1:3-4,“1</strong> <strong>Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. 4 For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.”</strong> Jude actually encouraged contending! I think it is clear that we must contend for the faith and contend on Gospel issues. Apologetics is the study of actually defending the faith, which is still a crucial issue in this day and age. We defend the faith, because it is worth defending, and God is glorified as we stand for His word! Do you stand for God’s word? The issue of faith alone being essential for salvation is still an issue today, are we willing to stand for a Gospel issue and make it clear that we cannot agree with those that hold to a salvation by works?. In the <strong>Genesis 26</strong> it reads, “<strong>For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land</strong>.” God will make room for you as you are faithful to the Gospel and cause you to be faithful in the Gospel even as you contend for the Gospel when necessary. To close one of my favorite scriptural accounts is from <strong>Acts 7,</strong> when Stephen is put on trial for Christ. Stephen stands and contends for the Gospel, using harsh but true language toward his Jewish accusers. As he is about to be stoned he says, <strong>“Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”</strong> Jesus stood for Stephen as Stephen stood for Christ! What a blessing! Yet he was willing to contend, and then the blessing followed, and I am sure that God made room for Stephen (his life is recorded in Scripture!) and fruitful, we are still encouraged by the stand that he took, and his story is a model for us to learn how to stand and contend. What a great example, and a great God! Now go and be faithful to the Gospel.\r\nUntil the nets are filled…blessing Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Acts 15:39, “Then the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another “</strong>\r\n\r\nThis account is the famous argument that took place between Paul and Barnabas over John Mark. In part 1 of “When to Contend”, Paul and Barnabas were in agreement and contended together against the Judaizers (<strong>Acts 15:1 – 5</strong>). However, now in <strong>Acts 15:39</strong> they had such a disagreement that they ended up going their separate ways. So the question remains who was right in this contention, Paul or Barnabas? They had worked together for so long.<!--more--> It was Barnabas that took Paul under his wing, and helped the disciples to receive Paul, as they previously knew him as Saul the murderer of those that were part of the Way. <strong>Acts 9:26-27</strong> says, <strong>“26 Andwhen Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple. 27But Barnabas took him and brought <em>him</em> to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road</strong>.” Barnabas validated Saul’s conversion on the road to Damascus to the Apostles that were fearful of him, and they obviously took trusted Barnabas, whose name means the son of encouragement.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the fact that Barnabas took Paul under his wing and I believe discipled him, Paul would not exactly take on Barnabas’ level of encouragement at that time in his life. Barnabas was probably very patient and gracious toward Paul, but Paul did not seem to have the same attitude toward one, John Mark. Barnabas and Paul’s disagreement was over whether to take Mark on the second journey. He had deserted them on the first journey and Paul was not willing to risk the same thing happening again. However, Barnabas was not prepared to journey without Mark. Therefore the question remains, which was right, Paul or Barnabas?\r\n\r\nOne must examine both men in order to respond to this question as there is something to be said in favor of both men. On Paul’s side is the fact that Luke records no sanction or disapproval. The brothers in the church commend him to God’s grace as he leaves on the journey. Luke writes positively about the immediate effect of the journey - churches are strengthened. At the start of the next chapter Timothy enters the picture and we know from the rest of the New Testament that he goes on to play an important part in the work. It almost seems as though he takes Mark’s place.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Barnabas disappears from sight. However there is a clue to his vindication in Paul’s final letter where he writes to Timothy (<strong>2Timothy 4:11</strong>) about the usefulness of Mark. He wants Timothy to bring Mark to Paul in Rome. That is a significant reference. It demonstrates that change had taken place in Paul and, presumably, also in Mark. Paul had not held a grudge that he wrote Mark off indefinitely. We can only imagine that Mark had grown and learned about perseverance. I don’t think it is unreasonable to think that Barnabas may have played a key role in this growth. It is typical of Barnabas to open doors of opportunity to others; he did it for Paul, both in Jerusalem and at Antioch, and his refusal to abandon Mark kept the door open for him.\r\n\r\n<strong>Paul’s eye was on the success of the mission; Barnabas had an eye for the recovery of wounded soldiers</strong> (perhaps there was an added dimension in this case as Mark was a relative). Both kinds of people are needed in the church. If the church was filled with people whose eye were only on the mission, much work would get done but the path would be strewn with hurt and heartache from the wounded that get left behind. If the church was filled only with those who wanted to move at the speed of the slowest or “weakest link”, how much new ground would be broken, or when would the mission ever get carried out? With both kinds of people - including in leadership - both areas can be taken together. Where do you tend to lean more toward? How do you treat those that lean more toward the opposite direction? How have you dealt with this type of conflict in your circles?\r\n\r\nBut the story of Paul and Barnabas shows that it is not easy. They were unable to minister together at this stage. Since these two kinds of leaders are so different, conflict is more or less inevitable. However, were it not for the grace of God, conflict would be hopeless.\r\n\r\n<strong>Acts 15</strong> is along the lines of the story of Joseph and his brothers. God does not allow the brothers off the hook for their sinful behavior, but it recognizes the overruling sovereignty of God. It cannot have been pretty to watch Paul and Barnabas disagree sharply; who knows what illusions were shattered at Antioch that day? But God got His work done. The mission advanced. Timothy came into the picture to become one of Paul’s disciples. And the work of healing, restoration and strengthening was done in the life of Mark. Although they chose to contend with each other, the Gospel went forth, and God was glorified at end!\r\nInspired by Source: <a href=\"http://coastalpastor.wordpress.com/2008/05/14/who-was-right-paul-or-barnabas/\">http://coastalpastor.wordpress.com/2008/05/14/who-was-right-paul-or-barnabas/</a>\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled… blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Acts 17:30-31, “30 Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">but now commands all men everywhere to repent</span>, 31 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness</span> by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.”</strong>\r\n\r\nPaul in one occasion brought the gospel to the Athenians in <strong>Acts 17, </strong>very religious people. They believed that there was a force, a being beyond their ability to understand who made all things. In their state, they lacked understanding of who God truly was (is) though they were very religious. Paul says to them <strong>vs. 22</strong> \"<strong>Men of Athens, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I perceive that in all things you are very religious</span>; 23 for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD\"</strong>. <!--more-->They worshipped a God they did not know and no one ever instructed them of the Creator, His nature and His plan for salvation. In another occasion in <strong>Romans 10</strong>, Paul encountered with the Israelites in vs. 1-2 of <strong>Romans 10</strong> he says,<strong>\"1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved. 2 For I bear them witness <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge</span>\".</strong> The Athenians and the Israelites<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <strong>were NOT ignorant of the existence of a greater being God, they were ignorant of His true nature</strong></span>. To the Israelites, Paul says, <b>R</b><strong>omans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">have not submitted to the righteousness of God</span>\"</strong>. They created a righteousness they were more comfortable with the same righteousness we see today, people coming to the Lord with righteousness they have created for themselves. Before Paul shared with them what it took to be saved, he took time to instruct them on the <strong>true nature of God</strong> that they would have understanding before he shared with them how they could be saved.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the gospel, many teachers jump or rush into these few verses to get sinners saved, <b>R</b><strong>omans 10:9-13, “9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.”… 13 For<em>“whoever calls </em>on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”</strong> Very true, but go back to the beginning and read the <strong>vs. 1-8 </strong>that led to vs. <strong>9</strong>, Paul challenged their righteousness and taught them the righteousness of God revealed through the law of Moses we all fall short of and then he presented Christ who satisfied the demands of the law through His death on the cross and His resurrection. The bible says in vs.” 4 <strong>Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes”,</strong> that was (is) the good news of the gospel. In reading a few verses later within the same chapter, the bible says, Israel rejected the gospel and so were the Athenians. The people who were religious and zealous for God rejected the gospel when Paul taught the true righteousness of God. Preacher Paul Washer said (paraphrased),<strong>“Many people like the idea of God but will not submit if they taught His nature\"(Paraphrased). This scares me because many are led to the Lord without being first instructed on the righteousness of God to let go of their self righteousness and submit to the righteousness of God.</strong>\r\n\r\nTo be truly saved, one cannot be ignorant of the righteousness of God revealed through the law. The righteousness of God should either make a sinner very angry like many of the Israelites and Athenians who rejected the gospel though dubbed zealous and religious or be humbled by the righteousness of God like Isaiah who was said “<strong>Woe is me for I’m done</strong>” and cried for mercy. One thief on the cross ignorant in the beginning acknowledged his deep sin when he realized he had transgressed the law and understood he deserved to be crucified yet there was a Man in the middle who did not deserve to be there, He was innocent. This thief was ignorant because in the beginning he like the other thief was mocking Jesus. But then looking at Jesus on the cross, innocent Man on the cross, his ignorance disappeared. He acknowledged his sin and flung to Jesus to save him. The bible says <strong>Acts 17:30-31,”30 Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">but now commands all men everywhere to repent</span>,31 because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are living in times where men have lost reverence to the Almighty God and have no understanding of His true nature, even people who call themselves Christians (not truly saved) blaspheme the name of the Lord. We do injustice to those who want to get saved by giving them <strong>Romans 10:9-13</strong> first without giving them <strong>Romans 10:1-8</strong> and <strong>Acts 17:30-31</strong> or doing a drive by through the verses they desperately need rather than the ones they crave.\r\n\r\nHere is what has happened over the years that if we are not careful of, we will continue to see great fall away as people \"<strong>Accept Jesus As Their Personal Savior</strong>\" and have little or no understanding of the righteousness of God. People will like the idea of being saved and not be saved. Read these words by William Booth the founder of Salvation Army and see if this is not true today, “<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">In Answer To Your Inquiry, I Consider That The Chief Dangers Which Confront The Coming Century Will Be Religion Without The Holy Ghost, Christianity Without Christ, Forgiveness Without Repentance, Salvation Without Regeneration, Politics Without God, And Heaven Without Hell</span>.” Where are you? Blessings, Ev</strong>"

              "<strong>John 1:51, \"Jesus then added \"I tell you the truth, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong style=\"line-height:1.5;\">How can angels descend and ascend \" ON THE SON OF MAN\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe can see how this happened to a person in a dream, running away due to fear of death, in a very tensed state, Jacob, tired fell asleep on the way and had a dream. Bible states in <strong>Genesis 28:12</strong> \"He had a dream in which he saw a stairway/ladder resting on the earth, with its top reaching heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. Let's meditate on this STAIRWAY /ladder...<!--more-->When a person has to climb or get onto a position higher than himself, he definitely needs something, a boost, in this case a ladder needed. A ladder comprises of steps, which have to be climbed one at a time, to reach the top of the ladder.\r\n\r\nOur Lord Jesus Himself is the ladder, (Heaven is his throne and earth is His footstool) who came down from heaven to this earth. As He rightly said \"<strong>I am the way , the truth, and the life\" </strong>, so only through Him can we reach our destination -heaven.. The seven sayings on the cross are like seven steps of the ladder to reach our heavenly abode...First step being forgiveness, without which our prayer of repentance and faith in God, will not reach God. Secondly after forgiving our trespassers, showing way to salvation and the process to enter the eternal kingdom. Thirdly to be considerate to our fellow beings, loving our neighbors as ourselves. Fourth step is to always have thirst for the lost souls /dying world. Fifth always remembering the pain when Jesus was forsaken by the Father because He became sin (treated as a sinner) for each one of us<strong>. </strong>Sixth step is finishing the task which we have been sent to earth for/ complete the mission. Lastly we need to learn to commit ourselves into His mighty and trustworthy Arms ...\r\n\r\nLast but not the least, the support which the ladder gives while a person is in the process of climbing is so very comforting. Since the ladder is properly fixed, we can trust it and hold firmly to it so that we will not fear falling, failing or drifting away. \"<strong>Let us hold firmly to the faith we profess</strong>\" Yes, once we make an attempt to start the journey in Jesus, climbing this ladder, Holy Spirit of God will help us reach our God, the Father.\r\n\r\nThough we are like Jacob running away from fearful circumstances/tough situations in life , we can still look to Jesus, who is our only HOPE -our way for eternal happiness\r\n\r\nIn Christ\r\nSis Sarah"

              "<strong>Philippians 4:19, \"But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus\"</strong>\r\n\r\nOur Heavenly Father takes pleasure in providing for His children. He is the God of too much, the bible says, \"<strong>A thousand cattle on the hills belongs to Him</strong>\", \"<strong>Riches and Glory are His</strong>\", The God of the impossibilities. He knows each of His children in and out and He knows all their needs. He knows how to give good things to His children. <strong>Matthew 7:11, \"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!\". </strong>He gives good things, not corrupt, broken, despised, or rejected. He gives the best to His own. He does it with joy, pleasure and gladness, and He gives with all of His heart. <strong>Psalm 23:1, \"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not lack (AMP)\". </strong>The work of a shepherd is to feed, guide, protect, inspect His sheep.  With Him being the Shepherd He guarantees His provision.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nNone of us qualifies for a blessing but each of us desire a blessing and the Father takes pleasure in blessing His children, David says in<strong> Psalm 37:25, \"I have been young, and now am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his descendants begging bread</strong>\". The more we walk with the Lord, the more we see how faithful He is even when we are faithless. The blessing is not reserved for those who are perfect; He desires to bless those who are His. You agree with me that there are many of the unsaved that God has blessed. More blessings does not mean more love and also does not mean He prefers more blessed people than less blessed. The bible says, <strong>\"He shows mercy to whoever He wants to show mercy, and grace to whoever He wants to show grace”. </strong>\r\n\r\nWe are all looking to God to supply our needs, some have financial needs, healing needs, guidance, strength, hope, you name it. When you know that no one else can come to your rescue but the one who created you, you will run to Him knowing that He is faithful. The Philippians had been a blessing to Paul. Paul's needs were met by God through the Philippians and he in turn encouraged them by saying <strong>\"my God shall supply all your need\",</strong> not some of their needs but all their needs. If you need it, God will supply you with it. <strong>What a blessing to know that His supply is greater than demand</strong>. That He has a lot of ways to bless you. He may choose to use a means you were not even expecting or a person you were not thinking about. Paul was not expecting the Philippians to bless him but God used them anyway.\r\n\r\nGod is not only concerned about your spiritual life, He is concerned about your physical needs too. He is concerned about your family (wife, husband, children, parents), He is concerned about your health <strong>Psalm 103:3, \"...who heals all your diseases</strong>\", he is concerned about your finances, in short, He is concerned about your wellbeing. All you have to do is ask. Hannah asked for a son, Hezekiah desired a prolonged life, Jabez asked for a blessing, Samson asked for strength, Paul asked for boldness to preach the gospel, <strong>they all asked according to His will and He supplied according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus</strong>. Remember today that God takes pleasure in providing for His children. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Genesis 15:9-12, \"And when the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away\"</strong>\r\n\r\nYou and I know those times when we have so much to do and we want to do it all well. However hard we try, sometimes we just fall short. You look at how time ran fast only to find you accomplished little. You are left exhausted gasping for strength and some headache. The best cure at this point is not medicine; the cure you need is rest.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Genesis 15:1</strong> the Lord appears to Abram in a vision and His words to him, \"<strong>Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward</strong>\". In one line He gave him one instruction and two promises. In other words, do not be afraid if you do not finish all you needed to do, don't feel bad that you failed to accomplish it, why? because I am your shield. Believe it or not, no one understands REST like God. He created the earth in 6 days and on the 7th day He rested. His word to Abram was to some how say, “<i>I am your shield, protecting you from all that make you exhausted, bring fatigue, those things that appear to be like headache because I have called you into rest</i>.\" God also tells him that He is Abram's exceedingly great reward, which I would interpret, this way, God gives you the ability to do something and then there are those times He takes over. He rewards those who diligently seek Him. We do the best we can with the help of God, we leave the rest to Him to handle as we go to rest.\r\n\r\nGod asked Abram to prepare a sacrifice, 3 year old heifer, ram, goat, then with turtle dove and young pigeon. After he cut and prepared the sacrifices, no fire yet, <strong>Genesis 15:11, says \"the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away\". </strong>For a whole day, he was fighting, chasing the vultures from devouring the sacrifice. You too will find that when you offer yourself to God for service, what happens? vultures of fear, frustrations, anxieties, confusion, and anger try to come in and for the whole day, all you do is trying to chase them away to protect what you are offering to God. <strong>Romans 12:1, \"Brethren I beseech you by the mercies of God that you present yourself a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable which is your reasonable service</strong>\". The moment you surrender yourself as a sacrifice, all hell breaks loose, however do not be afraid, you are in His will.\r\n\r\nWhen you have done all you can, the Lord takes over and gives you rest in the spirit, body, soul, and mind. <strong>Vs. 12, \"Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram</strong>\". You cannot sleep when you are troubled. Those who are troubled toss back and forth on their beds worrying, fighting vultures. Sleep through it, rest while He takes care of the rest. While Abram was deep asleep horror and great darkness fell upon him, the Lord already told him not to be afraid, He was in control of the vision, the present and the future. He then spoke to him in a dream of his future. Remember the Lord said to him from the beginning, \"<strong>I am your shield</strong>\". And while he was asleep, <strong>vs., “17 …when the sun went down and it was dark, that behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those pieces</strong>”. If he was a sleep, how come the vultures did not devour the sacrifice? the Lord protected the sacrifice. When you have done your best, close out everything, and commend the rest to God and go to sleep, relax, and gain your strength back. <strong>Philippians 4:6-7, “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; 7 and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” </strong> Therefore rest and let God handle your rest and the rest that you need to do.

              "<strong>Psalm 73:25&amp;26, \"Whom have I in heaven but You? And there is none upon the earth that I desire besides You. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">My flesh and my heart fail; But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever</span>\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are times when you know what you should do but you are not doing them. You have the skills, you have the ability but the strength to make it happen is what is lacking. We know of the phrase from the bible,<strong> Mark 14:38 \"...The Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak</strong>\". The Spirit desires to win but for the winning to really take place, the Spirit has to get the flesh on the same page otherwise both will war against each other.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHave you been feeling so tired of late dragging your feet to do anything? waking up is a struggle, praying is a struggle, so is reading the word? The Spirit is really willing but the flesh is just too weak to agree with the Spirit. There is war in the body and that war has to be defeated. I'm not even talking about sinning but having no strength to do what you and I should do to be even stronger. I need strength to move from point A to point B, I need to stay focused, I need to concur even more but I don't have that strength.\r\n\r\nThe bible tells us of who we have in heaven, our heavenly Father, there is no doubt about that. The second thing is that who do we desire besides Him? this is a way to set priorities straight for everything that we need revolves around our heavenly Father. He is the author of good things. <strong>Desire to seek His kingdom first channels other desires to be fulfilled for they are desires revolving around Him</strong>. The truth of the matter is, flesh will fail and so is the heart. I am yet to meet someone whose flesh and heart never fails. Flesh could fail in trials and temptations, heart could fail in the area of faith but the bible states it clearly,<strong> God is the strength of my heart</strong>. Why not, God is the strength of my flesh? God deals with the heart, if we allow Him get to the heart, the heart has a way of affecting the flesh to comply with the Spirit. Like mentioned, the Spirit (heart) is indeed willing, ready, expecting but what helps it fail is the flesh. <strong>Strength is the fuel that helps each of us accomplish what we need to accomplish</strong>. You can have visions, dreams, ambitions, abilities but God strengthens us to bring those things to a completion. It's just like you can make a body and it may look good and strong but without the breath of God, the body will do nothing. God's strength is our breath, pumping the heart to keep beating and give life to the entire being.<strong> Philippians 4:13, \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\", </strong>you can endure all things because the heart has been given strength<strong>. Isaiah 26:4, \"Trust in the Lord forever, For in Yah, the Lord is everlasting strength\", 2Corinthians 12:9, \"My grace is sufficient for you, my strength is made perfect in weakness\", Psalm 46:1, \"God is my refuge and strength...\"</strong>. God has deposited many wonderful things in our lives, we now need His strength to make them happen. Let me also say that <strong>God's strength is the heartbeat of our Christian living</strong>. Through His strength we can say no to sin, strength to worship Him, strength to reach out to others, strength to bring forth more spiritual babies. Take a closer look at your life and you will see that when strength is missing, doing God's will becomes impossible. <strong>The truth has been revealed but the strength to function in that truth is what we need</strong>.\r\n\r\nSeek strength from above, the breath of God to empower you to fulfill that calling, vision, dream, desire. <strong>The fact that the spirit is willing is a sign that we need God's strength. </strong>\r\n\r\nHave a blessed God's strengthened day, blessings Evans"

And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, also how he had executed all the prophets with the sword. 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, \"So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.\" 3 And when he saw that, he arose and ran for his life...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nElijah's encountering with the prophets of Baal is a very interesting story in the fact that he was so zealous for the Lord. He challenged the prophets of Baal as one man to prove to them all who the real God was. In other words, 1 man against 450 prophets of Baal. They were all prophets only that one was a true prophet of God and someone had to challenge the theology of the rest. <!--more-->What an awesome opportunity to stand for the Lord. You might be the only believer at home or at work yet you are not intimidated by the fact that the people surrounding you are not believers. You can stand strong and tall and challenge their stand through your lifestyle, your walk, your message. Elijah did, he prevailed and killed all the 450 prophets of Baal.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving a word of what happened to her prophets, Jezebel threatened to kill Elijah and he ran for his life. How is it that we can have boldness to fight but at times some type of Jezebel threatens us and we run for our lives? Fear is lethal, it cripples. King Ahab was not a threat to Elijah but his wife Jezebel the queen was. That boldness he once had to stand for the Lord was threatened and challenged. Listen to his cry to the Lord<strong> 1Kings 19:4, \"...And he prayed that he might die, and said, \"It is enough! Now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!” “</strong><em>It's over, I'm done, I'm finished, I can't see anything beyond this, I don't see any more victories lined up for me, take my life. I can't fight any more, it's just too much. I caved when the pressure was too much. I conquered many prophets of Baal by God's grace but that Jezebel threatened to take my means of livelihood and I couldn't help but find a place to hide</em>” I imagined all these running through his mind. Elijah did not see the reason for living anymore and he was right because after all, he would die by Jezebel’s sword and if the Lord killed him, he would die peacefully. Couldn’t this man who called fire from heaven stand on the thought of whose he was?\r\n\r\nGod knows what we need better than we do, God knew this man was under pressure. Dying was not what he needed; he needed encouragement, refreshment, rest, food and a time to refocus. <strong>The Lord responded to his need first before he dealt with his complaint.</strong> <strong>Vs. 5\"...suddenly an angel touched him, and said to him, \"Arise and eat.” </strong>He needed to be away from everything else to be one on one with God. He had a want yet God was only responding to his need. Twice the Lord fed him with bread and water which kept him strong for forty days. My first point for today, God knows your need better than you do. It was reported this week that a pastor killed himself just before he went to church where he was expected to preach that Sunday morning. Who knows what kind of pressure he was facing and like Elijah he saw no need to live anymore.\r\n\r\nAt times under pressure, all you need is to get away from everything, seat and let the Lord feed you with His bread and water because the journey is still long. Giving up is not an option, He has not given up on you, why should you give up on yourself and more so on Him? To continue Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Kings 19:1-3, \"1… And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, also how he had executed all the prophets with the sword. 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, \"So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.\" 3 And when he saw that, he arose and ran for his life...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are ever going to do anything for the Lord, be sure that the spirit of Jezebel will show up when you have done what you need to do. The spirit of Jezebel always brings fear, threats and is out to steal your faith and confidence in God. If Elijah called on God to answer by fire and He did, couldn't he have believed God for fire to defend him from Jezebel?<!--more--> The bible says that God went before the children of Israel by day as a cloud of wind and by night as <strong>a pillar of fire</strong>. Darkness is associated with evil therefore Elijah being threatened was the presence of evil and he needed God to go before him by night as a pillar of fire. Some of us need God to go before us today as a pillar of fire as we face our Jezebels.\r\n\r\nAfter running for his life into the wilderness, he prayed that his life would be taken away, as we saw how God feed him with what he needed. It's an encouragement to us that <strong>God cares for his servants in the moments of triumphant and in the moments of defeat.</strong> <strong>The Lord does not abandon us when we are defeated and we shouldn't abandon the Lord when we feel defeated</strong>. A true believer will run to the Lord when his life is under pressure and when they feel like giving up. They will also know that their confidence is not in themselves but God. Elijah ran into the wilderness looking for death only to find life, God reached out to him. This is the Lord I fall in love with daily. As Ravi Zacharias has said, “<em>God did not hide the scars of our hero’s in the bible</em>”. That even the men God used mightily had their moments of struggle with sin, fear, battles, challenges you name it and we can identify with them.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 8, \"So he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God\", </strong>Given food and drink kept him running 40 days and 40 nights, wow!!. We get hungry after every few hours. God knows what we NEED best and He supplies it. <strong>Philippians 4:19, \"My God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus\", 2Corinthians 12:9</strong>, <strong>\"My grace is sufficient for you, My strength is made perfect in weakness\" </strong>God gave Elijah what he needed for that period of time and it was enough to sustain him in the journey God had set for him. I believe the Lord was teaching him that what He had started, He would be faithful to complete it and because He wasn't done with Elijah, He would provide all the necessary tools he needed to keep him strong to fulfill His call in his life.\r\n\r\nYou realize that after being fed, never again do you hear him complain of his desire to die. Remember this, when it gets tough, He is offering to ease your burdens,<strong> Matthew 11:28, \"Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest</strong>\". It's not giving up that you need, it's the rest you need for the journey that is still long. If He was done with you, He would have killed you Himself but the fact that you are alive and kicking is an indication that your journey is not over. <strong>You may be missing in action yet you are being prepared for a comeback</strong>. God will give you rest, equip you, feed you, reveal Himself to you and will send you back to where you tried to run away from. The only difference is that you are going back as a changed, renewed person. Blessings Evans, God's servant"

              "<strong>Genesis 24:21, \"And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI have granted an awesome opportunity not only to minister to big groups all over the world but also one on one. I find that what someone else needs is exactly what I need. In the process of encouraging them, I am encouraged too. I get a deeper understanding of a scripture and often times God leads me to develop a word from it.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite subjects to speak on is Prayer. I find a good flow as I do it. It is my strength, it builds my faith. I am more stronger in praying than I am in the word. I find it much easier to pray than read my bible. Now we know that praying is not a one way but two ways. We pray and God in turn speaks to us through the word. Many times as I am praying, a passage is dropped in my spirit to which if I know it well, I pray it and read after as a confirmation of God’s word in response to my prayers. What happens when you have prayed for something over and over again and all you are waiting is to hear God speak to you maybe audibly (as some think) over what to do about your situation? I will share a concept from a passage that has been a blessing to me over the years.\r\n\r\n<strong>Genesis 24</strong> has really taught me so much about praying and waiting to hear what the Lord has to say. In this case, <strong>it's not about what the Lord said but what the Lord did</strong>. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>The message was not in what He spoke but what He did</strong></span>. The reason why the person in the picture knew it was God was because He had prayed SPECIFICALLY for something. Abraham's servant was given a task to find a wife for Isaac. He had been given guidelines as where he should find her from. He had no description of what to look for in a good wife however he applies wisdom of God's will for a good wife. He SPECIFICALLY prays to God about those qualities. \"<strong>The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable\", Proverbs 10:32</strong> tells us. Staying in the word will teach you more of what God's will is for mankind, thereafter when we know what the boundaries are, we pray within those boundaries (guidelines). <strong>The train finds complete freedom to flow within the boundaries it's given</strong> and so is a righteous man who knows the boundaries of what is accepted. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Praying within boundaries is not an indication that you will get all you've prayed but allowing the God of the boundaries to exercise His will for YOUR life in that which you have prayed for</strong></span>. God's word is \"THE WILL\" for ALL but when you pray the will, He sees out of the total WILL of what He desires for you at a given time and provides it. Here is where we many times we struggle, waiting patiently for the will to manifest in God's way and God’s time.\r\n\r\nThe servant prayed God's will, finished praying and started watching to see what the Lord would do. Here comes Rebekah, who does everything he had prayed to God for, <strong>Genesis 24:21, \"And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not</strong>\". Can you see he wasn't waiting for God to send thunder, angel to speak to him or God Himself to appear and say, \"<em>Servant, I have heard your prayer and now I have come to perform?\"</em>No, for this man, all the speaking he needed was to see what He had prayed being fulfilled. Watch this, when he saw all that he prayed coming true, he did not jump and conclude, he sat patiently to see if the Lord had prospered his way or not by waiting to see more of it unfold. The only reason he finally knew it was God's will was when he had peace within, he did not struggle or fight for it, no one else came for comparison, and there is no indication that he moved to another place. When I have prayed for something within the boundaries for a long time, I cease to pray so as to see what I have prayed. Ceasing to pray and watching does not mean I gave up, it means that <strong>I activated the will and now it's time to watch it's manifestation in silence</strong>. I believe the people who never pray specifically have a way of missing God's will, why? because you could be praying and praying and God is doing something but you can't see as you won't know. You could be waiting for God to speak to you in another way maybe audibly however you will miss what He is doing to indicate He is already speaking. See what you prayed, to continue...

              "<strong>Genesis 24:21, \"And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe thought that God is on the move blows my mind. When the bible talks about the Spirit of God, it says, \"The Spirit of God moved\". So expect the act of movement when you are dealing with prayers. The fact that my times are in His hands makes me be at peace for my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus. God knows what we need but He still requires us to move His hands by praying.<!--more--> <strong>Philippians 4:6, \"Be anxious for nothing, but by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make your request be known to God</strong>\". Stop worrying about what has not happened yet or what should have happened by now and go back to calling His name when you do not know what to do. The servant had been given a task, he did not know what to do but pray and move.\r\n\r\nPrayers are accompanied with thanksgiving. The scripture <strong>Philippians 4:6, says \"..,with thanksgiving</strong>\" makes it clear how thanksgiving is part of prayers. Thanksgiving is not only reserved when you have received it, it’s executed on the verge of waiting for it. This eliminates anxiety, frustrations and lack of patience. We write letters for job applications, at the end of the letters we tend to write, <strong>\"<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">thanking you in advance</span></strong>\", Pause for a sec, you don't have the job yet and might not have it but there is a “thank you” word. You have faith based on your qualifications that you can get that job but you leave it in the hands of the hiring manager to make that decision. It's the same way with prayer, you submit your request and conclude it with a thanksgiving. This means you have faith not in yourself but in God who is able to do it. <strong>Genesis 24:26, \"Then the man bowed down his head and worshipped the Lord, 27, And he said, \"Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His mercy and His truth toward my master. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">As for me, being on the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren</span>.</strong> Though he had just seen the signs, he went and worshipped the Lord. Yes Rebekah had all the qualities he had prayed for, he gives her gifts but does not tell her why he is there and does not even know whether she and her family will accept the proposal but he worships God any way. He understands that God has led him this far and He will lead him that far. Those who are in God's will are led of Him from the start to the finish. <strong>Psalms 37:23, \"The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in His way</strong>\". This is for those who are walking within the boundaries of God's will. Being led means going somewhere and not just sitting and stagnant. Effective prayers call for a move. Moving from the familiar to the unfamiliar, from what you are used to, to what you are not used to. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Greater things happens in the unfamiliar grounds</span>.</strong> Therefore you pray, move as you are led and you see what you prayed.\r\n\r\nYou may have prayed for something for a long time, you were specific, it was within the boundaries of His will. See what you prayed and know if the Lord made your JOURNEY (MOVE) prosperous or not. Be open to whichever way the Lord might speak to you cause it might not always happen the way you expect it. Give Him praise and thanksgiving while you are on the verge of waiting and know that your steps are ordered of Him. Find what His will is and stay in it if you ever want to succeed. You might have stepped out of it and went your way because you waited for too long. It's never too late to get back on the track to be led by Him. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>God only delights in our ways when He orders our steps</strong></span> when He goes before us, that is what prayers are about, we call on God and He leads. Don't be surprised when you see what you prayed being unfolded before your eyes because it was within God's will. We are yet to hear testimony after testimony of what the Lord is doing. One last thing, I believe in praying with eyes opened, meaning praying and watching to see when the Lord is passing by. SEE WHAT YOU PRAYED, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 13:24-30, \"...The Kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seeds in his field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe bible likens the Kingdom of God to a sower who sowed good seeds in his field. The gospel is the good seed that was sowed in us and the result was repentance and faith. The gospel (good news, good seed) was sowed in well prepared fields. Everything was okay as he natured his seed, dug around it, watered it and watched over it. This is how a Christian life ought to be, a life of hard work.<strong> Acts 14:22 “…strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, “We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.”</strong> Following Christ is hard work.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn the process of time, the sower fell asleep and stopped watching over his sowed seeds. If we were to look at it in this day and age, he stopped praying, stopped reading the word, stopped going to church and mixing up with believers. He took off the whole armor of God, threw down his sword, and stopped fighting sin. This is what happens when the heart is left unguarded, <strong>Proverb 4:23 says, \"Keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life\". </strong>We are told to keep our hearts with all diligence meaning guard our heart at all times for it is where the issues of life flow. We are told to protect the seed at all cost, fight for the seed, so as not to allow the enemy to plant weeds in our lives. In Jesus parable, the enemy came in and planted doubt, fear, hatred, confusion, lack of patience and many things.. While Jesus was in the garden praying with His disciples shortly before He was arrested, He comes and finds them asleep instead of watching and praying, <strong>Luke 22:45-46, “45 When He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow. 46 Then He said to them, “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Philippians 2:12,”Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;” </strong>It concerns us above all things to secure the welfare of our souls: whatever becomes of other things, let us take care of our best interests. We must not only work at our salvation, by doing something now and then about it; but we must work out our salvation, by doing all that is to be done, and persevering therein to the end. Though we must use our utmost endeavors in working out our salvation, yet still we must go forth, and go on, in a dependence upon the grace of God. His grace works in us in a way suitable to our natures, and in concurrence with our endeavors; and the operations of God's grace in us are so far from excusing, that they are intended to quicken and engage our endeavors. <strong>All our out working depends upon His working in us. </strong>\r\n\r\nHave you been guarding the seed like you should or are you sleeping on the job? You sleep and the enemy would be running the show. The sleep does not just happen, it starts with something small like sitting down, before you know it, you are way gone. It's very hard to tell when you went to sleep but the good thing is that we can wake up from the sleep. <strong>Hebrews 12:1, \"The night is far spent and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast aside the works of darkness and let us put on the armor or light</strong>\". You and I have a job to do, watch and pray. No more sleeping on the job. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Mark 14:36, \"Abba! Father! All things are possible for Thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nShortly before Jesus was betrayed and arrested, He was very distressed and troubled to the point of death. He took His three disciples and led them to a lonely place where He could reveal to them the sad condition of His heart and also pray. He said to them: <strong>\"My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death; remain here and keep watch</strong>\" And went a little further to pray and He prayed the prayer quoted above. <!--more-->The Bible says that He prayed the same prayer twice. He had expected His disciples too to pray and watch with Him, but they didn’t. They were overcome with sleep. But He prayed and His expressed His desire, which was \"<strong>to let this cup (the suffering and the crucifixion he faced) pass away\"</strong>. In his human nature, He felt the pain like we do. He experienced conflict of choice like we often do. He naturally feared like you and I sometimes do. The enemy was heavily present to persuade all His senses to reject the suffering and evade the cross, which would have been a good thing for Him, but would have been disobedience to God, His Heavenly Father. Jesus was at cross roads. Faced with the challenge and difficulty of choosing between what pleased Him and what pleased His Heavenly Father, He chose to surrender His will to God’s will. Now that was not easy, but it was necessary and was the right thing to do. He simply obeyed his Father’s wish to die for the world’s salvation. He remembered that \"<strong>Obedience is better than sacrifice</strong>\" according to <strong>1Samuel 15:22</strong>. And, in that moment, He gave up His will. Nothing mattered to Him anymore than what mattered to His Father. He trusted in His wisdom, guidance and power to do anything He willed. And God willed that He dies. And He did! A loss for Christ? No! That surrender brought such great joy to the Father and unprecedented recovery of all Jesus had lost when He came down to die for sinful mankind. The surrendering of His will to the Father’s and His humility and costly obedience, earned Him a Name above all names and elevated Him to position of honor in heaven and on earth. His reward:\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Therefore also God has highly exalted Him, and has bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of JESUS, every knee shall bow, of those who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and that every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.\" Philippians 2: 9-11 </strong>\r\n\r\nToday, you might be at cross roads like Jesus. Your will to do your thing or escape pain may be stronger than you are willing to surrender or let go. Your thoughts, ways, plans, purposes, dreams and intentions may appear right, righteous and acceptable in your sight and in the sight of many, but the end thereof may be death and loss of opportunity of doing God’s will for God’s rewards. God’s will is God’s wish for your life. If you want to see God at work in your life, join Jesus in praying \"<strong>Thy will be done</strong>\". <strong>That total surrender to God’s Will is what moves God</strong>. It is what secures your future and mine. It is the guaranteed insurance and assurance that you are covered against any losses or future eventuality or disappointments. It is what will earn you peace and prosperity. Surrender your will today; let go and let God! God bless you, In His service, Br. Boaz Olang"

              "<strong>Genesis 32:28, \"And He said, \"Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nIt's very easy to be crippled by your own opinions of yourself. Some people tend to add salt to this wound you have created. Instead allowing yourself to be healed, you inflict more pain to yourself. You just can't see yourself living any way better than the way you already know about yourself. Everything God wants to do in your life is assassinated by what you think of yourself. You keep bringing back to memory what God already forgave you for. <!--more-->When you have been in a condition way too long, there is a tendency to throw in the towel and conclude that perhaps you were meant to be in this situation forever. And your conclusion, healing and deliverance was not part of God's plan for your life. If you are dealing with \"this conclusion\", you may need to ask yourself, what were you saved from and for? If you don't understand this well, I guarantee you a defeated life.\r\n\r\nI have often said that if we've been saved by grace through faith, we ought to identify with our new birth. The new man ought to assassinate the old man. The new man needs to understand that the God of heaven had a plan for his life from day one. Jacob operated on what they named him, manipulating his way in life. If anything, he did not see himself being anything different than what he already knew about himself. When God is getting ready to use you, be sure of His dealing with the old man. In the case of Jacob, God asks him his name and what does he tell God, \"Jacob\", which means surplanter, deceiver, and conman if I may add. Here comes God ready to use him but He starts dealing with the old man \"Jacob\" molding him to a new man \"Israel\". He struggled with God and men and the bible said he prevailed. If the negative energy was turned into positive energy, how cool will that be? Paul's strength, teachings, and eloquent speech were turned around by God to be used for His glory after pulling Paul from using these wonderful gifts for evil. Of course we can tell that Jacob was not a deserter, he was a hard worker knew what he desired and went for it. God was about to use these strengths for His glory. At the beginning he was living a lie because of what they called him but when God appeared to him, God showed him who he really was and He called him to be a \"Prince\". He identified him with his new birth.\r\n\r\n<strong>Just to be clear, I am not talking about positive thinking, I am talking about heavenly living</strong>. I am talking about knowing that regardless of your past life and even present situations, you are His. The blessings He brings in your life are not a result of what you can do but what He can do. I quote this scripture with confidence, <strong>2Timothy 1:12\"...for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day</strong>\". I believe this report over someone's report and mine; I know whom I have believed, I know He will keep it all till that day. I keep killing what he is doing because I speak negative things in my life but let the truth be known.<strong> If I continue to believe a lie, eventually I will live a lie</strong>. The devil might accuse me of something I did, and sure he may be right but I am not trusting in myself to be what I should be, I am trusting in God who knows what He can do in my life. Why are you living in the “yesterday” when God is telling you to live in the “today?” Your prayer is about what could have happened instead of what can be. Rise up today and live like a prince (princess) because you are no longer living a lie. Take this dose of truth and live fully for God, <strong>Philippians 4:8, \"Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy --meditate on these things</strong>\". Stop living a lie and choose to live fully. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Philippians 4:11, \"..., for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI always find it exciting when I discover something new. Electronics always fascinate me. When I discover more of what they can do than what I anticipated brings a smile on my face. Of course there are times I have had something for so long, limited it's use because I did not know it could do more and I wondered why I did not discover this a head of time, I could have made use of it long time ago. We as Christians also know what we can do, how about those times we are unable to discover what we are made of because we have not learnt to unlock them?<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>You and I cannot know what we are made of until we try things for ourselves or are tried in some areas</strong>. The reason why I have discovered more of what some gadgets could do was by trying. Yes there are times they broke but not always. We have people in our congregations that do not know what they are made of and for that reason, <strong>they have never learnt the art of trying things out to know what has been deposited in them or they have overlooked what they have and dismissed it as something of no use</strong>. David had no problem trying things out and learning what he was made of. He ran after a bear and killed it and so was a lion. Facing Goliath was nothing to him, he knew whose he belonged to therefore he added faith to what he was about to do and stepped out to do it. That was his key to victory with the testimony more reflecting on God who enabled him than himself. This is the reason why I believe when he was being anointed the next king, there is no hint of him saying he did not feel able, again not resting on his own ability<strong>. I believe it's hard to unlock the hidden treasures without stepping out and trying them</strong>.\r\n\r\nPaul writing to the Philippians in <strong>chapter 4</strong> talks about their generosity towards him. The Philippian church was one of the churches that supported Paul's ministry and right from the beginning, Paul had tried and had been tried in areas where he learnt what he was made of. He had survived ship wrecks, had been stoned and left for dead, worked (made tents) and did ministry at the same time, he made long trip journeys, I believe at times he went without and this is what he unlocked in all that he dealt with, “<strong>contentment”</strong>. Something he could not unlock unless he stepped out. He says, \"<strong>I have learnt</strong>\" not by sitting in class, or observing but by doing. He says, \"<strong>12 I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 13 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me</strong>\". He had a tank of survival opened up when he was facing good times and tough times. Had he not tried and faced these things, for sure he would have not learnt them. I know that God gives calling to His people and I also believe God reveals what you are made of as you step out. Stepping out allows you to unlock hidden mysteries He deposited in you. I am a witness to this, I never knew what I was made of until I began to exercise faith and step out and do it. This ministry was birthed in stepping out. I never knew God could use me with all my limitations but when I stepped out, I unlocked a tank of writing and putting messages together He had reserved for the right time. In stepping out by faith, I applied pressure to a container of treasures stored and pushed out what was stored in there.\r\n\r\nShake a bottle of soda then try and open it and see pressure at work. Some of us need some shaking to produce pressure that will push out what is locked in us. In this ministry there are hidden treasure of preaching, teaching, parenting, leadership, encouragements etc. locked in some of you that are yet to be unlocked, what are you doing to unlock what God has deposited in you? Do you know what you are made of? Christ in you, the hope of glory. Don't wait till you know (might take a while or not show up), step out and try that you may know, You will be amazed to learn something new about what you are made off, God given abilities contentment being one of them<strong>.

              "<strong>1Timothy 3:14-16, “14 These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly; 15 but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">the pillar and ground of the truth</span>”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6216\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/image.jpg?w=205\" alt=\"image\" width=\"205\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nAs I think of qualifications of a minister and the model by which the church is to run, I count on Paul’s epistle to Timothy because of its depth and clear instructions. This epistle appears to have been written to Timothy while he was at Ephesus facing numerous challenges as a young pastor. Paul wrote to instruct him in the choice of proper offices in the church by keeping to mind the right qualifications he outlined, as well as in the exercise of a regular ministry.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->It was important who he appointed to service. While he directed him on how to establish the church and its leaders, he also took time to caution him against the influence of false teachers, who by subtle distinctions and endless disputes, corrupted the purity and simplicity of the gospel by adding or subtracting to and from the vital parts of the gospel. <strong>He pressed upon him to be constant in regard to the greatest diligence, faithfulness, and zeal in handling God’s word</strong>.\r\n\r\nIn this writing, he had hoped to be there in person to instruct, however, Paul was also confident that in writing, the inspired word of God had the capability of guiding Timothy. He therefore says, <strong>“…I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth”. </strong>How to conduct himself was crucial because the stand and the survival of the church depended on it with Christ as the foundation and the chief cornerstone of the church.\r\n\r\nPaul identified the pillars as the disciples, the apostles, the representatives of Christ who by their teaching, this foundation and introduction was based upon. <strong>Galatians 2:8-9, “8 (for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles), 9 and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised</strong>”. The apostles in Christ were the pillars of the church. Paul in <strong>Ephesians 2:20</strong> says the household of God<strong> “20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone</strong>”. The prophets mentioned here I am convinced are the ministers of the gospel who proclaim the truth of God’s word to His faithful without compromise. And these are all built on the ground, the foundation of none other than Jesus Christ. Paul writes, <strong>1Corinthians 3:10-11, “10 According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it. 11 For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ”</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is what should drive us in to be under certain pastors, teachers, the church etc. The truth of Christ’s Gospel fueled by the Holy Spirit should be the ground and the pillar for God's work for there lies in Christ’s sufficient power through His word to save and deliver anyone. “<em>When the church ceases to be the pillar and ground of truth, we may and ought to forsake her; for our regard to truth should be greater than our regard to the church; we are no longer obliged to continue in the church than she continues to be the pillar and ground of truth”, </em>Matthew Henry.\r\n\r\nSamson standing before the Philistine in their temple (<strong>Judges 16</strong>) shackled and blind asked God for strength one more time to destroy his enemies or rather God’s enemies. He asked to be led to the pillars that supported the temple. He pushed the pillars destroying himself with those ungodly people in that temple. Any minister, pastor, teacher who destroys the pillars and the ground for the truth like in Samson's example would have destroyed instead the house of God and himself if they deviate from who Christ is to the church. Paul’s advice to Timothy, “<strong>16 Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you”, 1Timothy 4:16.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhy was this advice important? because sound doctrine matters<strong>. </strong>As Martin Luther beautifully articulates the importance of doctrine says, “<em>The great difference between doctrine and life is obvious, even as is the difference between heaven and earth. Life may be unclean, sinful, and inconsistent; but doctrine must be pure, holy, sound, and unchanging. Life may show omissions and come short of what doctrine calls for. But from doctrine (says Christ, Matt. 5:18 ) not a tittle or letter may be omitted, however much life may fail to meet the requirements of doctrine. This is so because doctrine is God’s Word and God’s truth alone, whereas life is partly our own doing. On this account doctrine must remain entirely pure. God will have patience with man’s moral failings and imperfections and forgive them. But He cannot, will not, and shall not tolerate a man’s altering or abolishing doctrine itself. For doctrine involves His exalted, divine Majesty itself. In the sphere of doctrine, therefore, forgiveness and patience are out of order.</em>”\r\n\r\nSound doctrine, the doctrine of Christ must be the pillar and ground for the truth if any believer, the church is to stand<strong>. </strong>Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 19:23-26, \"23 Then Jesus said to His disciples, “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Assuredly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24 And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God</span>.” 25 When His disciples heard it, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” 26<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> But Jesus looked at them and said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/images.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5966\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/images.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"221\" height=\"228\" /></a></span></strong>In business there are things looked into for the health and the growth of the business. They look at <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">ASSETS</span></strong> and <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">LIABILITIES</span></strong> columns as part of their analysis for the health and growth of business. Assets are properties or things or people of great value. In accounting, they are items on balance sheet that constitute the total value of an organization. Liability has a different description, for the sake of the point I would like to make, I will describe it as something that holds somebody back (organization, business) or causes trouble.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHere is a classic example of a RICH young ruler coming to Jesus with what he considered assets to gain or secure him everlasting life. He comes ready that upon being told what it took to have eternal life, he would pull it out of his bag of good things and present it to the Master. <strong>Vs. 21 “Jesus said to him, “If you want to be <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">PERFECT</span>, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.” </strong>He admitted to have kept some of the commandments and Jesus perceiving that he was determined to have all these in his assets column told him that if he wanted his asset column to be PERFECT, he had to get rid of all that he had (wealth). In actuality, Jesus was showing him where his heart was, it was in his money and you cannot serve God and money.\r\n\r\nThen Jesus said how hard it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. Of course, we know of rich men who are saved and are being saved because He does it with Zacchaeus in <strong>Luke 19</strong> right after the same story of the rich young ruler in <strong>Luke 18</strong>. I believe the deeper understanding of this would be someone having what he calls good (declaring himself rich with good works) because he believes he has what it takes to gain eternal life. This is someone who has taken his attempts to be good enough before God and placed it in his asset column. Such would be hard to save; they are trusting in their own merit to gain eternal life. Paul tells us in <strong>Romans 7:9-13, “9 I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">10 And the commandment, which was to bring life, I found to bring death.</span> 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me. … 13 Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">what is good</span>, …\" </strong>Everything that Paul once considered an asset, something to save him he found that it brought him death, in other words they became a liability to him. What was to give him value (trying to keep the law), made it more impossible to gain eternal life. When he thought he was rich with good works it only turned to condemn him. That’s what condemns people today who consider themselves rich in good works and would not declare themselves bankrupt and trust in Christ riches of righteousness to save them.\r\n\r\n<strong>Proverbs 11:4, “Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness delivers from death”. </strong>Men’s assets won’t save them in that day, only Christ who is rich in mercy provides the righteousness he desperately needs to stand before God. Under conviction, Paul filed chapter 11, <strong>Philippians 3:7-9, “7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith</span>\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAre you trusting in your riches (good works) to have eternal life? If you are, Jesus has a message for you, <strong>Matthew 19:24, “And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</strong>” When you realize that everything you counted on to save you is a liability, tainted with sin, be done with yourself, file chapter 11, declare bankrupt, put all your today’s assets (good works) in the liability column, repent of them and receive Christ who is rich in mercy to grant you the righteousness you desperately need. His righteousness is the asset you need in your column. When the disciples wondered who could be saved then, Jesus said <strong>“<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.</span>”. </strong>Your salvation and mine is impossible without Him. Repent of your sins today, and trust and embrace Christ who died on the cross and rose again to save you and He will. Read the word and obey what it says and God will never fail you. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Kings 4:38-41, vs. 40, \"Then they served it to the men to eat. Now it happened, as they were eating the stew, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that they cried out and said, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!”</span> And they could not eat it\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/image2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6221\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/image2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThere was famine in the land of Gilgal. It wasn't famine for truth or love, it was starvation for food. Now Elisha the man of God was with the sons of the prophets who I believe looked up to him as a great prophet and a leader. They knew him as a miracle worker too and even in the midst of this great famine, they believed God could provide a way through his servant Elisha.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nElisha therefore tells his servant to put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophet vs. 39, “<strong>So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, though they did not know what they were\". </strong>They were starving for food, in the process of setting the pot for stew, they still needed to find something to cook in that pot. Without knowing what to do, they bumped into some herbs and wild vine and cooked them anyway. Like these men, have you found yourself in the midst of something you knew you had to do, you wanted to do right and tried different things hoping they would work? I have. The bible says that after they cooked and served. It happened that as they were eating the stew, they cried to the man of God saying, <strong>\"there is death in the pot\". </strong>How is it that what was supposed to be good and life sustaining became life threatening? How is it that in the midst of trying to live by the Ten Commandments to which many try to do find that it only brings death? We want to live by the golden rule, do good that we may live but the more we eat from the pot of the commandments we find that there is death in it.\r\n\r\nPaul desired the stew of the law but as he began to eat from the pot of the law, he ran into a king size problem and he tells us in <strong>Romans 7:10, \"And the commandment, which was to bring life, I found to bring death,… 7:13, \"Has then what is good (commandments) become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful\"</strong>. Maybe Elisha would have not been affected by the stew which is a representation of Jesus who could eat from the pot of death and not die. It was to be a pot to restore life however it brought death. I also tried to live by the stew in the pot (commandments), only to discover it brought me death because of my sinful nature serving as a reminder that I do not have a system that can defeat this death in the pot.\r\n\r\n<strong>2Kings 4:41, “So he said, “Then bring some flour.” And he put it into the pot, and said, “Serve it to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot\", </strong>Is this not like what Jesus did for us, while there was death in the pot, he bled and died, rose and again and defeated death?, when we now repent and put our trust in Him alone for our eternal salvation, we too have defeated death and we can eat from the pot and live because of what He has done. Elisha did not get rid of the stew and God also did not get rid of the law. Elisha had flour put into the pot and served the people and so did God send His son in this pot we call earth and defeated its power over us.\r\n\r\nTherefore if you are not saved and are trying to live by the stew of commandments in this pot of life, rest be assured, there is death in the pot and only Jesus Christ has the cure for that stew. Repent of your sins, put your trust in Jesus Christ alone for your eternal salvation and you will pass from death to life, no more will there be death in the pot. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Luke 17: 16 , “He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan”. </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>We are quick to complain and ask God for things, but slow to thank Him for the blessings already in possession and slow or non – existent to give thanks when He does answer prayer, provide, or protect.</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nHow quickly we forget to give thanks. “Give credit where credit is due” How much credit does God deserve? Do you treat God like a cosmic Santa Clause or a Heavenly Father? I’ve heard it said that the <strong><em>Key to contentment is Thanksgiving. </em></strong>For the Christian, every day should be Thanksgiving Day. We should even be thankful in the midst of problems. The Apostle Paul said in <b>2Corinthians 7:4, “I have great confidence in you; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds</b>., \" He knew that God was working all things together for his good, even though he was going through trials (<strong>Romans 8:28</strong>). And we know that in <strong>all</strong> things God <strong>works </strong>for the <strong>good </strong>of those who <strong>love </strong>Him, who have been <strong>called </strong>according to His <strong>purpose</strong>\r\n\r\nJesus encounters 10 lepers that ask Him to have mercy on them. Jesus conforms to Jewish norms by requiring that the lepers go for the required priestly declaration of health (cf. <strong>Leviticus 14).</strong> Jesus teaches about the expressions of a thankful person. To give thanks is to show gratitude, give admonition, and let gratefulness flow out of your heart in words and in deeds and to express that joy Godward! Here are some expressions to learn from a thankful leper.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>#1 Thanksgiving BEGINS with Recognition (V.13). </strong>All the lepers acknowledged Jesus as MASTER. As you spend time with Jesus what are some names or titles you use to refer to Him as you recognize His rule over your life? Lepers were social outcasts that had body parts rotting away that would eventually fall off. Perhaps there are areas in your life that seem to be “falling off” that you can’t seem to keep together. There is no one that has it all together. Maybe everything is not falling apart in your life, but there are areas that each of us feel handicapped in. We need to recognize God’s power and mercy (“HAVE MERCY ON US).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li><strong># 2 Thanksgiving CONTINUES with Obedience (V.14). </strong>Upon asking for help from Jesus, He sent them to the priest and they obeyed Him. As they were going (obeying) they were cleansed. God does things in our lives as we are obeying Him. He trusts us with a little and sees how obedient we are with what He has given us, before He will ever entrust us with more. Jesus has commanded us to “GO” seek and save the lost. Can this command given be seen as obedience in your life? Jesus said “<strong>if you love me, you will obey me” (John 14:21</strong>)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n\t<li><strong>#3 Thanksgiving is FULFILLED in Praise </strong>(V.15-16) Only 1 out of 10 returned to give thanks, and Jesus recognizes that. The leper gave active thanks. He didn’t send a postcard, or e-mail, no way, he thanked Jesus personally! His thanks came from his loud voice (he was not ashamed) <strong>Romans 1:16.</strong> He Glorified God (not the priest). In Humility he fell at the feet of Jesus. The world is unthankful “<strong>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened</strong>”</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n\t<li><strong>#4 Thanksgiving RESULTS in Spiritual Healing. </strong>The Samaritan realized he was healed and “Made whole” which was not the same proclamation for the others. Jesus verbally recognized the man’s faith in the healing process, which could also be read, “<strong>Your faith has saved you”</strong> More than physical healing, but spiritual healing. This man got something the other nine didn’t receive because he gave thanks. God may withhold future blessings from you when you don’t give Him thanks, and recognition for what He has already done in your life.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings &amp; Thanks, Pastor Phil&lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

One popular example, in the last few years there has been a drive for unity for a common cause in many areas with Evangelical and Catholics Together (ECT).\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nBased on some resources I came across, a statement was written as a testimony that spells out the need for Protestants and Catholics to deliver a common witness to the modern world at the eve of the third millennium. While this was embraced by many on both sides, there were a number of evangelicals who were reluctant to sign the agreement due to some theological distinctions between Catholics and Protestants. The resources further states, these evangelicals emphasized that sola fide (the doctrine of justification by faith alone) is a fundamental distinctive of evangelical theology, which fundamentally divides evangelicals and Catholics theologically. This is a great area where unity and fellowship could not be extended because the pillar and ground of truth in salvation by faith alone vs. salvation by faith and works needed to be settled. While they agreed on things such as fighting against abortion, poverty, injustice etc., the ground for unity and fellowship was still an issue they could not agree to call each other brethren.\r\n\r\nWriting to the Galatians, Paul spent time defending the gospel he never received from the apostles James, Peter and John considered the pillars of the church. His preaching was under attack, false brethren had crept in and were perverting the gospel. Some thought he was one of those who crept in to do the same. For this against his will, he had to defend his apostleship and the gospel he preached. To show that he was called and the message was the same, he qualifies his defense by saying, “, <strong>vs. “8 (for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles)”. </strong>Two men would reach different people groups of different backgrounds, different traditions and the like with the same message. The main ground and pillar of truth was the gospel entrusted to them<strong>. </strong>This gospel they never received from each other had to perfectly align with the gospel Christ had entrusted them with for that was going to be the ground for unity and fellowship.\r\n\r\nNot only did God work through both men separately for the same cause, it was further attested with the pillars extending to them fellowship as brethren <strong>, vs. “9 and when James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.” ESV.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe ground for unity and fellowship is important because, “<em>The Christian faith, more than any other, is based on doctrine. The doctrines of the deity of Christ (John 1:1, 14), the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:21), the resurrection of Christ (1 Corinthians 15:17), and salvation by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9) are absolutely essential and non-negotiable. If any of these doctrines is removed, the faith is empty and void. There are other doctrines in the Christian faith that are very important, such as the Trinity, the inspiration of Scripture, and the reality of the eternal state.”, </em>S. Michael Houdmann.\r\n\r\nAs long as Peter and his people the Jews continued to practice circumcision for instant without adding it as a prerequisite to salvation, he and Paul (Jews and Gentiles) would continue in fellowship without any issues. On this same ground I have linked arms with those in the body of Christ starting from my church, friends who may be across holding on other non-essential doctrines and traditions I may not but are in agreement on the fundamental Christian doctrines. Despite our differences in traditions, backgrounds, we have extended each other the right hand of fellowship as brethren in the body of Christ with the same call. What ground of unity are we aspiring to have? A number battle over the style of music, baptism, Lord’s table, set up etc. causing disunity. Should these be reasons to break fellowship? What is causing you to break fellowship with a brother, a church etc.? blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Luke 17, vs. ,\"5 - And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe subject on faith is very important, but what kind of faith? We need faith for sure, however we need faith that works. In this message we will look at the faith we truly need. The opening verse in chapter <strong>17:1 reads, \"Then He said to the disciples, “It is impossible that no offenses should come, but woe to him through whom they do come! \"</strong>. I highlight the word \"IMPOSSIBLE\" because it sets in motion what kind of faith we need.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHere Jesus says it is impossible for offenses not to come, therefore it cannot be ignored. The response to it is what is important. People will offend and be offended. If offended, the action is to forgive and not once but always. This was hard a message for the disciples about offenses and the action in light of how easy it is to offend and be offended. With this hard to live up to message <strong>vs. \"5 - And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”</strong> It almost sounds like they were trying to change the subject by asking the Master for something else. On the contrary, what the Master had said was impossible to accomplish without faith or greater faith as they thought. They did not ask to be given faith, they had that, but rather asked for their faith to be increased because this was one area among many they felt deficient in their walk.\r\n\r\nIn response to their request, <strong>vs. \"6 So the Lord said, “If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea,’\" </strong>This meant, if they had the smallest amount or measure of true faith (seed) no instance of duty would be too hard for them to accomplish. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">This was also to say, they did not need more faith to believe, they needed to be assured they had enough faith to live</span>,</strong> \"<strong>the just shall live by faith\", Romans 1:17</strong>. This is working faith or faith that works. To make this faith clear, He gave them an example of a servant/slave who is humble, obedient in serving his master fulfilling his duties not to gain rewards but rather to demonstrate that faith is about faithfulness with the emphasis on faithfulness to the master and not the master's faithfulness to his servants. The faith that is often thrown around is that the Master serves the servant.\r\n\r\n\"<em>Faith in God's pardoning mercy, will enable us to get over the greatest difficulties in the way of forgiving our brethren. As with God nothing is impossible, so all things are possible to him that can believe. Our Lord showed his disciples their need of deep humility. The Lord has such a property in every creature, as no man can have in another; he cannot be in debt to them for their services, nor do they deserve any return from him\", </em> Matthew Henry\r\n\r\nMost of our faith definition is having a greater belief, meaning more of it, increased so that the Lord can serve and meet our needs. True faith here turns the table to reveal the faith needed to be the kind of faith that serves the master as a duty rather than the master serving men. After he has served the master and the master's needs are met then, in vs. 8 the servant sits and enjoys what he prepared provided by his master. <strong>Increase our faith should mean empower us to be faithful and as we become more faithful, the more we can overcome what is impossible in our living</strong>.

              "<strong>Mark 6:40–43, “So they sat down in ranks, in hundreds and in fifties. And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to His disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among them all. So they all ate and were filled. And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fish.” </strong>\r\n\r\nSowing and reaping is a farming principal that certainly melds over into a variety of life situations outside farming. The farming practice is that if you sow your seed at the right time, in due season (harvest time) you will reap plentiful crops. The Scriptures show us that times when this principle certainly has been misrepresented in life practice. <!--more-->Recall in <strong>Matthew 25</strong> the man that buried his talent and upon his return the master found that the servant had not sown it so that it would grow, and therefore no profit was reaped. He was called a wicked lazy servant and cast out, never to be entrusted with the master’s goods. The prodigal son sowed his wild oats and, at some point I imagine, prayed for “crop failure.”\r\n\r\nThe disciples wanted to send the people away to the country and the villages to go buy themselves bread, for they had nothing to eat. Jesus turned to His disciples and said you feed them. The disciples were most likely discouraged as they thought of the impossible amount of money it would take to feed a crowd like this one. The Expositors Bible Commentary tells us “<em>Two hundred denarii represented the pay a common laborer earned in a period of about eight months (cf. Matt 20:2-15, where the usual pay for a day's wage is one denarius). Not even that amount of money would buy enough bread for all to eat (cf. John 6:7: \"for each one to have a bite\")</em>. Knowing this, makes their feelings make a lot of sense. Then he asked them how much food they had with them, and they replied five loaves of bread and two fish. Perhaps again they were thinking, “<em>Jesus if you take the little bit of food we have and give it to these people you will have done two stupid things, one there is not enough to feed these people, and two we won’t have any food to eat then</em>”. However, Jesus had his men instruct the crowd to sit down in ranks of hundreds and by fifties. Jesus was beginning to show his men how he would use their lives, help, and resources to be a blessing to others. Jesus took the food they had, blessed it, broke it, and gave them to his disciples.\r\n\r\nThe result was twofold. First, “they did all eat AND WERE FILLED… and they that did eat…were about five thousand men [not counting women and children].” Second, “and they [the disciples] took up TWELVE baskets full of fragments, and of fishes.”\r\n\r\nWhen we sow our resources into the Kingdom of God, hence give the Lord what is really rightfully, His everything we are caretakers of, He can bless it, break it and feed multitudes with it. He can do miracles with what you sow into the Kingdom. The disciples, although not knowing the outcome, and perhaps being nervous about their own hunger being in jeopardy, obeyed Christ and were blessed. Their sowing of food, resulted in everyone being feed to their hearts content, and there were TWELVE baskets left over. Were there not twelve disciples? You see when you sow into His Kingdom with the little you have, He will provide for your needs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: God is asking for you to invest (sow) your time, talents, and treasures into His kingdom. What will you give to Him to bless, break, and “feed” others with of yours first? Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>John 4:28-29, “28 Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people29 \"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ ?\".” </strong>\r\n\r\nIn this story Jesus had an interaction with the woman at the well. This woman had a sexually sinful lifestyle. <strong>First: Jesus began in the natural realm (v. 7). </strong>This woman was unregenerate, and the Bible tells us “<strong>the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God” (1Corinthians 2:14). </strong>He therefore spoke of something she could relate to—water<!--more-->. <strong>Second: Jesus swung the conversation to the spiritual realm (v. 10). </strong>He simply mentioned the things of God. Jesus made the powerful statement saying, “<strong>If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water</strong>.” <strong>Third: Jesus brought conviction using the Law of God (vv. 16–18). </strong>Jesus gently spoke to her conscience by alluding to the fact that she had transgressed the Seventh of the Ten Commandments. He used the Law to bring <strong>“the knowledge of sin</strong>” (see <strong>Romans 3:19, 20</strong>). This woman agreed with Jesus as to her sinful state and admitting that she had some “dirty water” in her bucket. <strong>Fourth: Jesus revealed Himself to her (v. 26).</strong> Once the Law has humbled the person, he is ready for grace. Jesus revealed Himself to her as the only one that could purify the dirty water in her life as He made His identity as Messiah known to her. However the question remains, why did this woman leave behind her water bucket?\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Perhaps she forgot it</strong>. This woman had quite a conversion with Jesus and one that would change her life forever. Perhaps in the midst of the conversation she ran back to tell the town about Jesus and simply forgot the water bucket (hence what she came there for). Sometimes when something leaves us in awe we tend to forget the immediate.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>2. Maybe it was a gift to Jesus.</strong> Jesus had spoken such words of truth to her that she had never heard before. She was overwhelmed with awe after having Jesus reveal to her that He in fact was the Messiah she was waiting for standing before her. Perhaps she felt that He gave her a gift in the encounter, and she gave him a gift in leaving the water bucket for him.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. She didn’t want it anymore</strong>. This woman perhaps felt that water bucket filling was nothing compared to what she just discovered in the Messiah.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Her new life began the bucket for new water</strong>! “<strong>Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him,”</strong> or in this case her! She brought the message of the Messiah to her whole village and “<strong>Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” And because of his words many more became believers. They said to the woman</strong>, “<strong>We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world</strong>.” Jesus gave her beauty for ashes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is your life an empty bucket of temporary satisfaction, or one in which flows streams of living water from within him? The Gospel is not to stay in the bucket of our lives, but is to be poured out to the thirsty. Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>2Kings 5-4, “2 And the Syrians had gone out on raids, and had brought back captive a young girl from the land of Israel. She waited on Naaman’s wife. 3 Then she said to her mistress, “If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy.” 4 And Naaman went in and told his master, saying, “Thus and thus said the girl who is from the land of Israel.”</strong>\r\n\r\nPeople come in all shapes and sizes. People seem to split apart from one another by ethnicity, social status, language, occupation, etc…. However I love to look at those that God chooses to carry out His will. The Scriptures states that God is no respecter of persons. Peter refused to reach the Gentiles at one point in his ministry. <!--more-->God therefore gave him a vision in Acts while he was up on a roof a great sheet came down of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. God said to Peter, “Kill and eat,” but Peter replied, “No Lord.” <em>D. James Kennedy</em> said, “You cannot say, ‘No, Lord,’ and mean both words; one annuls the other. If you say no to Him, then He is not your Lord.” Peter eventually understood God’s lesson to him, and submitted to God’s will. This is why the Scriptures states, “Then Peter opened <em>his</em> mouth and said: “<strong>In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality”</strong>. Evans often shares, “<em>God doesn’t call the qualified, He qualifies the called.”</em> God can use whosoever He chooses, to reach whosoever He calls to repentance.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>2Kings 5,</strong> God used a slave girl to reach Naaman, Commander of the Syrian army and turn his heart toward the Lord. This girl was taken from Israel and saw the leprosy of her master, Naaman. She had compassion upon him and brought word to her mistress, <strong>vs. 3 “…If only my master <em>were</em> with the prophet who <em>is</em> in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy</strong>.” Naaman had a high profile job, he was extremely wealthy, popular, and was in the midst of war against the Arameans. As far as social status, the slave girl was far below Naaman. However God used her to reach Naaman. Naaman brought this news to the King of Syria, and the King sent a letter with Naaman to the King of Israel, and Naaman brought, <strong>vs. 5 “ten talents of silver, six thousand <em>shekels</em> of gold, and ten changes of clothing</strong>,” which was in the vicinity of three-quarters of a <em>billion</em> dollars (<em>The IVP Bible background commentary : Old Testament</em>). The girl told Naaman to go to the prophet, but Naaman first went to the King of Israel. The King tore his clothes saying, “…<strong><em>Am</em> I God, to kill and make alive, that this man sends a man to me to heal him of his leprosy?” </strong>Elisha heard what is going on, and told the king to send Naaman in to him. Naaman was then told by Elisha to go and wash in the Jordan River and bob up and down seven times. Naaman thought that this was the most ridiculous prescription for healing, considering the Jordan was forty miles away, to a river that was not known for being the cleanest of waters. Initially, pride began to rise in Naaman’s heart as he disapproved of washing in the Jordan saying, <strong>“vs. 12 Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?”</strong> Naaman eventually humbled himself and made the trip to the Jordan River, dipped seven times, and his leprosy was healed.\r\nIn the Scriptures, leprosy was a type of sin. Just as the young slave girl saw the problem, so we must see the (leprosy) sin in the lives of people, no matter who they are, and lay the weight of God’s Law upon them that they too might humble themselves to be washed in the living water of Jesus Christ. Thank God for the slave girl who gave Naaman directions which brought him to humble himself before God. Will you be like the slave girl, and be an ordinary witness to the many you see daily who will die in their sin without the living water of Jesus Christ?\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phi &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>1Samuel 30, vs. 6, \"... but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God\" (KJV)</strong>\r\n\r\nBelievers fight the spirit of discouragement many times. The man of God Elijah was suicidal because of discouragement. The Israelites became discouraged when they faced challenges in the wilderness. It's the same thing even leaders face today, discouraged from failing and discouraged by other people. Discouragement is the absence of courage. It deprives courage, hope or confidence.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nDavid too was discouraged at one time. He had killed Goliath, he was a commander of six hundred. They had subdued many enemies. While they were away in battle one time, the Amalekites invaded Ziklag where they had camped with their families. The Amalekites took away their wives, children, possessions and burnt the whole place down. The bible says, <strong>vs. “4 Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep\". </strong>I remember about 20 years ago, coming from school one day only to find that robbers had broken into our house in our absence and nearly cleaned us out leaving us with nothing but things that were little or no great value. Imagine things my parents had worked hard for many years to gain were all gone in one day. Like David and his men, we sat down and wept until there was no strength left in us. The people who could encourage each other were all weeping because they were all victims. What do you do when there is no one around to encourage you? Or when the people you are close are in no position to encourage you?\r\n\r\nYou would imagine David's men standing together in this and figure out how to work together to figure out a solution, on the contrary, in <strong>vs. 6 \"... David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters\", </strong>this was like adding salt to injury. When no one can encourage you, and those who should be standing with you distress you, either you can choose to be discouraged like the Israelites or pick up yourself like David and do something about it.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of pain upon pain, David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. He chose to draw strength from God who is never discouraged. Jesus was left alone in his hour of need when the disciples scattered. One had betrayed Him, the other had denied Him. In the midst of excruciating pain and suffering, He encouraged Himself in the Father and the Father gave Him grace to endure even sending angels lower than Him to minister to Him . It was just for a little while before it was all done. I can imagine David thinking about the goodness of God, how God helped him fight many enemies, how God was his refuge and strength, a very present help in time of need <strong>Psalm 46:1</strong>. The more I believe he drew from the word of God, the more his discouragement was turning into encouragement. This was not his courage but God’s driving away discouragement. He was encouraged that he turned around to encourage those who were discouraged.\r\n\r\nThis year has been tough with a serious injury in the family among other things. In the midst of it all, I and the family have benefited from David’s response and have encouraged ourselves in the Lord because God is in control. We are our best encouragers for we know exactly how it feels to be in it and what dose to prescribe to our dilemma. You cannot draw courage from without, you can draw from within. David did it <strong>IN</strong> the Lord so can you. Look at what the Lord has done, get into His word, get encourage in Him for when no one else can, you can IN Him. Don't let the devil see you sweat or tell you no one cares. Trade in your discouragement for encouragement. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Kings 2:9, “When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, \"Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?\" \"Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,\" Elisha replied”</strong>\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the highest form of emulation is imitation. When a small child puts on his dads big shoes what is that child showing<em>? \"I want to be like my dad\"</em> , the child displays without saying a word. Dad is most likely the man the child spends the most time with, although unfortunately that is not always true in this day and age. It has also been said, \"<em>Show me your friends, and I will show you yourfuture.\"</em> <strong>This whole thing with relationship influence is at the heart of discipleship</strong>. Jesus said come “<strong>FOLLOW ME and I will MAKE YOU fishers of men.\"<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nIn the passage today Elijah knows his time is near to be taken by the Lord. His asks his disciple Elisha, <strong>\"Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?</strong>\" Out of perhaps any other response that Elisha could have given with respect to Elijah's prayer life, miracle working \"abilities,\" or even his preaching tenacity. Elisha requested one thing of his master, \"<strong>Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit</strong>,\" he said. In short Elisha said, \"<em>I want to be like you, and continue to have the influence that you had. I want to have a double portion of your spirit, your character, your influence. Give me your spirit that I may magnify you, and others will recognize your spirit in me.</em>\"\r\n\r\nIs there anyone that you admire such that you would like to be like them? What is it about their character, their influence, their treatment of others, their words, etc. that draws you to them? Do you spend a lot of time with them? This is where Elisha found himself with Elijah. In an age that is very set on self, it is unpopular perhaps to want to have one’s life modeled after another. Elisha was not losing his identity in light of Elijah's in wanting to have his spirit, but rather his identity was influenced by a godly man and he was not ashamed to show it.\r\n\r\nIs there anyone that desires to be like you? Is there anyone that looks up to you with such high esteem? Apart from titles, positions, do you see that there are those that seem to hang around you often? Is there someone that seems to \"pick your brain,\" a lot, do some want to hear how you would handle a matter? To say again, <strong><em>\"the greatest form of emulation is imitation.\"</em></strong> Who are you spending time with to influence. Who is gaining your spirit, and is your spirit worth gaining?. What do you think is admirable about your spirit that is worthy to pass along?\r\n\r\nTwo main things must be in place to pass along your spirit to another. First, availability - you can't spend time with those that have no time for you, and vice versa. Secondly, teachable, one must desire to learn and be willing to learn from you. Both aspects are held together by the desire to want your spirit. Who craves your spirit?\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>2Kings 2:15, “The company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, “The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him”, </strong>\n\nElisha was like the vice-president prophet in the days of Elijah. He was chosen by Elijah, and through the time spent together he craved the spirit that was upon Elijah. Before being taken up in a chariot of fire by a whirlwind of God, Elijah asked to Elisha, <strong>“Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?</strong>” To which Elisha replied, <strong>“Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit</strong>.” Elisha didn’t want a material possession of Elijah. He wanted that which can only come through impartation, Elijah’s spirit.<!--more-->\n\n\nElijah is taken up by God, and Elisha picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan<strong>. Vs. 14. “Then he took the cloak that had fallen from him and struck the water with it. “Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah</strong>?” he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over. WOW! He wanted to know if God was going to be with him, in the power that God was with Elijah. He craved Elijah’s spirit and wanted to know if he had received the double portion that he desired. He had a cloak in is hand (tangible), but did he have the spirit (intangible)? At one time Elijah had placed the cloak upon Elisha when he first chose Elisha to follow him as his disciple (<strong>1Kings 19:19-21).</strong> The cloak (mantle) was once placed symbolically upon him, but now it would be upon him permanently.\n\nElisha retraces the steps of his master and goes back to Jordan to perform the exact same miracle that Elijah had done by parting the waters of the Jordan <strong>(2Kings 2:8).</strong> He strikes the water with the cloak and the water divided. Then the company of prophets who were watching said, “<strong>THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH IS RESTING UPON ELISHA. And they went to meet him and BOWED TO THE GROUND.”</strong> Elisha wasn’t trying to make a spectacle of himself, he was just exercising by faith the “proof” of the spirit that was upon him by putting his faith to the test. If the spirit was truly upon him, it would be evident. Elisha didn’t brag or boast, he simply asked and believed. The impartation was clearly recognizable to the prophets that knew Elijah. They bowed in reverence to the chief prophet Elisha\n\n<ol>\n<li>Whose spirit do you have upon you? Are there things in you good or bad that you have received from someone else imparting into you. Do you like that character that you currently have?</li>\n<li>Whose spirit do others recognize to be upon you? Is that spirit godly? If the spirit upon your “Elijah” was godly, then the spirit imparted should reflect their spirit in you. The phrase “I am with you in spirit,” certainly has some truth to it. Just be wise as to the spirit that is upon you.</li>\n<li>Who are you imparting your spirit to? Is there someone that is craving the spirit that is upon your life. The greatest form of emulation is imitation. Who is imitating you, a child, a friend, a student, a co-worker, a disciple of your, etc…?</li>\n</ol>\n\nUntil the nets are filled....\nBlessings,\nPhil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Numbers 11:17, “And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.” <em>NIV</em></strong>\r\n\r\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the word burden? Perhaps your job, your family situation, a medical condition, recent news, responsibilities, etc…. Moses found himself with a heavy burden upon him as the children of Israel were crying and complaining that they had no meat to eat. <!--more-->Now they did have fresh manna each morning, but they were chocking on their blessing with their attitude. Here is what Moses said to God vs. 11-15, “<strong>He asked the LORD, “Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me? Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers? Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me. If this is how you are going to treat me, put me to death right now—if I have found favor in your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin.”</strong>\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that Moses felt that the burden was too heavy for him, God did not tell Moses that He will remove the burden from Moses’ shoulders. Instead God was going to share the burden and take some of the weight of the burden off Moses shoulders. God summons Moses and, <strong>vs. 16 “The LORD said to Moses: “Bring me seventy of Israel’s elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you. 17 I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone”</strong>\r\n\r\nGod knew that Moses had the right spirit for the task at hand, but that Moses’ spirit needed to be upon others if Moses was going to last in the long hall and not burn out. Moses wanted the Lord to actually take his life – he wanted to die! The spirit that was upon Moses was the Spirit of God fleshed out in the life of Moses. By God’s Spirit Moses applied his faith and defied the Pharaoh, called down plagues, opened the Red Sea and went through it on dry ground. This was the spirit that God would place upon others to preserve His servant Moses. Elijah’s spirit rested upon Elisha, and now Moses’ spirit would rest upon the seventy. Just as the proof of Elisha had Elijah’s spirit upon him shown in the parting of the Jordan, Moses spirit upon the seventy would be manifested in their prophesying.\r\n\r\nGod saw fit to take Moses’ spirit and place it upon others to accomplish His work. Would God take your spirit and place it upon others? What kind of spirit do you have? Perhaps you’ve not defied a Pharaoh, or parted a sea, but there are some things perhaps that you have done by the hand of God that have been amazing. This whole thing as well is the process of discipleship, one’s spirit being imparted by the Lord upon another. Allow God to work on your spirit that he may place it upon others.\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Numbers 14:24, “But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<em>“I have come to make a difference. I’ve said it, I mean it and now I’m here to represent it</em>.” This quote comes concerning his mission. This person is Evans Olang. When I first met Evans, it was his spirit that stood out to me. <!--more-->We would all gather for early morning prayer and everyone would be seeking God, and then I couldn’t help follow this voice of this prayer warrior which led me to see a skinny man storming heaven in prayer on his face between two pew chairs. It was this spirit that Evans had, that made me say, I need that kind of prayer intensity in my life. Although the room had many people praying in the same place, he had a different spirit about him and that stood out.\r\n\r\nGod singled out Caleb and said <strong>“…my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly…”</strong> There were many people in Moses camp, what was it that caused God to acclaim his servant Caleb as such?\r\n\r\n“<strong>Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.”</strong> (Numbers 13:30)\r\n\r\n1. A man of leadership\r\nHow did Caleb silence the people before Moses? I can see him calling the people to order, but Caleb had a spirit that caused people to listen when he spoke. John Maxwell often says, leadership is influence, and Caleb certainly displayed that. When you speak do others listen?\r\n\r\n2. A man of vision\r\nWhen Moses sent out twelve spies to spy out the land and two different reports were brought back. Caleb and Joshua’s report was to go up and take the land, because they felt that it was an opportunity that could be accomplished. They saw that their Israelites could advance their territory. It’s interesting that many do not seem to remember the names of those that brought back the bad report. Do you have vision?\r\n\r\n3. A man of favor\r\nCaleb had God’s favor because he was obedient to God. It was God Himself that said <strong>“my servant Caleb…follows me wholeheartedly…</strong>” Caleb wanted to please God, and it was recognized for it. God didn’t say everyone followed Him wholeheartedly, only Caleb. God craved his spirit. How has your following been lately?\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…\r\nBlessings,\r\nPastor Phil"

              "<strong>Acts 1:8, \"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThis series focus has been on the spirit of one being passed on to another. It started off with Elijah and Elisha, then Moses, and it can certainly go on and on. Training people is a key element if one wants their legacy to live. Military leaders train soldiers to engage enemies in war, and place their lives on the line if need be. How does a man convince another man to be in a place that bullets are flying all around?<!--more-->The twelve had the best training, by the greatest communicator ever, Jesus Himself. However there was one element missing and Jesus said that He would have to leave for another to come upon them. They needed the Spirit of Christ to be in them, as He would illuminate all that Jesus taught them. Jesus sends His Spirit to rest upon the disciples and the others in the Upper Room. Jesus was forthright and confident telling them, \"<strong>You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you...\"</strong> There was no question in the mind of the Master, this was going to happen!. If they were going to do God's work, God's Spirit upon their lives was a necessity. They were going to make sure that the Gospel would reach the world. It was by this very Spirit that the blind eyes were opened, that the deaf ears were released, the dumb could speak, the lame could walk, the sick were made whole, and even the dead were raised!\r\n\r\nIf we are to win the lost to Christ it must be done through the power of the Spirit of God. The Spirit of Christ is a Spirit that compels us to love our neighbor as ourselves enough to share our faith with them. There are many unsaved people that will spend eternity in Hell, because the Holy Spirit is not in their lives. How does that rest with you? If His spirit is in you it will shine out of you. Do you have His Spirit in you?\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Jerusalem will have a witness</strong>. Those in closest proximity to you will hear the Gospel because of you. Perhaps speaking to your family and friends about the things of God seems like a grueling task. Who else is going to tell them? Do you love them enough to swallow pride, fear, etc..., and share the truth with them? If you haven't already, why not tell them today!\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Judea and Samaria will have a witness.</strong> \"Social outcasts\" are around. Will you reach out to those ones that nobody else would reach out to? Did Jesus only reach out to those hanging on His every Word, or did He even reach out to Judas? Do you touch the untouchables?\r\n\r\n3. <strong>The ends of the earth will have a witness.</strong> I personally recommend to everyone go on at least one mission's trip in their life. The Gospel knows no bounds. Where have you taken it, where will you take it?\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Luke 23:39-43, \"39 One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: \"Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!\"; 40; But the other criminal rebuked him. \"Don't you fear God; \" he said; \"since you are under the same sentence? 41 We are punished justly; for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.\"; 42Then he said; \"Jesus; remember me when you come into your kingdom.\"; 43 Jesus answered him; \"I tell you the truth; today you will be with me in paradise.\" (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nLuke is reporting a story after Jesus was crucified. He was at the center crucified besides two guilty criminals crucified with Him on death row. <!--more-->While the two criminals should have been thinking about their destiny, they were both throwing insults at Jesus, but after a while one criminal insulting Jesus stopped to think of his destiny while the other continued. With only one life to live and not knowing where that life would lead them, one stopped to rethink. All three on the cross were under the same sentence, only One was innocent.\r\n\r\n<strong>Luke 23:39, \"One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: \"Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!\"; </strong>We as human may be insulting Jesus without even knowing. When you reject the One who has given you life, has led you, has done all for you, are you not insulting Him? You've heard His Name, you've been witnessed to but still refuse to surrender your life to Him. Just because you have not seen Him perform miracles in your life you think He is a wimp, a crutch for Christians. You even take His holy Name and reduce it to a four letter filth word to express disgust simply because He is quiet. You refuse to admit your sins because you don't think your sins are that bad compared to someone else. You don't see it as exceeding sinful and you keep covering it up with self-righteousness. You try to work your way into heaven by what you call \"good works\" making His dying on the cross in vain. What an insult!! This is the same kind of attitude the first criminal had. I will not be surprised if he even thought he was being punished unjustly. Too careless to think of what happens to him after this life. Now what is sin?, sin is transgression of the law (lying, stealing, lusting, fornication, adultery, coveting, dishonoring, murdering (also includes hating), taking God's name in vain, failing to keep Sabbath day holy, Him not first in your life, having other things given reverence instead of God. I was guilty of all like the thief/criminal on the cross.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. “40 But the other criminal rebuked him. \"Don't you fear God; \" he said; \"since you are under the same sentence? 41 We are punished justly; for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong\". </strong>I love this other thief/criminal because he has but a moment, he has thought about his life, all that he ever did, what landed him on the cross. He knows that if he dies, there is something beyond the grave he has to be ready for. He has no one to condemn or blame for being on the cross but himself. All he does is see himself in his true state, a criminal who deserve justice. <strong>He knows he is getting what he deserves</strong>,. In the middle he sees a Man who has no criminal records, doesn't even make sense why He is there and not complaining for being there. He is humbled on the cross. If He is not doing it for His sake, He must have been accused wrongfully and someone else is going free. Then I remember, it was a custom to release ONE prisoner during a feast, in this case it was either Jesus the Christ or Barabbas the murderer. They let go a murderer and the innocent Man is condemned to die. <strong>Philippians 2:7-8,\"7 but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. 8 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death-- even death on a cross!\"(NIV) </strong>All I can imagine is as this thief was on the cross, thinking that if it was between him and Jesus instead of Barabbas, they would have let him go and crucified Jesus. He now understands that Jesus is also on the cross to take his punishment.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 42-43, “42Then he said; \"Jesus; remember me when you come into your kingdom.\"; 43 Jesus answered him; \"I tell you the truth; today you will be with me in paradise.\" (NIV). </strong>With one life to live, no avenue for escape, condemned to die justly, hanging in the balance of eternity he cries out to Christ to remember him, and Jesus promises to be together with him in paradise (eternity), <strong>James 4:6, \"But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: \"God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble\". </strong>One was proud and arrogant, God resists such but this other criminal was humble and Christ gave him grace. “<strong>Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sin”</strong> and without Grace, there can be no salvation. One made it to heaven while the other made it to hell based on the choices they made. You have one life to live here on earth, think about your eternal salvation, you too are on the cross for what you've done. You are not crucified wrongfully, you are crucified for sinning. Either you continue to throw insults by your life style or humble yourself and come clean, this is your day of salvation, tomorrow may never be. Saying sinner’s prayer or doing ritual stuff or going to church or paying tithe does not save you, only God does. And God only saves those who see themselves lost in dark sin and cry out to Him to save them from their sins. A patient will never desire cure until He sees sickness in his life killing him. You will never cry to be rescued until you see yourself drowning.\r\n\r\nThe bible says, “<strong>Examine yourself and see if you are in the faith”.</strong> Make your calling and election sure, don't let pride and arrogance stand in your way. Repent of your sins and put on the Lord Jesus to save you from sure death, obey his words and you will pass from death to life. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Esther 4:1-17, \"9 The girl pleased him and won his favor.”(NIV).</strong>\r\n\r\nI am a firm believer of kingdom principles. If you carefully look at how good things happen on a day to day basis, you can trace the attributes back to God’s kingdom principles applied knowingly or unknowingly. For today I would like to take a principal from the book of Esther and apply it to our day to day life. I had a different direction to go with the book but I am prompted to approach it from another angle.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf you look at an job ad or if someone tells you of an opening, there are things you look at such as, the job, the requirements, the benefits etc, then you decide if you are qualified for the job or not. We are told in the book of Esther that there was a job opening for the next queen. If you’ve read the book of Esther, you find that the queen’s position was vacant when queen Vashti disobeyed the king and was dropped from her position. For this reason, ad for the position was to find a beautiful young virgin, and the one who pleased the king would be the next queen. We see this in the first 4 verses and then the scripture switches to concentrate on someone by the name of Mordecai a Jew carried away captive from Jerusalem. He had a niece Esther whose parents died awhile ago and Mordecai took her as his daughter. <strong>Vs. 5. “…The young woman (Esther) was lovely and beautiful”</strong>. Mordecai heard about the ad and felt her niece was qualified for the job. Yes she was a slave girl, did not even deserve to be recognized yet that did stop her uncle. The kingdom principle teaches us that God has not put limitations in our lives, we are the ones who put limitations in what we can be or do. It’s our attitude that leads us to where we can go. The bible says, <strong>Proverbs 23:7, “For as he thinks in his heart, so is he…”</strong>. How many leave defeated lives though qualified because they have chosen to limit themselves. Many will stand before God one day and be showed what they could have been but because they never believed in themselves through God, they missed a lot.\r\n\r\nIt’s one thing to have the qualifications, it’s another thing to be the man or woman right for the job. <strong>Vs. 8. “When the king’s order and edict had been proclaimed, many girls were brought to the citadel of Susa …. Esther also was taken ….. 9 The girl pleased him and won his favor.”(NIV).</strong> You know what fascinates me about this verse, many were called who had qualifications, only one was chosen. The beautiful slave girl. What made her different, she was able to sell herself. <strong>In job interviews, your qualifications allow you to be called for an interview, you now have to prove to the interviewer why you are the man or the woman for the job</strong>. You have to sell yourself. David before facing Goliath had to prove to Saul why he was the man for the job. At least for him he did not have the qualifications but still convinced the king by talking about his past successes. Remember the book of Esther has no name “God” in it but you can see the kingdom principles. You can go to an interview and not mention the name of God but apply the kingdom principles for you know who is backing you up in that interview. So many beautiful girls but one pleased the king and WON his favor. It does not say she found favor, no, she WON his favor. This to means she did something more than what the other girls did, she did sell herself through character, humility, hard work, charming, lovely. A slave girl encouraged to make one move and that changes her life completely, it was but for a moment for something this big to happen. To continue… Have you limited yourself? Have you ever thought about selling yourself? Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Esther 4:14, “… Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe know of opportunities that present themselves when least expected. At the very moment they present themselves, you weigh the possibilities of being the person to rise to the occasion while looking at who you are. I watched a comedy where this young man was afraid of swimming, he did not feel he could do it because he was just too terrified. On one particular day, he saw this girl fall in the pool drowning, he swallowed his fears and jumped into the pool to rescue the girl not knowing that he had fears before. But for a moment of time, he stepped into the occasion and did what he was afraid to do so as to rescue someone else.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nEsther found herself in a position of diving into the deep end to rescue the Jews who were about to be destroyed by wicked Haaman. She is the queen as we know, feeling safe but her people were not safe. Though Mordecai knew her niece was the queen and he could get whatever he might have wanted for himself, his desire was to see all the Jews free. Of course we can now see that his fighting for Esther to be the queen was not just for Esther alone but for the Jews. But for a moment she had an opportunity to rise to the occasion to rescue the Jews even if it meant perishing. Esther is reminded that if she does not do it, there will still be deliverance for the Jews, but who knows if she came to the kingdom for such a time as this for such a time as this to be used. Have you ever asked yourself why you are where you are for such a time as this? I don’t believe it was by coincident. Have you asked yourself why what you’ve been afraid to face present themselves the way the do and you either have to let them drown or jump to rescue because you have swallowed your fears? That job, ministry or calling you were afraid to step into because you do not see how you can do it? for such a time as this, you’ve been presented with an opportunity. I believe that there are certain things you will never fully know you can do until you swallow your fears and jump to the deep end only to find you can swim.\r\n\r\nUpon being challenged by Mordecai, she knew the fate of the Jews will based on the decisions she makes. Note something here, she is not known as a Jew to the king yet, neither is anyone allowed to present themselves before the king without being called. Appearing before this king without being summoned called for death and here is her response to Mordecai <strong>vs. 16″Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me; … My maids and I will fast likewise. And so I will go to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish!” </strong>A young queen ready to lay her new career on the line. Ready to face her fears for the sake of her people. Ready to jump to the deep end. The moment she was ready to let go, God granted her favor with the king. When we are ready to loose it at a given moment that is when we find it. Great decision by Esther, great rescue for the Jews. You are where you are for such a time as this, ask the Lord to show you what you could do at a given moment to make a difference, swallow your fears and jump to the deep end at trust Him with the outcome.

              "<strong>Ephesians 1:7, “In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace”</strong>\r\n\r\nOf late I have been thinking about the saving grace of our Lord Jesus and I am constantly amazed at what He has done for a wicked wretched man that I am. I am forever thankful to Him for what He has done.\r\n\r\nThere are some truths that continue to humble me in learning of saving grace and here is the biggest one, <strong>Jesus did not suffer and die on the cross because man was worth saving, He suffered and died on the cross because He was worthy to save</strong>. No one’s sacrifice was worthy to satisfy the demand of the law death.<!--more-->The Greek word translated “redeemed” was often used to speak of buying a slave’s or debtor’s freedom. Christ’s death, because it was a death of substitution for sin, satisfied God’s justice and exhausted His wrath toward His elect. This means Christ purchased believers from slavery to sin and from the sentence of eternal death. For a broken law to be satisfied, a blood sacrifice was required and <strong>Leviticus 17:11</strong> reads, “<strong>The life of the flesh is in the blood</strong>” and if a life sheds blood, there is no more life left hence death. That is what the law does; it demands a blood sacrifice for it to be satisfied. <strong>Ezekiel 18:20, “The soul that sins shall die”, Romans 6:23, “for the wages of sin is death…”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Thank God for His saving plan even when we were not worth saving (redeeming), He saved (redeemed) us through His blood. Ephesians 1:7, “In Him we have redemption through His blood” </strong>The term used here relates to paying the required ransom to God for the release of a person from bondage. Christ’s sacrifice on the cross paid that price for every elect person enslaved by sin, buying them out of the slave market of iniquity. <strong>The price of redemption was death. N</strong><strong>ow only saving faith unlocks the door of the prison where the law keeps men bound, kept under guard by the law.</strong> Paul personifies the law as a jailer of guilty, condemned sinners, <strong>ON DEATH ROW</strong> awaiting God’s judgment <strong>(Romans 6:23</strong>). Faith in Christ alone releases (redeems) people from the death row of bondage to law.\r\n\r\nWe therefore do not accept Him as many use this terminology in reference to being saved by saying “<strong>I have accepted Jesus</strong>”, No, He accepts us and we in turn <strong>receive</strong> His acceptance. We will not enter into heaven primarily because we have accepted Christ, we will enter into heaven because God has accepted us through His Son Jesus. A certain preacher, Paul Washer in one of his preaching gave this analogy, “<em>if for example I went to White House, I will not be accepted into White House because I know President, I can only be accepted into White House because he knows me and he has invited me”</em>. How then can this also apply to the unsaved, we share the gospel with them and <strong><em>“we don’t tell people they are saved, we tell them how they can be saved, God tells them they are saved</em>”, Paul Washer</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law and now His REDEMPTION BRINGS IN THE LIMITLESS GRACE OF GOD. </strong>Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Corinthians 5:20, \"We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.” </strong>\r\n\r\nMerry CHRISTmas! I love saying that. We live in an age where the world wants us to be culturally tolerant, and politically correct. All other religious “holidays” are not really holidays if we agree that the word holiday is really the word HOLY DAY. How is Kwanza, or Ramadan holy? Kwanza does not focus on Christ, because the focus is on culture and man not on Christ the Lord.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Then of course there are those professing Christians that go to a church, or maybe place a manger scene somewhere in our homes, perhaps even have “</span><em style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Jesus the reason for the season”</em><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> somewhere around. What is this whole thing really about? There is a well known Christmas song that says \"</span><em style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"><strong>Hark the herald angels sing, Glory to the newborn King! Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled</strong></em><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">” What does that mean for God and sinners to be reconciled? Consider the lyrics by Go Fish called “</span><strong style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">It’s about the Cross.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>\"Verse 1: It’s not just about the manger, Where the baby lay, It’s not all about the angels Who sang for him that day, It’s not just about the shepherds , Or the bright an</em><i>d shining star, It’s not all about the wise men, Who traveled from afar</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Chorus: It’s about the cross, It’s about my sin, It’s about how Jesus came to be born once so that we could be born again, It’s about the stone, That was rolled away, so that you and I could have real life someday, It’s about the cross, It’s about the cross</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Verse 2: It’s not just about the presents, underneath the tree, It’s not all about the feeling that the season brings to me, It’s not just about coming home, to be with those you love, It’s not all about the beauty in the snow I’m dreaming of</i>\r\n\r\n<i>The beginning of the story is wonderful and great, But it’s the ending that can save you and that’s why we celebrate, It’s about the cross, It’s about my sin, It’s about how Jesus came to be born once, so that we could be born again</i>\r\n\r\n<i>It’s about God’s love, Nailed to a tree, It’s about every drop of blood that flowed from Him when it should have been me, It’s about the stone, That was rolled away, So that you and I could have real life someday, So that you and I could have real life someday, It’s about the cross, It’s about the cross.\"</i>\r\n\r\nJesus was born to die for the Law that you and I have broken (God’s 10 Commandments). Jesus Christ was born of a woman, born of a virgin, lived a life of perfection and went to the cross for you and I. When one looks at how far one is, how one has violated God’s perfect standard of righteousness, it makes God’s love amazing. Have you been reconciled or made it right with God? Have you confessed and forsaken (turned away from) your sins and put your trust in Christ like you would trust in a parachute. If you have, be sure to thank God and Go as Christ has commanded, and begin to tell your friends, family members and even strangers about the cross. <strong>Acts 4:12 reads, “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</strong>” Only Christ provided a payment for sin. If you’ve never repented and trusted Christ, humble yourself and do that today, because eternity is a long time, actually its eternal. May those who are reading this be reconciled to God, and be used to share the truth with others to be reconciled to God.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;"

              "<strong>Matthew 1:18-20, \"18 This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. 19 Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. 20 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit ”.</strong>\r\n\r\nIn this day and age there are a lot of voices speaking, but none as important as the voice of the Lord.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures speaks of Joseph (Mary’s husband to be) as a righteous man not wanting to make a public display of his love (Mary). He was willing to protect and provide for her needs at this confusing time. At first Joseph didn’t understand it all, but his actions were dictated by his integrity and his love for his fiancé. Although Joseph did these noble things he still lacked in one area, he had not heard from the Lord yet. The angel Gabriel had spoken to Mary at this point, but not to Joseph (<strong>Luke 1:26-38). </strong> Mary is spoken of often in the Christmas story, but Joseph seems to be given a lesser role, a backseat role in the birth of Christ. Yet God is looking for men of God to hear from the Lord.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Matthew 2:13</strong>, Joseph hears from God to take his family into Egypt because Herod would try and kill Christ. Thank God Joseph wasn’t too busy to hear and obey God or we would all have been in trouble because our Savior would have died before His time. Of course God would not have let that happen, but yet God worked through fallible humans to accomplish His will. Again in <strong>Matthew 2:19-21,</strong> we find God speaking to Joseph about leading his family back to Israel, because God knows where He wants you. Sadly though many men believe God and church are for women only, and that they are to work and bring home the bacon. Yet from Scripture, before Joseph and Mary were married God spoke to both of them, and after they were married God spoke to Joseph, not Mary, concerning the leadership of their family. God desperately desires men He can speak to, to lead their families in the way the Author of the family designed it.\r\n\r\nGod said, <strong>“I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found none</strong>\" <strong>(Ezekiel 22:30)</strong>. Where are the Christian men building up, and standing in the gap for their families? <em>Statistically if 100 children profess Christ, 3.5 families will be added to your church; if 100 women profess Christ, 17 families will be added, but if 100 men come to the Lord, 93 families will be added! </em> God saves both men and women, desiring they both to hear and obey Him. But God is calling for men to spiritually lead their families, however without waiting on Him how can a man obey this?\r\n\r\nApplication: Men are you more emotionally focused on your job, or your family? Yes you are to be the breadwinner, provider, but remember jobs come and go, you are replaceable at work, but your family only has one husband, one dad. If you die your job will fill your role, but your family won’t. Listen to the voice of God, so you can spiritually lead your family, because this God will hold you accountable for. Women, give your spouse room to lead, pray diligently for him, because as a man and husband I know WE NEED your prayers. Women make sure that you too are hearing from the Lord. And may you together bring your children up in the fear and admonition of the Lord. Here is practical help for family devotional time. Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>2Kings 18:4, “He removed the high places and broke the sacred pillars, cut down the wooden image and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it, and called it.”</strong>\r\n\r\nAs humanity was created, they were created to worship God, glorify Him and enjoy Him forever. Unfortunately, the devastation of sin entered our world because of sin through a decision and action made by our first parents, Adam and Eve.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->From that point, it would seem that our sin saturated hearts chief desire would be to worship and glorify ourselves and anything that would bring personal pleasure to our lives. We so naturally think about ourselves first, glory in ourselves, and reveal in ourselves even though we have the stench of sin as the human race and we are ever so comfortable in it. Think about this, “<em>Does a fish know that its’ wet?”</em> Humanity doesn’t realize that it is saturated in, apart from a supernatural dynamic conviction from the Holy Spirit of God. The man John Newton author of the ever popular song realized that he was a wretch before God, hence the line, <em>“…that saved a wretch like me</em>.” He went from mistreating slaves he transported, to becoming a slave for Christ (<strong>Romans 1:1, Ephesians 6:6</strong>). The things we may worship are the very things that God created. The Egyptians worshipped the false sun god Ra, yet failed to worship the God that created the sun. This is why the plagues of Egypt were as specific as the plagues were the very gods that they worshipped, and in their thinking, seemingly attacking them at the command of the God of Moses.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine worshipping something that God instructed you to make for your healing? This is precisely what took place in the time of King Hezekiah (King of Judah) who did what was right in the Lord’s sight. He removed the high places of pagan worship, and cut down the wooden image of the Canaanite goddess Asherah. However what seemed to really be eye opening was the next idol that he destroyed to pieces, which was non-other than the bronze serpent that God commanded Moses to hold up in the wilderness to bring healing to those that were bitten by the epidemic of fiery serpents.\r\n\r\n<em>“Hezekiah broke the Nehushtan into pieces, i.e., the bronze snake made by Moses in the wilderness (</em><strong><em>Numbers 21:4–9</em></strong><em>), because Judah had come to worship it as an idol, perhaps influenced by Canaanite religion, which regarded snakes as fertility symbols (The MacArthur study Bible).”</em> Israel was told to look upon it at that time, and because of their obedience and the goodness of God, God healed their infirmities that resulted previously from their own sin. Looking upon it never carried the notion to worship the bronze serpent which Israel did 700 years later. The focus of this was on the God that healed and not on the serpent itself. Instead of it being used as merely a symbol to recognize the goodness and provision of the Lord, Israel began to look at the serpent itself as a deity, and that was a call for its destruction. Destroying this relic was no small matter, as it had lasted, and been preserved for quite some time at this point, but a necessary step in Hezekiah cleansing the land of all idols, even one that although did not being as an idol, and used by Moses, had become an idol, and manipulated by the enemy to drive people away from the true worship of God. However this is such the nature of humanity. Paul reminds us of this fact that happened centuries later in Rome, <strong>“Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things (Romans 1:22).”</strong>\r\n\r\nHowever, the bronze serpent, although destroyed because of the idolatrous worship that accompanied it, would be used as a symbol by Christ to bring glory to God. Jesus would refer the bronze serpent as a symbol of Himself. John wrote, “<strong>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life<em>” </em></strong>This Jesus would be lifted up (like the serpent in the wilderness) to bring healing to those bitten by the fiery serpent (Satan), however he would be broken just as he symbolized at the last supper when he said to His disciples, “<strong>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is My body</strong>.” This Jesus was broken on the cross for our sins. We dare not glory in anything except the cross of Christ. We need not worship, as many do, the symbol of the cross as many look to the cross (as a symbol) without looking to the Christ of the Cross. People because of the evil of heart, and natural desire toward idolatry have used the cross as a relic to protect themselves from evil. Should a man speed down the highway, but because he has a cross hanging on his rearview mirror, expect to be spared from a traumatic accident? It is Christ that saves, not a symbol of Roman execution. Many were executed on the cross during Christ’s time, but it was only the Christ on the cross, that died and rose that gives hope eternal and full of glory.\r\n\r\nAll of our Christian symbols CANNOT replace the Christ of Christianity. Perhaps that is why we don’t have a picture of Him, because if we did many would worship the picture on Him, instead of Him. If you have been guilty of idolatry, then perhaps there are some things you need to break, remove, and throw away. Then repent to God, and put your trust in the Christ of Scripture. Read your Bible to learn about the Christ of Scripture, and obey the Christ of the Word of God. Then go out and preach in obedience the Christ that was lifted up, and under the conviction of the Holy Spirit He will draw others to Himself.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\nPhil Sessa, Evangelist (Soulfishing Ministries)"

              "<strong>Colossians 3:22, “Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe all desire to be liked by others. As you look through God’s Word you will certainly see that God’s people especially His leaders, were not always given positive treatment as some were mocked, threatened, beaten, and even killed. <!--more-->Think of Moses who at one time had the favor of Egypt as a prince, and was treated as an outlaw upon returning to free the Israelites. Moses went from friend to foe, as he <em>“fell out of favor</em>” with the Egyptians. The Apostles were all killed for their bold preaching of the gospel. However, despite these truths there is another side to the same coin. You see God has a way of intervening in relationships and granting favor from the unsaved, ungodly, toward the godly. What do I mean, well let me explain.\r\n\r\nDaniel and his three friends were brought into captivity into the land of Babylon. This was an ungodly land, with ungodly leaders where pagan gods were worshipped. Even though he was in captivity Daniel gained favor with the ungodly leaders in Babylon, all whom had the “power” to take Daniel’s life from him at any given time. Even though Daniel was in such an ungodly environment the Scripture points out <strong>Daniel 1:8, “But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.”</strong> His mind was made up to be pure before God and not to follow the old saying, “<em>when in Rome do as the Romans do.”</em> No, he would do as God desired, period. Because of this Daniel gained favor with the most unlikely people of that ungodly land, and that is the leaders, specifically the princes and kings that ruled the nation. Look at Daniel’s testimony.\r\n\r\n<strong>Daniel 1:9, “Now God had caused the official (prince of the eunuchs) to show favor and sympathy to Daniel,” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Daniel 2:46, “Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him</strong>”. <strong>47</strong>, <strong>“The king said to Daniel, “Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery</strong>.” <strong>48, “Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men</strong>.”\r\n\r\n<strong>Daniel 5:29, “Then at [King] Belshazzar’s command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom</strong>.”\r\n\r\n<strong>Daniel 6:1, “It pleased [King] Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom,: 2 with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss.:3 Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom</strong>.\r\n\r\nHow did Daniel gain favor with the ungodly princes and kings? He simply maintained a commitment to God. He told the kings things that were true that was bad news about them, he broke the laws of the land in order to obey the Laws of God, and he of course operated and so flourished in the spiritual gifts God had given him. He would not compromise his relationship with God, and always took care of his three friends.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: In an ungodly world, keep your commitment to God no matter what. God can bring favor with the ungodly toward you. Psalm 46:10, “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations (heathen-KJV), I will be exalted in the earth.” Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<b>Exodus 3:1-12, \"And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed\"</b>\r\n\r\nAlways people want to be in comfortable places, comfortable home, job, ministry etc. When you talk about comfort, you will be referring to being set, nothing else to worry about, relaxed nothing further to pursue. I love comfort just like anybody else but I believe God brings us to certain levels that our comfort is <b><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">disrupted not by what He tells us but by what He reveals to us to see.<!--more--></span></b>\r\n\r\nIt can be comforting to be in a place where you don't have to deal with the past and that is the case with Moses. He was a special child to some capacity. In the times Moses’  being born, the male born children to the Israelites were in danger as many of them were killed, Moses being targeted too. He was hid to prevent him from being killed and was discovered by Pharaoh’s daughter who had him raised for her as her son. From almost being killed, to being raised by Pharaoh's daughter as a prince. As a prince, he had everything he could have wanted. Later he discovers he was a child of the slave, he then chooses to suffer with his people. Later he kills someone while he was in the kingdom he served as a prince to defend his people then ran for his life. Coming to the Medianites, he had a chance to get his life back together, no more enemies after him and the life is now too good to be true. <b>Exodus 2:21,  reads \"Then Moses was content to live with the man (Jethro), and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses, and she bore him a son\". </b>Moses was like the CEO of Jethro's flock, he had a good wife, a healthy son, and everything was normal and he was content. When you have a well paying job, good family, living in good neighborhood, good car, money in the bank account, healthy, what else do you live for? Just like Moses, it's easy to be content with this kind of life and forget where you came from.\r\n\r\nBe very careful about what you pray for. Praying to God to use you may mean a life to be disrupted but the question is, are you ready for change? <b>Exodus 3:1, \"Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God</b>” I can't say Moses had been to this other part of the dessert before but I believe God was setting him up for something extra ordinary. See the desert was an ordinary place, a place where you never saw the unusual. And out of the ordinary, <b>, \"And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consume</b>\", <b>Exodus 3:2. </b>Sounds like the Lord was waiting for him, because out of the ordinary, Moses sees a burning bush and I can imagine him saying, <i>\"perhaps  it's one of those  wild fire\"</i>, but what fascinated him was the fact that the bush was not being consumed. Anytime God begins to reveal Himself to us, we see things in the ordinary because He appears to us like that, the more you keep looking, you begin to see that there is an extraordinary aspect of Him. All of a sudden Moses takes a closer look and he sees that bush is burning yes, but there is something about this bush, it's not being consumed. He would have seen the bush and continued doing his stuff, and I know times we see something the Lord is doing and we conclude that it's ordinary but look deeper, set your eyes upon Him, focus on Him, see far beyond the ordinary and natural and see the extra ordinary. “<b><i><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">See what you believe, don't believe what you see!!!”</span></i></b> Moses comfort was about to be interrupted. To continue. Blessings, Ev"

              "<b>Exodus 3:1-12, \"And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consume\"</b><b></b>\r\n\r\nAngels are supernatural creatures that exist in the heavenlies serving as messengers from God and as protectors for His chosen people. In this case, the Angel of the Lord was a visible manifestation of God, possibly the preincarnate Christ. The flame of fire was the glory of God’s presence, the Shekinah, which transformed everything and everyone it touched. This fascinated Moses that he drew closer to see. <!--more--><b>Exodus 3:3, \"And Moses said, \"I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt</b>\". As God draws you out, His drawing creates a thirst  in you to want to know more, and the more you draw closer, the more He shows you what later becomes the desires of your heart.\r\n\r\nFirst point, I have learnt that even the desire to worship and serve the Lord is not my own but His, He plants it there. <b>John 6:44</b>, says, <b>“No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him,...”.</b> Had the Lord not drawn Moses through the burning bush, he would have not seen it.  Second point, God came to where Moses was. God came to Moses through the commonplace, which becomes special and holy when touched by God. Spontaneous combustion was not unusual in the desert, but a non consuming flame was an extraordinary and commanding event. God had to come to us to save us.\r\n\r\nMoses desired to come closer and explore this magnificent sight not knowing what to expect. This is what I call beginning in the flesh not really knowing what awaits you or knowing who is behind this awesome sight. <b>Exodus 3:4, \"And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said here I am</b>\". Is it possible the Lord could show us something only  for us not show any sign of interest? We get used to every day's life, get comfortable and anyone who might want to disrupt our comfort is someone we want to distance ourselves from. Comfortable to only come to church to worship,  that's about it, not involved in any ministry, not reaching the lost who are still in Egypt under bondage because you and I are safe in the land of the Medianites where God has appeared to these people and to us many times. He turned to see and God called him out.\r\n\r\nA man in the making is a man who sees, desires, draws closer to see clearly what is there. If you watch closely, you will find that God is in control of every step, He is the  One that draws.\r\n\r\n<b style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Exodus 3:5 “Then He said, “Do not draw near this place. </b><b style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"></b><b style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.</b><b style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">”</b><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> I believe the first thing God taught Moses was His nature, His Holiness right before introducing Himself. The ground was holy because God who is Holy was present in it. This is also an indication that where God’s presence is, He makes that ground holy. I can now understand why born again Christians can be called holy, God who lives in them is holy. Wow. A man in the making learns that God is holy and therefore comes in reverence in His presence.  To continue, blessings Ev</span>"

              "<b>Exodus 3:1-12, \"And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consume\"</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Exodus 3:6, “Moreover He said, </b><b>“</b><b>I am the God of your father</b><b>—</b><b>the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</b><b>”</b><b> And Moses hid his face, for </b><b></b><b>he was afraid to look upon God</b><b>”</b><b>.</b> This was a solemn declaration God made of his name, by which he would be known to Moses: “<b>I am the God of thy father</b>”,  He lets him know that it is God who speaks to him, to engage his reverence and attention, his faith and obedience; for this is enough to command all these: I am the Lord.  What was about to happen in the life of Moses had to be of God and had to be revealed to him.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<b>Exodus 3:10, \"Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt\". </b>As I had shared, a man in the making sees, desires, draws closer, gets a revelation of who God is, His heart and what God requires of that individual He has called. My next point, a man in the making will receive a calling in his life not based on his/her background but based on what God will make him/her be. God clearly announced His intention of fulfilling His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob about the land of Palestine. He was fully aware of their plight in Egypt, and the time had now come for their REDEMPTION. To make this point clear, our salvation is not the end but the beginning of preparation to be used back in Egypt where we came from with the aim to seek and to save that which is held captive by the power of Pharaoh (sin). It's scary return to where you came from but when you understand that someone's life is at stake, you will cry out like Isaiah who said, \"<b>Here I am O Lord send me</b>\". The qualification for this job is very simple, \"<b>I CAN'T</b>\". When you say those words, you have just qualified yourself for the job.\r\n\r\nA man in the making has someone very important backing him up, the presence of the One who is sending<b> </b>him<b>. Exodus 3:12, \"So He said, \"I will certainly be with you. And this shall be a sign to you that I have sent you\".</b> What a promise that wherever God sends any of us as His witnesses, He has promised to be with us. <b>Mathew 28:19-20, \"19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: vs. 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world</span>.\" </b>\r\n\r\nThose who are safe would rather stay away from Egypt but when you get a glimpse of what is in the heart of God like Moses, you will move from the comfort zone to where He would lead you.  You have found freedom in Christ, you have escaped the wrath to come, what  about those still bound ? Charles Spurgeon said, <b><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\"If you have no wish for others to be saved, you are not saved yourself be sure of that</span></b>\".\r\n\r\nPray to God today that He will cause you to be a man or woman in the making in readiness to the calling He already has for you. A calling for the lost is not for some but all believers. His desire is that no one perish the reason He is sending us. If you are going to worship God, desire also to reach people for God. <b><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">It's easy to talk to God about people but hard to talk to people about God</span></b>. A man/woman in the making is ready for change, are you?  Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>2Corinthians 12:9, \"And He said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nI have shared from this scripture before but for the sake of those who are working under pressure, feeling tired, spent and exhausted like me, we need to hear this again. I find it easy at times to quote a scripture and then find it hard to apply it in a situation. Then there are those times you look at a scripture and you quote it and feel good to quote it but forget to look at the previous verses that led to it.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nPaul in this case was going through something he could not describe, he referred to it as thorn in the flesh sent to him by a messenger of Satan. Three times he pleaded (pressed in, cried out, called on God) to take it away. Of course this was humble him, but I would like to take some principles to be an encouragement to us. I don't know whether where you are right now you've felt something you couldn't describe, no one understood your situation, you received an assignment that did not make sense, in short you are distressed. You've prayed that the Lord takes it away but He did not, you even wondered if Jesus cares about what you are going through. You desire for it to be moved or changed or you move. <strong>He knows what you need and that is why you are in ABLE HANDS</strong>. Paul did not need to run away from what he was going through because that is what God was going to use to put him together. That is what He was using to get more praise and worship out of him. God's joy was about to be manifested in what he had to deal with. Escaping it would have meant missing the opportunity to experience something extraordinary.\r\n\r\n<strong>2Coritnthians 12:9, \"And He said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.\" </strong>Two things he was to receive, GRACE and STRENGTH. Grace is unmerited favor, a favor rendered by the one who need not to do so. A state of being protected and sanctified by the favor of God. His grace is sufficient, more than enough. I would say <strong>God is gracing you and I with His presence</strong>. <strong>So you and I need His presence more than we need answers</strong>. He is more than enough and with Him present, we can do anything. Moses said, \"<strong>If your presence is not going with us, don't let us leave this place (paraphrased</strong>). Thank God for gracing us with His presence, He goes before us by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire. Then His strength is made PERFECT in weakness. He is present and He is the strength because He is perfect. The Lord is my strength (not giving me strength) <strong>Psalms 46:1, \"God is our refuge and STRENGTH a very PRESENT help in trouble\". </strong>To sum up <strong>2Corinthians 12:9,</strong> <strong>When He graces us with His presence He is more than enough, He makes Himself strong in us in our weakness</strong>. This gave Paul a chance not to view what he was going through as discouraging experience but an encouraging one, <strong>vs. 9&amp;10, \"Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10, \"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong\". </strong>See your situation and be encouraged for you are in able hands. blessings Evans"

              "<strong>Number 13:1-2, “The LORD said to Moses, \"Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nPeople are always giving different reports on the same issue. Many scientists at one time reported that the earth was flat, but a minority of people believed it to be round, as did the Bible state the same (<strong>Isaiah 40:22</strong>) At one time the scientific majority said the earth sat on a large animal, while the Bible had stated the earth floats free in space (<strong>Job 26:7</strong>). And my favorite, many say you should never discuss religion or politics at a table, 2% of Christians disobey the majority’s word then.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe Lord brought His plan to Moses to send out spies into the land (v.1) by the commandment of the Lord (V.3) were chosen one man from each tribe in Israel. Verses 4-16 describe the names of the rulers from each tribe. Verse 6 speaks of Caleb who was from the same tribe as Jesus (Judah) and verse 16 is when Moses calls Joshua. These names are obviously the main characters in the account. Moses lays out the blueprints of the assignment. They were to bring back a report of the following: #1. The People: Strong or weak, few or many. #2. Land: Good or bad, fat or lean, wood or not, fertile soil or poor soil?. #3 Towns: Unwalled or fortified. #4 Tangible Evidence (extra credit): Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.\" (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) This was going over and above their assignment.\r\n\r\nTwo reports returned, one from the majority, and one from the minority. <strong>The Majority report stated the following in their report: </strong>Land: Flowing with milk and honey; People: Strong. They focused on the fact of the people of Anak that were allegedly giants (v.33). It’s probably more important to say gigantic as a description. Writings have been found from the Egyptians written on papyrus (13 Cent. BC) describing fierce warriors in Canaan 7-9 feet tall; Towns: Walled and very great; Fruit: They brought a single cluster of grapes, carried on a pole by to men, along with some pomegranates and figs.\r\n\r\nVerse 32 states \"<strong>And they brought an evil report</strong>\" to the children of Israel. Those were the cold, hard facts! Beautiful land - ugly giants; what were they to do?\r\n\r\n<strong>The Minority reported the following in their report</strong>: Well, one of the spies named Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, and answered Moses’ question with this statement; \"<strong>We should go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it.\" </strong>Now that’s an extremely different report, as different as liberals and republicans, night and day, east and west. The Israelite’s were faced with an important choice; who’s report were they going to believe? The minority, positive report, full of faith, adventure, and proactively, said, \"<strong>We should go up at once and take possession for we are well able to overcome it</strong>\" or the majority, evil, doubtful, already defeated, and may I say Satanic report saying \"<strong>We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are</strong>\". Unfortunately, they believed the negative report and didn’t enter the Promised Land for another forty years. Were Joshua and Caleb being presumptuous in their faith? Perhaps these two knew that \"giants\" were no problem for a Giant God! What is the final verdict? <strong>Deuteronomy. 1:35-38</strong> shows how out of the twelve spies only Joshua and Caleb entered the Promised Land. The ten were called by Moses rebellious, unfaithful, grumblers, causing the people to lose heart. None of the men of that evil generation Moses, said, would enter into the Promise Land, except Joshua and Caleb. Funny,! what were the names of the other spies? I can’t remember.\r\n\r\nApplication: God has placed a dream, passion, destiny or promise in your heart, you must be willing to kill some giants of doubt, fear and unbelief, to attain it! We must go forward unafraid and not be so easily dissuaded from the aspirations God has placed in our hearts. If God has spoken to us about a promise he wants to bring to pass in our lives - lets believe him and be ready to fight some giants. Hang onto God’s promises and refuse to back down! Go forward, praying for courage and enter that Promised Land - it’s worth the fight! Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Psalm 27:1-14, \"Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe division of <strong>Psalm 27</strong> mention a number of things the Psalmist describes what the Lord is to him. The first verse he tells us that the Lord is his light, then his salvation, a strong hold, he mentions the beauty of the Lord, his helper and also mentions the goodness of the Lord. It's hard to have a hero without knowing his strengths especially when you depend on him, in our case our Hero is Jesus but like David we got to know who He is to us.<!--more--> Many cannot move because they do not know or understand what the Almighty God is capable of handling and if that is not enough, they do not understand when they can call on the Lord, they are unaware if it's too late or too early to believe God for something. <strong>Psalm 46:1 reads, \"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble\". </strong>This verse alone sums it up, for one, <strong>God is our refuge . </strong>We have enemies and overwhelming things but the Lord is our refuge, a hiding place. Not only is He our refuge, He is also “<strong>our strength” </strong>for He lives in us. We are going in His strength and not anyone's. He is also “<strong>present”</strong> any time, all the time, never will He leave, He is always with us. He says, \"<strong>Lo I will be with you always\" </strong>and then He is “<strong>our help” </strong>in trouble and who does not face troubles?\r\n\r\nWith this established, David tells us in verse <strong>1&amp;2, \"The Lord is my light and my salvation-whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life- of whom shall I be afraid?”</strong> It is very important to personalize what the Lord is to you instead of generalizing. When we generalize, we feel like He can do it for others but us. When we understand who God is to us, we can confidently refer to Him us our light and salvation. The Psalmists knows that he has enemies and an army stationed against him, but with God on his side, he is set even if there are more armies against him. <strong>1Timothy 1:12, ...For I am persuaded that He is able...\" </strong>meaning I am more than convinced that He can and He will so I will be confident not in myself but in Him.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 27:4, \"One thing I have desired of the LORD, That will I seek: That I may dwell in the house of the LORD All the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the LORD, And to inquire in His temple\" </strong>It's easy to believe God and do nothing , here we have a psalmist who believes God and puts his faith in God by seeking Him. Seeking the Lord removes all the fears and doubts for the presence of the Lord like a fire which consumes everything including that which is wet. When Elijah called fire from heaven, though we know it’s hard for fire to consume water and stones, the fire of God consumed everything. When we seek God, His fire will come down and consume the stones of pride in our lives, stones of doubt, and everything that will try and put off the fire. Yes He is around all the time and many times you may not feel Him but seeking Him reveals the God who is present. Then he says, <strong>\"That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life\". </strong>I wonder if all desire to be in the house of the Lord forever. The house of the Lord is a type of Ship that sails on top of the world is sinking in. The Ark, a type of church preserved Noah and his family in the flood. The church is a place of refuge, yes we can meet God everywhere but I found that there is such a greater connection when I am in His house. David loved the house of the Lord that he gives this line to us in <strong>Psalms 84:10, \"For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere, I'd rather be a door keeper in the house of the Lord than to dwell in the tents of the wickedness\"</strong>. Imagine one day in the house of the Lord is better than days going to parties, camping, vacation. <strong>\"To behold the beauty of the LORD, And to inquire in His temple\".</strong> Behold is to view, observe, see, watch or take a look at the beauty of the Lord, His holiness, His Majestic splendor, His Excellency, how precious, gracious, merciful, powerful, present. The beauty of the Lord we behold when we come to seek Him. It's in the process of beholding His beauty that we discover even more, He is Yahweh who has no beginning or end, He has no birth dates and He does no need for anything to make Him complete for He is complete within Himself lacking nothing. In <strong>1John 3:2, \"...for we shall see Him as He is\", not as we perceive of Him or thought of Him but as HE IS. </strong>I found that the more I behold His beauty, the more all my fears, doubt, confusion ran away for everything knows who is in control. Seek Him that you may see Him as HE IS. To finish. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 27:1-14, \"Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIn part 1, we looked at David taking time to personalize what the Lord is to him. He is not reducing or trying to make God in his own way but he understands who the Lord is and how the Lord is his help therefore he calls him “MY …”; He is My strength, My joy, My Hope, My healer, My deliverer, My confidence, My peace, My guide, My light, My redeemer. Whatever you know for sure you can't do and we know we can do nothing, the Lord becomes to us what we are not.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 27:5, \"For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; In the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock\". </strong>Where do you first run to when you are in trouble? do you run first to your buddies or to the Lord. When you fall, who do you call on? <strong>Psalm 18:3, \"I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies\", Romans 10:13, \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved\"</strong>. Because we call on the name of the Lord, the strong tower, we surrender ourselves to his hiding place, pavilion (dwelling place). For where He is stationed can no enemy enter. Not only will He hide us, He will also shelter us in His tabernacle, in other words, He will not just protect us. He will also provide for us in His presence. We understand that whatever is from the Lord comes already blessed. When He has blessed us, He shall set us high upon the a rock where we can display the goodness of the Lord. Everything the Lord is doing in our lives is to bring Him glory. We therefore give Him the glory by praising Him and letting people know of what He has done for us that someone somewhere can believe in Him too for a blessing. If being set upon the rock is being set on Him for He is the Rock of Ages and what a blessing to know that He has raised us up above my enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Lord is my everything, He is My mother and My father, my earthly parents are just demonstrating who He is to me. <strong>Psalm 27:10, \"When my father and mother forsake me, The Lord will take care of me</strong>\". Glad is he who knows that even the people who are supposed to be there can leave but having the Lord take care of you is more than enough. The bible says that He the Father to the fatherless, He is a friend who sticks closer than a brother and what the Psalmist is telling us here is that even if the people that are very close may choose to leave, His care for us will not diminish for His care is not conditioned to who is there and who is not.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 27:11, \"Teach me You way, O Lord and lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies\". </strong>There is a great difference between knowing the ways of the Lord and knowing the acts of the Lord. The bible says that unto the children of Israel, God showed them His acts but unto Moses, He showed him His ways. When you only know the acts of the Lord, you will only rejoice when things are done and if not, chances are, you will complain. Knowing the ways of God changes the way you think and how you perceive God, in that even if He does not do it, does not mean He is not able. He could have delayed it, He is trying to teach us something, He is building a people with a destiny and so we rejoice in every step because we know His ways. <strong>Psalm 86:11, \"Teach me your ways O Lord and I will walk in Your truth, unite my heart to fear you name\", Psalm 37:5, \"Commit your ways to the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass\", Psalm 25:4, \"Show me Your ways, Oh Lord, teach me thy paths, lead me in Your truth and teach\". </strong>Would you rather know the acts of the Lord or know His ways?\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 27:13, \"I would have lost heart, unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the LORD In the land of the living\" </strong>How many times I have felt like giving up, giving in and calling it a quit. In KJV version says, <strong>\"I would have fainted\". </strong>Friends, Christ is our heart beat, many times we fainted because we stopped believing. David says that I was tempted to stop believing but that caused me to almost faint and loose heart. It's was getting too much and the journey was long and tiring but I could not stop believing in Him to bring me to a place where I could see His goodness in the land of the living. <strong>\"The race is not for the swift neither is the battle for the strong but for those who endure till the end\", </strong>rest if you must but do not faint, don't stop trusting God where you are, keep fighting the good fight of a soldier enduring shame as the elect of Christ. Believe God to bring you to a place where you can see His goodness in the land of the living.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 27:14, \"Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord\". </strong>We will wait for the Lord and I don't mean sit down and keep checking our watch to see if He is coming but doing what the waiter and the waitresses do, they wait on people who come to the restaurant. Their waiting is actually working, serving, reaching out, making sure that someone has what they need and so is with us, we have to believe God for greater things, but we have to reach God by doing something. <strong>When He calls me, I will answer for I will be somewhere working for the Lord.</strong> Your blessing and my blessings many times comes as a result of service so I wait on the Lord for <strong>HE IS MY EVERYTHING</strong>. Have blessed day people. Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 14:22-33, \"28 And Peter answered Him and said, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.” 29 So He said, “Come.” And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe subject of faith is often preached on, taught and abused at the same time. The many faith teachings are more about what God can do for you financially and health wise. And if you’ve listened to the same, be enlightened that there is more to faith than that. Teachings on faith today mostly dwell on the byproducts of faith. We find that often times too many of us have enough faith for breadcrumbs and not enough for a whole loaf, what He has promised. Faith enough to get us by and nothing to challenge us to grow more faith in God.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLet me share on faith that’s beyond getting us stuff, faith that brings glory to God<strong>. It's not what you will gain from God that is priority, it’s what God will gain for Himself through you, the rest are benefits</strong>. That is where the Prime product supersedes the by product. Faith ought to distinguish us from the world, we walk by faith and not by sight or not by luck. Faith in what? <strong>Faith in God demonstrated on unfamiliar territories</strong>. If <strong>“faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen”, Hebrews 11:1</strong>, then how do we hope for what we see in the familiar territories? <strong>I believe that if we are not walking by faith,(trusting God for great and mighty things), we are robbing God of the glory He could gain for Himself through us.</strong>\r\n\r\nIn our text, Jesus fed 5 thousand men besides women and children with five loaves and two little fish. Right after, He made His disciples go by boat to the other side while He sent the multitude home. He later went to pray followed by meeting them later<strong>. Vs. 24 \"But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary\", </strong>come to think of it and I could be wrong, most miracles that involved ONLY the disciples appeared to be happening in water (lake, sea) and that is fascinating to me. They were far from everyone else and the usual. In the sea, they had no one to trust in but God, they couldn’t even put their faith in each other to bring them through. Everything they tried to do could not succeed. The obstacles they faced happened in the middle of the dark sea and not at the shore. These were places where they could not operate by sight but by faith. And I believe that we will never trust God for great and mighty things as long as we are trading on safe grounds, familiar territories where we have a backup plans to fall back on.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 25, “Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea”,</strong> this must have been going on most of the night for when Jesus met them, between 3-6 AM, He had prayed all night while these men battled storm all night. Jesus knew what they would be facing and still let them go. It was a faith learning class in unfamiliar territory. He came walking on water prayed up while His disciples were hanging onto the boat for their dear lives with no avenue of escape. Then the disciples saw Him walk on water and they were afraid thinking He was a ghost.\r\n\r\nNow the boat was just a little familiar, they had travelled by it many times and I believe that when all failed, all their little left faith (breadcrumbs) was on that boat to save them, and Here comes the King of kings, walking on water. No one had ever walked on water. And Peter all of a sudden forgets about what they went through the night and was still facing and said <strong>“Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.” </strong>It was Peter’s idea to step out of the boat by faith, moved from asking for crumbs (wind to cease) to walk on water, while the rest were left in the boat. Stepping out to face what almost killed them and face it head on because of the presence of the Master. His faith increased when saw Him do the impossible. And since he was His disciple and a disciple ought to learn from His teacher, he mastered faith in the Lord and attempted the impossible. It’s assign that he was learning and growing.\r\n\r\nWhen was the last time you trusted God for something way bigger than you while in the middle of the sea? Salvation of a loved one, a miracle over what you perceived as way too bigger than your back up plan? We can’t keep operating on the little faith we have when there is more we can trust God for. We got to have something, a middle of sea experience that awakens, challenges and increases our faith to even step out and concur by faith what has threatened to take our lives. To walk on what could make us drown, that is faith in God. <strong>Psalm 37:4, “Delight yourself also in the LORD, And He shall give you the desires of your heart”</strong>, Without faith it’s IMPOSSIBLE to PLEASE God and to delight ourselves in the Lord is to have great pleasure in walking by the measure of His faith and not ours, and He will glorify Himself through us. Those who delight in Him He gives them the desires of their heart because they are in line with His desires for them. Peter’s delight in the Lord caused the Lord to honor his desires. To finish, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 14:22-33, \"28 And Peter answered Him and said, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.” 29 So He said, “Come.” And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus.</strong>\r\n\r\nI love reading about Peter, he was a regular guy like any of us. He had weakness and strengths. Peter was an ordinary fisherman who walked with Jesus. His walk with Christ changed his life and I don’t believe anyone can walk with Christ and not be changed.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 29 “So He said, “Come.” And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus”. </strong>Jesus was (is) God to have walked on water; Peter was a man, the first man to ever walk on water. God walking on water was expected, He is God He can do anything. Greater testimony in my judgment is when God takes an ordinary life and does something extraordinary in that life, glorifying Himself through that life. Even if it was for a short time due to little faith, he attempted something no man ever dared to try or even have faith in someone else to make him or her do it. Think about it, for that short time he walked on water, he gave God all the glory because he proved to the rest of the disciples and to us all that Christ is able to make us do the impossible if we believe. Also shows the Lord keeps His promises. Peter said, “<strong>command me to come to You on the water</strong>”, the Lord said “Come”, a seal of His approval and the ability to make it happen. Peter took the Lord at His word, asking no questions and walked on water towards Jesus. That is daring faith, taking the Lord at His word even if it does not make sense.\r\n\r\nHow is God glorified in us in such a daring faith? Here is something to ponder on <em>“If someone says to you, \"You're a man of great faith in God,\" they may think that they are paying you a compliment. But they aren't -- the compliment is to God. For example if I said to you, \"I'm a man of great faith in my doctor,\" it's actually the doctor I'm complimenting. If I have great faith in him, it means that I see him as being a man of integrity, a man of great ability -that he is trustworthy. I give \"glory\" to the man through my faith in him. The Bible says that Abraham \"</em><strong><em>He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.\" (Romans 4:20-21)</em></strong><em>. Abraham was a man of great faith in God. Remember, that is not a compliment to Abraham. He merely caught a glimpse </em><strong><em>of God's incredible ability, His impeccable integrity, and His wonderful faithfulness to keep every promise He makes. His faith gave \"glory\" to a faithful God.”, </em></strong>Ray Comfort. And so was Peter’s and so should us. This is the faith that is not comfortable with the normal territories; it’s faith in action complimenting God. It’s his faith finding an open heart seeking to please God, making His name great.\r\n\r\nTo not have faith in God is to show He is not able and cannot be trusted to perform what He has promised, what an insult and that is sin, <strong>Romans 14:23, “…for whatever is not from faith is sin”</strong>. God has given us an awesome challenge to respond to. <strong>Jeremiah 33:2-3 “2Thus says the LORD who made it, the LORD who formed it to establish it (the LORD <em>is</em> His name): 3 ‘Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.</strong>” Only those who have daring faith dare to respond to God’s challenge. There are three responders to this challenge, The <strong>Jawbones</strong> - they are talkers but no action, they make promises to one day respond to the challenge and never does. Then you have the <strong>Wishbones -</strong> the wishing ones, always wishing something would happen but never stepping out by faith. Then we have the <strong>Backbones</strong> - the ones who respond to the challenge, call on God and step out by faith. I want to be a backbone, I have chickened out of things I should have been trusting God to bring because I wanted to be on the safe grounds. Safe grounds did not demand much (prayer, faith, fasting). And I feel I have robbed God of the glory He could have gained if I only had the faith to operate in the unfamiliar territories. This is the prime product, the benefits are results from trust, the bible says, “<strong>God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him</strong>” <strong>Hebrews 11:6.</strong>\r\n\r\nTwo greatest things I have come across that the disciples ever requested of the Lord, <strong>1. Teach us to pray</strong>, <strong>Luke 11:1</strong> and 2. <strong>Lord increase our faith, Luke 17:5</strong>. To have asked for these two, they may have been tired of operating on the familiar and desired more, more of what the Lord had for them. They did not ask to be taught to preach, to relate, to even perform miracles. What are you asking of the Lord? You cannot pray without faith and you cannot have faith and not pray. In 2009 God performed a miracle, a plane with 155 passengers on board safely landed on Hudson River with no life lost. The plane did not even sink. The Lord used this incident among others to increase my faith before. He proved He is able to do even greater things. I am done with breadcrumbs faith; I am going for the whole bread, what He has promised. I have things I am trusting God for this year and I am believing God for daring faith, hope you join me.

              "<strong>James 1:4&amp;5, \"But let patience have it's perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all men liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him\"</strong>\r\n\r\nNearly everyone struggles with <strong>patience. The more I walk with the Lord the more I learn that God is not in a hurry. </strong>Read about delivering the Israelites, raising David, Joseph, Paul, Abraham etc. and you will see this trend with God. If God was not patient with us, we would all be gone tomorrow.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Patience is awaiting God's timing without doubting His love and ability to do something</strong>. <strong>Patience is not caught or taught in classrooms, it’s learnt and mastered in the sea of life</strong>. I struggled with this for years but then by God’s grace I began to master it as the life itself taught me how to live it. I’m still learning. People can be patient if they know how long it will take and what it will take, but can we be patient if we have no clue as to when and how? You can tell the impatient by what is coming out of their mouths, <strong>Luke 6:45, \"...of the abundance of the heart, the mouth does speak\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe text given tells us to “<strong>let patience have it's perfect work”</strong>, you cannot hurry patience and/or dictate it. By itself it can do what needs to be done. The bible says that patience is one of the fruit of the spirit. If you are lacking patience in your life, you are missing one of the most important fruit. Patience brings about good when allowed to perform a surgery. It will do its own tests, discover the weakness and allow certain things to come our way to make us wait longer and the more we wait the more our attitude is adjusted. Patient people are never frustrated when things don't go right. They are not fast to draw conclusions.\r\n\r\nPatience will perfect and complete you lacking nothing only if you allow it to do so. Good illustration, when people fly, it reaches a time they are informed of the landing. The passengers begin to prep themselves for landing. Sometimes the pilot may announce a delay for reasons like weather, planes taking off or other things that bring about hold. You should see some people's faces before they start to complain, murmur. Does this sound familiar? Some may ask if the plane has enough fuel to stay in the air (on hold) and the truth, the airlines project such delays and grace themselves with enough fuel to put them on hold position\r\n\r\nI want us to know that if <strong>God puts us on hold position, He has filled us with enough fuel (grace) to keep us in hold position</strong>. The <strong>landing is not denied, only delayed </strong>for our own good. No need to be frustrated because you don't have what you requested, your patience is required for safe landing. Walking with Christ requires patience, <strong>Hebrews 12:1&amp;2 \"...let us run with patience the race set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the perfector of our faith\"</strong>. This goes even for calling into ministry, as you wait patiently for His time, you will learn more patience even to deal with people when the door for ministry opens. I was led into ministry 5years after I became a believer. It was not easy to wait but I had enough fuel to put me on hold position and when I landed, my runway had been cleared. I am still allowing patience to do it's perfect work in me.\r\n\r\nNow if you lack wisdom on how to be <strong>patient, ask the Lord “who gives to all men wisdom liberally and without approach, and it will be given to you”</strong>. You pray for patience you are asking for something you don't know for in the next few hours, you may hit the heaviest traffic that will test your patience. That friend, workmate or boss will really test your patience. Don't crush your plane simply because you were not allowed to land in your time, know that God will equip you with enough grace to<strong> PUT YOU ON HOLD POSITION</strong>. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Genesis 13: 1 – 4 “So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him. Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold. From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the LORD.”</strong>\r\n\r\nAre you content with what God has given you? Solomon wrote, “<strong>Death and Destruction are never satisfied, and neither are the eyes of man</strong>”, <strong>Proverbs 27:20.</strong> <!--more-->There is something about the majority of us that always wants more than God has given us. Let me ask you another question, when do you seek God most? Is it when things are going smooth or when things are not going so well? Many seek God when they are not content with the way things are going in their lives. Are we not to seek God at all times, even during times of contentment?\r\n\r\nThe great prophet Abram (Abraham) is called by God to take all of his things, and his family and to journey to a place that God would show him. Abraham obeys God, leaves all that is familiar to him, and starts on his journey to “God knows where.” When he arrives at a place between Bethel and Ai he builds an altar and calls upon the name of the Lord. Although Abram was rich in cattle, gold and silver, he didn’t choke on the blessing God gave him. Why not?\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Abram was content</strong>. Abram didn’t try to fight God’s call, but rather took up his household and lived a nomadic lifestyle in his obedience to God. He didn’t go on a journey for more of what he “wanted,” but rather more of what God wanted for him. Paul wrote that “<strong><em>godliness with contentment is great gain</em></strong>” (<strong>1Timothy 6:6).</strong> Are you one that is content, or always wanting for more of what God is not calling you to? Are you content with what God has given you, in your job, your home, your friends, your family, your appearance, or do you yearn for more.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Abram built an altar</strong>. What comes to mind when you hear the word altar. Perhaps words like sacrifice, sacred, special, offering, incense, prayer, are some of those words. An altar was a place designed for worship. Pagans set up their altars to worship their false gods many times made of wood and stone. God designed humanity to be worshipers, the only question remains is who or what will one seek to worship. Whatever the case, man will build an altar of worship either with his hands or his mind. Where is your altar, where is the place that you seek God? No one built the altar for Abram, he built it and so should you establish a place whereby you seek God daily. The New Testament refers to the prayer closet as the place to seek Him. When two people are going to meet they establish a meeting place. Where is your established meeting place with God? If you don’t have a place, establish one today, as a sacred meeting place between you and God.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Abram called upon God</strong>. Abram didn’t allow his wealth to hinder his worship. It’s not enough to build an altar; one must meet with God there. Do you meet with God daily at the altar, in the prayer closet? Prayer is a conversation between two people that love each other –you and God. Do you daily meet with God in prayer and read His word, because He is the Word (<strong>John 1</strong>)? Some never bother to “pick up the phone” to even call God, or if they do, it is a one-sided conversation. What has God been saying to you lately? If you’re drawing a blank, then perhaps you have not been calling upon His name and listening to His response as Abram did. If so are you content with that? <strong><em>If God has blessed you, don’t choke on the blessing. Be content, build an altar, and call upon God there.</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Numbers 11:3–34. “33 But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague. 34 Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved other food” </strong>\r\n\r\nOne might not imagine something as seemingly minute as a lack of contentment to have a great impact. However when Israel was in the desert having come out of Egypt, it wasn’t too long before Israel would choke on the blessing that God gave to them through their discontentment. <!--more-->Although they had an all-you-can-eat manna buffet in the middle of the wilderness provided by God, they were not happy. “<strong>4 The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, “<em>If only we had meat to eat</em>! 5 We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic. 6 But now <em>we have lost our appetite</em>; <em>we never see anything but this manna!</em>”</strong> They never saw anything is right! They didn’t see God’s provision, God’s protection, God’s guidance, and God’s grace, although God did set a table for them in the desert. How will you keep from choking on the blessing?\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Don’t lose your appetite</strong>. The Israelites physically lost their appetite, because they were not focused on the Lord’s provision. Some however loose their appetite spiritually as well. Some stop seeking God and the good things He is giving them. The Psalmist wrote, “<strong>Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him”,</strong> <strong>Psalm 34:8.</strong> Israel didn’t take refuge in God’s blessing after all, where are to “TASTE” and “SEE” that the Lord IS GOOD, not that He might be good, or that He is good for some and not for others, but for all. How is your spiritual appetite been lately?\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Appreciate and partake in God’s blessing</strong>. There was plenty of manna to go around for everyone. The rabble (non-Israelites) that came out of Egypt benefited by Israel’s relationship with God too. Instead of being grateful, Israel complained about what they didn’t have rather than appreciate what they did have. They had miraculous manna, but craved meat. Do you appreciate what God has given you, or do you want something else? Many want the bigger, better, latest, and top of the line, because <strong>“Death and Destruction are never satisfied, and neither are the eyes of man.”</strong> If God has given you your home, job, spouse, children, finances, abilities, spiritual gifts, personality, material goods, one must first be thankful, because He can take it all away if He desired. Job had it all, and then for a time everything was taken away.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Fear the Lord</strong>. God sent the meat, quail, because he was fed up with the complaining of the Israelites. <strong>Psalm 34:9</strong> reads<strong>“Fear the LORD, you His saints, for those who fear Him lack nothing<em>.” </em></strong> The Israelites thought they were lacking, but really their needs, not their “greeds” were provided for. God is a Father that provides. Again God can take everything away should He so desire as He did to Job. What Israel craved is meat they anticipated to bring satisfaction to their coveting hearts, but it actually brought death. “<strong>While the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed”</strong>, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.” All those who died also left behind relationships with friends and family that were affected by their lust for meat. If they would have walked in the fear of the Lord they would have lacked nothing. <strong>Psalm 84:11</strong> reads, “<strong>For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.”</strong>\r\n\r\nDon’t lose your appetite for the things God has given you. Appreciate and partake of His blessings. Fear the Lord, and see that you will lack nothing, nor with God withhold any good thing He has for you. <strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Luke 15:11-12, “Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them. Lk 15:13 “Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.” </strong>\r\n\r\nIn this series, “Don’t choke on the blessing,” we have looked at how Abram didn’t choke on the blessing, but how the children of Israel did. Now let’s take a look at perhaps the most famous parable ever, the prodigal son.<!--more--> In this parable (which is an earthly story with a heavenly meaning) two sons are both awaiting the inheritance that would one day be given to them. The prodigal son choked on his blessing for many reasons.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Immediate self gratification “give me my share of the estate\": </strong>The prodigal son was going to receive his inheritance, but it was not initially intended to be given at the time of his asking. He would have been given one-third of his father’s estate at his father’s death, but he had to have it now! Isn’t that just like many of us, we want what we want now? We want certain things before the time in which God gives it to us. How many have premarital sex prior to God giving one their spouse to walk down the aisle together in God’s sight. When we want it now, chances are our motive are selfish in nature and the first cough or gag is beginning to manifest. In what ways do you seek immediate self gratification?\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Desiring riches over relationship “the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country:”</strong> The younger son also, desired his riches now over his relationship with his father. Again, traditionally he would receive his inheritance after his father’s death. When the father gave him his inheritance early, the younger son left his father, almost treating his father as if he were now dead. Wasn’t his relationship with his father valuable? He displayed a disregard for his father’s authority in his life. Sometimes we are so busy chasing after other things that we “forget” to chase after God. In what ways do we sometimes show disregard for God’s authority, like the younger son in the story? God created us to live in relationship, not as islands unto ourselves.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>The freedom factor “and there [he] squandered his wealth in wild living:”</strong> The younger son was now free of his father’s authority. He had freedom to do what he wanted, when he wanted. He would go where he wanted, be with whom he wanted, say what he wanted, etc… What happens when God gives people freedom to make their own choices? The prodigal son used the freedom he had to get himself into a jam. Many feel that if they had more money, they would be better off. However it wasn’t until the son lost it all that he humbled himself, and ran home, back to the father. He said to himself, “<strong>I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.</strong>” Why do hard times often bring people to repentance? The famous story is told about the little train that wanted freedom from the tracts he was confined to. Therefore he jumped off the tracts to his freedom, and was no longer “limited” on the confining tracks. However he could no longer travel anywhere because his designer built him to have mobility only on the tracks. Did he really get the freedom he was after? The younger son too, ended up not in freedom, but in bondage, until he came to a place of repentance.\r\n\r\nLet’s not choke on our blessing because of our desire of immediate self gratification, desiring riches over relationship, the greatly misunderstood freedom factor. Thank God for your blessings but don’t rush things, appreciate your relationships, and don’t buy into the false freedom Satan offers.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Luke 15:28–30 “28 The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIn Don’t Choke on the Blessing part 3, we looked at the younger son and how he choked on the blessing given to him. He eventually came to his senses, humbled himself, and repented to God and his father. However, another character in the same parable upon seeing the younger son repent also choked on the blessing. That’s right, the older son too choked on the blessing,<!--more--> although he didn’t take his inheritance and squander it, his heart toward his father was not right. How did he choke on his blessing?\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Comparisons produce winners and losers: ”‘</strong>…<strong>I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders… But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him?”</strong> I love sports and the competition involved. However in families when there is competition and comparison, a dividing line is established. The older compared his loyalty to his brothers’ disloyalty toward the father. He was accurate in what he said, but he was not right in the attitude of which he said it. When we say look at how great I am, and what a loser this other person is, we’ve established the winner and the loser in life which is NOT a game. Imagine if Mary would have said to her other children, “<em>Why can’t you be perfect like your brother Jesus?” </em> With Satan trying so hard to destroy the family, why should we play according to his tune? Satan almost destroyed the younger son in the parable, but the older brother didn’t care about him, only himself. If he wanted accolades then he should have allowed his father to say them. <strong>Proverbs 27:2 says, “Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips.”</strong>\r\n\r\n2. <b>Attitude is everything!: </b>\"<strong>I’ve been slaving for you … never gave me … this son of yours.” </strong> I’ve heard it said that life is ten percent of what happens to you and ninety percent of how you respond to it. The older brother should have had his younger brother’s back. The younger brother could have been sick in a hospital, or even dead, but he was alive and had returned. The older brother didn’t contemplate any of those things, only that “this son of his father’s,” as he put it, lost it all while his father celebrated his homecoming. The older brother would one day receive two-thirds of his father’s estate as his own inheritance, but he wanted some recognition now! He was a hard worker, with a loving father, all his needs were provided for, and his brother was not dead, but alive and back to talk about his “frivolous adventure.” Paul wrote about how our attitudes should be when he penned the words in <strong>Philippians 2:5-7, “5 Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:</strong> <strong>Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.”</strong> The older brother hardly had such an attitude. Our attitudes determines a lot. Jesus was God, yet became a servant. We are not God, yet we don’t have the attitude Christ displayed.\r\n\r\nHave you been playing the comparison games? Does your attitude need maintenance today, if so humble bring it in to God’s presence and have it worked on. Don’t choke on the blessing God has given you.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Genesis 26:18, “And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. He called them by the names which his father had called them”</strong>\r\n\r\nHave you ever been frustrated that the Gospel that you hear preached is not the Gospel According to Jesus Christ? Have you ever asked yourself, if the Gospel you hold to is the saving, biblical Gospel that Jesus preached? It seems that in our day and age (although it is really not a new thing) the Gospel message has been vastly compromised in pulpits across our country and our world.<!--more--> Many have taken the pure, unadulterated Gospel, and attempted to put sinful humanities rendition of the Gospel on display. Dare I say many have attempted to cover the genuine Gospel, with man-made, man – centered unbiblical, dirt and filth and yet have proclaimed that it too was indeed the Gospel. No it is not!\r\n\r\nI recently ran across a passage in the Old Testament in <strong>Genesis 26</strong> that spoke of the wells that Abraham dug to help sustain life to people that needed the water to live as one of life’s basic human needs. Can you imagine perhaps this being the most precious commodity in the desert where Abraham dwelt? John MacArthur points out, “<em>Plugging someone’s well was ruinous to them and constituted serious aggression, often leading to war</em>.” This was a serious thing the Philistines (which were the enemy of God’s people) did toward the Israelites. Isaac came upon these same wells years later and could have retaliated, and attempted to come against the Philistines, but yet he didn’t take that path. He dug up the wells which were covered by dirt from the enemy. Now once again the water could flow, unstopped by man’s devices, unhindered by the enemy, and unadulterated by those that would have preferred to see God’s people defeated. But no, this was not the plan that God was going to bring forth. He dug, and the precious water could flow once again, giving life to all those that would partake of it’ life giving sustenance and refreshment.\r\n\r\nMany under the guise of Christianity have put their man-made doctrinal dirt on the well which contains the living water of Jesus Christ. Many have bought into Christ-less Christianity which includes: Christ-less conversion, Christ-less discipleship, Christ-less evangelism, Christ-less worship, Christ-less prayer, and Christ-less fellowship. The terms, sin, righteousness, repentance, has been replaced with more acceptable non-offensive (yet unbiblical terms). Paul in <strong>2Timothy 4:16</strong>, warns “<strong>Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.” </strong>Those that drink from the living water will experience what Jesus promised. <strong>“If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. 38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.” 39 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:37-39)</strong>.” The Holy Spirit will flow forth from a vessel that is not covered up by the unbiblical doctrinal dirt, but from a vessel that has tasted and seen that the Lord is good by realizing that after one repents God can save the worst of sinners, for His own glory.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you know some that have an unbiblical worldview and you clearly see the ungodly dirt of the enemy upon their lives. Then it is time to uncover the dirt by taking them through the Law of God, and once humbled, share the precious living water of Christ with them. Biblical evangelism is Law to the proud and grace to the humble. For more information on this please check out <a href=\"http://www.soulfishingministries.org/\">www.soulfishingministries.org</a>.

              "<strong>Psalm 86:11, “Teach me Your way, O Lord; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name.”</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen a lion tamer goes into a cage with a lion, he brings his trusty stool with him. Most think of the whip in hand and forget about the importance of the stool. Why a stool, good question. When the stool is extended toward the lion with the legs facing the lion, the lion tries to look intently at all four legs of the stool at once and it causes the lion to become dizzy and therefore tames it. Perhaps it would be more fitting to call the stool the lion tamer than the man holding the stool.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJust as the fierce and mighty king of the jungle can be tamed by focusing on all four legs at once, so too can the Christian be “tamed” by focusing on too many things at once causing one’s mind to become boggled just like the lion’s. This is what I believe that the Psalmist was feeling when he cried out to God in his writing <strong>“Teach me Your way O Lord; I will walk in Your truth: unite my heart to fear your name</strong>.” What are the four most important priorities in your life? Perhaps your four are in the following list: family, work/school, finances, ministry, exercise, friends/relationships, hobbies, etc…. Now is God the focal point all of your priorities? In <strong>Psalm 88:11,</strong> the writer gives us insight into how to not live in so many directions at once, but how to live with SINGLENESS OF HEART.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Teach me your way O Lord: </strong>Realize that God has a way about Him just like you have a way about you. <strong>Isaiah 55:8,9</strong> reads, “<strong>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, says the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways…”</strong>When we handle our priorities in God’s way, He will be the center of those priorities because they will revolve around Him just as the earth revolves around the sun as it rotates on its axis. God desires that we learn His way of doing our priorities. God’s ways are found in His Word, in prayer consistent with His Word, and through the advice of mature believers that live consistent to God’s Word.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. I will walk in your truth: </strong>First one must learn God’s way, then one can walk in the way of truth. This is the step or appropriating God’s way, actually doing in practical ways in your life. When God is central then His way in your life will be central, thus appropriating His way in your life will cause your way to be aligned with His and you will walk in His truth. Jesus said, “…<strong>If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. Thenyou shall know the truth, and the truth [you practice] shall make you free</strong>.\" James instructs us, “<strong>But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves</strong>.”\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Unite my heart to fear your name: </strong>John Bevere wrote, “<em>One will submit to and serve whatever one fear</em>.” The heart cry of the Psalmist is to have his divided heart united and submit to the Lord by fearing His name. His name is Lord, which is to say He is in control, and deserves to be in control of your life. Abraham tested to see if he had a divided heart or a united heart when he was commanded to offer Isaac on the altar. God tested Abraham on the very blessing (Isaac) that God gave him and Abraham showed his love for God outweighed his love for his son. “<strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom</strong>…”\r\n\r\nLive with singleness of heart unto God learning His way, doing His way, and Fearing Him so your life will be aligned with His will. God will never let your down.\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>1Samuel 30:1-31, “26 Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe story of David always fascinates me; he was no strangers to hardship. He had a call of God in his life; it took years of learning experience in the sea of life as he waited for the promise. He depended on God, knowing God was in control in good and bad times. His experience shaped his character, kept him humble, and taught him how to be generous.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, we see how David came home with his men only to find the Amalekites had invaded their camp capturing their wives, children, possessions then burnt the place down. David and his men lifted up their voices and wept until there was no more strength left in them. As David’s men conspired to stone him, vs. “6<strong> … But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God”, </strong>I believe that when he encouraged himself in the Lord, he gathered strength and generously encouraged his men too. But that’s not the end of it. They then inquired of the Lord if they should pursue the enemies; the Lord gave them a green light. David and his 600 men left for battle, on the way, 200 men got weary and exhausted and were left behind. He continued with 400 men knowing that the victory was not in the number but in God. So they get there and destroy their enemies, <strong>vs. 18-20, “18 So David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives. 19 And nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything which they had taken from them; David recovered all. 20 Then David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those other livestock, and said, “This is David’s spoil.”</strong>\r\n\r\nDavid received double for his trouble. They were restored each man his family and possession and much more. As they travelled back to meet with the 200 who were left behind, his 400 men did not want to share the much more (spoils) with them. They were willing to give them back their wives, children and possessions but they were not willing to be generous with the spoils. Here is what the bible called them,<strong> vs. “22 … all the wicked and worthless men ….</strong>” They failed to understand that it was the Lord who blessed them and not their strength. And they were the first ones on the blessings however that did not mean they were to keep all the blessings to themselves. The Lord blesses us each differently not that we can accumulate blessings to ourselves; he blesses us so that we may be a blessing to others. In Africa we have what we call the HARAMBEE spirit, which means togetherness. That even if you are able to meet a need by yourself, the family, and community rally around you and generously blesses you.\r\n\r\nNot only did David generously bless the other 200 men, he blessed others beyond his territory. Vs. “<strong>26 Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD” … </strong>read the remainder of the chapter and you will see.\r\n\r\nGenerosity knows no bound, it’s not dictated by actions, it’s driven by kindness. It becomes harder when you look back at the battles you faced, trying moments others may have not gone through. Remember David could have kept everything to himself because of all his trouble, nevertheless he realized he was the first on the blessing, God allowed him to get there first for a reason despite the trouble. This is not a blessing to those who deserve it; it’s a blessing for those in need. Not all men battled but all received generously. Generosity is not a waste neither is it a loss. “<em>What will make Jesus more valuable is when because of how precious He is to us that we sacrifice to the good of others so that it looks to them like we have a treasure somewhere else than in the stuff</em><strong>”, </strong>John Piper, I pray that we will shine for the Lord by how generous we are to the need of others.

              "<strong>Matthew 13:24-25, “24 Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; 25 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way</strong>.”\r\n\r\nIn our month of prayer and fasting, it is beneficial to address three areas that affect the spheres of our prayer lives 1<strong>. THE REASON TO PRAY, 2. THE POWER TO PRAY, 3.THE HOW TO PRAY.</strong> We start with <strong>The Reason To Pray.<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nThe enemy has one mission, to keep believers asleep. To paralyze, disable, disarm and what better tool to use but sleep. It was Keith Green who wrote a song, “<em>Believers are asleep in the light while the lost are asleep in the dark</em>”.\r\n\r\nAsleep is the state of not being alert enough to function or operate properly. It’s in sleepiness that we become sluggish, lukewarm, weary from spiritual duties; we neglect our duties as men. “<em>Satan ruins men by flattering them into a good opinion of their own safety, and so bringing them to mind nothing, and fear nothing; and then he robs them of their strength and honor, and leads them captive at his will, when we sleep our spiritual enemies do not</em>.”, Matthew Henry. It’s in sleeping that the enemy plants weeds (fear, doubt, anger, lustful thoughts, resentments etc). It’s when men are asleep that the enemy takes full control, planting tares. Look at what Delilah did to Samson to take away his strength, <strong> Judges 16:19, “Then she lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him”. </strong>The tragedy of a believer is to lay his head on the lap of the Delilah’s of this world and fall asleep.\r\n\r\nA person in a deep sleep is not aware of the time, or what is happening. He could be slain and not fight back. The enemy has shaved off your locks of Prayers, Reading of the word, being the man of God in your homes, honoring your wife, discipling your children, reaching the lost, strength to overcome sin, hunger for righteousness. Now you are left with no strength.\r\n\r\nJesus told His disciples, <strong>Mark 14:38, “Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. …”,</strong> Those who are awake cannot be easily destroyed. When Jesus knew His time for crucifixion was getting nearer, He began to prepare His disciples for the things that were coming a head of them. The very best was to tell Peter to be ready as the devil had desired to sift him and to assure him of His prayers for him. This was not just for Peter but for the rest of the disciples too. He had already warned them Peter in particular that an egregious trial was imminent. Sadly, that warning as well as His imploring them to pray went unheeded. It did not burden them to do something about it. Those who are troubled don’t fall asleep. Those who are troubled will be in vertical position rather than horizontal position. They understand that it’s time to watch and pray.\r\n\r\nWhen I read the passage in <strong>Luke 22</strong>, I see a collective of things in their lives threatened the reason they needed to pray. If the Master was arrested as He would, 1. Their faith would be shaken to the point of denying Christ, they needed to pray. 2. Their unity was going to be in jeopardy. You take away the shepherd, the sheep scatter; 3. Their prayer time would keep them solid in God’s will even in the midst of the trial ahead of them. 4. They needed to pray to be strong.\r\n\r\nAt the garden of Gethsemane, what did he find them doing when He came back from praying Himself? He found them fast asleep instead of watching and praying to evade becoming vulnerable to the enemy’s prey<strong>. Luke 22:45-46, “45 When He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow. 46 Then He said to them, “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe battle a threefold enemy: the world, the flesh and the devil. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, <strong>1John 2:16.</strong> What is our hope? Be strengthened by these verses and pray, <strong>1Thessalonians 5:6, “Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober”; </strong><strong>1Peter 1:13, “Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober; 1Peter 5:8, “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour</strong>”.\r\n\r\nWhen men don’t pray, the enemy will prey. Like a soldier in the battle field, the enemy wants to cut our communication line with headquarters. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 13:24-25, “24 Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; 25 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn Part 1 I mentioned that there are three spheres that affect our prayer lives 1<strong>. THE REASONS TO PRAY, 2. THE POWER TO PRAY, and 3.THE HOW TO PRAY.</strong> We shared on <strong>The Reasons To Pray</strong>. Let’s look at another area <strong>The Power To pray.<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s one thing to pray, it’s another thing to pray with power. <strong>Ephesians 3:20</strong>, reads, “<strong>Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.”</strong> God does things according to His power that works within us. The will and the desire comes from Him, <strong>Philippians 2:13, “for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.”</strong> It is the power that overcomes <strong>1John 5:4, “For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith”</strong>\r\n\r\nThink of <strong>2Corinthians 4:7</strong> that reads,” <strong>But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us” (NIV).</strong> God could have stored His treasure in golden vessels but He chose not to. He placed treasure in vessels of clay that breaks and can be replaced. He did because in these vessels are His power seen and there He glorifies Himself. And this is to show that the power is not of us but His. Jesus glorified His Father more than anyone else. I believe He could only do it best here on earth through submission to God the Father and displaying it to the whole world. One of the greatest things we observe about Christ is His prayer life, totally depending on the Holy Spirit power to endure. The gospel according to Luke makes it more clear than any of the other gospels.\r\n\r\nNot only does Christ demonstrate the power to pray, we see the same with the disciples and some of the men God has used down through the ages. They would all testify that it was according to the power of God working in them that they could pray with such power and expect God to move. Read some of their quotes “<em>You can do more than pray after you've prayed, but you cannot do more than pray until you have prayed</em>”, John Bunyan. ; “<em>Prayer is the greatest of all forces, because it honors God and brings him into active aid”</em>, E.M. Bounds; “<em>Only turning God's house into a house of fervent prayer will reverse the power of evil so evident in the world today</em>”, Jim Cymbala. “<em>He who knows how to overcome with God in prayer has heaven and earth at his disposal</em>”, C. S. Spurgeon. “<em>God uses prayer to educate His people and to produce holiness of character in them”</em>, Harold Lindsell; \"<em>No man - I don't care how colossal his intellect - No man is greater than his prayer life.</em>\", Leonard Ravenhill; \"<em>God does nothing except in response to believing prayer.</em>\" John Wesley (Famous evangelist who spent 2 hours daily in prayer), “<em>No preacher can reap on the pulpit what he has not plowed in the closet</em>”, C. S. Spurgeon\r\n\r\nAnd this quote also continues to bless my heart because it’s the heart of prayers by great missionary to China Hudson Taylor, who said, \"<em>The prayer power has never been tried to its full capacity. If we want to see Divine power wrought in the place of weakness, failure, and disappointment, let us answer God's standing challenge, Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know</em>”,<strong> Jeremiah 33:3</strong>\r\n\r\nAll these is possible when the Holy Spirit resides within us and empowers us to pray as He prays for us and through us too. <strong>Romans 8:26-27, “26 Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 27 Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God”. </strong>Therefore prayer power is not about ABILITY, it’s about AVAILABILITY. God will take care of the ability according to His power that works within us if we are available.

              "<strong>Matthew 13:24-25, “24 Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; 25 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the last message, I mentioned that there are three spheres that affect our prayer lives 1<strong>. THE REASON TO PRAY, 2. THE POWER TO PRAY, 3.THE HOW TO PRAY.</strong> We shared on the first two, we finish with the last but not least <strong>The How To Pray.<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nRight from the start, I want to point out that Prayer is not primarily a means to get us stuff, things. Prayer is a means to get believers be conformed to the image of Christ. <strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>. <strong>“</strong><em>Prayer is the greatest of all forces, it honors God and brings Him into active aid”, </em>E.M. Bounds<em>.</em> “<em>The priority of prayer in Jesus life, the great majority of His words dealt with one thing, a passion for God to be glorified throughout the world</em><strong><em>”, </em></strong>Paul Washer<strong><em>. </em></strong>Prayer is about <strong>PASSION</strong>, zeal, drive, hunger, burden to make God’s <strong>NAME GREAT (GLORY OF GOD)</strong> and <strong>ADVANCE</strong> His <strong>KINGDOM</strong> and not ours.\r\n\r\nThen how to we honor God and be conformed in our prayers? We first look how the disciples who had watched their Master’s prayer life asked Him to teach them to pray. <strong>Luke 11:1, “One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”</strong> They never asked Jesus to teach them to preach or perform miracles, they asked be taught how to pray and Jesus gave them what is commonly called “the Lord’s prayer” which in actuality is the “Disciples Prayer”. This would not be their daily prayer to be recited but a model, a structure, a guideline, a skeleton, the backbone by which effective power prayer would be. Sadly enough, many believers have never taken time to utilize God given guidance to praying effectively. I tackle on the blog this subject extensively in the Series “<strong>Lord Teach Us To Pray</strong>”, however allow me to do a drive through on how to utilize it.\r\n\r\n<strong>OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN,</strong> - We acknowledge who God is, our relationship and His dwelling place.\r\n\r\n<strong>HALLOWED BE THY NAME</strong>, - We ascribe His name and greatness (the desire to make His name great, magnifying His name)\r\n\r\n<strong>THY KINGDOM COME</strong>, - Our only one reason is to advance His kingdom, <strong>Romans 14:17, Colossians 3, Psalm 89:14, Ephesians 1:17</strong>-. Bringing Glory to His name by living in the light of His kingdom.\r\n\r\n<b>THY WILL BE DONE IN EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN</b> – Our desire is to completely yield to God in obedience, to His leading. When your will is in conflict with His will, you abandon your will and yield to His<strong>, Psalm 40:8, Psalm 143:10</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD</strong> –Our greatest desire is a hunger for the word <b>Job 23:12,</b> Desire the word <b>1Peter 2:2,</b> study the word <b>2Timothy 2:15</b>, hide His word, <b>Psalm 119:11,</b> let his word lead you <b>Psalm 119:105</b>. When this becomes our priority, God will add to us the other needs we have.\r\n\r\n<strong>AND FORGIVES US OUR DEBTS AS WE FORGIVE OUR DEBTORS</strong>, - Craving to be made whole (sanctification) and as we are sanctified, that we become to our brothers who Christ is to us by forgiving and being forgiven.\r\n\r\n<strong>AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION</strong>, - Temptations/trials serve God’s sovereign purposes, it reveals what we are made off. They are part of our pruning and education. <strong>1Corinthians 10:13</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL</strong>. - <strong>James 4:7-8, “ Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. 8 Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded; </strong> <strong>2Corinthians 10:4</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM, AND THE POWER, AND THE GLORY, FOR EVER. AMEN (KJV)</strong> It begins with God and ends with God for His glory. God is the glorious end. “<em>God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him</em>”, Pastor John Piper\r\n\r\nKnow the reason to pray, the power to pray and how to pray then let us pray for our spiritual growth, families, our church leaders, congregation, nation, city, jobs, persecuted church…\r\n\r\n“<em>What a friend we have in Jesus, All our sins and grief’s to bear! What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer! Oh, what peace we often forfeit, oh what needless pain we bear, All because we do not carry, everything to God in prayer!</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged, Take it to the Lord in prayer: Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our sorrows share? Jesus Knows our every weakness, Take it to the Lord in prayer.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Are we weak and heavy laden, Cumbered with a load of care? Precious Savior, still our refuge; Take it to the Lord in prayer: Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? Take it to the Lord in prayer; In His arms He'll take and shield thee; Thou wilt find a solace there.</em>\r\n\r\nMay we not fall asleep in this crucial hour when we have all the tools we need at our disposal.\r\nBlessings Ev"

              "<strong>“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done”, (Matthew 22:40-46, Matthew 26:36-46; Mark 14:32-42) </strong>\r\n\r\nCan you imagine having a job of tasting wine for a king? This was actually a very high profile job in biblical times. The cupbearer was one who tasted and served wine to the king. Ancient kings had to be very cautious about what they ate and drank. They used trusted servants to taste everything before they consumed it. <!--more-->If the servant lived or did not get sick, the king and queen then ate or drank. The “chief butler” in the Joseph account (<strong>Genesis 40</strong>) headed the king’s cupbearers. Nehemiah held this highly trusted position under King Artaxerxes (<strong>Nehemiah 1:11</strong>), influencing the king politically. King Solomon also employed cupbearers (<strong>1Kings 10:5). </strong>In modern times there are tests scientists and pharmacists can run to discover if something contains poison. One man had sole responsibility of being the one to test if the king’s wine was poisonous or palatable. This was a position of great trust I would imagine as the cupbearer may be killed in the service to the king. I am sure there were conspirators who attempted to take the life of the king through poisoning the wine. The trusted cupbearer would be the one to discover the true contents of the wine even at the cost of his very life. The cupbearer then was a high court official, one that was close to the king and having the trust of the king. The cupbearer would also sit at the right hand of the king. The cupbearer had to have the king’s best interest in mind, and not his own. This would be likened to the President’s bodyguard. The bodyguard, the cupbearer, may have to give his life for the sake of the king.\r\n\r\nAt the Last Supper, Jesus took the cup and said, “…<strong>Take this cup and drink from it all of you. This is the cup of the New Covenant, which is shed for you and for all</strong>.”\r\n\r\nIn the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus said, <strong>(Matt 22:40-46 pp—;Mt 26:36-46; Mk 14:32-42) Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done</strong>.” Please meditate on this in your mind and spirit. Jesus Christ was ultimate cupbearer and yet the King simultaneously. The cupbearers throughout the Scriptures sat in the high, noble, and trustworthy position at the right hand of the king and placed their lives on the line for the King. Here in the New Testament Jesus Christ is the cupbearer that places His life on the line as the King of Kings (in His humanity) that God’s wrath might not come upon you and I. Christ submitted to the will of His Father and now sits at the right hand of His Father. Jesus was reminding the disciples that He would soon fulfill the ultimate role of the cupbearer.\r\n\r\nThis is why Paul makes such a big deal about the manner in which one takes communion. The cupbearer Jesus Christ, willingly, lay his life down for you (see <strong>1Corinthians 11:27–33),</strong> lest one dare partake in His sacrifice in an unworthy manner. When you partake in communion, realize that in doing so it is not just some religious ritual, but a remembrance of what Christ did in the past, is doing in the present, and will do in the future, because He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\r\n\r\nThank the Lord today, and daily for even having the opportunity to partake in communion together. To continue, Blessings by Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Mark 10:38 –40, “38 But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”39 They said to Him, “We are able.” So Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the baptism I am baptized with you will be baptized; 40 but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it is prepared.”</strong>\r\n\r\nHave you ever asked a question to someone, but because of your lack of maturity and understanding, you came to receive an answer which exhibited, you really did not think through the whole question itself?<!--more--> Children are famous for this kind of questions. Picture a child asking his mother (who is not pregnant) “<em>mom I want you to have a child now, so to have someone to play catch with.”</em> The child doesn’t really know what he or she is asking. In <strong>Mark 10</strong> we read that James and John make a request to Jesus to sit on his right and left hand in Jesus’ Kingdom. John MacArthur shares, “<em>Matthew reveals that their mother accompanied them and spoke first (Matt. 20:20, 21), after which James and John reiterated her request. If she was Jesus’ aunt, the 3 undoubtedly hoped to capitalize on the family ties.” Jesus replies, “You know NOT what you ask: Are you ABLE to drink THE CUP that I DRINK…?</em> “\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Why would Jesus reply that they did not know what they were asking? What was the cup that Jesus said that He drinks? Jesus would drink the cup of sin-bearing death. The Expositor’s Bible commentary shares, “Jesus' answer is sharp and penetrating. The two disciples did not really know what they were asking. The way to privileged position in the Messianic kingdom is not by grabbing for power but by relinquishing it through suffering and death. Jesus explains this to them by using the analogies of the cup and baptism. The cup, symbolizing trouble and suffering, is found in the OT. \"</span><strong style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs\", (Psalm 75:8). </strong><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">\"</span><strong style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Rise up, O Jerusalem, you have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of his wrath, you who have drained to its dregs the goblet that makes men stagger\", (Isaiah 51:17; cf. also Mark 14:36; Jeremiah 49:12; Ezekiel 23:31-34).”</strong>\r\n\r\nNot understanding Jesus, they said to Him “<strong><em>We are able.”</em></strong> Jesus responds<strong>, ““You will indeed drink the cup that I drink…”</strong> If Jesus was the ultimate cup bearer then what cup would His disciples drink? In a sense they can and will drink from his cup of suffering. James would become the first apostolic martyr (<strong>Acts 12:2);</strong> and John would suffer exile on the Isle of Patmos, A.D. 63 (<strong>Revelation 1:9</strong>). Jesus is the ultimate cup bearer of course. However, He is calling those that are His to be willing to lay down their lives for Him. Laying down ones’ life is a daily process. If one cannot give Christ their time, talents, and treasures, how can one give one’s life for Him? In closing the words of a song by Christafari, <em>“He died for me, so I live for Him, he gave His life, for me, so I can give mine to Him, He became like me, so I can become like Him</em>.” How are you drinking the cup today? You may desire the cup be taken away, even as Jesus prayed, <strong>“…take this cup from me,”</strong> however will you pray like Jesus, “<strong>Not my will, but Thy will be done.”</strong> Realize as you pray “<strong>Thy will be done</strong>”, you must also pray, my will be gone. Do His will and see, God will never let you down. Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Psalm 118:17, \"I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of the LORD\"</strong>\r\n\r\nA question once asked, \"<em>Why are we here on earth?\",</em> someone responded, \"<strong>to live this life to the fullest</strong>\". I wouldn't say that is the reason why we are here primarily, that is <strong>what we do while we are here. </strong>God designed the earth, populated it and finally created man to fit into what He had created. God being a God of order did not create man on the first day. <strong>The chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever,</strong> that is the purpose He created us for. <strong>No one is here by accident but by the divine will of God</strong>. The question then you ask yourself, \"<em>if I am here, why I'm I here and how long am I going to be here?”,</em> <strong>Until what He had planned for me is fulfilled in my life</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Acts 14,</strong> Paul had been moving from city to city preaching the gospel. Many believed on the name of the Lord Jesus and were saved but there were some Jews who stirred up strife trying to confuse some of the Gentiles that believed. When this wasn't working as fast as they wanted it to work, they had an idea to get rid of Paul. One time they tried to stone him and Barnabas. When they learnt of it, they escaped from Iconium to Lystra and Derbe nevertheless they later followed them there. <strong>Acts 14:19-20, \"19 Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead. 20, \"But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city” (NIV). </strong>How would you react if you learnt that what God wanted to accomplish in you was in jeopardy? The life you held dear is threatened by challenges of life. You make an tempt to progress yet there is such a great opposition from people and situations, words stoning you, frustrations and fears stoning you. Paul was preaching GOOD NEWS, that did not exempt him from being stoned then left for dead.<strong> There was something God had invested and deposited in Paul that was not ready to be terminated yet</strong>. It looked like he was going down the drain, his life in danger, few friends and more enemies, not wanted in cities <strong>but his mission was not complete</strong>. When we understand what God has called us to do, come high water and hell, saints might be shaken but none of it will terminate the work God has started. Jesus was almost stoned to death, nothing could happen to Him because His time had not come. Paul's time had not come, therefore the stones couldn't kill him. When they dragged him out of the city supposing he was dead, he picked himself up and went back into the city. \"<strong>I AM STILL HERE</strong>\", you or anyone will not destroy what God has started, He finishes what He has started,<strong> Philippians 1:6, \"being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ\". </strong>Are you glad you are still here regardless of what you went through in your childhood and the last few painful episodes in your life?\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 118:17, \"I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of the LORD\", </strong>This scripture is for those like Paul who know the calling of God and the destiny in their lives. <strong>What you know about God in you will cause you to look the situation and be encouraged with these words, \"I shall not die, but live\", </strong>my faith in God will not die, my hope, my vision, my desire, my calling, my spirit, my destiny, will not die. I may be bruised and limp but the fact that I can still see these things at distance will keep me alive. <strong>You live because God started something in you.</strong> Pick yourself up where the enemy has left you to die, wipe off the dust, go back to the city and keep doing what the Lord called you to do, remember, \"YOU ARE STILL HERE\", That is your testimony, \"<strong>God is still on the throne</strong>. <strong>2Timothy 1:12, \"For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day\". </strong>Why still live?, \"<strong>TO DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD</strong>\". <strong>I live because He lives in me therefore I am still here until He is done with me</strong>. <strong>Deuteronomy 30:19, \"I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live;\", </strong>Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>1Thessalonians 5:16-18, \"16 Rejoice always, 17 pray without ceasing, 18 in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThese three verses are short, however they are weighty. If I was to write a paper on these three, I may end up with a book.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the few verses in <strong>1Thessalonians 5</strong>, I realize that many times we look at <strong>vs.18</strong> in reference to the will of God. That it's God's will that we give Him thanks in everything. Note that the bible does not say to give Him thanks \"FOR\". It's while we are \"IN\" it that we give thanks. <!--more-->Now look at vs. <strong>16</strong> and <strong>17</strong> how they are punctuated and see that there is more to it. The bible says, vs. <strong>\"16 Rejoice always, 17 pray without ceasing, 18 in everything give thanks\". </strong>If you ever struggle to know what the will of God is for your life, think on these three because I believe they are the foundation of knowing God's will and should not miss in a believer's life, <strong>1. Rejoice always 2. Pray without ceasing 3. In everything give thanks</strong>. You can never miss His will if you remember these three. Not only do these three help us understand the foundation of the will of God in our lives, it drives the devil nuts.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy's mission is to<strong> kill, steal and destroy </strong>(<strong>John 10:10</strong>), the believers mission should be <strong>rejoice, pray, and give thanks</strong>. How can Satan break someone who is constantly rejoicing in all things, praying without giving up and in everything always giving thanks? Satan wants you to reject God when things are not going right, he wants you to be depressed and moody, he wants you to complain and be grumpy but those who know their God will not fall for his tricks. They will remember that God is in control always and will let them deal with more than they can handle<strong>. </strong>Paul says <strong>2Timothy 1:12 \"For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I KNOW whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI can rejoice because I know in who I believe in. I can pray without ceasing because I know He is more than able. In everything I can give thanks because I am in a position to learn, grow, be stronger knowing there is a reason why He has allowed me to be in a situation. I recall one morning when getting ready to go to work, while checking car oil, my car electronically locked the doors, to make the matters worse, that was my ONLY set of car keys locked in the car. Oh how I should have been upset and frustrated on a cold morning trying to figure out what I would do. Anyway, I calmed myself down, rejoiced in it however hard it was, prayed for wisdom and gave thanks. The enemy would have loved to see my flip but he did not see it happen. Anyway, with God's wisdom, as I was trying different things to see if I could open it, believe it or not, by God's grace I was able to open it in 15 mins (last time even the police could not open it up). That’s providence from the Lord when I needed it the most. I came to work rejoicing even more. Praises be to God. In all things, remember the foundation of God's will for every believer.\r\n\r\nKeep rejoicing, keep praying, keep giving thanks, this is the will of God. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Philippians 3:1-16, \"That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering. Being made conformable unto His death\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe that for us to be overcomers in the flesh we have to seriously be in tune with God. What we align ourselves with will either draw us close or push us further away from where we need to be. Therefore when we pray to be daily filled with the Holy Spirit, that does not mean we are getting more of the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit getting more of us.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Galatians 2:20, reads \"</strong> <strong>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.\"</strong> This is where it all begins, dying to self, crucifying the flesh which does not want the things from above, the things of God. Paul tells us in <strong>Philippians 3: vs. 2</strong> of the things we need to be aware of especially those who will try to deceive us (the evil workers), in fact he says be aware of dogs and the main thing he talks about is <strong>\"…have no confidence in the flesh\"</strong>. Flesh is the no. 1 enemy of the Sprit that's why we read over and over again \"crucify the flesh\". Paul had every reason to trust in the flesh because of his background, walking with Christ and learning more of Him changed his life and all he ever counted on, all the knowledge, success, and where he came from he labeled them as rubbish. KJV uses the word <strong>dung</strong> instead of rubbish to describe how worthless those things were compared to knowing Christ.\r\n\r\nMy flesh surprises me many times, I don’t trust it even for a minute. Just when you think you have it under control, it will surprise you with something else. The bible says, <strong>\"…flee youthful lusts\", </strong>it does not say deal with it, fix it, pray over it or stay strong, it simply says <strong>\"flee for your life</strong>\". Samson thought with the anointing of God in his life he could play with sin to overcome it, well <strong>sin is not a respecter of persons. </strong>We all know what happened to him, we can be like Joseph who ran for his life.\r\n\r\nVs. 10, \"<strong>That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering. Being made conformable unto His death\"</strong>. Knowing all that you know about your life and discovering that it's nothing compared to who Christ is, you will be like Paul who saw himself in his state and began to desire more of Christ. You will never desire more of Christ until you have you have counted all that you have, education, money, success as rubbish in comparison to Christ. He realized that he needed more to which he says, \"…<strong>that he may know him\" not about Him and \"... the power of His resurrection\"</strong>.\r\n\r\nVs. 12-14, He reminds us that with all that he counted loss, he gained more of Christ. His desire at this moment was to forget those things which were behind and press on for the things which were (are) before and that is Christ. To reach Christ is the goal that he had set for himself, to gain Christ is the prize he would have attained. It all comes back to <strong>Philippians 2:12, \"Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling</strong>.\r\n\r\nFor this to work, Vs. 15&amp;16 says, <strong>\"Therefore let us, as many as are mature, have this mind; and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal even this to you. Nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us be of the same mind.\" </strong>I desire to know Him more and more, the only way is to decrease that He may increase, less of me and more of Him, none of me and whole of Him as I press in and press on.

              "<strong>1Corinthians 1:10, “Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you</span>, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/image2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6209\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/image2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nRight from the early beginning of human race, tongues has revealed its uniqueness in bringing a people group together. A classic example appears in <strong>Genesis 11</strong> where the building of the tower of babel became possible because the people were of the same mind and of the same tongue.<!--more--> The passage begins by reading in <strong>Genesis 11</strong>:<strong>1, “Now the whole earth had one language and one speech...”</strong> The one language and one speech unified them in a level that nothing else would. And knowing that their unity would be threatened, <strong>vs. 3 “Then they said to one another, “…, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.” </strong>This unity gave them a purpose to build a tower as a monument to strengthen their unity lest they be scattered.\r\n\r\nThe next few verses indicate that their intention of building and not scattering was not God’s intended plan<strong>. Genesis 11:5-8, “5 But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. 6 And the Lord said, “Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them. 7 Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.” 8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city.</strong>” By confusing their language, this hindered them from understanding each other and continuing to build together in unity. This would force them to scatter.\r\n\r\nAs the confounding of tongues divided the children of men, and scattered them abroad, so the gift of tongues (languages) bestowed upon the Apostles in <strong>Acts 2:4-11</strong> was tremendously instrumental in bringing the children of God together. It started with 4 people group scattered all over, <strong>the Jews, the Samaritans, the God fearing and the Gentiles</strong>. To show great division of these 4 people group, we have an example where Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans in <strong>John 4. “</strong><em>We all know about the distinction between those who were Jews, those who were not Jews, namely the Gentiles. Samaritans were of a mixed heritage—part Gentile, part Jew. But there was a fourth group that was very important, and that group was called “the God fearers,” and the God fearers were, for the most part, Hellenistic Greeks who had converted to Judaism. They believed in Yahweh, the God of Israel. They embraced the teaching of Judaism, but they were not fully included in the Jewish community, because they were Jews in every respect except one, they had not submitted themselves to circumcision”, </em>RC Sproul.\r\n\r\nAs the gospel spread throughout the book of Acts, you notice distinct actions of the Holy Spirit in converting and demonstrating the outworking through speaking with tongues. The tongues was not the main thing, it was a demonstration, a means to those especially the Jews who had not learned to receive the other three people group who God was bringing together. <b>1Corinthians 1:21-25</b> describes the the Jews REQUEST for SIGNS. To continue…Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 1:10, “Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, t<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">hat you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you</span>, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/image3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6211\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/image3.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"214\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Acts 8, </strong>Phillip goes down to Samaria to preach Christ. Peter and John upon hearing that the Samaritans had received the word came to witness. When they got there, through their laying on of hands, the people who had received the gospel message from Phillip received the Holy Spirit.<!--more--> Next in <strong>Acts 10</strong>, tongues are given to a particular group of God fearing Gentiles (Cornelius) with the unambiguous reason being to serve as a sign to the Jews that the Samaritans and the Gentiles are included in God's plan of salvation. This fact is spelled out in <strong>Acts 11</strong> when Peter is confronted by the Jews for having gone to the Gentiles. When he tells them of how tongues externally signaled the salvation of Cornelius and his household, <strong>\"they [the Jews] fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, 'Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life'</strong>\", <strong>Acts 11:18.</strong>\r\n\r\nComing to <strong>Acts 19</strong>, Paul meets some Jews who were only acquainted with John the Baptist's preaching. After Paul teaches them about Jesus, they are saved and manifest the gift of tongues. <em>“The author of Acts showcases this sign to his readers to demonstrate how salvation in the new age is only possible through Christ, and that religious Jews as well as non-religious Gentiles have but one way to God, which is via Jesus, and not through their prior Old Testament ways</em>.”\r\n\r\nThis gift that had divided and scattered a people group in <strong>Genesis 11</strong>, indeed God used it to bring His people scattered together that with one mind, one purpose, one mouth they would be unified in glorifying His name as the gospel spread. To quote John Gill<em>, “These cloven tongues cannot but bring to mind the division and confusion of the tongues or languages at Babel; which gave rise to different nations, and different religions; but these divided tongues gave rise to the spreading of the Gospel, and settling the true religion among the nations of the world.”</em>\r\n\r\nHere then comes Paul to remind us of what is written, <strong>Romans 15:4, “For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope”. </strong>Why is this important, because this is where we are instructed, this is where we get our identify and this is where our unity lies. This is also where we pray for one another <strong>Romans 15:5-7, “5 Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus 6 that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ 7 Therefore receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God</strong>”.\r\n\r\nAgain Paul pleads with believers in<strong> 1Corinthians 1:10, “Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment”</strong>\r\n\r\nBy one miracle of tongues men were dispersed and gradually fell from true religion. By another, national barriers were broken down--that all men might be brought back to the family of God and speak the same language in glorifying God. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Genesis 16:1-16; vs. 13 “Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees</span>; for she said, “Have I also here seen Him who sees me?</strong>”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5893\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/image1.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"236\" height=\"236\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn the midst of being left alone and pregnant, the Lord appeared to her Hagar, Sarai's maid when she was kicked by Sarai. <strong>Vs.7-8, “7 Now the Angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur. 8 And He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where have you come from, and where are you going?”</strong> The Angel of the Lord here is a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ (Christophany) or an appearance of God the Father (theophany). He found her and called her by name, He knew who she was and where she had been. How amazing that the Lord knows each of us even when it appears we are lost, messed up and in the dessert alone trying to find our way. A slave girl who heard of the God of Abraham encountered with this God herself.\r\n\r\nThen, vs. 9, <strong>“The Angel of the Lord said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hand.” </strong>The Lord in His own wisdom instructed her to go back from where she was fleeing from and submit to her mistress. To be faithful to her and there be cared for by Abraham as the father of her child and her husband and to Sarai her mistress. Her place of blessing and protection was to remain with Abraham and Sarah as God ordained. And because the Lord heard her affliction, vs. 10&amp;11, she was promised that her descendants through her son would be multiplied and they would be great and there the Lord gave her a name for her son, Ishmael.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 13 “Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees; for she said, “Have I also here seen Him who sees me?” Amen, hallelujah, praise the Lord. </strong>She responded to this visitation by calling upon the name of the Lord. The name of the Lord which is a strong tower. And she makes a profound statement, “…<strong>You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees;…”. </strong>She never imagined that someone would see and care for a slave girl but right there in her mess, in her fears, in her doubt, running away, He appeared to her and gave her assurance no one could give her. The God who sees appeared. The God who sees promised. She could not believe that she had encountered and seen the One who sees her, she says, “…<strong>Have I also here seen Him who sees me?”</strong>\r\n\r\nWhy is this important? Because there are a number of people especially women who wonder whether God sees them. In the midst of their pregnancies where they are left alone to wander in the wilderness because the men who promised to be with them some have chased them away, want nothing to do with them and with the babies in their womb and all they can nurse is disappointments, fears, and uncertain futures. Some women are even contemplating abortion and some have received advice from friends, doctors, family members, boyfriends, husbands to get abortion. They are now left confused of what to do. Where is God even in this mess?\r\n\r\nMy prayer is that they will encounter with the God who sees in the midst of the dessert. May the Lord appear to them in form of a good counselor, church member, pick up a bible and read or even just prayer because regardless of the means of conception, God is sovereign over every life. God has a plan and a purpose for that life just like He did with Ishmael. Listen to what David says in <strong>Psalm 139:13-18, “13 For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb. 14 I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Marvelous are Your works, And that my soul knows very well. 15 My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 16 Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And in Your book they all were written, The days fashioned for me, When as yet there were none of them. 17 How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them! 18 If I should count them, they would be more in number than the sand; When I awake, I am still with You.”</strong> This is the God who sees, This is the God who has a great plan for both the mother and the child. This is the God we trust through it all. Stand firm, trust Him and He shall bring it to pass.

              "<strong>Leviticus 8:22-24, “22 And he brought the second ram, the ram of consecration. Then Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, 23 and Moses killed it. Also he took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 24 Then he brought Aaron’s sons. And Moses put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood all around on the altar”<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Right ear:</strong> Do you regularly listen to God through His Word? It amazes me how many people claim that age speaks to them, yet they have a poor dedication to God's Word. Maybe this is why so many that claim to speak for God, or say they have a Word from God speak things that do not agree with, conform to, or stay within the boundary lines of the Word of God. When things do not align with the Word of God, then they are not the Word of God. This is why I believe the Lord has lead us to read though His Word in this way in this year.\r\n\r\n<strong>Right hand:</strong> There is a term called orthodoxy with means right doctrine, which is what would have been described above. Orthopraxy has to do with right actions. The right hand signified carrying out what the Word of God says. If one is a Christian they will read and do the Word of God. We have been given holy assignments, not to be saved, but because we are saved. Rich Mullins had a song concerning faith and works. Faith without works is dead...like a screen door in a submarine...faith without works it just ain't happening.\r\n\r\n<strong>Right foot:</strong> We are called to live holy lives. Perhaps there are times when your flesh, like mine, screams and begs to disobey the Lord. But the Spirit of God always commands us to submit to God, die to self, obey and glorify Christ in all we are and do. Holiness is not a popular teaching in the church it would seem today. <strong>Romans 12:1</strong> commands us to live holy lives, <strong>Ephesians 4</strong> commands us to put off the old man (unholy man) and put on the new man (Christ the holy man). Without holiness no man will see the Lord. <strong>Hebrew 12:14-17 states, “14 Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord: 15 looking carefully lest anyone fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become defiled; 16 lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright. 17 For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears”. </strong>Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Ecclesiastes 3:11, “GOD MADE EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL IN ITS TIME” </strong>\r\n\r\nWhat is “its time” and what is “our time?” Let us meditate on it ….Many times, we tend to be in a hurry regarding things in our day today life. Occasionally, if there is a delay, we panic…Things are not moving as we had expected…Thus there is also some discouragement /frustration ..and we cannot wholeheartedly praise Him for all His works.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalms 92 :4 says “I sing for joy at the work of your hands”</strong> Are we able to sing with David, praising God in every situation we face or are we murmering, complaining, and grumbling at certain situations which God has allowed into our lives?….<strong>Romans 8:28 says “And we know that in all things, God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose”</strong> Are we twenty four hours and three hundred and sixty five days aware of this fact? When things do not go our way, we feel our prayers are being unanswered.\r\n\r\nWhatever God does, it is for our best interest…This is well proven in the book of Esther …When Haman the Agagite honored by the King and all the royal officials observed that a Jew named Mordecai was not kneeling or paying him honor. He became enraged and along with other officials and the plotted to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews on a single day ….These days, Satan the enemy is roaming like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and his aim is to steal, kill and destroy us …<strong>John 10:10</strong> He steals our joy in the Lord, makes us believe what circumstances have to teach us rather than the word of God…Once we start looking at the circumstances /prevalent situations, we tend to loose faith and focus on the problems, worrying, getting depressed. Instead of basing ourselves totally on God’s reliable word, we meditate on our tough situations …As a result we cannot rejoice in the Lord\r\n\r\nNow how did Mordecai react to Haman’s plan? Did he get depressed or defeated? On the contrary he went into fasting, weeping, and wailing and then persuaded Queen Esther for help.. He counsels Queen to plead the King for all the Jews and in the process, he ensured that all the Jews would fast for 3 days…Mordecai never based himself on Queen Esther as in <strong>Esther 4:14 “For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from anther place”</strong> Yes, this is true…there are times, people tend to rely more on rulers, authorities, or kings than on the Lord <strong>Psalms 11:3, \"It is better to take refuge in the Lord, than to trust on men ..It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in kings”. Psalms 3:8 says, ”Deliverance is from the Lord” …The horse is made ready for the day of battle but victory rests with the Lord\". </strong>Instead of trusting on God, we expect relief or deliverance to come from people,…But Mordecai is a classic example of relying on the Lord…He requested Esther’s help but told her that deliverance or relief will arise from some place if she does not help…He was not depending on Esther, He was depending on God who could use Esther in her position of authority ….to continue, blessings Sarah"

              "<strong>Ecclesiastes 3:11, “GOD MADE EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL IN ITS TIME”</strong>\r\n\r\nTo pick up from where we left, we learn how Haman became excited about his plan and that all the Jews would be destroyed forever. In high spirits, he called his friends and wife Zeresh and boasted of his vast wealth, his many sons, all the ways the king exalted him and how he was elevated above the other nobles and officials… <strong>“Pride goes before a fall”<!--more-->...</strong>To add to all this, his friends and wife suggested to Haman to have a seventy five feet gallows built for Mordecai in order to hang him on it …And this suggestion delighted Haman according to Esther. On the count of Haman's story, what delights you? Do suggestions of beloved people delight you? Or the Law of the Lord? Does the word of God delight you? Delight is the highest level of ecstasy or happiness or joy or pleasure or contentment. <strong>Psalms 1:4</strong> speaks of delighting in the law of the Lord…Does the word of God delight you? Does the word of God pour life into you as in the case of David?\r\n\r\nThough Mordecai was aware of all this, he never got worried or never panicked. He never complained to God by saying something like this, “<em>Haman was vile/evil, then why is he being blessed or exalted above others and that too above me? Why should not that exaltation happen to me as I am God fearing and devout? Why should the plans of vile Haman come into action and also been approved by the king? Those plans could have been stopped but why did You allow all this in my life? To worsen the situation, gallows also are built. God You could have stopped the gallows being built and what not”</em>\r\n\r\nMordecai was quite composed and humble under Gods mighty hands to exalt him at the due time …Never did Haman’s boasting or his feasts upset Mordecai…In all these happenings, apparently God looked to be silent ..Why? He let the enemy work to its best …He let the enemy plan the worst ..he let the enemy get excited to the maximum … Though he appears to be silent, He is working behind the scene..\r\n\r\nKing Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, Gods children when they disobeyed his command to serve other gods or worship them…Though he was quite favorable towards them till that moment, his attitude immediately changed and he ordered that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual… Yes people are prone to change…However close or dear to us, they are subject to change depending on the situations/circumstances… But our Father never changes …He is the same yesterday, today and forever…What a comfort to have a God/guide/friend who never changes… who loves us in the same way, though we are prone to change parties or change colors … These children of God were never worried that the furnace was getting hotter …never questioned God. God could have changed the king’s heart…He could have stopped the king from throwing into fiery furnace… To add to all this, the furnace was seven times hotter…But God was watching the situation… He let the enemy carry out his plan with much energy and excitement but He intervened just at the right time in the furnace. The blazing furnace had killed the soldiers who tied up the children of God to throw into the furnace but these people were completely protected. Praise the Lord ! To finish, Sarah"

              "<strong>Ecclesiastes 3:11, “GOD MADE EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL IN ITS TIME”</strong>\r\n\r\nExactly the night before Haman was to speak to the king to have Mordecai hanged, God did not allow the king to sleep. Sleep is ordered by the Lord. <strong>“He grants sleep to those He loves” Psalms 127, </strong>Praise Him…Only those who are peaceful can have a good sleep.<!--more--> In fact it is a blessing from the Lord. After slogging for the entire day, sleep during the night is a gift from the Lord, wherein we get rest and also get refreshed/revived for the next day ahead… Though we all sleep and rest, our God never slumbers or sleeps but keeps watching over us…<strong>Psalms 121:3</strong>…What a loving Father we have …Even our beloved mother or dear ones may be asleep ignoring us but our Lord keeps safeguarding us ...never to slumber or sleep\r\n\r\nNow the king had learnt that Mordecai was due to be honored and Haman was not aware of all this. When he came to know that the king wanted to honor someone, he gave an excellent suggestions, to the maximum extent possible, thinking that the person the king wanted to honor was none other than Haman himself…But God started turning the tables. Though he planned maximum harm for Mordecai, God made the same Haman plan maximum amount of honor, without his knowledge … Nothing less than a miracle…\r\n\r\nImmediately on hearing that the King had exalted Mordecai, Haman’s wife Zeresh and advisers said <strong>”Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started is of Jewish origin, you will surely come to ruin. You cannot stand against him”, Esther 6:13. </strong>While they were uttering these words, the kings eunuchs arrived and hurried him away to the king... What do these words mean <strong>“You cannot stand against him”</strong> God had promised Joshua in <strong>Joshua 1:5, “No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. I will never leave you nor forsake you”</strong> The words of the Lord are true…He led Joshua victoriously <strong>…”No weapon formed against you will prevail”, Isaiah 54:17. </strong>Yes, nothing designed, however well planned against the children of God can prevail. We need to claim this promise. The Devil cannot prevail… Praise the Lord. We are privileged to be in the hands of the Mighty one.\r\n\r\nThe same gallows Haman built for Mordecai was finally used to hang him. and the same honor he planned for himself, God reserved for Mordecai<strong>…”Blessed is He who trusts in the Lord “Proverbs 28 : 25 says” He who trusts in the Lord will be prospered”</strong>God intervenes at the right moment.\r\n\r\nAre you worried that people around you prompted by the devil are planning some harm for you? Are you getting upset that the children of the enemy are flourishing? …They may flourish as the green grass but it is only for destruction forever …We are safe in His hands …\r\n\r\n<strong>”The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that he might devour her child the moment it was born. She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and his throne”, Revelation 12:4</strong> Yes the devil is ready to take us alive but the Lord says ”<strong>Lo, I am with you always”.</strong> God is with us to protect us and safeguard us …The devil, the dragon was waiting for the opportune /appropriate moment to devour the child. Right from the beginning of accepting the Lord to the point of entering the Lord’s kingdom, Satan is after us, to steal, kill, and destroy…. But the male child, symbolic of the bride, will be snatched up to God and we will be ruling <strong>all the nations </strong>with an iron scepter … Praise God. Though our beginning was humble, God will exalt us at the right time…, blessings Sarah"

              "<strong>Ezekiel 22:30, \"So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap (intercede) before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one\"</strong>\r\n\r\nOne of my prayers, \"<em>God raise up more prayer warriors to pray like never before and they will also put legs to their prayers and be used by God to reach many</em>\".<!--more-->Prayer is powerful. We pray to God the Father, through His Son Jesus Christ by the help and the power of the Holy Spirit. Wow, that is powerful.\r\n\r\n<strong>2Chronicles 7:14, \"If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and forgive their sins and heal their land\". </strong>I take this scripture verse and a few things leap out for my better understanding. \"<strong>If My people …</strong>\" we've been identified with God to be called His people, if so, then we are called by His name. This is the struggle, <strong>\"…Will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face\"</strong>. Humility is what God looks at when He wants to bring you up, if you can be humble He will exalt you in due season,<strong> 1Peter 5:6 reads, \"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty Hand of God that He may exalt you in due season</strong>\". This is where all the preparation takes place, this is where we are motivated by reality that if He does not do it, it cannot be done.\r\n\r\n\"<strong>Praying</strong>\" has so many sides to it, number one it reveals to us where we are and what changes we need to make in our lives before we can be used, praying will also reveal to you what is in God's heart for a situation. Prayer will lead you and I to a place of repentance not just for our individual lives but for families, community, city, state, country, you name it. <strong>\"…Seek My face</strong>\", seek is to look hard with so as to find. Not seeking His hands or His legs but seeking His face. Why seek His face, several reasons, for example seeking His face would mean seeing a Holy God and desiring to be holy as He is. Every time Moses came back from the Mountain, He had the seen the face of God (presence of God) that he came back with a glowing face. That would mean, being changed in the presence of the Living God. Through encountering with God will put salt in our mouths to hunger and thirst for righteousness to the extent of turning from our wicked ways. It's in the process of turning from our wicked ways that God hears our prayers. Without repentance, however hard we pray, our sins block the flow of prayer and God hearing them. <strong>The Holy Spirit is so sensitive to sin, the moment He detects sin, He shuts the power off that causes prayer to flow</strong>. And if the Holy Spirit helps and empowers our prayers, how will He reach God the Father if He shuts the power off? Think of it, the Spirit is Holy that is why He is called “HOLY SPIRIT”. Thank God, there is forgiveness of sin and then healing of the land which in other words, cleansing and provision. To continue, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Ezekiel 22:30, \"So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap (intercede) before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAn intercessor by definition is person making petitions to God on behalf of another. Also one who pleads on behalf of another or stands in the gap. So I would conclude that an intercessor is not someone who particularly stands in the gap for his own needs but on behalf of someone else. Pleading is hard work, it’s draining however the results are amazing.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nBefore we talk more about an intercessor, let's see if there are any intercessors in the bible. Jesus Christ is the greatest intercessor that has ever lived. While on earth He was interceding for His people, the disciples, the sick, the ones who will hear Him through His disciples. <strong>Romans 8:34, \"Who is he that condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us</strong>\", <strong>Isaiah 53:12, \"... And He bore the sin of many, And made intercession for the transgressors\", Hebrews 7:25, \"Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them\". </strong>So we have Christ sitting at the right hand of God the Father daily making intercession for us, He is forever working. <strong>Remember we pray to God the Father through His Son Jesus Christ by the help and the power of the Holy Spirit</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Spirit is an intercessor, <strong>Romans 8:26, \"Likewise the Spirit also helps our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, But the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groaning which cannot be uttered\".</strong> The Spirit of the living God helps us by directing our prayers and putting the words in our mouths and empowers us to intercede as He intercedes for and through us.\r\n\r\nThere are individuals in the bible who also interceded for their people, Abraham, <strong>Genesis 18:22-23, \"22 Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the Lord 23, \"And Abraham came near and said, \"Would you destroy the righteous with the wicked?\" </strong>if you continue to read down through the same chapter, you see Abraham interceding for Sodom for the sake of righteous people living there with Lot in mind. Moses was also in several situations interceding for the Israelites. Israelites complaints and murmur prompted the Lord to wipe them out, but then Moses pleaded (interceded) with God on their behalf. Daniel was another man who pleaded for his friends and wise man in Babylon,<strong> Daniel 2:18, \"... that they seek mercies from God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men in Babylon</strong>\". His intercession was to know the meaning of the king’s dream so that they would not perish. This was more than to save his skin but those whose lives were in danger. In <strong>Daniel 9,</strong> we see him again interceding for people. A number in the bible interceded, people like King Jehoshaphat, Job interceded for his friends <strong>Job 42:10</strong>, men in the book of Acts such as when Peter was put in prison scheduled for execution, <strong>Acts 12:5, \"Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer (intercession) was offered to God for him by the church</strong>\".\r\n\r\nLooking at the work of intercession, I can see where the power of men lies. We cannot change it through other means, we can only change it through interceding. It works my friends, I am a witness to this. It is also very essential, and if Christ is doing it, how much more should we do it. You never know what the intercession of saints can do to a nation, state, city, community, neighborhood, home, to the unsaved etc. God values intercession and that is why it's recorded in <strong>Ezekiel 22:30, \"I sought for a man among them... who would stand in the gap before me on behalf of the land\"</strong>. God wants to do something when His people begin to intercede. <strong>Isaiah 59:15&amp;16, \"The Lord saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no justice. He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor\". </strong>Would we be the ones the Lord would find interceding? He is seeking for intercessors for this land<strong>.

              "<strong>2Peter 2:1-2, “1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. 2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. </strong>\r\n\r\nAnyone that has watched a magician or an illusionist knows that the hand can appear to be quicker than the eye. Many illusionists cause one to look in one direction while the illusionist does something in another direction. <!--more-->Illusionist show things that are false hiding what things are true. Peter writes that false teachers are among you and they shall bring damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them and bring them and bring upon themselves swift destruction. Peter tells us:\r\n\r\nThere are teachers among you now, at this time that are false. These false teachers may be heard on the radio, seen and heard on television, they have authored books, and of course some preach in churches and or stadiums. Perhaps you listen to some of these false teachers. One must realize that just because a preacher or teacher is popular that does not automatically connote that the preacher is biblical. Hitler was popular, but certainly not a man of integrity, and certainly did not preach truth, using Evolution to substantiate his racial superiority jargon. If a preacher can get a large following, this too does not equate a biblical source in the preacher. Any music celebrity can also gain a large following, can also pack a stadium or concert hall full of people that will scream their name, buy their products, and wear their apparel. The church is not popularity contest. Jesus choose twelve, and one was lost, he did not have a large following in this light, but those that followed him learning to be fishers of men.\r\n\r\nHow can one recognize a false teacher? Peter answers this question by saying one can recognize a false teacher by “<strong>realizing the damnable heresies, even denying the Lord bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction</strong>”. Do the preachers you listen to preach damnable heresies. Here are some popular heresies among the professing Christian preachers today:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>There is another way to heaven other than Jesus</li>\r\n\t<li>People are basically good (moral) in their heart</li>\r\n\t<li>God would never send anyone to Hell</li>\r\n\t<li>My God would never create Hell</li>\r\n\t<li>The trinity does not exist</li>\r\n\t<li>One can be a “good” Muslim, Mormon, Buddhist, Hindu, etc… and still make it to heaven</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nMany deny this payment that Christ paid on the cross, choosing to put faith in ones “good works” rather than on the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross. Peter said that swift destruction would come upon them. <strong>Remember that judgment delayed (in our estimation) is not judgment denied.</strong> Please, be very careful about the preachers and teachers that you are listening to whether via TV, radio, reading a book or magazine, etc…. Evans and I would be open for you all to examine the messages that we share to be sure that we are staying biblically accurate. We can accidentally be in error. Let <strong>1Timothy 3:16</strong> and <strong>2Timothy 2:15</strong> be your guide as you beware of false teachers.\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzSsnhXIRnk"

              "<strong>2John 7–11, “7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. 8 Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward. 9 Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son. 10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him; 11 for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn part 1 of this series, we examined Peter’s warning of false teachers where he spoke of why the unbiblical doctrine of some is such a dangerous poison among those in the Church. <!--more-->Not only did Peter give these warnings, but the Apostle John did as well. There are some that are preaching and confessing that Jesus Christ did not come in the flesh. Now there are many preachers out there that would certainly fit into this category, but a group that is even more subtle and equally as dangerous is the preachers and groups that preach that Jesus did come in the flesh, but they preach a different Jesus other than the One in the Scriptures. Jesus said, concerning the Judgment Day, “22 <strong>Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’23 And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’ Also in Matthew 7:13</strong>, “<strong>Enter by the narrow gate; for wide <em>is</em> the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it</strong>.” It should not be a surprise that John writes, For many<strong> deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ <em>as</em> coming in the flesh… </strong>There are so many deceivers in our world, and there is something we must listen for to discern who is true and who is false. Here it is, “<strong><em>Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son</em></strong>.”\r\n\r\nIt is crucial that one abide in the doctrine of Christ. John MacArthur writes,<strong> “</strong><em>A failure to be faithful to the fundamental, sound doctrines of the faith (a proper view of the person and work of Christ, love, obedience) marks a person as having never been born again (</em><strong><em>1John 2:23; 3:6–10; 4:20,21; 5:1–3</em></strong><em>). The word “abide” has the idea of constant adherence and warns that these fundamentals are not open to change or subject to the latest trends or philosophical fads</em><strong>.” </strong>We must abide in the doctrine (teaching) of Jesus Christ, it is crucial for us to be in the Word of God daily, not every other day, or every once in a while. There are many heretics preaching at this time. There are those that deny the Infallibility of Scripture; the denial of Substitutionary Atonement; etc.) A<em>heretic</em> is one who therefore denies the Faith and cannot be a true Christian (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Peter+2-3\"><strong>2Peter 2-3</strong></a><strong>).</strong> The use of the term should be reserved for clear cases (like 'Bishop' John Spong; Kenneth Copeland; Benny Hinn; the Jehovah's Witnesses; the Mormons; etc.)\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Error</em></strong> is a departure from Biblical Truth, but generally one not so serious as to deny the Faith. Peter was in error when Paul rebuked him openly to his face, but Peter was not a heretic. Errors can be major and serious (bordering right on heresy - like denial of eternal punishment), through to minor ('how many angels are there in heaven' stuff). They usually have negative impacts on practice and other doctrines. Such a person who embraces such things are <em>in error</em> (or even i<em>n serious error</em>), but should be rebuked/challenged/dialogued with, lovingly as a brother (<strong>1Corinthians 11:19; 2 Corinthians 10:1; Hebrews 5:11-14</strong>) until their conscience is changed or our own error exposed.\r\n\r\nEssentially, this is one of the reasons why we need the Body/Church (assuming it holds to the Word Alone doctrine). Error does not normally refer to such things as alcohol, movies or other questions of Christian liberty where there can be diversity/liberty of application within basic principles - unless one turns their principles into laws and tries to impose it on other's consciences (cf <strong>Romans 14</strong>). Hence - someone who promotes the p<em>rosperity</em> teaching but is otherwise 'sound' is in serious error but not a heretic. (Indeed 'denominations' have arisen to allow people with differences of conscience to worship the way they believe while still recognizing others as true Christians (unlike Rome who has taught that \"outside the [Roman] church there is no salvation\").\r\n\r\nThese are some of the basic distinctions that can be made between H<em>eresy</em> and <em>Error</em>, and are essential when dealing with issues of discernment and deception in the Church. Brothers and sisters, please be sure to abide in the doctrine of Christ, by reading, and studying His Word, the Words of truth daily and of course obeying what you read. You will see too that God’s Word is sure, and that God will NEVER let you down as you abide in Him, His Son, His Spirit, His Word, and in His Will.\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessing, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Jude 1:3–4, “3 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. 4 For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ “</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen one looks throughout the Scriptures and even in our world today, there is constant fighting, contending for land, possessions, property, status, etc…. Jude tells us that we need to <strong><em>CONTEND EARNESTLY for the faith</em></strong>. <!--more-->To do something earnestly is to be intense and serious in one’s mentality regarding the matter at hand. Is there any matter greater than the Gospel<strong>? Proverbs 28:1</strong> reminds us, <strong>“…the righteous are as bold as a lion</strong>.” The lion is known for its boldness, for its roar, for its presence. Should not the Christian be bold in his or her witness in the midst of false teachers? In part 2 we examined the difference between someone being in error and someone being classified as a heretic.\r\n\r\nCarlton Pearson, is a well know preacher, yet denies the existence of Hell. TD Jakes does not believe in the trinity. We must be ever so careful as to those that are preaching what they think is the Gospel, but is really not. Remember all it takes is a teaspoon of rat poisoning to kill you. Paul said it like this, <strong>“4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump” (1Cor. 5:4-6)?</strong>\r\n\r\nJude says of those bringing in the poisonous doctrine and sinful practices, “<strong><em>For certain men have crept in unnoticed</em>.” </strong>This is a scary thing when the church cannot notice the wolves in sheep clothing come to devour the sheep. We are to contend, speak for the Gospel and we have the mandate to speak against the deceptive messages that some have to preached which are false gospels. Does this mean that we are to argue with people? Paul wrote to Timothy, “<strong>23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. 24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, 25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; 26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will (2 Timothy 2:23-25)</strong>. “<strong>You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine, Titus 2:1,”</strong> as you <strong>“Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers (2Timothy 4:16).” </strong>This is why we are instructed to, <strong>2Timothy 4:2-3, “2 Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction. 3 For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.</strong>\r\n\r\nSaints, we must be diligent to preach the Word in and out of season. When you share the gospel with others, be diligent to make sure that the gospel that you hear, and share with others is truly the Gospel according to Jesus Christ, for no others “gospel” can transform a life to become like the person of Jesus Christ. Take time to go through the Gospel this week and read the very words of Jesus Christ and examine how you might apply what God reveals to you through them in your life.\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessing, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;\r\n\r\nFor more “false gospel preachers, Check out <a href=\"http://www.pinpointevangelism.com\">www.pinpointevangelism.com</a> for many preachers that preach false gospels."

              "<b>1Samuel 16:1-13, \"1 The LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.” ...12 So he sent and had him brought in. He was ruddy, with a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the LORD said, “Rise and anoint him; he is the one. 13, \"So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came upon David in power. Samuel then went to Ramah\"</b>\r\n\r\nCan you imagine if one were a king, but had no kingdom? This is where David found himself for a time, when he was first anointed to be the King of Israel. <!--more-->The prophet Samuel was in mourning for Saul, the current one in the position of king, because Saul had been disobedient to God. The Lord has taken the Kingdom away from Saul (<strong>1Samuel 15:28</strong>) to give it to another better than Saul. That other person became none other than David. At this point David had been a shepherd boy, he did not have a fancy resume’ that “qualified” him to be king. However I appreciate the word that I’ve heard Evans often say to people, “<em>God does not call the qualified, He qualifies the called.</em>” David became a King without a kingdom for quite a number of years. Many seem to forget that although we are bound by time, God is not. Sometimes we also forget the following truths as well.\r\n\r\n1. <b>God chooses whoever He wills, “I have chosen one of his sons to be king.” </b>God sets up authorities and God tears down authorities. Don’t forget who is really running the universe! God is still in charge, and there is still no authority greater than He. God will raise up whosoever He chooses. A man sings a song which says, “<em>when others see a shepherd boy, God may see a king.”</em> God chose David, because of how God was going to work in David’s life. What has God chosen you for?\r\n\r\n2. <b>God anoints His chosen vessel for His chosen will, “…Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him…”</b> When God calls you for something, He will anoint you for the task. Even though David at this point was a king without a kingdom, he was still anointed for the position of king. This kind of thing boggles our minds especially in America because we are very selfish people. We want instant gratification. We have minute rice, instant coffee, TV dinners, etc…. We are a microwave generation. God works more like a farmer that plants the seed, and over time, as we are bound by time, the change begins to take place. What ministry has God anointed you to?\r\n\r\n3. <b>God will give you power, “…and from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came upon David in power.</b>” If you want to see the character of a man, give him power. Many people want power for their own selfish purposes. However, God gives power to carry out His purposes. If God calls you, anoints, then He will empower you. That is why God has empowered the church with the Holy Spirit to be His witnesses. We need only to walk in the power He has given us to do the task He has called us to do. Are you walking in God’s power, anointed by Him, to accomplish His will for you? Jesus said, “<b>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”</b> Are you seeking and saving the lost? God has given you a Kingdom, the Kingdom of God; your Father is a King which makes you royalty. Now GO and serve your King in obedience.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil, Pastor Boaz &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>1Timothy 3:14-16, “And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6219\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/image1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nHaving discussed the pillar and ground of the truth in Part 1, Paul further presses upon Timothy to be constant in regard to the greatest diligence, faithfulness, and zeal in handling God’s word. Teaching among other things 6 pillars of the truth that must remain pure and be preached. <strong>1.God was manifested in the flesh, 2. Justified in the Spirit, 3.Seen by angels, 4. Preached among the Gentiles, 5.Believed on in the world, 6. Received up in glory.<!--more--> </strong>These truths are greatly under attack even in the Christian cycles today where some men who call themselves pastors deviate from teaching these truths hence heresy rises up. Let’s look at these pillars.\r\n\r\n1.<strong>God was manifested in the flesh</strong>: First, the virgin birth must not be taken lightly. If Joseph had anything to do with the pregnancy, then Christ, as we are born in Adam would have been born sinful, (<strong>Romans 5:12)</strong>. Our redemption needed a perfect sacrifice. Second, the deity of Christ, God/Man has also come into great attacks. There are those who preach that Christ did not come as God but was Man who grew up into perfection. God was pleased to manifest Himself to man, by His own Son taking the nature of man. The bible called Him the suffering Servant, a King without a kingdom. He came in the likeness of man as the last Adam not second, (<strong>1Corinthians 15:45). Sound doctrine of Christ leads to salvation. </strong>\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Justified in the Spirit</strong>: Christ was conceived and publically declared to be the Son of God by the Spirit <strong>(Matthew 3:17, Matthew 12:18, Matthew 17:5)</strong>. He was led by the Spirit, example led of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted <strong>(Luke 4, Mark 1, Matthew 4).</strong> He was anointed by the Holy Spirit to accomplish His work <strong>(Luke 4:18). </strong>Though reproached as a sinner, and put to death as a malefactor, Christ was raised again by the Spirit, and so was justified from all the false charges with which He was loaded. He laid aside His majesty and totally depended on the ministry of the Holy Spirit for conception, identification, leading, anointing and resurrection.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Seen by angels: </strong> Angels from above testified of His deity and ministered to Him knowing their role. <strong>Hebrews 2:9</strong>, reads, “<strong>9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone</strong>.” In His weak moments in the flesh as the Son of Man, the angels came and ministered to Him right after being tempted of Satan and when He was about to be taken to be crucified. To add, He was seen by angels who confirmed to the women at the grave that He was risen as He testified. Without the resurrection, we have no gospel at all. <strong>1Corinthians 15:14, “And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Preached among the Gentiles</strong><em>: </em>Christ crucified was preached to the Gentiles.<em> “The worst of men, and that by the express orders of Christ himself; and which was foretold in the prophecies of the Old Testament, and yet was a mystery, hid from ages and generations past”, </em>John Gill. What a wonderful knowledge that the Gentiles are part of God’s plan for redemption. That the gospel of Christ was not for the Jews only.(<strong>Romans 11:11-36) </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Believed on in the world. “</strong><em>Started among the Jews, and in the nations of the world, so that He was preached with success; and faith in Christ is the end of preaching; though this is not of a man's self, but is the gift of God, and the operation of His power: and it was a marvelous thing, considering the reproach and ignominy Christ lay under, through the scandal of the cross, that He should be believed on as he was. This can be ascribed to nothing else but to the power of God, which went along with the ministry of the word</em><strong><em>”</em>, </strong>John Gill. He is the hope for everyman.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Received up into glory; </strong>He was raised from the dead, and had a glory put upon His risen body; He ascended in a glorious manner to heaven, in a cloud, and in chariots of angels, and was received there with a welcome by His Father; and is seated at His right hand, and crowned with glory and honour, and glorified with the glory He had with Him before the world was. <strong>Hebrews 10:12, “But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God”. </strong>He was given a name that is above every name, the Father promising that every knee shall bow to His Son and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, <strong>Philippians 2:11. </strong>\r\n\r\nNotice that Six elements/pillars enter into this mystery of godliness, elements all of which were fully revealed in the gospel and they all point to none other than Jesus. He is the pillar and the ground for truth, the one we must preach. <strong>Hebrews 1:1-4, “1 God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 2 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds</span>; 3 who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4 having become so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they\".</strong>\r\n\r\nThe mystery is not something incomprehensible, but the hidden wisdom of God revealed in the gospel; a sense similar to that in which mystery is always used in the Scriptures. Christ, in all His aspects, is Himself \"the mystery of godliness.\" Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Mark 5:1-17, vs. 15 “Then they came to Jesus, and saw the one who had been demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are told of a story of a man in <strong>Mark 5,</strong> described as a demon possessed man. It’s interesting to note how Mark begins to describe Jesus’ encounter with the man. He came out of the boat and immediately met Him out of the tombs a man with unclean spirit. <!--more-->You have to understand this was no ordinary situation for one; he was living in the tombs where dead people were buried. The demons forced him there. The demons were called Legion and the term Legion represents soldiers of about six thousand men. This is what was controlling him, a legion, so demonic and filthy which caused much harm him. He had no avenue of escape, vs. 3 says no one could bind him for he had such tremendous strength. He had shackles and chains (heavy metals used to restrain the rest of his body); he was crying and cutting himself with stones bleeding all over. In agony and in pain with no one to tame him, restore him, bring him out of his misery, he was destined to die in his condition.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his parents gave up on him, wrote him off, called his situation hopeless perhaps just waiting for him to die and bury him. Society may have tried some programs to help him but could not come up with a solution. If the bible says he was bound and broke the chains, you and I can speculate that he may have been disturbing the peace of the community in his condition. The bible takes time to tell us his condition and what they. One thing that strikes me is the stress that no one, not even a group of men could tame him. But when Jesus came out of the boat, the person who most people if not everyone wrote off was about to receive one of the greatest miracles Jesus performed while He was on earth.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. “6 when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped Him</strong>”. The demons recognized Jesus and knew there was no one else who had power over them. When they saw Jesus, they trembled, (<strong>James 2:19) knowing </strong>that <strong>“10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</strong>”, <strong>Philippians 2:10-11</strong>. Something many of us fail to realize is that we serve a big big God, the God of the impossibilities. When He is present, everything is subject to Him both good and evil. Everyone wrote this man off, not Christ, He came to rescue him. People tried everything like we sometimes do too but Christ was destined to get His Father glory out of this hopeless situation as the legion (six thousand) demonic forces were to bow to Christ and confess He is Lord.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 11-13, “11 Now a large herd of swine was feeding there near the mountains. 12 So all the demons begged Him, saying, “Send us to the swine, that we may enter them.” 13 And at once Jesus gave them permission. Then the unclean spirits went out and entered the swine (there were about two thousand); and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and drowned in the sea”, </strong>I love that song that says, “<em>Arise Oh God, demonstrate Your power</em>”, this is a good example of Christ rising up to demonstrate His power. Demons knew He had power over them, and could do with them whatever He pleased, He chose to cast them into 2 thousand swine that ran violently into the sea and drowned. Do you see God’s power here? Is this not a demonstration that He has power of all and not just the demons? One man against a Legion (six thousand troops). <strong>Vs. “15 Then they came to Jesus, and saw the one who had been demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid”. </strong>When no one could tame him, when everyone wrote him off, only Christ in His power drove out the tormenting spirit that controlled him and gave him freedom and sound mind.\r\n\r\nWhat have you written off as a hopeless situation? Or who have you written off? Don’t you realize the same power that raised Jesus from the dead is the same power that saved you and it’s the same power at work in your life, your marriage, your children, your job, and your health? If you and others have written things off, Christ has not. He has a bigger plan in that situation; He will make His name great when He steps in. He is more than what He can do for us; He is more about making His name great in your situation. My encouragement to you when you pray, ask the Lord, “<em>How can You make Your name great in the situation I’ve written off”,</em> Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Kings 5:1-19, “2 And the Syrians had gone out on raids, and had brought back captive a young girl from the land of Israel. She waited on Naaman’s wife. 3 Then she said to her mistress, “If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThough the Syrians were idolaters, and oppressed God's people, yet the deliverance of which Naaman had been the means, is here ascribed to the Lord. Whether Naaman knew it was God who had given Him victory and not his own ability is not told to us, he’s healing was going to happen through channels he would least expect but would serve God’s purpose, making His name great.<!--more-->There are four things that made this man great, <strong>vs. 1 “ Now Naaman, (1) commander of the army of the king of Syria, (2) was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, (3) because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria. (4) He was also a mighty man of valor…”</strong> Naaman was honorable; not only acceptable to the king, and loaded with honors by him, but greatly respected by all ranks and degrees among the people. What a resume going for him but with one huge obstacle, he was a leper.\r\n\r\nNo man's greatness, or honor, can place him out of the reach of the sorest calamities of human life. Every man has some or other, something that blemishes and diminishes him, some allay to his grandeur, some damp to his joy. Some may lead them to drug house, suicide, depression etc.\r\n\r\nIn as much as God had given him victory in the field through other means that made him great, what God was going to do in his life would take a different means. God was going to use the least likely, rejected, despised, written off little maid, girl they captured and brought in as a slave to tend to his wife.\r\n\r\nThis little maid, though only a slave girl would give an account of the famous prophet the Israelites had among them. Children should be taught early about the wondrous works of God, that, wherever they go, they may talk of them for His glory. As she became a good servant, she desired the health and welfare of her master. Though held captive, she said, <strong>vs. 3, “…“If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy</strong>.” Servants may be a blessing to the families where they are, by telling what they know of the glory of God, and the honor of his prophets. God was destined to make His name great by beginning to use a little girl though a slave who had to be listened to. <strong>She was God’s chosen vessel for a mission to make His name great whether she understood it or not</strong>. Naaman did not despise what she said. Desperate people do desperate things, they will stoop low if they have to, humble themselves, do anything to make that desperation go away. He did not even say, “<em>What do you know you slave girl?”,</em> or wondered how it will sound when he narrates to his master that he listened to a little girl. His wife headed to her words, so was Naaman and so was Naaman’s master.\r\n\r\nDo not write off the prayers of your little children, or despise someone as to whether God can use them. God is more than able to use anything He wants for His names’ glory. I know I keep using this phrase “<em>Making God’s name great</em>”, that is what it is about. God is in the business of making His name great and if you look carefully, you notice unexpected He uses that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us, (<strong>2Corinthians 4:7)</strong>. And they that seek the blessings which the Lord sends in answer to the prayers of His faithful people. They will find nothing can be heard, except they come as beggars for a free gift, not as lords to demand a blessing. Don’t write off the slave girl, Thank God for her, she is God sent. To continue, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Kings 5:1-19, vs. “14 So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. 15 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his aides, and came and stood before him; and he said, “Indeed, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe that greater glory to God comes when God uses the least expected, the despised. If someone does something they can do, there is not much rejoicing. How will you even know how it happened? Christ walked on water, which was expected, He is God, but when Peter walked on water, that was grand but not because of Peter but Christ who makes all things possible. <!--more--><strong>2Corinthians 4:7, “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us</strong>”. Christ is the treasure, we are the vessel, the power is His. That is why there is greater glory for Christ when He lives His own life through us, enabling us to do what we could never do on our own. Using the foolish and despised things for His glory.\r\n\r\nNaaman having received a message from a slave girl about a prophet of God with the ability to heal leprosy, Naaman, the great Naaman still prideful went to his master and his master sent a letter to king of Israel to cure him. Remember the girl did not say there was a king; she talked about a prophet. The king of Israel instead of recognizing Elisha as a prophet of God and sending Naaman there became angry as he felt the Syrians were looking for a fight. Syrians especially its leaders may have despised prophets; they would rather deal with people of certain class. God was destined to humble this man and bring glory to His name. He had given him victory in his greatness; never did Naaman acknowledge God’s hands in his victory.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 8” So it was, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.” </strong>The despised prophet is the one God was going to use. God could heal him by sending a word right away. He gets to Elisha’s in an entourage of horses and chariots, loaded with gifts. He comes in style expecting to be healed in style; at this point he felt he deserved attention of this prophet. Elisha does not even meet him, he sends his servant to tell Naaman to <strong>vs. 9, “…”Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and you shall be clean.”, </strong>how low in Naaman’s thinking for Elisha to send a servant with simple instruction. If washing in a river was all it took to be cured of leprosy, all those who had leprosy would have been cured as they bathed in the river. There was something bigger than that, the foolish things God uses to bring about the unexpected. He was not even sent to a clean river, he was sent to a dirty river. <strong>His healing was not in the river, his healing was in his obedience to do what he was told</strong>. Taking Elisha’s word even in that which seamed foolish and despised. Naaman became angry, he argued his case, and even chose to go back home but was convinced by his servants to just do it. If Elisha had asked for something bigger, he would have had no problem doing it, but this was different.\r\n\r\nHe goes to the river and does as instructed and he is healed as the prophet said. “<strong>15 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his aides, and came and stood before him; and he said, “Indeed, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel.” </strong>God made His name great in this situation, and He was going to continue to make His name great as Naaman took the testimony back to his master and his people, he even asked for loads of earth from Israel to bring back to Syria. vs. “<strong>17 So Naaman said, “Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1Corinthians 1:26-30, “26 For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called. 27 But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; 28 and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, 29 that no flesh should glory in His presence”, Do not despise the means by which God could bless you,</strong> we are quick to write people and things off, God is not. blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Corinthians 5:14-15, \"14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a kind of message few will say \"Amen\" to, nevertheless it needs to be sounded more often. I think that many are loosing sight of the reason we serve Christ. While we say and even preach that its not about us but about Him, many of our preaching, worship songs, our actions and even prayers tell a different story. <!--more-->\"The Purpose Driven Life\" book begins by saying it's not about us then turns to make it about us. This is why a book like \"Your Best Life Now\" is very popular. To quote Dr. Michael Horton on now many Christians view Jesus Christ, they view Him as ” …<i>a coach with good game plan to our victory rather than a Savior who already achieved it for us\".</i><strong> </strong>God is not a means to any one’s end, He is the glorious end.\r\n\r\nThe truth that must be preached, He died for all that we now should no longer live for ourselves but for Him. To quote again Dr. Horton on how people view God, “<i>God is used as personal resource rather that known, worshiped and trusted“</i>. There are things that drove Paul to live for God the way he did and none had nothing to do with living his best life now.\r\n\r\nWhen the disciples preached the love of God, they did not preach “<em>Jesus loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life”</em>, no, they preached Christ crucified,<strong> Romans 5:8, “But God demonstrates His own love towards us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us”. </strong>Anyone who carried his cross knew he was not coming back and so are we. Christ’s loving, substitutionary death motivated and compelled Paul’s service for Him. Paul emphasized the strength of his desire to offer his life to the Lord. Christ demonstration of His love to the point of death was a driving force unto Paul to serve Christ to the point of death. He says, “<strong>If One died for all, then all died, and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him, who died for them and rose again</strong>”. Christ died for all who died in Him.\r\n\r\nAs he defended his integrity to the Corinthians, Paul wanted them to know that his old, self-centered life was finished and that he had an all-out desire to live righteously. For all genuine believers, their death in Christ is not only a death to sin, but also a resurrection to a new life of righteousness. And the life of righteousness is not to please self but to please God.\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 16:24-25, \"24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. 25 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it</strong>.\"<strong> Galatians 2:20, \"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe journey in Christ is a journey of SELF DENIAL and not SELF FULFILLMENT and Paul demonstrates it over and over again. What we ought to ask ourselves as we walk this walk, what drives us to serve Him? Let’s make sure our motive is right, die to self and alive in Him; no longer living for self but for Him and let God exalt us in due season. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 145:16, “You open Your hand, And satisfy the desire of every living thing”</strong>\r\n\r\nAs a science teacher I have taught my students that all life has basic needs. Most living things need food, water, air, and living space (shelter). I’ve heard it said in the context of marriage that man has a need for respect that can be satisfied by a man’s wife. Similarly, women have a need for emotional love that can be fulfilled by her husband (see <strong>Ephesians 5</strong>). <!--more-->Only God however can meet all of the needs of both men and women, because only God fully understands the needs of all of His Creation. We know that we have needs, the animal and plant kingdom have needs, but the question remains does God have a need? A need is a necessity, something that one cannot live without. I’ve heard it said that God’s need is that humanity would worship Him. This would mean that God needs, not just desires worship.\r\n\r\nHere is the relationship scenario. God is perfect in faithfulness, love, power, holiness, justice, kindness, goodness, mercy, grace, jealousy, unity, patience, wisdom, trustworthiness, righteous, etc…. Now let us looks at humanity, apart from God we are unfaithful, unloving, unholy, unkind, not good, selfish, mean in spirit and deed, impulsive, unrighteous, blasphemous, self – righteous, etc… Looking at this non-exhaustive list, what do we have to offer to God? If God had a need, how could we possibly meet His need, we can’t even clean the sin in our own heart. He alone must create in us a clean heart. Well then after He cleans our heart can’t we use that clean heart by which to worship Him? Yes, but God does not need us nor our worship. The angels cry out Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God almighty, and have been doing so since God created them. Lucifer was the archangel of worship, which gathered all the worship creation and reflected it toward God. Yet upon his rebellion through pride God removed him from that position as the angel of worship. God didn’t need it from the angels. However many angels still express their awe of God through worship and obedience. Therefore I submit that God doesn’t have a need! We the need to worship the Lord.\r\n\r\nThink back to the Noahic flood, although eight were saved, only one worshipped and that was Noah. If God had a need for worship, how many people does He need to satisfy that need? Noah soon after was drunk and naked, and surely was not in worship, so that would equal zero worshippers. If my need is for food and I do not have my need met, I would eventually die. If God had a need for worship what would happen to God if He did not have that need met? The fact is that God does not need anything from angels, humanity, or creation.\r\n\r\nGod opens His hand and satisfies the needs and desires of every living thing. Only One that is without needs, hence the All – Powerful, Creator, Self-Sufficient, God can make such a claim. Thank God that He supplies all the needs of His children. We call on God for our needs, He does not call upon us.\r\n\r\nToday make it a point to thank God for supplying your needs, and thank Him that He is Self – Sufficient, and that you do not need to meet His needs because He does not have any.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Amos 8:11-13, \"The days are coming,\" declares the Sovereign LORD, \"when I will send a famine through the land-not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD. Men will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the LORD, but they will not find it. \"In that day \"the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst”</strong>\r\n\r\nDestruction was to come upon the city of Samaria which would be the cause of bitter mourning. Amos described the event in terms of a funeral for an only son. <!--more-->He continued the use of metaphorical language as he depicted a coming famine. It was no ordinary famine but one of the words of the Lord (v.11). He pictured men longing and searching for God’s Word as starving people seek food or water (vv.12-13). But despite their search they received no word from the Lord. They had rejected the word, not realizing its great value, and had lost it forever (cf. <strong>Luke 17:22; John 7:34</strong>).\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the Bible and all it contains ponder on this. A young man once received a letter from a lawyer stating that his grandmother had left him an inheritance. To his astonishment, it was $50,000 plus <em>\"my Bible and all it contains</em>\" . The youth was delighted to receive the money. However, he knew what the Bible contained, and because he wasn’t into religion he didn’t bother to open it. Instead, he put it on a high shelf. He gambled the $50,000, and over the next fifty years he lived as a pauper, scraping for every meal. Finally he became so destitute, he had to move in with his relatives. When he cleaned out his room, he reached up to get the dusty old Bible from the shelf. As he took it down, his trembling hands dropped it onto the floor, flinging it open to reveal a $100 bill between every page. The man had lived as a pauper, simply because of his prejudice. He thought he knew what the Bible \"contained.\" The Bible has treasures, and spiritual nourishment you need for your survival.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine having a famine of the Word of God? Imagine Bibles taken off the shelves of stores all around the world. It is illegal in some countries to own a Bible. What happens if and when that happens in this country? Which one book takes a definite stand against abortion, homosexuality, relativism, and a host of other controversial issues without compromise but the Word of God? With the way the USA is going, I can see the continual moral decay, and the word of man taking more and more precedence over the Word of God. Do you have the Word of God so settled in your heart, especially through Scripture memory (not memorizing the whole things)? that should the day come you know how to live God’s Word without the thin lined pages of your Bible so easily accessible? Imagine the worst famine the world has ever seen<strong>, \"a famine of hearing the words of the LORD</strong>\". It certainly happened in the Scriptures, perhaps it will happen again. It’s interesting that the famine wasn’t one of food or water. Yet Job said, \"<strong>I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food (Job 23:12</strong>),\" and Jesus said in <strong>John 4:32-34, \"I have food to eat that you know nothing about. Then his disciples said to each other, \"Could someone have brought him food?\" \"My food,\" said Jesus, is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work</strong>.\" Furthermore in speaking with the woman at the well \"<strong>Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life (John 4:14).\" </strong>\r\n\r\nYou see when you have God’s Word in you the water and food for your spirit will nourish you. Just as the physical body would die without physical food and water, so will the spirit die without spiritual nourishment, the Word of God in you. C.S. Lewis said as a car is meant to run on Gas, people are meant to run on the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nBe in God’s Word consistently and daily. The King has set the table, if you don’t sit and eat, you will be the one with a spiritual famine in your life. Read <strong>Matthew 5:6, and Psalm 1</strong>. Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Amos 8:11-13, \"The days are coming,\" declares the Sovereign LORD, \"when I will send a famine through the land-not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD. Men will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the LORD, but they will not find it. \"In that day\" the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst”</strong>\r\n\r\nIsn’t it amazing the magnitude of this famine? The Scriptures point out that even the lovely young women and strong young men would be affected by it. <!--more-->Young people are known for their strength. In <strong>Proverbs 31:3</strong> King Lemuel’s mother gave him an oracle she said to him: \"<strong>do not spend your strength on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings\"</strong> Now even though this was a warning against sensual lust, the fact still remains that this king’s mother was warning this young man not to allow his inner strength of character or virtue to be drained by an outside force. <strong>1John 2:14 reads \"I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one\". </strong>The young were characterized by being strong, and having the Word of God living within them, and therefore overcoming the evil one. But, if there is a famine of the Word of God, not even the young will stand based on their youth alone. These need the Word of God flowing through their very veins! Just as one gets vaccinations and booster shots to keep up with their immunizations so does one need to be vaccinated by the Word of God, and have daily booster shots of daily time reading, memorizing, and mediating on it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Illustration - Water or Money</strong>? If you were offered a handful of $1,000 bills or a glass of cool water, which would you choose? The $1,000 bills of course-anyone in his right mind would. However, if you were crawling through a desert, dying of thirst, and you were offered a glass of water or a handful of $1,000 bills, which would you take? The water of course-anyone in his right mind would. That’s called \"circumstantial priorities\". Your priorities change according to your circumstances. If there were a way to find everlasting life, would you want to know about it? The answer is \"yes\", of course-anyone in his right mind would. What the Bible contains may surprise you. The Scriptures speak of riches beyond our wildest dreams-the \"riches\" of everlasting life-and they are offered in the form of cool, clear water: \"<strong>Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely\" (Revelation 22:17). </strong>At the moment, you may not be interested in the offer, but on Judgment Day your circumstances will radically change. Then it will be too late.\r\n\r\nThe church must realize the preciousness of the Word of God. We must obey and honor it, because it points to the source of life. Look at our society that tries to keep God’s Word out of our institutions, government, and judiciary system. Without God’s Word you have no choice but to spiritually die.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application:</strong> Are you spiritually eating or starving? You can only live so long on a verse here and there; eventually Satan will easily steal, kill, and destroy you. Be on guard, and lift daily the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, to fight for God against the schemes of the enemy. Blessings, Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Matthew 22:12, “ So he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless”</strong>\r\n\r\nI can imagine at celebrity weddings, that each person allowed to attend the event must be on a guest list at the front entrance. You see not just anyone can walk into an event with a bunch of celebrities and be allowed in. Some will certainly try to manipulate their way in claiming they should be on the list, and perhaps even name someone else they are acquainted with which is on the list, however the one checking the names at the front entrance will not let the person in because they have no right to be there.<!--more-->Jesus told a similar account in <strong>Matthew 22:2-10, “And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said: 2 “The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son, 3 and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come. 4Again, he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding.” ’ 5 But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business. 6 And the rest seized his servants, treated them spitefully, and killed them. 7 But when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. 8 Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. 9 Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding.’ 10 So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests</strong><em>. </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>The Kingdom of God EXISTS</strong>! “<strong>The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son.”</strong> In Matthew’s Gospel, he wrote on Jesus’ repetitive statement “<strong>The Kingdom of Heaven is like</strong>…,”which appears about ten times in his writing. Jesus is using this parable to describe the Kingdom of God, which is a kingdom many in this world don’t contemplate much about. Someone is either a part of the Kingdom of God or the Kingdom of this world. The kingdom of this world may tantalize many, with its music, entertainment, glamour, etc..., yet we are to resist these things, because they are NOTHING compared to the Kingdom of our God. In <strong>Matthew 4, and Luke 4, </strong>Jesus is tempted by Satan himself, and one of Satan’s temptations to lure Jesus in was to show and promise Jesus to own the kingdoms of the world. Matthew wrote, <strong>“8 Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 9 And he said to Him, “All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me</strong>.” The Devil seemed to believe that Jesus would jump at this gift the Devil was offering Him. The kingdoms of this world are the Devil’s to give, as “<strong>the god of this age (world) has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them.” </strong>Yet Jesus would not give in to this. What are the kingdoms of this world compared to the Kingdom of Heaven anyhow? The term “<strong>Kingdom”</strong> means “rule,” “reign” or “authority” (not a king’s people or land, as connotations of the English term could imply). Jewish people recognized that God rules the universe now, but they prayed for the day when he would rule the world unchallenged by idolatry and disobedience. The coming of this future aspect of God’s reign was generally associated with the Messiah and the resurrection of the dead. Because Jesus came and will come again, Christians believe that the kingdom has been inaugurated but awaits consummation or completion. “Kingdom of heaven” is another way (Matthew’s usual way) of saying “kingdom of God.” “Heaven” was a standard Jewish way of saying “God” (as in<strong> Luke 15:21</strong>) (Bible Backgrounds Commentary).\r\n\r\nJesus had (and still has) a Heavenly eternal kingdom and would not “trade it” for a temporary earthly one. He was the Gospel that was shining brighter and greater than ANY kingdom the Devil could allure Him with. So what did Jesus do at this point? Did he pray, yell, scream, or “cast Satan out”? No! Jesus used the Word of God, the Scriptures to combat his enemy. He did say say <strong>“Get behind me Satan (Luke 4) </strong>and “Away from me Satan (<strong>Matthew 4</strong>) but it was coupled with the Word of God. I heard of a false teacher that claimed to be a Christian Pastor say, “<em>The Bible is not the Word of God, it is words about God.</em>” The Bible makes it clear over and over, that the Bible is the written Word of God, which is why Jesus used the phrase over and over “<strong>It is written…”</strong> Here is where Jesus displayed this truth in His final combat with Satan on the mount of temptation. “<strong><em>Then Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.’ ”</em></strong>Jesus used the Word of the King Himself! This is the same power that drove the demons out of demonized people when they encountered the Christ. The King Word’s is sure. “<strong>For ever, O Lord Your Word is settled in heaven” (Psalm 119:89</strong>). What was the result of Jesus using the Word of the King? <strong>vs. 11“Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom of God (Heaven) is the first kingdom we are to seek (<strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>) not our own kingdoms, nor the Kingdom of this world. The Kingdom of heaven is within you (<strong>Luke 17:20-21</strong>). The Kingdom is not a visible kingdom at this time, nor is it confined to a geographical location. The Kingdom of Heaven lives within the lives of people, not within walls, buildings, or palaces. Because the Kingdom of God exists, and it is in the Children of the King, then those children must live for their King and His Kingdom and not theirs. When Jesus taught the disciples to pray, he taught them to pray “<strong>Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven</strong>.” We must also pray my kingdom Go! In the period of time between the resurrection and the ascension Jesus spoke about one topic, the Kingdom of God. You see a King will always speak about His Kingdom. The king in Jesus’ parable threw a wedding, in which many guests were invited. The King here represents God Himself, so serve the king faithfully!

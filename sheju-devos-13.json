With the death of her sons, there is actually nothing in the family line to tie them together apart from the bond of friendship they developed over the years as they related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">Ruth 1:8, And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, &#8220;go return each to her mother&#8217;s house. The Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me&#8221;, vs. 9 &#8220;The Lord grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">&#8220;. In the previous verse, Naomi began a journey out of the land of Moab to return to Judah (Bethlehem), she has her daughters-in-law but in the middle of journey she pauses to talk to some sense to these two women she calls her daughters. Though tough to kiss the friendships goodbye, she speaks a blessing over them as she releases them back to their homes. Naomi had journey to embark on, a lot of past issues to deal, she can&#8217;t stand bringing her friends into this kind of misery. She is getting old and may be and I mean may be there is not much left for her but for these two young women, they have a chance to marry again and start a whole new life.<\/span><b> <\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">Ruth 1:9, &#8220;&#8230;So she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept&#8221;, vs. 10, &#8220;And they said to her, &#8220;Surely we will return with you to your people&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">If you look carefully, you will see that Naomi had introduced them to a new life style where the true God was seen in the life of Naomi and they must have desired the same. Today mothers-in-law and the daughter&#8217;s in law always clash and we see a perfect example of what friendship is all about breaking every barriers and boundaries from these three women who have very little in common. Naomi has a concern for these two young women&#8217;s future that she puts their desires a head of hers, she cares more about their lives than hers and she is willing to advise them on what to do. They refuse to go back for one, the past looked so bad (full of darkness, idols, no hope, confusion). Who in their right mind would want to go back to such a place. Second, they had suffered together, walked together, built a bond that was not going to be easily broken. All they are saying is that,<\/span><b> <\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">&#8220;we have come too far to go back<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">, we will go with you to Bethlehem to your people&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">Question that arises is in<\/span><b> <\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">Ruth 1:11, &#8220;&#8230;why will you go back with me?<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">to add to that question, What have you seen in me to want to journey with me? Is it because you see that there could be hope to gain more sons that will in turn marry you and we will continue with the family tree? Check again, I am old and the Lord has gone against me, there is no hope to get a husband and be married again and bare children and even if that happened, would you patiently wait till they are grown to marry you? To top it all, where I am going is not promised that it will be okay, are you sure you want to take the risk?, maybe they were beginning to see Naomi&#8217;s reasoning for preventing them from coming back with her. What a friend who is concerned about the welfare of others; what she had, she gave it freely.<\/span><b> <\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">Ruth 1:14<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">,<\/span><b> <\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">&#8220;Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law&#8230;&#8221;<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">The first time the two women were ready to journey with Naomi but with Orpah convinced by the argument started and a sense that there could be no hope, they weep once again and she kissed Naomi goodbye. She is not willing to suffer anymore, she cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel, the person who could still give her hope has just declared that she has nothing else left, what else can she do but go back to Moab, to her people, to her gods. Meanwhile<\/span><b> <\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">Ruth 1:14, &#8220;&#8230;Ruth clung to her&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">Did Ruth miss to hear what Naomi said? there is no nothing left to tie them together and there is no guarantee that things could get better so once again Naomi tries to speak some sense to her,<\/span><b> <\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">Ruth 1:15, &#8220;And she said, &#8220;Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">Everyone has a choice to be to make, people can influence you either the wrong way or the right way. The decision you make will affect you for a long time. The decision we make shouldn&#8217;t be based on what someone else made. Their convictions could be different from yours and what they have been exposed to could show whether they are ready to journey forward or backward. Orpah is gone but Ruth said in verse<b> 16, &#8220;Entreat me not to live you, or turn back from following after you; forever you will go, I will go; And wherever you will lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people, And your God, my God. vs. 17, &#8220;Where you die, I will die, And there will I be buried. The Lord do so to me, more also, if anything but death parts you and me&#8221;.<\/b><\/span> <span style=\"font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';font-size:10px;\">That requires boldness and conviction. One says our situation is just too much to keep us together, the other says, we will work it out together. Sounds like marriage for one party says for better or for worse, I will stick with you (good marriage), the other party says, there is so much to deal with that I am not ready for (shaky marriage). There is something about Ruth, to continue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:10px;\">Thanks<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:10px;\">Evans<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Ruth 1:1-22, &#8220;Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her&#8221; One woman decided to go back to her people, problem is, she had two friends related to her as her daughters-in-law at one point when they were married to her sons.

I can see up to a certain distant, He sees far beyond what I can see with my natural eyes. He sees into eternity while I can only see the present. He is the God who works behind the curtains in the sense that many things He does, we don&#8217;t see Him do them but we can see the results and the effects of His doing. Who is like God? from generations to generations He is God; from the beginning to the end He is God and nothing, I mean absolutely nothing is too difficult for Him.<br \/>When I talk about the goodness of the Lord and His work, I am reminded of the book of Ruth. If you carefully read this book, you will see how God skillfully patterns two women&#8217;s lives by causing them to go through different stages of life with an aim to bring them to a level where they can truly understand who God is. Through one of the women we will talk about, her lineage became the line by which David came through and through that line Christ comes to us. When God begins to do something in a life, He will not just look at the present but more so the future. He is making something that will last for a long time.<\/p>\n<p>The story of Ruth took place sometime during the rule of the judges. Those were dark days for Israel for everyone did as they saw fit in their own eyes. During those times Elimelech and his wife Naomi interpreted as &#8220;My pleasant one&#8221; left Bethlehem which is also interpreted as &#8220;House of bread&#8221; to go to Moab a land full of idols. The main reason for the relocation was because of famine in the land of Bethlehem. Elimelech and Naomi had two sons Mahlon and Chilion. These two young men were given names that typifies some kind of dysfunction in their lives. Remember names were not just given in the olden times, names were carefully picked and most of the time it had something to do with the current or future situation. Naomi&#8217;s husband died and his two sons married Moabite women Orpah and Ruth. In the process of time, the two sons also passed away and we see new situation, three widows. One widow is getting old and is loosing hope and the other two are very young but have nothing much to live for. They only have one mentor, their only friend and they are loyal to each other, their friendship is strong and their commitment to each other is solid. They all have lost something but they still have each other to help them deal with the grief, pain, the fiercest storms. We need friends the most when we are dealing with tough times, when fear is knocking at the door and all the hope and strength has left the door, a friend who will stick closer is what you need, who will hear you out, who will encourage and strength you. Proverbs 18:24, &#8220;A man that has friends must himself be friendly, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother&#8221;. A friend that lets you know that it will be alright, a friend to boost your faith, a friend that will pray for and with you and who is a better friend than JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH, Mathew 28:20, &#8220;&#8230;lo, I am with you, even unto the end of the world&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Ruth and Orpah have nothing to tie them to Naomi for they are free to marry whoever they want to, they have a chance to abandon Naomi who is getting old, they look back at where they have come from and it doesn&#8217;t look good for before they worshiped idols and when they met Naomi, they met Naomi&#8217;s true God. They are stuck in the middle for where they came from is not pleasant and where they are is not pleasant either. Naomi is about to make a drastic change of going back to her home land empty handed. She left with much trying to run away from the house of bread during tough time but now she is coming back empty handed and of age. Ruth 1:6, &#8220;The she rose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had visited His people (Israel) by giving them bread&#8221;. A very tough decision to make, one part is to face her situation head on the other part is to break a bond that she already made.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m just laying a ground work for today as I want us to understand that there are and will be times when we are caught up in the middle of situations and the choices we make during those times can change the course of our lives either for a short time or forever. Going back is not an option when have invested so much into your tough situation. God will let you know that there is bread in His house (Bethlehem) and now you have to make a choice to fight all the fears, doubts, pride and the thought of what people will think of you when you make the move and take a stand. We are not destined to spend the rest of our lives in Moab when is bread in Bethlehem.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Ruth 1:1-22, &#8220;Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her&#8221; Often God works in ways that blow off my mind for He is such a brilliant, Mighty God.

The first one is for justification, the second is for sanctification.<\/p>\n<p>Sanctification involves more than a mere moral reformation of character, brought about by the power of the truth: it is the work of the Holy Spirit bringing the whole nature more and more under the influences of the new gracious principles implanted in the soul in regeneration. In other words, sanctification is the carrying on to perfection the work begun in regeneration, and it extends to the whole man. Perfect sanctification will never be attained in this life for we are still at war in the flesh and we still live in a fallen world.<br \/>Paul the apostle had a miraculous conversion that changed his life completely, the more he walked with God, the more the righteousness of God through the power of the gospel began to reveal the true condition of his heart. Paul talks extensively about it in Romans chapter 7 , what was in his heart, his struggle with sin, the desire to do good and not do it, and the urge to do the wrong things, in vs. 18 of Romans 7 he throws in the towel by saying, &#8221; For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find&#8221;. Like Paul, the more I walk with the Lord, the more the deceitfulness of my heart are revealed through the righteousness of God and I see myself in truth. Think about it for a second, when you got saved and started walking with the Lord, did He not begin to show you things in your heart you never imagined were sins? To some, you may have thought they were too small to be noticed or considered sins; things like little anger, thought life, wandering eyes, hatred, not honoring God like you should, what comes out of your mouth, using His name loosely and in vain, how you treat others (your wife, husband, children etc) I mean the list goes on. If you used to lie and not think of it as a big deal, now His righteousness paints a whole new picture. Here is analogy that brings this to light, &#8220;if I lied to a little child, it may not be a big deal; if I lied to my wife, trouble awaits me; if I lied to my boss, I could loose my job; and if I lied to the government; I could go to prison&#8221;, see the weight of the lie depends on who you do it to. This is what the righteousness of God does, shows us how so Holy God is and how His holiness exposes our ungodliness.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way, you\u2019ve just dusted the table clean then decided to pull back the curtains to let in the early morning light. To your surprise you see on the table DUST and in air, DUST. The thought that runs in your mind, &#8220;how can this be when you just cleaned the table?&#8221;, then you ask yourself this question, Did the light create the dust? NO, it simply exposed the dust. That is what the righteousness of God does in our lives too, it draws the curtains of the light of Holy of holies and exposes things in our hearts we never thought were there and then the Grace of God becomes so AMAZING that in spite of who we are, He still saved us anyway. It is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith that reveals the condition of our hearts and shows us that there is nothing good in our flesh except Christ in us and through the power of the Holy Spirit helps us to deal with them for our sanctification.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 1:16, &#8220;For I am not

to Catch a Rattlesnake, by Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Good morning,<\/font><br \/>\n<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I was watching a TV program on rattlesnakes, and one of the families on the show spotted a rattlesnake near their home.\u00a0 The family contacted one that caught rattlesnakes, lest anyone in the family would be bitten by the snake.\u00a0 The snake catcher came onto the scene, and brought three items to help her catch the snake, a rod with forceps on the end, a bucket, and a mirror.\u00a0 I thought that it made sense that the women would use the rod to catch the snake, and the bucket to place the captured snake within.\u00a0 However, I was puzzled by the reason for the mirror in its use in catching the rattlesnake.\u00a0 The women began to reflect the light of the sun to find the rattlesnake hiding in the dense brush where darkness was.\u00a0 <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Think back to the Garden of Eden, and recall when Adam had sinned, \u201cAdam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.<sup> 9<\/sup> And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, \u2018Where<em> art<\/em> thou\u2019\u201d?\u00a0 Adam, like the rattlesnake, tried to hide from the presence of God!\u00a0 God is still asking many, where are you?\u00a0 God didn\u2019t lose the location of Adam, hiding among the trees that God created.\u00a0 God was asking Adam, so that Adam would realize where Adam was in his sinful condition.\u00a0 When God wants to asks a sinner where they are, what is it that helps a sinner to know where they are?\u00a0 John explains, \u201cAnd this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.<sup> 20<\/sup> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.\u201d\u00a0 Light exposes the darkness, and Solomon writes Proverbs 6:23, \u201cFor the commandment<em> is<\/em> a lamp; and the law<em> is<\/em> light; and reproofs of instruction<em> are<\/em> the way of life.\u201d<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">As believers, we must take the time to shine the light of God\u2019s Law on the dark sinful heart of the sinner (non-believer).\u00a0 The light of the Ten Commandments are like a mirror that shows a sinner how he or she looks in light of God perfect standard.\u00a0 When you share your faith with an unbeliever, do you take the time to shine the light of God\u2019s Law upon the dark hiding heart of the sinner so they will know where they are?\u00a0 Recall what Jesus did in Mark 10:17, \u201c\u2026there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?<sup> 18<\/sup> And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good?<\/font><em> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">there is<\/font><\/em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> none good but one,<\/font><em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> that is<\/font><\/em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, God.<sup> 19<\/sup> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.<sup> 20<\/sup> And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.<sup> 21<\/sup> Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, one thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.<sup> 22<\/sup> And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.\u201d\u00a0 Jesus brought him through five of the Ten Commandments, to which the man felt that he had kept, until Jesus told him to<u><strong> sell his possessions<\/strong><\/u>, and give it to the poor, using the essence of the first and second commandment. The man was grieved and left Jesus, choosing not to follow him.\u00a0 Shining the light of God\u2019s Law upon the heart of the sinner will cause the sinner to repent and follow Jesus, or repel him away, like when light is shinned in the eyes of a sleeping person in the morning.\u00a0 Go share your faith like Jesus did, there\u2019s only a certain amount of time left.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Until the nets are filled\u2026.Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, I was watching a TV program on rattlesnakes, and one of the families on the show spotted a rattlesnake near their home.\u00a0 The family contacted one that caught rattlesnakes, lest anyone in the family would be bitten by the snake.\u00a0 The snake catcher came onto the scene, and brought three items to help [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-783","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-cD","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/783","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=783"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/783\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=783"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=783"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=783"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":782,"date":"2007-09-19T18:07:52","date_gmt":"2007-09-19T18:07:52","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/09\/19\/the-power-of-borrowing-vessels-2\/"},"modified":"2007-09-19T18:07:52","modified_gmt":"2007-09-19T18:07:52","slug":"the-power-of-borrowing-vessels-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/09\/19\/the-power-of-borrowing-vessels-2\/","title":{"rendered":"The Power Of Borrowing&nbsp;Vessels"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Good morning,<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2Kings 4:1-6, &#8220;&#8230; go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors-empty vessels; do not gather just a few&#8230;&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Naturally man is selfish knowingly or unknowingly, that is the nature of man. We always come for us, it&#8217;s always about what we can get, how to get it and how we are going to benefit from it. Look at even the praise and worship songs today, the lyrics of the majority of the songs have (me, my, I etc).<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">The text above tells of a woman whose husband is dead and she has two sons. For some unknown reasons, her husband owed creditors who came about to take her sons to be slaves. This was a form of satisfying the debt. She goes out crying to the Elisha and all she can testify is the fact that her husband feared the Lord. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">The first question Elisha asked her was. &#8220;&#8230;<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Tell me what do you have in your house?&#8230;&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u00a0 and the woman&#8217;s response is amazing,<\/font><strong>\u00a0<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> &#8220;Nothing but a little oil in jar<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">At times, what you have is all you need to get you started.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> She is not hiding anything, she is transparent. If we are going to desire blessings from the Lord, we have to be transparent by what we have. I bet she was hoping that the man of God would just call things from heaven and that would fill her house with good stuff but that&#8217;s not the response she got. She was told to go borrow vessels from everywhere, from all her neighbors and friends,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">empty vessels<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">and\u00a0 not few is the advice she get. How can one borrow vessels when there is only very little in a jar, and the vessels borrowed are not even filled vessels, they are empty vessels. Being obedient to the word of the prophets is the beginning of blessings. They borrowed vessels until they could not borrow anymore, after that they went in, closed the door behind them and poured little oil in every vessel and as they did that, God filled all the vessels they poured little oil in. God gives increase.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">What I&#8217;m I talking about here? Prayers is the little oil that we&#8217;ve got and the empty vessels are the people around us who need our prayers. Friends, neighbors, family members need it and the moment we begin to borrow these vessels, we are getting to a place where we just don&#8217;t think about ourselves and how we can get more blessings from the Lord but we begin to pray for those who are struggling, have nothing, weak, sick and the like. Some times God allows us to go through some things as a reminder that there are people going through the same. Why pray for them? because you\u2019ve learnt how to approach the throne of grace and you know prayer works and they may not are have strength to. You are the attorney that will represent them in the courts of law, you will fight for them as you know the law, you know what to do that will cause the court to have mercy on who you are representing. You put little oil in those empty vessels,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">God will fill those vessels ands what He has done for others, He will do the same for you.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">At times forget about what you are going through, what you don&#8217;t have and the like and remember that there is someone out there who&#8217;s condition is worse than yours.

Looking at the his life style and his great sins, he could not understand how God would be kind to save him and render him righteous. I feel that way some times and the more I think about it, the more I thank God for His saving grace. We are not justified by keeping the law as many people believe, we are justified by faith through our Lord Jesus Christ.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Justified means, made as though one never sinned.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">What a kind God He is!!, imagine of all the things we did, when we repented of our sins and put on the Lord Jesus Christ for our eternal salvation, our sinful accounts was wiped out clean and He credited to our accounts righteousness. This is what is called imputed righteousness.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Imputed righteousness through justification is credited righteousness not by works and by this we have peace with God.<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Christ was delivered for our offenses that we may be the righteous of God.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> God the Father delivered Jesus Christ to the cross of Calvary, not as an example, but to make atonement for our sins (II Cor 5:21). God the Father also raised Jesus Christ again<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">for our justification.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> The meaning of the resurrection for us today is that Christ Jesus died on account of our sins, and was raised from the dead in order to render us righteous in the eyes of God. Faith imputes righteousness. There isn\u2019t a thing anyone can do to become clothed with God\u2019s righteousness except have faith in Jesus Christ as his Savior from sin.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">The Swiss reformer Robert Haldane said, \u201cAnd it is by Him (Jesus Christ) they enter into the state of grace, so by Him they stand in it, accepted before God; secured, according to His everlasting covenant, that they shall not be cast down. &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8230;Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221;, Colossians 1:27<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">It is the death of Christ which effects our salvation (justification); but it is the life of Christ which sustains it (sanctification). Christ died for our sins and was raised for our justification to make continual intercession for us (Heb 7:25). The life of Jesus Christ did not take away the penalty of our sins, His death did. But Christ ever lives to take away the dominion of sin over us (sanctification). This is how we are continually kept saved by His intercessory life.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">We thank God for His righteousness imputed in us through justification by faith through Jesus Christ. On judgment day, the righteousness of God through Christ is what will cause us to enter into heaven. There will be no sin on our account because our sin account was wiped clean by His blood and righteousness was credited to our account. This should give us unspeakable joy full of His glory.

If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.&#8221; <\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">If you will not humble yourself, God will. This is what we shared on yesterday. Let&#8217;s see what the Lord has for us today.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Vs 34. &#8220;And Balaam said to the Angel of the LORD; &#8220;I have sinned; &#8230;<u> Now therefore; if it displeases You; I will turn back<\/u>.&#8221;; 35, &#8220;Then the Angel of the LORD said to Balaam; &#8220;<u>Go with the men; but only the word that I speak to you; that you shall speak<\/u>.&#8221;<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">We said God is a God of second chances, here we have a man who acknowledges his sins, how selfish, stubborn and arrogant he has been. Declaring \u201cnot my will but yours be done\u201d. If you look at it from the beginning, it was about him, now that he has been humbled, he is ready to do whatever pleases the Lord even if it means terminating the mission.<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">He is ready to sacrifice what he desires for what the Lord requires<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Psalms 51:17, &#8220;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, A broken and a contrite heart&#8211; These, O God, You will not despise&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">And anyone who comes to the Lord in this manner, the bible says God will not despise him. It does not matter how many times you have fallen, if you are willing to come to Him with a repentant heart, He is waiting for you with open arms. David says, &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Let us fall into the hands of the living God<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8221; for He is a God of mercy and second chances. His humility, repentance and decreasing channeled to be led of God and not himself.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">A chastised Balaam ready to do the will of God comes to Balaak with a different motive. He knows God will not curse the Israelites and by now he knows that whatever the Lord will put in his mouth will be in favor of the Israelites and not for the Moabites. As you read in chapter 23, God used him to speak more blessings upon the Israelites, the more he did, the more Balaak was getting upset and wroth. The more Balaak asked him to curse the Israelites the more God spoke blessings over the Israelites through Balaam. The more God used Balaam, the more he learned God&#8217;s nature and character and the more he also preached the same to Balaak.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 23:19, &#8220;God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken,<\/font><\/strong><strong><u> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">and will He not make it good<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">? 20, &#8220;Behold, I have received a command to bless;&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">In other words, I tried twice to have Him reverse what He had done and He did not and I am here to tell you as His mouth piece,<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> GOD WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND WHEN IT COMES TO DOING GOOD<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. He does not say one thing and do something else therefore we shouldn&#8217;t see Him the way we see man. Man can make promises they can&#8217;t keep, God will keep His promises. Man will lie, God is the author of truth. God will not repent, because He never makes mistakes. Perfect is HE!. This is a message Balaam is bringing to Balaak but for some unknown reason, he is not getting it. He still desires Balaam to curse Israelites.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 24:1, &#8220;Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times, to seek to use sorcery, but he set his face toward the wilderness&#8221;,<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">My greatest desire and zeal is to please the Lord. Learning what He requires of me and doing it will please the Lord, living a righteous life will too, therefore I have to constantly work towards that. If I can please the Lord, I would have accomplished what He requires of me. The more Balaam walked and spoke God&#8217;s words, the more he discovered what pleased the Lord and the more he performed them. He would always go before God and inquire only to learn that God will always bless so why not just go a head and bless the people. God said,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;I will write my laws in their hearts that they will know what to do without me even telling them<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;(paraphrased),<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Proverbs 10:32, &#8220;The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. That is what walking with Christ is all about, climbing from glory to glory, learning more of God and becoming like Him.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">John 1:12, &#8220;As many as received Him, to them gave ye the power TO BECOME the sons of God<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. What does this mean, the more you walk with Him, the more you are becoming like Him (not there yet but getting there). As for Balaam, he now understands that it pleases the Lord to bless Israel and not only that, he discovers a secret,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 24:8, &#8220;&#8230;Blessed is he who blesses You, and cursed is he who curses You&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong><strong><u> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">You bless God&#8217;s people, His people will be blessed, you will be blessed and He will be pleased<\/font><\/u><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. What Balaak had offered Balaam could not be compared to what God was doing, though Balaak was angry against Balaam, none of that could change what he had destined to do for the Lord.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">What are his beginning words and ending words,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 24:12, &#8220;So Balaam said to Balaak, &#8220;Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, 13, &#8220;If Balaak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD, to do good or bad of my own will. What the LORD says, that I must speak&#8217;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">He said this in the beginning but almost compromised his integrity, he started poorly but finished this race gracefully. There is so much I could share about Balaam but I hope you have learnt something just like I have. Few lessons, it does not matter how you start, how you finish matter&#8217;s a lot; God will not curse or let you curse what He has blessed; if you can&#8217;t humble yourself, God will; as you walk with God and know what pleases Him, you will perform it even when He does not speak; the more you bless His people, the more you are blessed; do not abuse what God has used to be a blessing to you.

Part&nbsp;3"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Good morning,<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 22:1-41, &#8220;The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.&#8221; <\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">What we&#8217;ve been sharing on has some real day to day practical lessons, and the more I read this story, the more it&#8217;s becoming clear in understanding what God is doing. Three chapters in Numbers touch on Balaam dealing with God thereafter you don&#8217;t hear of Balaam again until much later when he is killed. One lesson we want to get out of today&#8217;s word is,<u><\/u><\/font><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;If you won\u2019t humble yourself, God will<\/font><\/strong><\/u><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. I would rather humble myself than have God do it. <\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">A thought came into my mind about what we shared on yesterday and it made sense. God told Balaam that He will put His words in His mouth so as to speak them and then He also puts His words in the donkey&#8217;s mouth to also speak. I learnt this, even in the midst of your weaknesses and failures, if God appointed you to be the person to use, He will preserve you all through. If He could cause the donkey to speak, He could have used the donkey to convey the message to Balak in this case, Balaam was chosen to speak.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 22:28, &#8220;Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, &#8220;What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?&#8221;\u00a0 29, &#8220;And Balaam said to the donkey, &#8220;<\/font><\/strong><strong><u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Because you have abused me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">!&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Shifting blames ruins lives because it does not permit taking full responsibility by admitting and desiring to be healed. Bitter breakups always have both parties blaming each other for the failure of a relationship. Balaam is accusing the donkey of abusing him when in the actual sense, he is the one who is abusing the donkey. The reason is simple, the donkey is not doing what he wants (about him) but what God wants. Why do we have WAR? because<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">WAR<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">stands for &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">W<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">e<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">A<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">re<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">R<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">ight&#8221;. It could be true that you are right, but how about if you are wrong? If eye can trick us to think that on a hot sunny day you can see water on the highway when there isn&#8217;t and if the eyes can trick us that the sky is blue, there is a possibility that you could be wrong yet you feel right. You can win an argument but loose the truth, you can also win an argument by your facts and loose a relationship. Our friend Balaam is so furious, mad, raged because he feels he has been wronged, that leads him to do more inflict pain to his donkey and we know that he was the one who was wrong. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Vs. 31, &#8220;Then the LORD opened Balaam&#8217;s eyes, and he saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand; and he bowed his head and fell flat on his face&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Encountering with God will show you who is wrong, hence creating an atmosphere of repentance. Don&#8217;t be surprised if God uses other people especially the called to advise you on what you shouldn&#8217;t do. They could be the people He is using to stop you on your truck from making the biggest mistake of your life. They could be used to warn you about the person you are about to marry, or a job you are about to take, or a group of people you are about to hook up with or something you are involved with that will drive away His presence<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. If you insist, God could permit you to go a head and not approve of it or be part of it<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, the choice is yours and mine. We can see that finally Balaam understands who was standing in the way and that drove him to fall on his face and repent (not true repentance though). He was asked why he struck his donkey three times to show that what God has blessed you with is not subject to abuse.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">vs. 31, &#8220;&#8230;Behold, I have come out to stand against you, because your way is perverse before Me<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;, the Lord searches the heart and tries the mind, He knows every motive whether be good or bad. It&#8217;s revealed to us that Balaam had a perverse heart which means directing away from what is right or good. In other words, obstinately persisting in error or fault (stubborn).<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">An opportunity can test your integrity remember that<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. His opportunity to be used by God tested his integrity thus causing the inner things in his heart he might have not known about surfaced. You will agree with me that there are people who really changed with time as they gained more. They became arrogant, stubborn, prideful etc,<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> their one time humility that everyone admired had been swallowed by what they had gained and no one\u00a0 mattered anymore<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. When God is taking you to greater levels, also pray that He will enlarge your character to stabilize your integrity as you will not want His blessings on you turn into a curse.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Proverbs 10:22, &#8220;The blessing of the Lord makes one rich, And He adds no sorrows with it&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Vs. 33<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">The donkey knew the Lord and feared him, how much more is the person created by God should see Him in situations and fear Him. Balaam almost died while the donkey would have lived but I believe that what God has started in a person, He will be faithful to complete it. Balaam was to speak God&#8217;s words, though he stumbled, God had to humble him and instead of giving him justice, he gave him mercy, a chance to start again. That is the God we fall in love with, God of second chances.

Part&nbsp;2"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Good morning,<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 22:1-41, &#8220;The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.&#8221; <\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Yesterday we looked different things such as temptation is not evil, what is done with it can be turned into evil. I also mentioned the fact that we always struggle to know whether we are led of the Spirit or the flesh. Prophet Samuel in 1Samuel 16 almost made a big mistake when God asked him to go Jesse&#8217;s house to anoint the next king, he picked the wrong man who looked more of a king type. Prophet Samuel, a man of God, a man who hears from the Lord almost anointed the wrong man because he looked on the outside while God looked on the inside. God had to stand in the way and stop the oil from running and then directed him to the right man, David. I wonder if he tried to cast out demons since the man he wanted to anoint the oil would not flow on him. If this can happen to a prophet of God, &#8230; need I say more?<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 22:23, &#8220;Now the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road&#8221;.<u> The Angel of the Lord here is some manifestation of God Himself<\/u><\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. At times it refers to the Angel of God and at times the Lord, in all, God is the One in the picture. Of all, it&#8217;s the donkey that saw the Angel of the Lord, showing God reveals Himself to whoever He wants to. Here is Balaam hurrying to get to Balak, already the Lord said he will not curse the Israelites, twice he sought the Lord about it and twice he received the same answer. Finally the Lord allows him to go to Balak but the instructions are to wait for the words of the Lord to be put in his mouth. Why would the Lord stop him on the road if He had sent him? Here is what I believe, he is impatient, he feels that there is a gain for him and at this time nothing can stop him. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">The Angel of the Lord standing on the way was really to his benefit as we can tell he is going to sin. God would not want us to sin so He will stand in the way, but at times we try so hard to push our way through casting demons thinking they are in our way when in the actual sense it&#8217;s the Lord&#8217;s doing. You might be riding on something to a destination, to a higher level and if things are not moving fast as expected, what do you do?, do you try and abuse everything that has always been beneficial to you? Under frustrations many people tend to do damn things, some smash their walls, what they have in their houses or around them because they are mad. The same happened to Balaam, at his frustrations, he began to abuse what had always been beneficial to him, the donkey. Something to think about, from day one to this very day, the donkey had never disobeyed the owner, couldn&#8217;t he stop, think and check why the animal was not moving? he didn&#8217;t care about what was happening to his donkey, all he cared about was reaching Balak for selfish reasons. There are people who will not care about their valued assets such as people around them, all they will care about is reaching the top but God knows how to stop you and I on our track when the evil is beginning to surface and prevail. It started with temptation, an enemy has been given a room and now he is in control. One thing to note, everything evil you could ever think about is already in each and everyone of us, if the Lord was not controlling the thermostat (standing in the way), there are things that could have manifested. I thank God that He has prevented us from doing the worst to ourselves.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 22:28, &#8220;Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, &#8220;What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">If the Lord can&#8217;t get your attention through things He is doing, He will get your attention through extra ordinary stuff. Balaam did not discern that the Lord tried to stop him because he was concerned about where he was going, then God opens the mouth of the donkey to speak. For a few minutes, he argues with the donkey but not clicking in his mind that this\u00a0 donkey was speaking. Why is he stubborn to see that the Lord has stopped him?, simple,<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">his heart is not on what the Lord is doing, he is blinded by it because of his motives<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. It is possible to have dreams, ambitions, desires cloud the path God would want to take us. It could be on the same way, but Him standing on the way could mean things like, have faith in me, don&#8217;t loose focus; be patient I am the one leading you; lean not on your own understanding; what is your real motive of wanting that fulfilled? What could be a blessing to you could be a curse because of the way it is handled. Started perfectly in the spirit but progressed in the flesh. Starting in the spirit means starting with God, ending in the flesh means God is no longer present in it. It&#8217;s easy to start with God and as things begin to fall in place, and you see yourself succeeding forget about God knowingly or unknowingly and it&#8217;s because what you wanted to accomplish has consumed you to the extent that you don&#8217;t need God. If God interrupts, stop and seek God, &#8220;what do you want me to learn from this Lord, what I&#8217;m I doing wrong? what is the condition of my heart? what is really my motive for pursuing this?&#8221;. You could be casting God thinking it&#8217;s the devil.

If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.&#8221; <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">I would like to share a devo series I shared on back in 2003, hope you will be blessed and challenged.<\/span><\/strong><font face=\"Times New Roman\"> <\/font><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">I constantly struggle to know the will of God in a situation and not miss it. I also struggle to know whether I am acting in the flesh or I am led of the Spirit. There are times I am not sure whether what is standing on my way is of the Devil or of God. One time when prophet Elijah was waiting for God, there was great earthquake which would be a sign of God, but He was not in the earthquake, I believe it was followed by thunder but still He wasn&#8217;t in that, then finally a still small voice and that was of God. May be it&#8217;s just me but at times I find it hard to know when God is moving, I might see the results in the end, but I missed the opportunity to see Him move. I thank Him for His word, the best way to know Him, to know His ways and His will for my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">Today let&#8217;s look at who is standing in the way. Many times we blame the devil when things are not going right but who really is behind all these?. We know his mission from<\/span><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><strong> <\/strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">John 10:10, &#8220;The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy&#8230;&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">We know that very well but I would submit to us that he will only finish what we have started in our lives. You give him a little room, he will be the master.<\/span><strong><u> <\/u><\/strong><strong><u><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">Temptations are not evil by themselves, what is done with them can be turned evil<\/span><\/u><\/strong><\/font><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">. This why we need to submit to God first, then resist the devil for him to flee. So before we are too quick to blame the devil, let&#8217;s see who started the whole thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">In my text this morning we are introduced to the children of Israel, Balak the son of Zippor king of Moabites, Balaam who the Lord speaks to and God Himself. The Israelites have left Egypt, they have subdued nations that stood on the way because God was with them, they are now close to Moab. Every nation was terrified at the mention of the Israelites and something has to be done real quick before they step in to take Moab. First mistake the king made was send for Balaam,<\/span><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><strong> <\/strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">Numbers 22:6, &#8220;Therefore please come at once, curse these people for me, for they are too mighty for me&#8230;for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">&#8220;. Could it be possible that he made his living through blessing and cursing? perhaps we are not sure of that. The more I walk with God the more I realize that what God has blessed can no man&#8217;s curse or change it. He that God has blessed is blessed in the field, at home, at work, when driving, in the community. Everything that person touches, gets blessed because what God has blessed can no man go against. Listen to this response in<\/span><strong> <\/strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">vs. 12, &#8220;And God said to Balaam, &#8220;You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people,<\/span><u> <\/u><\/strong><strong><u><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">for they are blessed<\/span><\/u><\/strong><\/font><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">.&#8221; I could stop there because I am blessed already so are you. We are not blessed when we have it, we are blessed on the verge of waiting for it. What God has said can no man terminate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">Balak was persistence because even after the Lord had refused Balaam from cursing the Israelites, he sent a message again giving promises of how he will honor Balaam, give him whatever he wanted. Very tempting but his stand was sure (or at least for now), he would not go beyond the word of the Lord. What disturbs me is that when the message from the king came again, he sought the Lord. Didn&#8217;t Balaam know that God would not go against His word when it comes to doing good? What was his motive of seeking the Lord again. He sought to know the will of God again in the situation hoping the Lord would change His mind. This time the Lord told him to go with them but only speak what He would put in his mouth and immediately God&#8217;s anger was aroused against him and this left me scratching my head. If God told him to go, why would God be angry with him? Remember I said that temptations are not evil but what we do with them can turn evil. Balaam has been tempted to bring curse upon the Israelites and he will be honored. He is torn in between as to who to listen to, God or Balak, if God gives him an okay to curse, then he will gain out of that curse. God evaluates, both motives and actions.<\/span><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><strong><u> <\/u><\/strong><strong><u><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">Individuals inner heart attitudes, such as Balaam&#8217;s desire for power and money, will eventually be revealed no matter what outward disguise they use<\/span><\/u><\/strong><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">. He must have been quick to leave the place to go and meet the king.<\/span><strong> <\/strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">Vs. 22&#8243;&#8230;and the Angel of the Lord took His stand in the way as an adversary against him&#8221;. <\/span><\/strong><\/font><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Univers 45 Light','serif';\">Got to stop for today with these questions in mind, who do you blame when things are not going well?

It has been abused and misused to lead many people to have a false sense of assurance of salvation just because they said the sinner\u2019s prayer. Now when you look at their lives, it\u2019s hard to see the fruits that accompany salvation (don\u2019t read God\u2019s word, not in fellowship, does not pray, doing pretty much the same things they should have been saved from etc) then you wonder, did the power of God through the gospel plow their hearts leaving them helpless and defenseless at the cross that God would save them? It&#8217;s very easy to get decision for Christ but to see people soundly saved, we need to remember salvation is of the Lord.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I\u2019m studying the book of Romans to which I believe is the book of salvation. I\u2019m in chapter 3 and\u00a0 I am already seeing many eye opening words that should help us in reaching the lost. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">In the text above, Paul says, \u201c<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Paul gives the reason why he is not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. It is the power of God, the great and admirable mystery which has been hidden with God from before the foundation of the world. The gospel, through the agency of the Holy Spirit of God, does what no amount of mere human reasoning or argumentation can do. The gospel compels men to face the reality of their own sin and guilt, the inevitability of divine judgment, and the need for a perfect substitute to make atonement for sin if man is to survive at all. The gospel is the dynamite which blasts away self righteousness, self-complacency, self-delusion, and sinful self-reliance. This nothing else can do, for nothing else is in itself the<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">power of God unto salvation to every one that believes.<u> So it\u2019s not the sinner\u2019s prayer that saves, it\u2019s the power of God through the gospel that saves<\/u><\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> because<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Jonah 2:9, \u201c\u2026salvation is of the Lord<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u201d.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">John 6:44, &#8220;No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him&#8221;<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">And the power of God only draws and saves a heart that has been plowed and prepared by the law<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, Psalms 19:7, \u201cthe law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul\u201d<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">When I understand that salvation is of the Lord, my job is not to convert people, my job is to be true and faithful witness (preach sin, judgment, righteousness, fine being paid through God&#8217;s love demonstrated on the cross when Jesus died and heaven offer as a free gift). The Lord does the drawing and the saving the reason we shouldn&#8217;t be ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Let me use this analogy, \u201c<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">God may ask you to push a rock, that does not mean He expects you to move it\u201d<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, You and I do the pushing (witnessing to the lost), He does the moving (drawing and saving). That is His power to get the job done. When I witness and someone receives the gospel or rejects it, it&#8217;s still a win win deal. A seed has been planted and at that point my prayer is that God would use the words he placed in my heart to share with the lost and grant them repentance that would lead to salvation. God&#8217;s Word will not return void. Paul was not ashamed because he knew the power of the gospel was in God and so should we. Lord help us to be bold.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Shruti\">Thanks<\/font><font face=\"Shruti\"><br \/>\n<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Shruti\">Evans<\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 1:16, \u201cFor I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; \u2026 I heard a joke on a radio which said, \u201cthere is a recall on the sinners prayers\u201d from that I gathered that he meant \u201csinner\u2019s prayer\u201d [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-776","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-cw","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/776","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=776"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/776\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=776"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=776"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=776"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":775,"date":"2007-09-07T18:19:19","date_gmt":"2007-09-07T18:19:19","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/09\/07\/work-can-be-worship-by-max-lucado-submitted-by-maria-chilkuri\/"},"modified":"2007-09-07T18:19:19","modified_gmt":"2007-09-07T18:19:19","slug":"work-can-be-worship-by-max-lucado-submitted-by-maria-chilkuri","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/09\/07\/work-can-be-worship-by-max-lucado-submitted-by-maria-chilkuri\/","title":{"rendered":"WORK CAN BE WORSHIP by Max Lucado, submitted by Maria&nbsp;Chilkuri"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Good morning,<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Jesus&#8217; word for frustrated workers can be found in the fifth chapter of Luke\u2019s gospel. Peter, Andrew, James, and John made their living catching and selling fish. Like other fishermen, they worked the night shift, when cool water brought the game to the surface. And, like other fishermen, they knew the drudgery of a fishless night.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">While Jesus preaches, they clean nets. And as the crowd grows, Christ has an idea.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">He noticed two boats tied up. The fishermen had just left them and were out scrubbing their nets. He climbed into the boat that was [Peter\u2019s] and asked him to put out a little from the shore. Sitting there, using the boat for a pulpit, he taught the crowd. (vv. 2<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\u2013<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">3 msg)<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Jesus claims Peter\u2019s boat. He doesn\u2019t request the use of it. Christ doesn\u2019t fill out an application or ask permission; he simply boards the boat and begins to preach.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">He can do that, you know. All boats belong to Christ. Your boat is where you spend your day, make your living, and to a large degree live your life. The taxi you drive, the horse stable you clean, the dental office you manage, the family you feed and transport<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\u2014<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">this is your boat. Christ shoulder-taps us and reminds:<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u201cYou drive my truck.\u201d\u201cYou preside in my courtroom.\u201d\u201cYou work on my job site.\u201d\u201cYou serve my hospital wing.\u201dTo us all, Jesus says, \u201cYour work is my work.\u201d<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Our Wednesdays matter to him as much as our Sundays. He blurs the secular and sacred. One stay-at-home mom keeps this sign over her kitchen sink: Divine tasks performed here, daily. An executive hung this plaque in her office: My desk is my altar. Both are correct. With God, our work matters as much as our worship. Indeed, work can be worship.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Peter, the boat owner, later wrote: \u201cYou are a chosen people. You are a kingdom of priests, God\u2019s holy nation, his very own possession. This is so you can show others the goodness of God\u201d (1 Pet. 2:9 nlt).<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">A priest represents God, and you, my friend, represent God.

Something to keep in mind while we look at this subject is,<u><\/u><\/font><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">We pray to God the Father, through His Son Jesus Christ by the help and the power of the Holy Spirit.<\/font><\/strong><\/u>\u00a0<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Wow, that is powerful.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2 chronicles 7:14, &#8220;If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and forgive their sins and heal their land&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I look at this scripture verse and I pick out a few things from it to help me understand it better. &#8220;If My people&#8221; we&#8217;ve been identified with God to be called His people, if so, then we are called by His name. This is the struggle, &#8220;Will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face&#8221;. Humility is what God looks at when He wants to bring you up because if you can be humble He will exalt you,<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> 1 Peter 5:6, &#8220;Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty Hand of God that He may exalt you in due season<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. This is where all the preparation takes place where we are motivated by reality that if He does not do it, it cannot be done. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;Praying&#8221; has so many sides to it, number one it reveals to us where we are and what changes we need to make in our lives before we can be used, praying will also reveal to you what is in God&#8217;s heart for a situation. Prayer will lead you and I to a place of repentance not just for our individual lives but for families, community, city, state, country, you name it. &#8220;Seek My face&#8221;, seek is to look hard with an aim to find. Not seeking His hands or His legs but seeking His face. Why seek His face, several reasons for example seeking His face would mean seeing a Holy God and desiring to be holy as He is. Every time Moses came back from the Mountain, He had the seen the face of God (presence of God) that he came back with a glowing face. That would mean, being changed in the presence of the Living God. Through encountering with God will put salt in our mouths to hunger and thirst for righteousness to the extent of turning from our wicked ways. It&#8217;s in the process of turning from our wicked ways that God hears our prayers.

When we get saved as I have always mentioned, it&#8217;s not the end but the beginning. Often times those who have been in Christ for a while tend to loose the fire and become regular people meaning everything else is normal. No zeal to grow, no zeal to witness, no zeal to pray effectively, or zeal to even read the word with passion. It&#8217;s very easy to loose fruits without knowing, we need to therefore constantly do spiritual evaluation to see where we are. I know of people who used to talk about the Lord strongly, they had such a joy and enthusiasm but something somewhere happened and all that began to fade away and now have a form of godliness but denies the power.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u201cArise, shine\u201d are the first two keys to bring to our attention. Let&#8217;s define the word ARISE, this is a simple word to mean get up or rise up. Anyone who is getting ready for a greater move has to be in a position ready to get up and will do whatever it takes to get up. You cannot move from point A to point B unless there is something that causes you to desire to relocate. \u201cShine\u201d is to glow, excel, sparkle, glitter. Interestingly, shinning requires some effort. Normally when polishing my shoes, once I apply the shoe polish, it does not make it shine when application is done until I begin to work on it by shining it with the brush and dry cloth. It takes time to shine as desire, determination and patience are put into practice. Paul advising Timothy on how to arise and shine, shared with him in<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1Timothy 4:12, &#8220;Let no man despise your youth<u> (point of rising by not allowing anyone to despise his youth<\/u>), but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity<u> (all these were to be his way of shinning)<\/u>&#8220;<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. If he worked on all these, he was definitely going to shine and not for himself but for the Lord for the bible says that whatsoever you do, do it unto the Lord. Yes the light had already come, but he needed work on it and put it somewhere where all could see for<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Math 5:14-15, &#8220;You are the light of the world. A city set on the hill cannot be hidden nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lamp stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">We are called to rise up and shine for we are the candles God will use to light other people who either their candles were blown off by the winds of the world or the ones who have never had their candles lit up.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">The number three key is<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you&#8221;,<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">to me this is the gas that keeps the light shinning for when we begin to talk about the glory of the Lord, we are talking about<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">a divine light<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, it&#8217;s the light that shines in the middle of the darkness, it&#8217;s the light that nothing can dim and what a blessing to be connected to that source of power that when I feel like my light is gonna go off, the gas of the glory boosts my lamp that I may keep burning, shinning, glowing. Someone said that the smallest light can be seen in the middle of darkness therefore we are not intimidated to think our light is small, it can be seen in the middle of darkness. Be encouraged the way Paul encouraged Timothy and know that He has called you to rise, shine for His glory fuels your existence. He who called you to rise and shine, knew you could do it as long as His glory is present.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Shruti\">Thanks<\/font><font face=\"Shruti\"><br \/>\n<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Shruti\">Evans<\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Isaiah 60:1, &#8220;Arise, shine; For your light has come! and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you&#8221; Three key things to share with us this morning are on the scripture introduced above.

I have battled fear all my life. Fear of doing wrong, rejection, fear of ending up in hell, fear of deceiving. Of course some of the fear are healthy and then most of the fear I deal with are not. Think about it, what is one of the things God dealt with in the bible, &#8220;FEAR&#8221;, He said &#8220;FEAR NOT&#8221;. Fear is a distressing emotion aroused by impending danger, evil, pain, etc. God told Hagar the mother of Ishmael in Genesis 21:17 to fear not, Isaiah 41:10 tells us to fear not, so was Joshua told to fear not, Jesus spoke to the disciples in occasions to fear not and it goes on. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Then comes Paul who is responsible for most of the New Testament whom you would think was bold all his life comes and tells us in<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1 Corinthians 2:1 When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God. 2 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Paul like any other believer was no stranger to fear but something inside of him continued to battle fear and that is the love, passion and zeal he had for the Lord to do His will. He says he did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom though he was a very smart guy, well learned. What I have learnt that when fear comes, it drives away things in you that could even help you stand. In as much as he was well learned, anytime he stood to speak to people about the things of God, fear would come upon him and God had to strengthen Him and give him words to speak.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Matthew 10:19, &#8220;But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak&#8221;. <\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">3<u> I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling<\/u> (NIV).<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">We can see that Paul came in weakness, fear and much trembling which if you look at it carefully are the qualifications of a born again Christians God uses daily. Do you qualify? I do, I have much weakness, fear and trembling every time I step out to do the work of God. We can see that the work of the Lord is not left for those who are bold (of course God uses the bold),<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">He has lowered the qualifications that we would all qualify<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. If there is one guy who is bold in doing the work of God is Pastor Phil. I am amazed and challenged by his love, zeal and boldness to preach and witness to strangers on the streets. That boldness rubs on me to deal with my weakness, fear and much trembling that I too may be used of God on the streets as a true and faithful witness. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2 Timothy 1:7&#8243; For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.&#8221;<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Because we have fear, God has given us three things to battle and conquer fear, &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">POWER<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;, Paul could only preach under God&#8217;s power, that always battled his fear, the reason he preached, taught and wrote to many churches boldly. &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">LOVE<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;, which compelled him to swallow his fears and preach the gospel with boldness because he did not want anyone going to hell,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1 John 4:18<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment.

I have shared along the lines in which he preached on. I took notes from his teaching and studied some more. Due to time, I would like to take a portion of the message and share with you.<\/font><br \/>\n<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">There is a great need for discernment in the 21<sup>ST<\/sup> century church. In the Pentecostal movement where souls are being added to the kingdom of God in thousands everyday, there is a great need for INTEGRITY and CREDIBILITY demonstrated by pastors, preachers, teachers, prophets to mention a few. The reason for this is because as the Pentecostal movement continues to rise and great things are happening, we are also seeing a lot of damage being done in the name of Christianity and integrity and credibility are lacking in some of the lives of the individuals who call themselves Christians especially in the leadership arena. The integrity of the word is compromised through twist and manipulation on the word of God causing many to live in error and heresy.<\/font><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">As born again believers, we must have discernment which is the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, especially when conditions are obscure, ambiguous or even misrepresented. Of all the things Solomon asked for when God gave him a blank check to ask for anything he wanted, he asked for wisdom to discern,<strong> 1 Kings 3:9, \u201c<\/strong><\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Therefore give to Your servant an<\/font> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<u><\/u><\/font><u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">understanding<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u00a0 (wisdom) heart<\/font> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">to judge Your people, that I may<\/font> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><u><\/u><u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">discern<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> between good and evil\u201d<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, three more scriptures to strengthen the discerning spirit, Ezekiel 44:23, Luke 12:56, Hebrews 5:12-14. Why is discernment so key to our Christian lives? We want to live in truth.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">John 8:32, &#8220;And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\u201d<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">No one likes to be deceived by anyone and what a tragedy it is when you discover you have been deceived just because you couldn\u2019t discern what was presented to you especially when you did not know the word. Eve was deceived because the serpent manipulated God&#8217;s word and she could not discern,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Genesis 3:1, Now the serpent was more crafty &#8230; He said to the woman, &#8220;Did God<\/font><\/strong><strong><u> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">REALLY<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> say, &#8216;You must not eat from any tree in the garden&#8217;?&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">In the light of too many preaching going on in our land, we have to be very careful what we feed to our spirit and mind because many of today\u2019s preaching may appear sound but when you apply wisdom that brings about discernment through the word of God you find that there maybe SOME truths and a lot of errors, misinterpretation and manipulation that comes with it. Four areas where great discernment is needed are. 1. Discern<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">CHARACTER<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> over<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">CHARISMA,<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2. Discern<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">DOCTRINE<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> over<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">DECEPTION,<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">3. Discern<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">PROPHESY<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> over<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">PRESUMPTION, 4.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Discern<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">MIRACLES<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> over<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">MANIPULATION.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I only have time to share on the first two.<\/font><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1. Discern<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">CHARACTER<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> over<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">CHARISMA<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. A person of charisma could be a person with gifts, talents even good looks. Charisma appeals to the flesh. Remember Saul who was appointed king when the Israelites demanded for a king?. They did not receive a king with character but a king with charisma to be like other nations,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1 Samuel 9:2, \u201cAnd he had a choice and handsome son whose name was Saul. There was not a more handsome person than he among the children of Israel.<\/font> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people\u201d<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Absalom the son of David was another man with charisma who tried to elevate himself. Is it not true today that we have many preachers with charisma (likeable, articulate, charming, good looking) but the big question is, do they have character?\u00a0 There is nothing wrong with Charisma yet Character should supercede charisma. Charisma can put anyone on top, Character will keep them there. In this age, many prefer what they like to hear rather than what they should hear<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">You know the end of Saul and Absalom.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2 Timothy 4:3-4, \u201cFor the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away<em> their<\/em> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables\u201d.<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong>\u00a0<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2. Discern<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">DOCTRINE<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> over<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">DECEPTION.\u00a0<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Paul addresses this with his spiritual son Timothy in 1 Timothy 4:1 where he says<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u201cNow the Spirit<\/font> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed<\/font> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">to<\/font><\/strong><strong><u> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">deceiving<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> spirits and doctrines of demons<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u201d Which means, moving away from preaching the essential doctrines of Christianity and the whole counsel of God. Teachings appearing to be powerful but lacking the power fueled through the truth of God\u2019s word. It&#8217;s easy to catch something that is wide open, when you talk about deception, it&#8217;s subtle, covered with some truths or may appear to be truth. Paul tells Timothy to be grounded in the word and teach the word, then says In vs. 6 \u201c<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">If you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters,<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> you will be a good servant<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> of Christ Jesus,<\/font><\/strong><strong><u> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> that you have followed (NRSV).<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Without discernment, many Christians are being led by doctrines that are not sound<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u201d<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Remember all teachings are judged by it\u2019s agreement with the words of our Lord Jesus Christ.

She has been such a great great blessing and God has honored her by elevating her to greater levels. Whenever you remember, say prayer for her as she taken a new challenging assignment. Be blessed as you read her devotion. Ev.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">It gives me pleasure once again to share my learning of the word with you all . for today I chose the topic &#8220;Attitude of gratitude&#8221;<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">When do we give thanks unto the Lord &#8211; how do we give Him thanks &#8211; what do we give Him thanks for\u00a0 ??? <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When someone does something good for us, it maybe even a little thing, we cant just sit there and ignore the fact that he has done this favor or a good deed to us, we would want to express our gratitude to that person, tell him \/her how thankful we are. Sometimes it makes us so happy but just saying &#8220;thank you, I really appreciate your help&#8221;. When we can do it so easily and naturally without any effort to people around us, it is even more easier for us to keep letting the Lord know how much we are thankful to Him for every little act He is performing in our lives. And later It would become so difficult for us to just sit and keep receiving everything from Him and not letting Him know how much that meant to us. We develop an attitude of gratitude. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 David is a perfect example to us for the way he gave thanks to the Lord for just anything and in everything. He would say &#8220;<strong>Give thanks to the Lord for He is good and his love endures forever<\/strong>&#8221; as in<\/font><em> <font size=\"2\" color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Psalms 118:1 and 107:1<\/font><\/em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, simply giving thanks for His goodness. If we like a person, whenever we get a chance to meet him or her we just let them know how nice they are or how happy we are to meet them, or appreciate them in something or the other, its just a human reflex. Likewise David used to keep on praising and thanking the Lord for His unfailing and everlasting love, his kindness, his mercy, his grace.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Paul is another who teaches us how to be grateful to God in everything. As he says<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">in<\/font><\/strong><strong><em> <font size=\"2\" color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1 Thess 5:18<\/font><\/em> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8211; &#8220;Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God&#8217;s will for you in Christ Jesus<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. this answers two of our questions &#8211; when do we give thanks and the basic reason why we need to give thanks. So whenever we seek God&#8217;s will in our lives for anything we should always remember that His will for us is also to give Him thanks in everything . No condition in this world is so bad where there is nothing to give thanks for. Now lets look at some reasons for telling Jesus &#8220;Thank You&#8221;, we shall look into just three reasons out of the many, today.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1. <\/font><font size=\"2\" color=\"#ff0000\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Thanks for bread:<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> In our every day walk in life we as usual thank the Lord for the food we eat. Jesus himself thanked the Father in heaven before he broke the bread as in<\/font><em> <font size=\"2\" color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1 Corinth 11:24<\/font><\/em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. We see Paul giving thanks for the bread in<\/font><em> <font size=\"2\" color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Acts 27.35.<\/font><\/em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u00a0 <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2. <\/font><font size=\"2\" color=\"#ff0000\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Thanks for eternal life through Jesus Christ:<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> This is God&#8217;s indescribable gift to us which no man can give unto us and that makes us special children of the Most High God. As in<\/font><em> <font size=\"2\" color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2 Corinth 9:17<\/font><\/em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> we should give thanks unto the Lord for his gratitude. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">3. <\/font><font size=\"2\" color=\"#ff0000\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Thanks for the victory over death:<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Death is something common man is afraid of, but we know that if we die hereon earth, we get to live with Him in Heaven.<\/font><em> <font size=\"2\" color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1 Corinth 15: 35 to 58<\/font><\/em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> explains very clearly the Resurrection Body. A very powerful teacher of the word once explained that when a bee stings once, it loses its second sting, so it becomes harmless after the first sting. All it can do is buzz around you and scare you but this time you know that it is not going to harm you. Likewise Jesus took that sting of death for us so it is not going to affect us anymore nor scare us. Death can only buzz around us but it is powerless to hurt us. So we see another reason to thank Him for His victory over death. As in<\/font><em> <font size=\"2\" color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1 Corinth 15:55 and 56<\/font><\/em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, &#8220;Where O death is your victory? where O death is your sting?&#8221;.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">You can find so many reasons to thank the Lord. Its a never ending list.<\/font><br \/>\n<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Praise the Lord !!!

you see how the enemy takes your family, friends, young people captive, I mean spiritually?. They should be growing in the Lord only to find the god of this world has held them captive? We fight the enemy of the flesh who wants or has stolen away our purity, discerning spirit, joy, strength, peace, blessings from the Lord.

Again he could not recover all without first defeating the enemy. If you are going to go to a strong man&#8217;s house to take away stuff, you have to bind him first before taking anything from his house. No recovery without fighting and binding the enemy first otherwise I believe we will be fighting a loosing battle. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Thank God for the equipping and letting us know that our weapons are mighty through Him to the pulling down of strong holds.

All I&#8217;m saying is, we need our stuff back. Someone may help you fight but they will not fight for you. I&#8217;m tired of the enemy taking away what does not belong to him and leaving me with what belongs to him. When will we say enough is enough, stop crying over what we lost and instead execute God&#8217;s word?.

I don&#8217;t see any way someone can win a battle without involving the One who was who is and is to come. He knows the enemy in and out and so when we submit to His Lordship as He is the captain of host, He will direct us in the right path. As for David, he had had come to the chief of the armed forces seeking approval, direction and help to fight the enemy. He sought the Lord after calming himself, encouraging himself and his soldiers.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1Samuel 30:9, &#8220;So David went, he and his six hundred men that were with him<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8230;&#8221; How is it that men who wanted to stone David were ready to go with him to pursue the enemy under his leadership?

David wasn\u2019t going in his might, he was going under the power of HIS might with an already guaranteed victory. Though the weapons they had were natural, they understood the victory was in the spiritual level. His weapons were mighty through God to destroy the enemy. David left with 600 men to win a battle, 200 became weary and could not advance to the battle field. David did not get discouraged for his hope was built on nothing less than the Lord. He had been guaranteed victory with less soldiers or more.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">David and his men could not leave even one man behind for they were men on a mission.

You may sense promise of victory but haven&#8217;t seen it come to pass yet, don&#8217;t stop fighting the battle. You may look like you are failing but keep God&#8217;s word in the back of your mind that no matter what happens, you the outcome is in His hands. This is like taking an exam paper you have already passed, though the exam may be tough and complicated, just knowing that you have an &#8220;A&#8221; will make you do it anyway. To pass means taking it as opposed to passing because you have the answers.

Upon coming home and finding out what had happened, I couldn&#8217;t help but weep until there was no more strength left in me. What my parents had worked for for years was gone in less than one hour. The blessing of hard work had gone like that. This kind of news will put you into tears and that is okay for it reminds you of the fact that you are flesh and blood and you have feelings.

How many families have been divided because they never identified the real enemy? here are men who had stood with David all through, in the midst of tough situation all of a sudden David become their enemy. Think about it, David already had enough enemies, Saul had driven him from his country, the Philistines had driven him from their camp, the Amalekites had plundered his city, his wives were taken prisoners, and now, to complete his woe, his own familiar friends, in whom he trusted, whom he had sheltered, and who did eat of his bread, instead of sympathizing with him and offering him any relief, lifted up the heel against him and threatened to stone him. Why him any way? the accusations could have come in this form, &#8220;It&#8217;s because of you David we lost everything, if we had not gone from here, none of this could have happened&#8221;, &#8220;you tricked us, you betrayed us&#8221;. Instead of comforting David and speaking life into him and telling him that they are there for him, or even asking him what they should do, all they thought about under distress and confusion was to stone David. Under this kind of pressure in situations, it is very possible to make silly mistakes to be regretted at a later time. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Under distress, calm yourself down. Weep if you must but don&#8217;t make hasty decisions and actions until you have pulled yourself back together. David realized he could not rely on his men to encourage him.<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">But David strengthened (encouraged) himself in the Lord his God<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> I ought to be my best encourager because I do it in the Lord and you too should be if you are not. Yes people can come and encourage you, but if a ground of encouragement is not laid by you, whatever they give you might not last for long. David could not be ready for the next step until he encouraged himself. I said this in part one as one of strategies to win the battle<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">know who you are in Christ,<\/font><\/strong><\/u><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> John 1:12, &#8220;As many as received Him, to them gave ye the power to become the sons of God&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Knowing who you are in Christ like David allows you to put your trust in Him and not man.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Psalm 118:8, &#8220;It is better to trust in the Lord than to put your confidence in man..&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Man whom you could count on will fail you, God will not.

I pray that we will not be hysterical but historical in dealing with tough situations that we may be encouraged.

He killed Goliath, fought many wars, Saul plan was to kill him. Crowned to be the next king yet running for his life as a fugitive for the next 17 years before he makes it to the throne.\u00a0 The moment we get saved and chosen, automatically you and I qualify for attacks. The first time I came to Christ I thought that would mark the end of my troubles only to be a target to the enemy. We do people injustice when we tell them that when they come to Jesus all their troubles will be gone. Trials, temptations and tribulation hits a true believer for sure. David tells us in<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Psalms 34:19, &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him from them all&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Knowing this, I need to remember that many are the battles that I should be aware of and be prepared for and the Lord will help me through it.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">In the book of 1Samuel 30, David and his strong men had just come back home from a battle field. They went to help the Philistines to fight Saul&#8217;s kingdom. They knew how David by God&#8217;s help defeated. The Philistines were afraid that David might end up helping the Israelites and fight them back. With that rejection, they came back home. Coming home, they found that an enemy had invaded Ziklag where David, his men and families had camped. If you think the enemy is not afraid of you (because of God in you), how come he shows up when you are not there? I&#8217;m not talking about being physically absence but spiritually absence. He has flesh under control without the Spirit of God present. The bible says that after Satan tried to tempt Jesus three times and failed, he left Him for a season. When you talk about for a season, that means that he is bound to come back. This is where putting on the armor of God comes in for you are always prepared for attack. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Remember the mission of the enemy?<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> 1Samuel 30:1, &#8220;&#8230;that the Amalekites had invaded &#8230; Ziklag, attacked Ziklag and burned it with fire vs. 2 and had taken captive the women and those who were there, from small to great<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. We see stealing and destruction. Men who were suppose to be there their families were not there to protect when they were needed and with that the enemy attacked. Even with us today at times when we should be aware of what the enemy is doing, we are not there spiritually to fight. Talk about what has been lost, health, purity, righteousness, hope, peace, confidence, trust, love, unity, innocence, money and you name it. Parents are under attack so are the children, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, churches, jobs. Think about the time you had something good and now you don&#8217;t. Wondering what happened to it? well it was stolen away from you while you were not there spiritually to do something about it..<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Know that you have changed sides no longer on the devil\u2019s side the reason you are such a great target.\u00a0 Many are our afflictions the bible tells us. Someone is under major attacks right now and you feel like giving up and dying. You feel like this Christianity thing is not what you expected it to be. Let this be a word of encouragement to you, you are a threat to the devil, why? because he knows God has set you up as a seed planted that will provide fruits to many. The enemy tried to kill Jesus when He was born. He knew the Jesus<\/font><font size=\"2\" color=\"#000080\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8216;<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> destiny, a seed that God would use to change the world and so are you.

God supplied man with everything he needed. In the garden of Eden, there was only one tree in the middle of the garden they were not to touch. This tree had good looking fruits but the instructions were clear not to touch it. It\u2019s interesting how the forbidden fruit always looks attractive and tempting but it&#8217;s a death trap. Instructions not to touch it preceded with an explanation, so our first parents were not ignorant of this particular tree. After the fall of man, God set enmity between the seed of man and the serpent, that lying old devil.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Genesis 3:15, &#8220;And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. We are the result of the seed of the woman and there is an enmity between us and the devil. I wish I could tell you have no enemies but that will be a lie because after the fall of man, we began to have enemies. The bible also says that a friend of the world is God&#8217;s enemy.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Here we have an enemy but the question is, what is the mission of the enemy?<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">John 10:10, &#8220;The thief does not come but except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy&#8230;<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8221; These are the three<\/font><u> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">main<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> missions of the devil we need to be aware of. He is not coming to be a friend, he may start on a friendship level but know that He is coming to kill, steal and destroy. The bible says again that he appears as the angel of light. I expect him to appear in any form or size but I need to be aware of his presence. I believe that without knowing you have an enemy and without knowing his mission, you are bound to be take to be kicked around.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Not only do we know we have an enemy, we also have to know who our enemy is,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2 Corinthians 10:3, &#8220;Though we walk in the flesh, we war not after the flesh&#8221;, Ephesians 6:12, &#8220;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Our enemy is not flesh and blood meaning people but something else greater than people. Understand that the enemy is powerful and cannot be under estimated. The word says we wrestle against principalities, powers, rulers, spiritual wickedness, where? in high places. He is not settled in hell, he has his dwelling in the high places. He is roaming throughout the earth with the aim to fulfill his mission.<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> 1 Peter 5:8, &#8220;&#8230; your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">So we know we have an enemy, we have identified his mission, we&#8217;ve ruled out that our enemy is not flesh and blood but a powerful being who is every where looking for souls.

How can angels descend and ascend &#8221; ON THE SON OF MAN&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">We can see how this happened to a person in a dream, running away due to fear of death, in a very tensed state, Jacob, tired fell asleep on the way and had a dream. Bible states in Genesis 28 : 12 &#8220;He had a dream in which he saw a stairway\/ladder resting on the earth, with it&#8217;s top reaching heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. Let&#8217;s meditate on this STAIRWAY \/ladder&#8230;When a person has to climb or get onto a position higher than himself, he definitely needs something, a boost, in this case a ladder needed. A ladder comprises of steps, which have to be climbed one at a time, to reach the top of the ladder.<\/font><br \/>\n<font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">Our Lord Jesus Himself is the ladder, (Heaven is his throne and earth is His footstool) who came down from heaven to this earth. As He rightly said &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">I am the way , the truth, and the life&#8221;<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">, so only through Him can we reach our destination -heaven.. The seven sayings on the cross are like seven steps of the ladder to reach our heavenly abode&#8230;First step being forgiveness, without which our prayer of repentance and faith in God, will not reach God. Secondly after forgiving our trespassers, showing way to salvation and the process to enter the eternal kingdom. Thirdly to be considerate to our fellow beings, loving our neighbors as ourselves. Fourth step is to always have thirst for the lost souls \/dying world. Fifth always remembering the pain when Jesus was forsaken by the Father as He was<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">deemed to be a sinner<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\"> for each one of us<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">Sixth step is finishing the task which we have been sent to earth for\/ complete the mission. Lastly we need to learn to commit ourselves into His mighty and trustworthy Arms &#8230;<\/font><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><\/p>\n<p><\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">Last but not the least, the support which the ladder gives while a person is in the process of climbing is so very comforting. Since the ladder is properly fixed, we can trust it and hold firmly to it so that we will not fear falling, failing or drifting away. &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">Let us hold firmly to the faith we profess<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">&#8221; Yes, once we make an attempt to start the journey in Jesus, climbing this ladder, Holy Spirit of God will help us reach our God, the Father.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">Though we are like Jacob running away from fearful circumstances\/tough situations in life , we can still look to Jesus, who is our only HOPE -our way for eternal happiness<\/font><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><\/p>\n<p><\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">In Christ<\/font><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><br \/>\n<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">Sis Sarah<\/font><\/p>\n<p>Thanks,<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;Jesus then added &#8220;I tell you the truth, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man&#8221; in John 1 : 51.

I have seen bumper stickers that says \u201cproud parent of \u2026\u201d, I know of no parent who would brag about their stubborn, rebellious, ungrateful, un loving, unforgiving child. They love them for sure, they just don&#8217;t have something in their lives to brag about. Like I said before in my previous devotion, parents take pride in their children when they honor them by how they live their lives. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Imagine our Heavenly Father bragging about His Son and not just His Son but His beloved Son. As Jesus was getting baptized, the Holy Spirit descended on Him in form of a dove and God spoke,<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Matthew 3:17<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, and said, \u201c<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\u201d,<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> then just before Jesus is taken away to suffer and be crucified, a voice comes from heaven again to three His disciples Peter, James and John and we hear it again,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Matthew 17:5, \u201c\u2026This is My beloved Son,<\/font> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">in whom I am well pleased<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u201d. The Son pleased the Father by representing Him here on earth and doing what the Father sent Him to do. I don\u2019t hear Him talk about Adam the same way. That is why Adam was God\u2019s son, Jesus was(is) His only begotten Beloved Son. He brought Glory and Honor to the Father. He did that which pleased the Father in deed, thought and word. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Let&#8217;s take a few lessons from a blessed father because of his son. If you remember Joseph in Genesis, he was a slave in Egypt after being sold by his brothers. After many years, he became the ruler of all Egypt (like a prime minister), he encounters with his brothers who sold him, forgives them, he asks for his father well being, they tell him everything about his father is doing. The father gets the news. Here are my points in relation to Jacob and his son Joseph.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1. Christian fathers spirits are revived and stay revived when they know their children are spiritually alive<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> (saved) Proverbs 23:24, \u201cThe father of the righteous will greatly rejoice\u2026\u201d<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Read how Joseph\u2019s living made an impact in Jacob\u2019s lif<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">e, Genesis 45:27, \u201cBut when they told him all the words which Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him,<u> the spirit<\/u><\/font><u> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">of Jacob their father revived<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.<\/font> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">28<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Then Israel said, \u201c<\/font><u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u2026.\u201d<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> .. It was hard for my parents to see their son (me) not saved while the rest of my family was, but when I became a Christian, I could tell their spirit was revived, their son who was once dead in sin, was alive in Christ.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2. Fathers take pride in knowing their children are blessed by God in every aspect of their lives (spiritually, economically, health wise, socially, emotionally etc). Hard work, diligence, striving to maintain a good name blesses the Father.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">3. Fathers delight in knowing their children will be a blessing to each other and to him. In other words, a father never desires division in the family. It&#8217;s a blessing for a father to see his children work out things he has taught them. Jacob did not tell Joseph to forgive his brothers, Joseph saw everything through the eyes of God, forgave them and blessed them<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Genesis 46: 11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father\u2019s household, with bread, according<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> to their families\u201d<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">4. Fathers take pride in respect from those who have encountered with their children<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Genesis 47:7 Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 8 Pharaoh said to Jacob, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d 9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, \u201cThe days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\u201d 10 So Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I believe that through the life of Joseph, Pharaoh the king had tremendous respect for Jacob though he had just met him and Jacob blessed the king. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Jesus brought honor to His father, so was Joseph and so should we today. I want my father to take pride in my salvation, delight in God&#8217;s favor and blessing upon my life, be blessed through God&#8217;s blessing in my life, blessed by the unity among us his children and respect from those I have encountered with because I represented him well.

.<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">As we shared on honoring our parents, today I will take the some little time to share on blessing the mothers. Hope to share on blessing on the fathers too.<\/font><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Everyone has a story to tell about their mothers and everyone will agree with me that our mothers have played key roles in who we are today and we ought to thank and bless them. In this age, it\u2019s hard to hear children regardless of their age sitting down to think about how God through their mothers have played huge part in their upbringing. Yes they were not perfect but they gave all. Let\u2019s see some of the mothers in the bible.<\/font><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Moses&#8217; mother Jochebed hid him when there was a decree in Egypt that all new male born children were to be killed. In the process of killing all boys, Jochebed had a sense that God had a plan for her son and with the wisdom she had, she hid the son in a place where he could be found and not harmed. God used Moses later mightily. Hannah prayed for a son when no one else could understand the longing and the desire of her heart. She knew her desires could only be met by God, so year after year she prayed. Finally she prayed a prayer that caused God to step into her situation and bless her. Her prayer was that God would bless her with a son and she would give him back to God. Samuel becomes a Prophet unto the Lord. God used him mightily. How can we forget Elizabeth the mother of John the Baptist, who was born to her in her old age, John became the voice in the wilderness preparing the way for the Lord. God used him mightily. Mary the mother of Jesus, a young woman yet pregnant with destiny, willing to take a stand to do that which she was not good at, raising up the Son of God who later died on the cross for the sins of the world. There are many more mothers in the bible I could talk about like Eunice the mother of Timothy, Samson&#8217;s mother, Isaac&#8217;s mother, Joseph&#8217;s mother and many more. God entrusted these mothers with these children and you can see that each of them raised their children in the fear and the knowledge of God, advising, protecting, praying for them in advance, dedicating them back to God and standing by them through thick and thin. Raising these children was not an easy task and so was raising each of us. <\/font><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I believe these men learnt to bless their mothers. Solomon took seriously the lessons on ho to handle parents and the book of Proverbs is full of them. This is what He is saying about a virtuous woman,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Proverbs 31:28, &#8220;Her children rise up and call her blessed; &#8230; &#8221; 29&#8243;Many daughters have done well, But you excel them all.&#8221;<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Just in America, over 40 million babies have been aborted since abortion was legalized in 1973, thank God my mom did not abort me. She may have not known how I would turn out to be but she trusted God with me and raised me in spite of. Those days dad had to be a way to work and provide for the family, mom took the responsibility of instilling what dad had taught. I have deep honor and gratitude for my mom and I bless her. She may have not been perfect but she gave it all. I wish I was in a position to do everything for her to make her comfortable. Do you know that many have aborted the leaders of tomorrow, thank God these women in the bible did not abort<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">How does this apply to us today, many times children forget the sacrifices their mothers have made for them over the years. Some even concentrate on what their mothers should have done better. It started long time ago and that is why<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Proverbs 30:11, &#8220;there is a generation that does not bless their mother&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Blessings are powerful and our mother\u2019s honor is in us blessing them. I don\u2019t need to wait for mother\u2019s day to bless mom. You might say your mother does not deserve it, it&#8217;s not all about deserving, it\u2019s about honoring God by blessing your mother through prayers, support, encouragement, time, living a life pleasing to God cause that is how she raised you, doing things that will not shame her, not causing her to worry and panic in this time of her life. She has done the sacrifice, let her now sit and enjoy the fruits of her labor. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Shruti\">Thanks<\/font><font face=\"Shruti\"><br \/>\n<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Shruti\">Evans<\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Proverbs 30:11, &#8220;11 There is a generation that curses its father, And does not bless its mother..&#8221; .

Right where it\u2019s placed gives me an indication how vital it is right after Him first. On top of the commandment that relates to parent(s), He adds an element of a promise and a threat (will explain the threat part). Take a close look at the 5th commandment in<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Exodus 20:12, \u201cHonor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">We have a generation rebellious towards parent(s) to which extends right into rebellion towards authorities and against the law. Matthew Henry puts it this way, &#8220;a generation that is such as abusive to their parent(s), give them bad language and wish them ill, call them bad names and actually injure them. There is a generation of such; young men of that dark character commonly herd together, and irritate one another against their parent(s)&#8221; This has kicked out the 5th commandment or has reserved it to only honoring fathers and mothers when they deserve which is contrary to the commandment.<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Honor means to prize highly, to show respect to exalt. No parent will ever be good enough to deserve an honor<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. God has put the commandment to by pass what they don&#8217;t deserve to what He has commanded. I believe God has put it there primarily for children to honor the position rather than the person and here is why. I believe that the moment a child honors the position of a parent, there will be no problem honoring the parent. It doesn&#8217;t matter how good or bad a parent has been or is, they still should receive the honor because God says so, period. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Part of the commandment completes with this line, &#8220;\u2026<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you&#8221;,<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> this is the promise; the threat I mentioned earlier is the opposite of the promise. If children will not honor, obey, respect their parent(s), their days will not be long on the face of the earth. Children will be honoring God by honoring their parent(s). Parent(s) take pride in being honored by their children. If children regardless of the age would understand the tremendous sacrifices the parent(s) have made for them to be where they are today, they would have great respect and admiration for their parent(s). The cost of raising a child is not cheap, parent(s) have put aside some of their great dreams to give their children the best life they can afford, loving them, caring for them even when children feel the parent(s) never understand or are standing on their way of happiness. I have learnt that parent(s) know their children very well. They know their strengths and their weakness. They know what to allow and what to restrain. For the older kids (for we will always be children in the eyes of our parent(s) regardless of our age), their wisdom and advise can play big part in our lives. I believe God blesses children who honor their parent(s) through respect, heading to their advise, their counsel, helping them in whichever way to make their lives comfortable as they get older<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Listen to Jesus addressing this commandment,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Matthew 15:3, \u201cAnd why do you, by your traditions, violate the direct commandments of God? 4\u00a0For instance, God says, \u2018Honor your father and mother,\u2019<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> and \u2018Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death.\u2019<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> 5\u00a0But you say it is all right for people to say to their parent(s), \u2018Sorry, I can\u2019t help you. For I have vowed to give to God what I would have given to you.\u2019 6\u00a0In this way, you say they don\u2019t need to honor their parent(s).<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Tahoma\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> And so you cancel the word of God for the sake of your own tradition. (NLT<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">). The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were so concerned about traditions they made law but could not take time to teach God\u2019s law to their children like honoring their parent(s).<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I believe the whole of children\u2019s duty to their parent(s) is included in this of honoring them, which is the spring and foundation of all the rest, Our Savior here supposes it to mean the duty of children\u2019s maintaining their parent(s), and ministering to their needs, if there be occasion, and being every way serviceable to their comfort.

My next point, a man in the making will receive a calling in his life not based on background check but based on what God will make him\/her be. God clearly announced His intention of fulfilling His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob about the land of Palestine. He was fully aware of their plight in Egypt, and the time had now come for their REDEMPTION. To make this point clear, our salvation is not the end but the beginning of preparation to be used back in Egypt where we came from with the aim to seek and to save that which is held captive by the power of Pharaoh (sin). It&#8217;s scary return to where you came from but when you understand that someone&#8217;s life is at stake, you will cry out like Isaiah who said, &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Here I am O Lord send me<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;.

When you say those words, you have just qualified yourself for the job.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">A man in the making has someone very important backing him up, the presence of the One who is sending<\/font><strong><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">him<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Exodus 3:12, &#8220;So He said, &#8220;I will certainly be with you. And this shall be a sign to you that I have sent you&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> What a promise that wherever God sends any of us as His witnesses, He has promised to be with us<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Mathew 28:19, &#8220;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: vs. 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and,<u> lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world<\/u>.&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Those who are safe would rather stay away from Egypt but when you get a glimpse of what is in the heart of God like Moses, you will move from the comfort zone to where He would lead you. You have found freedom in Christ, you have escaped the wrath to come, what about those still bound in ?. Someone said,<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;If you don&#8217;t care much about the salvation of the sinners, you are not saved yourself be sure of that<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;, (paraphrased), scary thought for me to. I am getting more desperate for souls still trapped in Egypt but I am scared silly of going back to be the deliverer God wants me to be. Thanks be to God, I am a man in the making. I have seen, desired, drew closer, had revelation of who He is, His heart and what He requires of me, he is equipping me, sending me and promising to be with me all the way. When was the last time you told someone about Jesus? how about, &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Lord here I am send me<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;?<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Pray to God today that He will cause you to be a man or woman in the making in readiness to the calling He already has for you. A calling for the lost is not for some but all believers. His desire is that no one perish and because of that He is sending us. If you are going to worship God, desire also to reach people for God.<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">It&#8217;s easy to talk to God about people but hard to talk to people about God<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.

In this case, the Angel of the Lord was a visible manifestation of God, possibly the preincarnate Christ.

This fascinated Moses that he drew closer to see. <strong>Exodus 3:3, &#8220;And Moses said, &#8220;I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt<\/strong>&#8220;.

So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consume&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Always people want to be in comfortable places, comfortable home, job, ministry etc. When you talk about comfort, you will be referring to being set, nothing else to worry about, relaxed nothing further to pursue. I love comfort just like anybody else but I believe God brings us to certain levels that our comfort is<u><\/u><\/font><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">disrupted not by what He tells us but by what He reveals to us to see.<\/font><\/strong><\/u><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">It can be comforting to be in a place where you don&#8217;t have to deal with the past and that is the case with Moses. He was a special child to some capacity. In the times when Moses was born, the male born children to the Israelites were in danger as many of them were killed Moses being targeted too. He was hid to prevent him from being killed and was discovered by Pharaoh\u2019s daughter who had him raised for her as her son. From almost being killed, to being raised by Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter as a prince. As a prince, he had everything he could have wanted. Later he discovers he was a child of the slave, he chooses to suffer with his people. Later he kills someone from the kingdom he served in as a prince to defend his people then ran for his life. Coming to the Medianites, he has a chance to get his life back together, no more enemies after him and the life is now too good to be true.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Exodus 2:21, &#8220;Then Moses was content to live with the man (Jethro), and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses, and she bore him a son&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Moses was like the CEO of Jethro&#8217;s flock, he had a good wife, a healthy son,\u00a0 and everything is very normal and okay. What else would you desire, well you have your job that may be paying well, good family, living in good neighborhood, good car, money in the bank account, healthy, what else to live for? Just like Moses, it&#8217;s easy to be content with this kind of life to forget where you came from.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Be very careful about what you pray for. Pray for God to use you and your life can be disrupted but the question is, are you ready for change?<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Exodus 3:1, &#8220;Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u201d I can&#8217;t say Moses had been to this other part of the dessert before but I believe God was setting him up for something extra ordinary. See the desert was an ordinary place, a place where you never saw the unusual. And out of the ordinary, .<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Exodus 3:2, &#8220;And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consume<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. Sounds like the Lord was waiting for him, because out of the ordinary, Moses sees a burning bush and I can imagine him saying, &#8220;may be it&#8217;s one of the wild fire&#8221;, but what fascinated him was the fact that the bush was not being consumed. Anytime God begins to reveal Himself to us, we see things in the ordinary because He appears to us like that, the more you keep looking, you will begin to see that there is an extraordinary aspect of Him. All of a sudden Moses takes a closer look and he sees that bush is burning yes, but there is something about this bush, it&#8217;s not being consumed. He would have seen the bush and continued doing his stuff, and I know times we see something the Lord is doing and we conclude that it&#8217;s ordinary but look deeper, set your eyes upon Him, focus on Him, see far beyond the ordinary and natural and see the extra ordinary.<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">See what you believe, don&#8217;t believe what you see!!!.<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.

The clear lesson is that even prophets cannot presume to claim that their message is equal to that of the scriptures. Prophesies do not have the equal authority the bible has. Some prophesies have failed, God&#8217;s word has never failed.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 12:9, &#8220;So the anger of the Lord was aroused against them, and He departed, vs. 10. &#8220;&#8230;.suddenly Miriam became leprous, as white as snow&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">In the Old Testament brazen sin was often punished by God through leprosy. We can conclude that because of what they did, she was cursed. Another incident where I see God defending His servant after he was despised is in<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2Samuel 6:14, &#8220;Then David danced before the Lord with all his might&#8230;., vs. 16, &#8220;Now as the ark of the Lord came into the City of David, Michal, Saul&#8217;s daughter, looked through a window and saw king David leaping and whirling before the Lord; and<u> she despised him in her heart<\/u>&#8220;.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Michal was David&#8217;s wife and when she saw him worshipping the Lord, she despised him and the Lord was not happy about it why? in<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">vs. 23, &#8220;Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death&#8221;,<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">the Lord shut her womb<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">It&#8217;s clear to me that the Lord cares about people who serve Him in spirit and in truth and because of that,<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Isaiah 54:17, &#8220;No weapon formed against you (them) shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment, You shall condemn.<\/font><\/strong><strong><u> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, And their righteousness if from Me<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;, Says the Lord&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> If you speak or despise someone else who is busy doing the work of God, it will not work out and if it is you who is doing what the Lord requires of you, anything that someone speaks against you or despises you will not work for the Lord will defend his own because their righteousness is from Him.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 12:11, &#8220;So Aaron said to Moses, &#8220;Oh, my lord! please do not lay this sin on us, in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. Aaron and Miriam understood their need to ask for forgiveness over their rebellion. Tough to reconcile with someone you have wronged or has wronged you but that is where the healing is.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">James 5:16, &#8220;Confess your faults one to another, pray for one another that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. Instead of crying out to God to do something, they went to the one who they spoke against to reconcile with him that the healing could take place.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Numbers 12:13, &#8220;So Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, &#8220;Please heal her, O God, I pray<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;, same Moses spoken against is the same Moses who interceded for his sister&#8217;s healing. See the humble have mercy and compassion simply because they have received it at one time. They do not hold any grudges against people who wrong them. They are like Stephen who said,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;Father forgive them, do not hold this against them<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8221; while being stoned to death, Jesus who said, &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. Can you and I reach to that place where we cry, &#8220;Father forgive them for doing it whether they meant to or not?&#8221;.<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">The key is to release them, drop the charges and forgive<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Forgive is to let go what you are holding onto. His prayer to God was his sister would be healed and God honored the cry of His servant. Surprisingly enough, there are family members who have been separated for years because of un-forgiveness, no talking to each other, no crossing each other&#8217;s paths but this is what Jesus said,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Matthew 6:14 &#8220;For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. vs. 15,&#8221;But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. Roots of bitterness and un-forgiveness will cause you to continue to have leprosy without being healed. Miriam had to confess and her brother had to cry out to God for the healing would take place. Thank God for men like Moses who forgives and let&#8217;s go of what he should have been holding on to.

Aaron was appointed by God to be Moses&#8217; spokes man and later a priest to which he was faithful in his calling.

What constitutes to what is good in your life, must it be approved by people for it to be good? The bible does not say they spoke with Moses or spoke about Moses or spoke for Moses, the bible says they spoke against Moses. They opposed his marriage to someone they did not like, from a tribe they did not approve of. I&#8217;m puzzled a bit because not at any time did Moses do anything that was against the will of God. If God did not want him to marry the Ethiopian woman, God would have rebuked Moses for his actions. At times people want to conform you into what they want you to be and when you don&#8217;t, they will speak against you.<u><\/u><\/font><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">They don&#8217;t care much about what is good for you, they care about what is good to them for you<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Everything Moses had done by God\u2019s helped worked for them and the Israelites but now here is someone God brings into his life and these two were against it. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><u><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">vs. 2, &#8220;So they said (Miriam and Aaron), &#8220;Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us also? and the Lord heard it<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. What would you say about this scripture? I will point out that according to them, Moses had not done the will of God and another point is that they were as good as Moses was because God had spoken to them too. They became arrogant as they bragged about how the Lord had also spoken to them too. Moses was chosen by God when he did not even see himself as a leader and then given a task bigger than him. He knew that if he was going to do a good job, God had to be on his side therefore he humbled himself. Point to make,<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Those who are meek do not fight back in life. They learn the secret of surrender and yielding to God as God fights for them<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;.<\/font><\/u> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Note that Moses did not try to defend himself, try to explain even how God might have spoken to him about his marriage, he did not even reason with them for God who had brought him this far was the only one who could defend him.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Psalm 118:6, &#8220;The Lord is on my side; I will not fear:<\/font><\/strong><strong><u> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">what can man do to me<\/font><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">?&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Those who know their God will not fight things in the flesh, they will surrender it to God.<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Numbers 12:3, &#8220;Now the man Moses was very humble (meek), more humble than all men who were on the face of the earth<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. With this line someone would think that Moses must have been a weak person to allow people to walk all over him but that is not what it says. The bible says that Moses was meek (humble) which is means HIS STRENGTH WAS UNDER CONTROL. His meekness allowed God to deal with him differently. The prophets, God spoke to them in visions and dreams but to Moses<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">vs. 7, &#8220;Not so with My servant Moses; He is faithful in all My house, vs. 8. &#8220;I speak to him face to face, even plainly, and not in the dark sayings; And he sees the form of the Lord&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. The manner of relationship God had with Moses was because of his meekness and faithfulness that God would speak to him face to face.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">God was angry with Miriam and Aaron because of what they said against God&#8217;s servant Moses. He brought the three of them before Him and God defended Moses that day. Be careful not to speak things against God&#8217;s anointed, they may speak truth you may not want to hear. You might feel more qualified to do the job better than the anointed one but God who appointed them knew what He was doing. God has chosen them for a reason to accomplish things you and I could never accomplish. You don&#8217;t know what they have to go through to be where they are, not everyone is on their side but they are chosen. The meek ones doing God\u2019s work not for personal gain. Some are under pressure because one day they will give an account to their leadership.

Often times as we walk with the Lord we get distracted on the way and we loose focus and it takes us time to get back to where we need to be. Also few people get beaten by their own opinion about themselves especially affected and infected by their past and so they cannot progress. We know for sure that there is nothing good in man except Christ and in as much as we have failed miserably and we ought to be throne into the lake of fire, Christ in us cannot deny Himself but casting us away. The fact is we don&#8217;t deserve to live but the truth is He has called us His own. We are adopted to be sons and daughters of God.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">In Romans 7, Paul talks so much about struggling with sin, how he learnt what sin is all about, he tells us of what sin does and then he concludes the chapter in<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Romans 7:24, &#8220;O wretched man that I am, who shall rescue me from this body of death? 25, &#8220;Thanks be to God-through Jesus Christ our Lord!. So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God&#8217;s law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> He has discovered how he is vulnerable to sin but he does not leave it there for he is transitioning from what he knows about himself and puts everything aside and begins a new chapter on a positive thought because of who God is to him.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Romans 8:1, &#8220;There is therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">It&#8217;s very easy to dwell on who you used to be\u00a0 instead of looking at what the Lord is doing right now. We can&#8217;t deny the fact that we all have histories, we are all from the past, good things and bad things happened but mostly we concentrate on the bad things that happened. We keep on bringing to remembrance what the Lord forgave us of and forgot about. Instead progressing to the healing part of our growth, we keep falling back to the same things we thought we dealt with.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Have you ever assassinated victories in your life because you still dwelt on who you used to be? cried yourself to sleep, couldn&#8217;t reach level of trusting someone again with your life because of what they did to you, haunted by a memory, an incident, an accident and you can&#8217;t see clearly where you are going.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I am terrified of becoming who I used to be, just the thought of it makes me sick but I cannot undo what&#8217;s been done<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I cannot change where I have come from and I cannot waste my time trying to fix what has been broken<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. I am too wise for that, every time I bring to remembrance my past failures, I want them to remind me that they were the bridge the Lord would use to tailor me to become who I am today. If I don&#8217;t see my past as bridge, it&#8217;s time leave it in the sea of forgetfulness. As long as the past haunts you, ask the Lord for strength to put it behind you otherwise you will not move far in Christ. Paul tells us how wretched he was then he moves to the next verse and thanks the Lord for he is reminded that what he is not, he can be if Christ is in his life.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Philippians 3:13&amp;14, &#8220;Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended; but this is one thing I do, I forget those things which are behind reaching unto those things which are before, I press towards the mark of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ Jesus<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;.

The word press does not mean walk into it,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">but fight and pushing your way through, pressing also means applying some force<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">and that is resisting the past that tries to assassinate your move.

I am looking at the end result while I am still moving towards it. Talk to God about who you used to be and who you are and He will talk to you about the mark of His high calling in your life.

Paul tells us in the scripture in vs. 2 of the things we need to be aware of especially those who will try to deceive us, evil workers in fact he says be aware of dogs and the main thing he talks about is<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;have no confidence in the flesh&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Flesh is the no. 1 enemy of the Sprit that&#8217;s why we hear over and over again crucify the flesh. Paul had every reason to trust in the flesh because of his background but after learning more about Christ he counted all the knowledge, success, and where he came from as rubbish. King James version uses the word<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">dung<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> to describe which indicates worthless. My flesh surprises me many times, the reason I don\u2019t trust it even for a minute. Just when you think you have it under control, it will surprise you with something else. The bible says,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;flee youthful lusts&#8221;,<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">it does not say deal with it, fix it, pray over it or stay strong, it simply says<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;flee for your life<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. Samson thought with the anointing of God in his life he could play with sin to overcome it, well<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">sin is not a respecter of persons.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">We all know what happened to him but we can be like Joseph who ran for his life.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Vs. 10, &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering.

Knowing all that you know about your life and discovering that it&#8217;s nothing compared to what Christ is, you will be like Paul who saw himself and began to desire what Christ had. You will never desire what Christ has until you have you have counted all that you have (education, money, success as rubbish) not that they are but in comparison to Christ.\u00a0 He realizes that he needs more and he says, &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">that he may know him not<u> about Him<\/u> and the power of His resurrection meaning the power that He has to do the impossible things and feel a little bit of pain that He felt and through this he maybe made conformable unto His death&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">This should be our desire too.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Vs. 12-14, He reminds us that with all that he counted loss and he gained more of Christ. His desire at this moment is to forget those things which are behind and press on for the things which are before and that is Christ. To reach Christ is the goal that he had set for himself to gain Christ is the prize he would have attained.

I think it will be beneficial for you and for us as God expands us through this ministry. Believe me when I say, I have grown more in the word through the devotion ministry. Someone in the team asked me to share on the importance of water baptism.<\/p>\n<p>First, water baptism is not another form of salvation, it accompanies salvation. Second, it\u2019s not sprinkling of water, it\u2019s immersion a sign of burial. It\u2019s a demonstration or symbol of a believer\u2019s union with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection. Anyone who gets baptized and is not saved goes into the water a dry sinner only to come out a wet sinner with water baptism doing him or her nothing. I believe babies should not be baptized but dedicated. The reason being, baptism is left for those who are old enough to understand their sinful state, repents of their sins and puts their trust in Jesus Christ alone for their eternal salvation. They publicly demonstrate their trust in Christ by being baptized. To be baptized symbolizes the old man dies and buried and the new man is resurrected. Burial with Christ symbolizes that sin no longer has hold upon a believer.<\/p>\n<p>The ordinance of Christian baptism beautifully portrays this burial into Christ in which the old order of a death-controlled life comes to an end and the new order of a Christ-controlled life begins. Therefore, having already been justified, a believer tells that fact to the world by submitting to the ordinance of water baptism.<\/p>\n<p>It is vital to be baptized into Christ Jesus but only after repenting of our sins and putting our trust in Jesus alone for our eternal salvation and desiring to walk with Him only after we have been raised from the dead by the glory of the Father and now we walk not according to our old ways but according to the newness of Christ. To me it serves a reminder of what it means to live a new life. May I repeat again, baptism is not another form of salvation. You can go to heaven because you are saved yet not baptized but every believer is encouraged to be water baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. If you\u2019ve not been baptized and you are saved, I urge you to consider it a priority and if you are baptized and not saved, baptism is not your salvation, repent and be saved.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 6: 3, \u201cOr do you not know that \ufeffas many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus \ufeff \ufeffwere baptized into His death? \ufeff4\ufeff Therefore we were \ufeff\ufeffburied with Him through baptism into death, that \ufeffjust as Christ was raised from the dead by \ufeffthe glory of the Father, \ufeffeven so [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-745","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-c1","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/745","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=745"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/745\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=745"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=745"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=745"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":744,"date":"2007-07-23T18:37:16","date_gmt":"2007-07-23T18:37:16","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/07\/23\/need-to-be-in-uniform\/"},"modified":"2007-07-23T18:37:16","modified_gmt":"2007-07-23T18:37:16","slug":"need-to-be-in-uniform","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/07\/23\/need-to-be-in-uniform\/","title":{"rendered":"Need To Be In&nbsp;Uniform"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Good morning,<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">John 1:12, &#8220;As many as received Him, to them gave ye POWER to become the sons of God, even to them that believed in His name&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Ever had those days you just couldn&#8217;t function effectively like you should?

Fear has gripped your heart and you just can&#8217;t seem to get past it and move on. Don&#8217;t fret for God is present with a solution. In school we would give the teacher the right answers in math question only to learn that he was interested in how we arrived at the answer. Most of the time the answer was right but we couldn\u2019t tell the teacher how we arrived at it because we cheated. See the teacher wasn&#8217;t concerned about the answer being correct, he was concerned about how we arrived at it. The process to get to that answer is more important than the answer itself. So praying that God would lead you to that destination is better than praying, God let me find myself there.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><u><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">POWER is authority, ability, right, strength, control, influence<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.

In positions, people are not respected much because they are people, they are respected because of their ranks. Their ranks give them power to rule. The officers have power to enforce laws because of their positions and ranks. If you are stopped, their badge is what shows you that they have power to do what is right and if you were going to go against it, that badge will stop your mouth from saying, &#8220;You can do nothing to me&#8221;.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;As many as received Him, to them gave ye POWER to become, first a son and as a son, an over comer&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.

I don\u2019t know about you but I have learnt that God has no shortcuts for His people to get blessed despite the many teachings we hear especially with televangelists. I believe God would want us to move from expecting miracles to being blessed. Being blessed to me is a working progress. Let\u2019s see what Psalm 1 teaches us how to be blessed.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 1, Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful\u201d. It\u2019s interesting to note that the bible already calls you blessed when you are set apart from the world. This verse puzzled me for a very long time as I was not sure whether it meant I should not walk with the unbelievers. The verse does not mean we cannot walk with the unbelievers, it says we cannot go by their counsel (wisdom), thinking or their ways. To grow, your counsel and their\u00a0 counsel has to be replaced by His. The primary reason we should hang out with the unbelievers is to witness to them.<\/p>\n<p>To be blessed is vs. 2, to delight in the law of the Lord, and on His law, meditate day and night\u201d. Though we know the law is to tell what sin is, God uses it also to keep and safe and sound but you have to delight in it.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 3, \u201c He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper.\u00a0 Every tree is planted for a reason. Trees don\u2019t just grow for nothing and no one also plants trees for nothing. Some plant trees for beauty, shade, timber, fruits. God does plant His trees for fruit. He wants to see us grow. As a tree, we are planted by the river of the living water to bring forth fruit and as a branch in John 15\u00a0 we abide in Him that we may bear fruit. You can see that to be blessed you have to be connected to the right source. So what kind of fruit is the bible talking about, Galatians 5:22, \u201cBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law\u201d. I don\u2019t see how one can bear the fruit real quick. It takes time and growth. Do you realize the bible does not say produce fruit or grow fruit? It\u2019s because if we are planted by the river and are abiding, the fruit will come. Our leaves will not dry and whatever we do, we will prosper.<\/p>\n<p>God has planted us by His rivers and as He living water, He continuously flows in us. The river is not stagnant water but moving water always bringing in the fresh water. When the word of God dwells in our hearts daily and we pray and meditate on His word daily, we get continuous supply for our day to day. I believe that when we are planted by the His river, we get our nourishment everyday. We don&#8217;t need to struggle to stay good or be fruitful because it will happen without any struggle. Many will see the change in us and would desire to know where we are planted. Remember that everyone is planted by a certain river, the question is, which one? Christ gave the Samaritan woman the living water and she went back to be a witness in Samaria. She did not struggle to do it as she was now planted by the river of life. The more I see the fruit of the Spirit in my life, the more I consider myself blessed. It takes time because of the growth process but it\u2019s worth it.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 1:1-6, &#8220;&#8230; He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings fruit in it&#8217;s season&#8230;&#8221; I believe the opening chapter in the book of Psalm, down to a few verses is a guideline to being blessed of God.

He had not had a revelation from above to the true the holiness of God, therefore as the bible puts it in Romans 10:3, &#8220;For they being ignorant of God&#8217;s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God&#8221;. Any time you can think to yourself that, &#8220;I&#8217;m a little bit better&#8221; will be a sign of establishing your own righteousness.<\/p>\n<p>If you have someone or something blocking your view of the true thing, it&#8217;s easy to get satisfied by what is there. Why would I want to progress in my spiritual walk if I feel I have arrived? I am going to heaven, sounds good. I feel a little bit better compared to those who have not received Him. I give to the Lord, I make it to church, what more could the Lord require of me? I use to feel this way, I was comfortable about being saved and going to heaven that I did not want to do anything else besides that. Just when you feel comfortable, God will disrupt your life causing you to see something extraordinary. Something that has been clouding your way has to die and be removed. Remember there are two kingdoms here, King Uzziah&#8217;s and King Jesus&#8217;. As king Uzziah faded from the picture, Isaiah began to encounter with the God of holiness. Isaiah 6:1, &#8220;&#8230;I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple&#8221;. I believe that you can never see who you really are until you see who He really is. Seeing who He really is exposes you to who you really are in His light. As long as king Uzziah was alive, Isaiah had no understanding of who God was (is) because king Uzziah\u2019s living clouded his\u00a0 eyes to see Who He was (is)). Isaiah in this case first saw Him sitting on the throne, HE is the King. High and Lifted up, Worshipped; train of His robe filled the temple, covering everything exposed. vs. 2, &#8220;Above it stood seraphim; each with six wings: with two he covered his face, with two covered his feet, and with two he flew&#8221;, Holiness. If Seraphim is a heavenly being, a type of an angel, I would say he must be holier than us. Bowing before God, covering his face, everything that Isaiah may have known about holiness was shattered at that moment. And the angels cried one to another, &#8220;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory&#8221;. Of all the things that describe the nature of God, none has been repeated more than once as the word &#8220;holy&#8221;. You don&#8217;t hear, faithful, faithful, faithful\u00a0 but &#8220;Holy&#8221; always mentioned three times. Holiness is what God requires of us, 1Peter 1:16 &#8220;Be holy for I am holy&#8221;. The holiness is not based on men&#8217;s standard but God&#8217;s. The holiness of God humbles me to the fact that I\u2019m undone. Not only did Isaiah see the holiness of God, he also saw that he had not worshipped the God of holiness. I am always reminded by God that I am not there yet even though He has used me mightily. I am grateful to be reminded to keep pursuing more and more. So Isaiah&#8217;s standard of holiness has been disrupted, what will he do about it?.<\/p>\n<p>His response, Isaiah 6:5, &#8220;So I said, &#8220;woe is me for I am undone!..&#8221;. Just like I Isaiah, we are not complete yet, whether God has used us mightily or not, we are not there yet. Why drift back when you haven&#8217;t reached yet? why relax and be comfortable because you established your righteousness by looking at someone&#8217;s life? Pray that God will let all the king Uzziah&#8217;s in your life die that you may see Him as He is and in turn open your eyes to see yourself in His true light and confess just like Isaiah did. I will finish this tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Isaiah 6:1-9, &#8220;In the year king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord&#8230;&#8221; At the introduction of the book of Isaiah chapter 6 shows us the preparation of Isaiah\u2019s life to respond to the call God had for him. &#8220;In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord&#8221;, I am yet to study [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-742","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-bY","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/742","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=742"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/742\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=742"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=742"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=742"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":741,"date":"2007-07-16T17:59:34","date_gmt":"2007-07-16T17:59:34","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/07\/16\/like-a-deer-by-sarah-susan\/"},"modified":"2007-07-16T17:59:34","modified_gmt":"2007-07-16T17:59:34","slug":"like-a-deer-by-sarah-susan","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/07\/16\/like-a-deer-by-sarah-susan\/","title":{"rendered":"Like A Deer, by Sarah&nbsp;Susan"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><font size=\"2\"><\/font><!-- Converted from text\/rtf format --><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Good morning,<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">There are some specific animals in the bible with some characteristics that are symbolic to a message it&#8217;s passing across and for us to learn and to relate to. We hear about the Lamb of God, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, The righteous are as bold as a lion, a dove descending on Jesus as a sign of the Holy Spirit, etc. Let&#8217;s talk about deer and it&#8217;s characteristics that applies to us.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Song of Songs 4:5 speaks about fawns (deer) of the gazelle that browse among the lilies. How is the deer described in the bible and it&#8217;s symbol? Let&#8217;s find out<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">1 Psalms<strong> 18 : 33 states&#8221; He makes my feet like that of a deer; He enables me to stand on the heights<\/strong>&#8220;. What is making of our feet as that of a deer? Just imagine the feet \/running of a deer &#8211; the swiftness, the speed, the strength, etc are the highlighting features. When a tiger runs towards it, the rapid speed at which it runs is simply superb. In spiritual terms, when there is sin enticing (symbolic of the tiger), are we galloping like the deer or faltering or stumbling? How are our feet in this wicked world? Can be they compared to that of a deer? Isaiah 40: 30 says that even the young men may stumble and fall, they may grow weary. This is the order of nature. But verse Isaiah 40:29 states ,<strong>it is God who gives strength and increases the power of the weak. He<\/strong> can strengthen our feet like that of a deer and enable us to stand on the heights.. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2. Psalms<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> 42:1 &#8220;As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God, My soul thirsts for God, the living God, When can I go and meet with God?&#8221;<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Are we like the deer panting for streams of water, for the springs of water welling upto eternal life- Jesus the source of the living water?? What are we panting for? King David, with his vast army, kingdom ,wealth, mansions and what not, was panting for meeting God&#8230;What an awesome experience ! <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">3. Job 39:1-4 God speaks to Job about the doe bearing her fawn, their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds. This verse speaks about the young of the doe which thrive, or rather prosper, succeed ,luxuriate. How do they thrive? And then become strong in the wilds\u2026 We also ought to gain strength from the Lord and thrive. The next point in the verse is that they leave where they are born and do not return. Yes, at last, we ought not to return the wicked world but to our dear Lord\u2026\u00a0 Our hope is for our eternal Home\u2026There are some instances in the Bible where His children were asked to leave certain situations. Abraham in Genesis 12:1 was asked to leave his father\u2019s household, his country. There is a usual tendency to become complacent in our own place. May be, we have to move\/leave some places according to God\u2019s direction to learn dependence on Him, rather than our own household, kith\/kin. Psalms 45: 10 also explains this context. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">4. Dueteronomy 14:3-5 certifies deer to be a clean animal. Bible classifies animals as clean and unclean based on certain characteristics- split hoof which is completely divided and that which chews the cud. Chewing the cud is to eat initially and later draw the food back to the mouth to be thoroughly chewed, bit by bit, rather enjoyed in a cool manner- for better digestion\/ absorption of the nutrients. Deer does this . We also ought to read the Word of God and also keep meditating on it , enjoying it, rethink it , digest as we draw the full strength \/nutrition of it. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">5. Strong antlers (horns) of a deer are basically for its protection against\u00a0 the enemy. While fighting, it first attacks the enemy with its antlers (horns) to bruise it&#8217;s attacker that it may flee. We too should possess the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God so that the enemy cannot attack us. The deer in Song of Songs is found to be browsing among the lilies, rather grazing on the pastures. What are we browsing ???Where are we grazing? Is it on the green pastures of the Lord- church with sound doctrine?? <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Every minute thing in nature, created by the Wonderful Almighty speaks \/narrates His greatness, His wisdom, which none can fathom.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">In Christ<br \/>\n<\/font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Sis Sarah<\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, There are some specific animals in the bible with some characteristics that are symbolic to a message it&#8217;s passing across and for us to learn and to relate to.

Let&#8217;s get to the word,<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">The world is full of chaos, confusion, murder, hatred in short, a scary world. It&#8217;s a world\u00a0 that God\u2019s hand has to be on for the sake of His people living in it. Many have prayed that they would be taken out of it but Jesus said in<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">John 16:33, &#8220;These things have I spoken unto you, that in Me you might have peace, in the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Hymn<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;Because He lives, I can face tomorrow, because He lives, all fear is gone. Because I know He holds the future and life is worth a living, just because He lives&#8221;<u> We need Jesus now more than ever.<\/u><\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">In order for us to make it in life, we got to have faith in God<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Faith in God can move mighty mountains and calm troubled seas. Faith is the wheel that allows God to accomplish what He has promised.<\/font><\/strong><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Many are not willing to let go off step two to move to step three because of fear and doubt. You have to let go of a then to hold on to a now faith<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.<\/font><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Faith is good for us but when and where do we apply it? All of us have faith but what kind of faith is the question? Lazarus was dead, mourners assembled to mourn his death and burry his body. Jesus had been told earlier that His friend Lazarus was sick to a point of death. Jesus did not come immediately when He heard of Lazarus condition until he died and was buried. Here comes Jesus and some of the questions that might have ran through the minds of those who knew how close He was to Lazarus might have been, \u201cwhere was He when His friend was sick\u201d?, how come He did not show up when he died or even help bury His friend if there was nothing He could do. Jesus let Lazarus die for a reason, He knew what He was doing. Lazarus resurrection was going to be bigger than healing he may have received had Jesus come when he was sick. Have you ever been in a situation where you trusted God for something and as time went by, the situation got worse and worse and you still called on Him? That is what Mary and Martha felt. Jesus was their best friend but when they needed Him the most, He wasn&#8217;t there to help.<\/font><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">He makes all things beautiful in His time<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> says the bible. You know what? whether He came or not when I needed Him the most doesn&#8217;t matter anymore, His presence right now matters a lot. Let&#8217;s look at Martha&#8217;s first response when He sees Jesus,<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> &#8220;Lord if you had been here, my brother would have not died&#8221;<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">This is past faith, don\u2019t allow yourself to live in the past faith. Jesus tries to bring her into the present and she jumps to the future faith<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last days&#8221;<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">There is nothing wrong with the future faith, currently you need the \u201cNOW\u201d faith. Jesus talked of the \u201cNOW\u201d faith when He said,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;I am the resurrection and the life&#8221;,<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Mark the word \u201c<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I am\u201d<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">not \u201c<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I was\u201d<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">or \u201c<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I will be\u201d<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, He is<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Jehovah Shammah meaning present<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, God of now therefore transfer your faith from the past and from the future and allow Him to be the Lord of your \u201cnow\u201d situation. Keep on talking to Him about your past and what could have happened if this and that took place, He will talk to you about now. He is not intimidated by yesterday\u2019s things as He is such a Master craftsman, He knows that He can take what is broken and set it on the wheel that it might become what He said it will be despite the condition in which it is in right now. Lazarus was sick then died but that still did not intimidate the Master.<\/font><u><\/u><u><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">He may delay but He will not be defeated<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. The delay is not assign He couldn\u2019t make it on time, the delay is to get more glory in the situation. He is the Lord who calls those things which are not as though they were.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Stop living in the future too as you will be wasting today&#8217;s blessings that come through today&#8217;s faith<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Do not wait till you get to heaven to enjoy what God has for you down here on earth. He has said be of good cheer, I have overcome the world. I want to trust Him today as<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">today&#8217;s faith tailors me for tomorrows victories<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">.<\/font><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">My desire is to always have faith in God at a given moment and trust Him with the condition of my situation. It&#8217;s not easy to trust God when something that you knew could turn out good is dead especially dreams and desires but who else can we run to?<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I can&#8217;t give up now<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, I have come from too far to give up and give in.

Anytime someone is bleeding, they try as much as possible to stop the open wound from bleeding why? Because blood is precious, without it in the body, a person can die. What is the work of the blood that makes it precious? Blood carries gases, nutrients and waste products throughout our bodies. Blood also fights infections, heals wounds and performs many other vital functions. There is no substitute for blood. It cannot be made or manufactured.<\/p>\n<p>In the old testament time, there was something about the blood sacrifice. People who sinned gave blood sacrifice of bullocks, sheep and goats to make atonement for their souls. All this pacified God but did not satisfy Him. The blood in the old testament only covered sin until the Lamb of God, who was, who is and is to come came down on the face of the wrapped in flesh and blood and offered Himself as a sacrifice by shading His blood precious blood on the cross for the sins of the world. He was the offerer and the offering and He came to take care of what other bloods only covered. While hanging on the cross, a Roman soldier pierced Him on the side and out of His side came water and blood for the sins of world. His blood was so powerful that it washed away our sins. \u201cWhat can wash away my sin?, nothing but the blood of Jesus; what can make me whole again?, nothing but the blood of Jesus; Oh precious is that flow, that makes me white as snow; no other fount I know, nothing but the blood of Jesus\u201d What other bloods could not screen, the blood of the Lamb screened it and took care of it. Not only did the blood take care of what we did, it also took care of what we could have done, what we thought about doing. If it were not for the blood, think about it for a moment, do you know who you would be today? I don&#8217;t know who and where I would be today had it not been for the blood. For sure I would be bleeding to death in my sins. The bible makes is clear, \u201cThe life of the flesh is in the blood\u201d and the life of the gospel is in the blood the makes atonement for the flesh. Hebrews 9:22, \u201c\u2026without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d (NIV)<\/p>\n<p>The life of the flesh is in the blood, if the body stops functioning like Abel&#8217;s, the blood will still speak out of the body because the blood can speak. And God hears the blood when it speaks. The devil knows the blood is against him and he knows that he has no power over those with the blood of the Lamb marked on the doorpost of their hearts. I remember a another song we would sing, \u201cI\u2019m gonna hide right under the blood where the devil can do me no harm\u201d. \u201cThere is power, wonder working power in the blood\u201d The blood of Jesus is what ties the blacks and the whites together, the rich and the poor, the young and the old. God does not look at who we are in the natural, He is looking for the color of the blood (RED)) and as long as we have the blood of His son marked on the door post of our hearts<\/p>\n<p>Choose to apply the blood of the Lamb on the doorpost of you heart, bring all your activities under the blood, bring your thoughts, actions, destiny, family, friends, work colleagues under the blood. God said to the children of Israel, &#8220;When I see the blood, I will pass over you&#8221;. Meaning that the angel of death, destruction, confusion shall have no power over you when you are under the blood. The devil is extremely afraid of the blood cause the blood is against Him. So hide right under the blood where the devil can do you no harm. I also believe that when God sees the blood on us, He will bless us, minister to us and encourage us. Rev 12:11, &#8220;And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the words of their testimony&#8221;, The blood of the Lamb is highly recommended.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Leviticus 17:11, \u201cFor the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.

Was blind but now I see&#8221;. What so amazing about the grace that the writer of the hymn had just to begin it that way. Yesterday the message of grace kept on pondering in my mind heart\u00a0 I had to find out what it&#8217;s all about. Yes I know what it does but my question was, &#8220;What&#8217;s so amazing about it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The good news in the NT is God&#8217;s acceptance of us by grace alone. The word &#8220;GRACE&#8221; in Hebrew are hesed and hen which means undeserved love and favor. God is love, and grace is the out flowing of His love toward undeserving sinners. Grace is love in action. For God so loved the world that He gave (action word). We are making it because of the favor of God. Eph 2:8&amp;9, &#8220;For it&#8217;s by grace that we&#8217;ve been saved through faith and not of ourselves, it is the gift of God and not of works lest any man should boast of&#8221;. I did not earn salvation by myself but by grace. Now you will say wait a minute Ev, I am the one who went to church that night, when they made the altar call, I said well since I am here and it doesn&#8217;t cost me anything to go to the front, I will go and kneel down and say the sinners prayer and I will be saved\u201d. As you can see there are a lot of &#8220;It&#8217;s&#8221; meaning I did all until I gave my life to Christ. No, it&#8217;s God who drew you to church that day or wherever you got saved, He planted the right brought His conviction on you, place words of truth into your heart and He caused you to believe, He put a desire for you to go to the front and He got you saved by His grace. The bible says that a man cannot come to the Lord unless he is drawn of the Father, John 6:44. So we need to be reminded that we&#8217;ve been saved by the grace of God, grace fought for us in the courts of law when the judgment had been passed that we were guilty. Were it not for grace and mercy, we would still be dead in sin.<\/p>\n<p>2Cor 12:9, &#8220;But He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, my strength is made perfect in weakness&#8221;. This is a message that came to Paul while He was going through something that he did not understand. He had no proper words to describe it, he called it a thorn in the flesh. The bible says that he prayed three times that it would be removed and instead of God removing it, He gave him the grace to endure. The amazing grace will cause you to endure hardship, making you comfortable and not happy in the situation you are in. His grace is more than enough to keep you intact until He has rescued you. After knowing that His grace would keep him, he rejoiced in his infirmities as he understood that this too would pass. Lord if you do not change the situation and circumstances I am in, please let your grace be more than enough to keep me on hold position.<\/p>\n<p>Heb 4:16, &#8220;Therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness that you obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need&#8221;. Already we have established a foundation about grace being a favor not something worked for or earned. Anytime we deal with grace, we understand that we have a debt that we need to pay but because of the favor of the Lord, we are exempt from it as Jesus paid it on the cross when He died. The grace of God makes it possible to be real. We can stand before God in our fig leaves, knowing we are accepted and beloved. Listen to this, the grace of God does not compromise the holiness of God but provides a way out. Now that we have been accepted as beloved we have been given the keys to access the throne of grace when we need mercy and grace to help in time of need. I always go to the throne of Grace for I am a working progress in this life being perfected everyday, growing in holiness. When you have grace, you will not disgrace yourself and the people around you.<\/p>\n<p>To sum up, God in His kindness saved me a dirty wretched sinner by His grace through His Son without compromising His Holiness by providing a way out, that\u2019s what makes grace so amazing. Would you like to share with me what makes grace amazing in your life?<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Cor 12:9, &#8220;&#8230; My grace is sufficient for you&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; Hymn: &#8220;Amazing grace, how sweet that sounds that saved a wretch like me, I once was lost but not I am found.

Said something that was taken out of context? or people misunderstood what you said?. There is power in the little thing in our bodies called the tongue. The tongue has landed so many people into trouble. As much as what people do can destroy, what people say can do even a greater damage and it&#8217;s because what has been done can quickly heal unlike what has been said stays in the memory. Friendships have been broken due to what came out of the tongue. Husbands and wives have ended up in greater fights because of the tongue.<\/p>\n<p>Proverbs 18:22, says &#8220;Death and life is in the power of the tongue&#8230;&#8221;, as you can see, the tongue is a very small instrument in our bodies but has power. James gives us an example of how powerful the tongue is vs. 4 where he says, &#8220;&#8230;ships: although they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires&#8221; and so is the tongue, it has power to control the entire body. The tongue can start fire spreading like wild fire and very fast. The fire is never satisfied when it is consuming and so is the tongue. In school as a teenager, my mouth always landed me into trouble. I never had strength to physically fight the reason I fought with my tongue. I always got beaten because of my mouth. Had I watched my tongue\u2026. James again says in vs. 6, &#8220;And the tongue is a fire of world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature&#8221;. It&#8217;s by the tongue that cussing and swearing comes about; backbiting and gossip; all lies are spread by the tongue; deception and misleading mostly come through the tongue; persuasion is another result of what the tongue can do. There is so much that the tongue can do and yet James 3:8, says &#8220;But no man can tame the tongue&#8221;. We use the tongue to scold, to nag, to slander, to quarrel, can no man tame. Under pressure and anger, people have said things that should have not come out of their mouths at all. What was released by the tongue damaged big time in small a mount of time.<\/p>\n<p>The bible does not say that the tongue cannot be tamed, it only tells us man cannot tame it Each of us has a tongue and a voice. These instruments of speech can be used destructively or employed constructively. Death and life is in the power of the tongue the bible tells us and that shows me that I can either speak life or speak death in my life or in someone&#8217;s life. But we cannot use the same tongue to speak death and life, James 3:9, &#8220;With it (tongue) we bless our God, and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God&#8221; vs. 10 &#8220;Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not just talking about what you say that affect others but what you say that affects you. Many speak death in their own lives, they speak defeat, and they speak curses in their lives. Instead of taking that precious little thing the tongue and using it to speak destiny, hope and courage, they use it as knife cutting their own throats. No wonder many fall in depression and sickness for they have taken their tongue and used it as a lethal weapon to bring destruction to themselves. You can tell the outworking of the internal by what someone has inside. Luke 6:45, says &#8220;&#8230;of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks&#8221; and with this verse you can tell what someone has inside as that is what will come out. The tongue is the manifestation of what is inside for it&#8217;s used to bring out what is harbored inside. As said earlier, man cannot tame the tongue but God can for what gets out of men&#8217;s control does not get out of God&#8217;s control. We need to bring our tongue under God\u2019s control and make it an instrument of blessing and praise. Only God can control it if we yield to Him. I hate to destroy with my tongue, and I hate to say things that will hurt my friends, family or anyone for I know the damage the tongue can bring. I have regretted many times to have said something that to me was okay but to someone else it wasn&#8217;t for it hurt them dearly. At times I tend to think that what I can take, someone else too can take it but that is a lie from the pits of hell. My tongue and your tongue ought to be used to build and not tear; bless and not curse; promote and not demote; uplift and not bring down. It&#8217;s in the process of yielding to the Lordship of Jesus Christ that we learn the art of using our tongue the Godly way.<\/p>\n<p>You will never bring your tongue under God&#8217;s control until you realize you need it controlled. Isaiah 6:5, &#8220;So I said, woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips (tongue), And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts&#8221;. Isaiah could not see what the damage his tongue was doing until his eyes saw the Lord of hosts and how Holy He is and then realized who he was. Isaiah 6:7, &#8220;And he touched my mouth with it (live coal), and said: &#8220;Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged&#8221;. With his admission and confession, he humbled himself and the Lord touched his lips (tongue) with a live coal. Live coal will burn but it will do you and I good. Isaiah was not ready for service until a transformation took place in his life. Where are you with your tongue? what damages has it done? have you asked for forgiveness from those that you hurt with your words? are you gossiping behind someone&#8217;s back? &#8220;Remember that he\/she who tells you about others, tells others about you&#8221;.

This was no rehearsed, practiced, scripted worship, this was a decision made, action taken type of worship holding nothing back. Once again four gospels reported what they witnessed in their own words and reporting what impacted them.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about a problem that arose when she worshiped. Mathew is very lenient, he brings all the disciples to the same level without pin pointing one person. Read what he says, Mathew 26:8, &#8220;But His disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, &#8220;Why waste? Vs 9, &#8220;For this fragrant oil might have been sold for much and given to the poor&#8221;.\u00a0 It appears that the people\u2019s reaction was that Jesus was not worthy of this kind of worship. He did not deserve an expensive worship. The truth of the matter is, worshipping Christ will cost you something. That is why we sing \u201cWe bring the sacrifice of praise\u201d.\u00a0 Sacrifice goes with surrender. David was given a piece of land to offer sacrifice to the Lord, he refused to take it for free and offered money to buy it. Listen to what he said to the king who offered to give him the land for free, 2 Samuel 24:24, &#8220;Then the king said to Araunah, \u201cNo, but I will surely buy it from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God with that which costs me nothing.\u201d Worshipping the Lord is costly.<\/p>\n<p>Luke is different, he gets into more details, Luke 7:39, &#8220;Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, &#8220;This Man, if He were a prophet, would know what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner&#8221;. The moment she walked in through the door, she had already been labeled and despised therefore anything good that she was going to do from then forward was not going to considered at all. By listening to the Pharisee speak, to him Jesus being in his house gave him an idea that he was a good righteous man. Paul tells us in Romans 7:18, &#8220;For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh&#8230;&#8221; This sums up the life of human beings that nothing good dwells in the life of man. To say more, the Pharisee changed his mind about Christ when he said \u201cThis Man, if He were a prophet\u2026\u201d To him being a prophet suggested handling only a certain class of people. He also had a wrong perception of Jesus for Jesus was more than a prophet.<\/p>\n<p>To talk more about the Pharisee, he no longer referred to him as Jesus but this Man. It was\u00a0 no longer Christ but some questioned prophet who does not discern or create boundaries as to who He should be in contact with. Mark responds to people&#8217;s action differently, he does not mention the Pharisee neither does he mention the disciples, all he says is that some people questioned it. He goes a head and even talks about the price of the oil to show how expensive it was. He continues to say that they criticized her sharply.<\/p>\n<p>John says something about people&#8217;s reaction; remember that John is very specific. At first, he identified the woman, and then identifies someone else who questioned the act of this woman. John 12:4, &#8220;But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot&#8230;.said, vs. 5, &#8220;Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?&#8221; This is what I call having people tell you what you should and shouldn&#8217;t do when it comes to worshipping the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>This woman Mary had counted the cost of worshipping, she knew it was an expensive worship. She was sacrificing something precious to her, having learnt like David that she will not offer to the Lord what cost her nothing. No one could define how she needed to worship for it was not about the people but Jesus. With that said, who defines how you worship Him? When you worship, is it costing you? Are you giving the Lord what is LEFT (remaining) or what is RIGHT (just)?

As Mathew, Mark, Luke and John gave the account of what happened based on what I believe impacted them. Let me also pick out something out each of their report to show what impacted me.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">All the four gospels say the woman came in with an alabaster flask of very costly spikenard. Mark goes on to add in<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Mark 14:3<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, &#8220;..<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Then she broke the flask<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8230;&#8221;, this is something that I don&#8217;t take lightly because it has really taught me what worship is all about. This woman who John tells us is Mary teaches us what worship is all about. The fact that she broke the flask has a lot to say about worship. In church it&#8217;s easy to be cool, calm, and collected, and by that I mean, it\u2019s easy to control how you worship. That is like opening a flask and pouring the amount of oil you want to pour out and closing it back. You have the power to control what comes out meanwhile a broken person like the flask (jar) has no time to control. You break a jar with liquid in it, it&#8217;s impossible to control the flow, you cannot even collect what has been poured out, you try it this way, and it comes out the other way. You cannot save what you have broken but He can. If you open it then I assure you that you can save it. Any thing you carefully open may be something you are not ready to loose. What comes out of something broken does not stay in one place, it spreads out finding paths to flow in. Is this not the case with worship, it flows freely from a broken heart,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Psalm 34:18, \u201cThe LORD is near to those who have a broken heart, And saves such as have a contrite spirit\u201d<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. They are not ashamed to look foolish worshipping the Lord, they do not care about who sees them and what they say about their style of worship. They are just glad that Jesus saved them when they were a wretched sinners and this is their way of showing gratitude to the one who deserves all worship.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Here comes Luke telling us more about what she did. Of all the people that were in that house, Jesus was the one who deserved to be worshipped, instead of the rest learning and joining the woman in worshipping, they got caught up in what she was doing.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Luke 7:38, &#8220;and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with her tears, and wiped them with her hair and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. Doesn&#8217;t sound like a woman who is cool, calm and collected, sounds like a woman who is ready to do whatever it takes to glorify the Son of God regardless of who is around her. We tend to be cautious about who is around us when we worship, trying to be dignified and looking holy. At times tempted to stop someone who is pouring him or herself to the Lord because we are not comfortable with the way they worship. Everyone wants to stop this woman from doing what she is doing but is not kicking her away or ordering her to be taken away, why? because He loves the worship. Giving all that she&#8217;s got and then some when no one else could. What more does John have to tell me that will impact me,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">John 12:3, &#8220;&#8230;And the house was filled with fragrance of the oil<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. Her act changed the atmosphere of the house, her worship drew every one&#8217;s attention not just to the woman but Jesus because I believe many saw how they had walked with Jesus but never actually worshipped Him the way He should have been worshipped. What does this very simple woman have to teach us about worship? Brokenness causes you to give all. Anyone around you shouldn&#8217;t define how you worship, only Jesus deserves worship, and what you give could be a fragrance that would fill the room affecting everyone and impacting everyone. To continue.

Hope you are blessed. By the way, My wife and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary yesterday. We thank God for this far He has brought us.<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u00a0 <\/font><br \/>\n<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Of the four gospels, Mathew, Mark, Luke and John we have four writers who are writing what they witnessed under the ministry of Jesus. The four were impacted in different ways and you will see how they were each impacted by the account of their story. Though they all may have seen the same thing, they did not report exactly the same way. Yes there are different accounts each of them give of certain incidents but there are some incidents that all of them did not report. In what I will share is about an incident that involves a woman who came Jesus with an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Mathew reports this incident in Mathew 26:6 going forward, while Mark reported it in Mark 14:3 going forward; Luke takes the time to report it in Luke 7:36 going forward while John reports it in John 12:1. Reading all the four accounts of their report, the story is the same but each of them takes the time to address certain things that others did not report.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u00a0 <\/font><br \/>\n<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Why would each record the same differently with some leaving things out and add some stuff in? Here is my thinking every was impacted and touched differently and that is what they reported. What captures your heart is what you are most likely to report. What you respond to the most is what you will work towards. How you are really impacted may not be the way I will be impacted but we still report about the same story. I would like to address each of their accounts and we will arrive at the common denominator. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Mathew says, they were all in the Bethany in the house of Simon the leper. He first identified where they were and whose house they were in. He also tells us the condition of the owner. He doesn&#8217;t&#8217; take time to tell us who Simon the leper&#8217;s background was, his tribe, the condition of his heart. Mark comes along and reports the same thing Mathew reports in his first line. Luke comes along and does not give us the man&#8217;s name but tells us that he was a Pharisee. Mathew and Mark&#8217;s were touched by the fact that Jesus was hanging out with the sick, as for Luke, he was touched by the fact that Jesus was in the <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">house of a Pharisee, the people who really opposed Jesus. What does John have to say? John starts by talking about the presence of Lazarus who had died and had been raised from the dead by Jesus, he was impacted by the fact that a man who was once dead was a live seating with them at the table for Passover. Four same first accounts but different beginnings.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u00a0 <\/font><br \/>\n<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Their report is on a woman who came in with an alabaster flask of. Whether she was invited or not we are yet to find out. As she comes in, I don&#8217;t believe that she is noticed until she does something that takes everyone&#8217;s breathe away. Mathew, Luke and Mark just refers to her as the woman, a sinful woman, what she did blew their mind but when John takes the time to report, I can imagine him going to do an interview to find out who this woman was, &#8220;please give me her name&#8221; and discovers that the woman&#8217;s name was Mary. Different accounts and different stories and how they have been reported give us a better understanding of what really happened. Putting those pieces together gives us a full picture of where they were, whom they encountered with, their names, the incidents etc.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Is it possible not to always rely on one side of the story? You figure it out.<\/font><br \/>\n<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u00a0 <\/font><br \/>\n<font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">My first point as I close today, what you have seen and experienced and has impacted your heart, is what you are likely to report but there will always be a common denominator where all will touch on or agree on. Like we have said before, we are not the same, God has given us individualities that each of us has a way to be impacted and impact others by our stories of life and how He has brought us this far. To be continued.

These visits are the start of a series of lessons that results in Joseph\u2019s getting gold plates that were allegedly buried in Hill Cumorah, just a few miles south of Palmyra, in Manchester, New York.\u00a0 In 1827, Joseph allegedly receives from the angel Moroni the gold plates that were buried in Hill Cumorah. Written on them in \u201cReformed Egyptian\u201d is the history of a previously unknown New World people. With the help of God Joseph translates the writing into what is now the Book of Mormon.\u00a0 What the book of Mormon teaches is that Salvation, a word that Mormons qualify in one of three ways: unconditional or general salvation is simply resurrection from the dead, granted to all through Christ\u2019s atonement; conditional or individual salvation involves entering the celestial kingdom through works of Mormonism; full salvation means exaltation to become a God as a result of temple ceremonies and other works (Farkas, J. R., &amp; Reed, D., A. (1997, c1995). Mormonism: Changes, contradictions, and errors (electronic ed.).\u00a0 An angel of God would not contradict the Word of God, and we certainly cannot become a god ourselves, that is idolatry!<\/p>\n<p>Mormonism is a self \u2013 righteous system that can earn their own salvation through good works.\u00a0 If one could earn salvation then who needs Jesus Christ to die for the sin of the world.\u00a0 John 3:16, 1 Peter 3:18, and numerous other verses of Scripture make this plane.\u00a0 \ufeff\u201cFor by grace you have been saved \ufeff\ufeffthrough faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of \ufeff\ufeffworks, lest anyone should \ufeff\ufeffboast (Eph 2:8, 9).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Remember that Satan masquerades as an \u201cangel of light\u201d (2 Cor. 11:14).\u00a0 There is only one God, not many, as the Mormons propose, (Isaiah 43:10 \u2013 11; 44:6, 45: 5 \u2013 6, 21b \u2013 22) all other \u201cgods\u201d are idols (1 Cor. 16:26, Exodus 30:3, 23).\u00a0 The God of the Bible created the entire universe (Gen 1:16; Psa. 8:3; Jer. 31:35).\u00a0 Jehovah (translated as \u201cLORD\u201d in all caps) and Elohim (translated as \u201cGod\u201d) are the same being (Duet 4:35; 1 Kings 8:60; Psalm 100:2).\u00a0 Jesus and Satan are not brothers, as put forth in Mormonism.\u00a0 Jesus is surely the only way to Heaven. \u201cNor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>May you help Mormons find their way to the truth lest they end up in Hell for all eternity!<br \/>\nUntil the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201cFriendship Evangelism that doesn\u2019t seek a way to quickly tell people about their eternal fate is the ultimate betrayal of trust.\u00a0 How can we call ourselves a friend of someone we don\u2019t bother to warn of terrible danger?\u00a0 Friends don\u2019t let friends go to hell\u00a0\u00a0 (Ray comfort).\u201d I realize that these messages are [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-728","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-bK","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/728","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=728"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/728\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=728"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=728"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=728"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":729,"date":"2007-06-28T18:44:46","date_gmt":"2007-06-28T18:44:46","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/06\/28\/what-gospel-do-you-believe-4-by-pastor-phil\/"},"modified":"2007-06-28T18:44:46","modified_gmt":"2007-06-28T18:44:46","slug":"what-gospel-do-you-believe-4-by-pastor-phil","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/06\/28\/what-gospel-do-you-believe-4-by-pastor-phil\/","title":{"rendered":"What Gospel do you believe 4? By Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ (Gal 1:6-7).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Paul was marveled at those that decided to jump ship from the real gospel to a false gospel.\u00a0 As I have been going through this series, God has put this series on my heart to convey His heart about false gospels as compared to the only true gospel.\u00a0 How does one know that although God is not surprised by yet angry with these other gospels?\u00a0 Recall this occurrence of Jesus in the gospel of John.\u00a0 \u201cAnd when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers\u2019 money, and overthrew the tables\u201d (John 2:15).\u00a0 It is clear that God opposes all while God opposes error and sin, he is especially passionate about expressing this opposition when error and sin come into his house and when his children are affected.\u00a0 Another error, false gospel that has become very popular at this time is the gospel of the emergent church.\u00a0 \u201cThe Emerging Church movement consists of a diverse group of people who identify with Christianity, but who feel that reaching the postmodern world requires us to radically reshape the church\u2019s beliefs and practices to conform to postmodernism.<\/p>\n<p>Postmodern rejects the fact that words have meaning which causes them to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d the language of texts (including Scripture), redefining the words and reinterpreting the texts to mean whatever they feel as they have an encounter with the text\u2019s language\u201d (Apologetics index).\u00a0 Ravi Zechariahs in his message postmodernism and philosophy brings out a question that was asked on a TV program,\u00a0 \u201cDo words have meaning, or does the speaker reserve the right to fuse his or her own words, with his or her own meaning?\u00a0 Is there a point of reference for language, or does the speaker determine the right to say whatever he or she wants, and mean whatever he or she wants?\u00a0 The program put out a survey to hear from the world on this issue.\u00a0 If words have no meaning how can one see meaning in the question itself?\u00a0 The surveyors responded that words do not have any meaning the speaker reserves the right to fuse in his or her own meaning.\u00a0 A second question asked, does morality have any meaning or does each individual reserve the right to choose his or her own morality?\u00a0 The surveyor respondents to hear from the world at large, morality doesn\u2019t have any absolutes, one reserves the right to create his or her own.\u00a0 The third item was that if Saddam Hussein didn\u2019t stop playing word games over the airwaves, the US was going to start bombing.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If words and morality have no meaning then what does the Christian do with the words of the Scripture, especially those spoken in the gospels by Jesus Christ, who used words to convey meaning about our bankruptcy of morality and our need for God\u2019s forgiveness?\u00a0 We are born dead in our sin and transgression and then proceed as we grow older to break God\u2019s moral Law (the Ten Commandments).\u00a0 The emergent church gospel does not subscribe to words having absolute meaning nor absolute truth.\u00a0 Also there is no moral absolute because a Christian can then assume moral superiority over a non-Christian.\u00a0 Furthermore, they do not seek to save the lost like Jesus did, because they use modern methods of evangelism, also known as \u201cfriendship evangelism\u201d.\u00a0 Satan is not creative but rather deceptive.\u00a0 A faithful brother in Christ of mine named Ivan shared with me, Satan will use our need for sleep and try to lead us to be lazy, he will use our design for work and try to cause us to become \u201cworkaholics\u201d.\u00a0 The emergent gospel has its roots in Satan back in the Garden of Eden when the serpent said to Eve, \u201cDid God really say, \u2018You shall not eat of every tree of the garden\u2019?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\ufeff2\ufeff And the woman said to the serpent, \u201cWe may eat the \ufeff\ufefffruit of the trees of the garden; \ufeff3\ufeff but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, \u2018You shall not eat it, nor shall you \ufefftouch it, lest you die.\u2019 \u201d \ufeff4\ufeff \ufeffThen the serpent said to the woman, \u201cYou will not surely die. \ufeff5\ufeff For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil (Gen 3:1-4).\u201d Did God really say?\u00a0 If the emergent gospel can redefine things, then humanity can play God and redefine both good and evil.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The emergent gospel wants everyone to be accepted and for everyone to feel good about oneself.\u00a0 So when Jesus makes a statement such as in Luke 14, \u201cIf anyone comes to Me \ufeff\ufeffand does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, \ufeffyes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. \ufeff27\ufeff And \ufeffwhoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple,\u201d this is extremely exclusive, it excludes some people who fail to do what Jesus is commanding as a prerequisite.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The emergent gospel really wants Christ-less Christianity.\u00a0 Brian McLaren, one of the emergent gospels leaders said, \u201cGood evangelism is the process of being friendly without discrimination and influencing all of one\u2019s friends toward better living, through good deeds and good conversations\u2026Christian commitment is where I\u2019m coming from\u2026This is not to say that there isn\u2019t a place for Buddhist or Jewish evangelism, but someone else will be better suited to write on these topics.\u201d\u00a0 Compare this to the beginning of Jesus\u2019 ministry, \u201cFrom that time Jesus began to preach, saying, \u201cRepent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d\u00a0 Perhaps the following dialog will put the unbalanced, \u201cfriendship evangelism,\u201d which perhaps many of you subscribe to in its true light:\u00a0<br \/>\nPreacher\u2019s Progress (by ray Comfort)<\/p>\n<p>Christian Loveless: \u201cHi, Mrs. Smith. How are you doing? Is Erik in yet?\u201d<br \/>\nMrs. Smith: \u201cLunch again, huh? I haven\u2019t seen him come through the lobby today. He came into work last week with a bad hangover. Probably the same thing has happened today. How was church?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Christian Loveless: \u201cIt was really good. We had Brother Don Waterdowns come in and do a series of healing meetings. Hundreds gave their hearts to the Lord. I\u2019m in charge of the follow-up program. Man, I didn\u2019t realize how easy it is to get people saved. Lots were getting healed and people were coming to the altar without even being preached to.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Smith: \u201cWhat a blessing. We had him at our church too. He advocates \u2018friendship evangelism,\u2019 doesn\u2019t he?\u201d<br \/>\nChristian Loveless: \u201cYes. I like that. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been using on Erik. We\u2019ve become good buddies over the years.\u201d<br \/>\nMrs. Smith: \u201cI like that approach. It\u2019s so much better than shoving the gospel down people\u2019s throats.\u201d<br \/>\nChristian Loveless: \u201cTrue. That can alienate them. I\u2019m waiting for the right time to mention the things of God to Erik; I don\u2019t want to make him feel uncomfortable. Erik came to one of the meetings, and he really seemed to enjoy it. That\u2019s the good thing about non-confrontational evangelism. He didn\u2019t give his heart to the Lord, though. Maybe today he will bring up the subject. I never do, because I don\u2019t want to offend him. I\u2019m just a good friend, and I think that\u2019s the right approach.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Smith: \u201cI agree. I\u2019ll call the Third Floor and speak to his secretary. Perhaps she will know why he\u2019s late.\u201d<br \/>\nChristian Loveless: \u201cOkay.\u201d<br \/>\nMrs. Smith: \u201cJeannie, Rose Smith.

He slinks in his seat, unstraps the parachute and throws it to the floor.\u00a0 Disillusionment and bitterness fill his heart, because as far as he was concerned he was told an outright lie.<\/p>\n<p>The second man is given a parachute, but listen to what he is told. He\u2019s told to put it on because at any moment he\u2019ll be jumping 25,000 feet out of the plane. He gratefully puts the parachute on. He doesn\u2019t notice the weight of it upon his shoulders, nor that he can\u2019t sit upright. His mind is consumed with the thought of what would happen to him if he jumped without the parachute.\u00a0 Let\u2019s now analyze the motive and the result of each passenger\u2019s experience. The first man\u2019s motive for putting the parachute on was solely to improve his flight. The result of his experience was that he was humiliated by the passengers, disillusioned, and somewhat embittered against those who gave him the parachute. As far as he\u2019s concerned, it will be a long time before anyone gets one of those things on his back again.\u00a0 The second man put the parachute on solely to escape the jump to come. And because of his knowledge of what would happen to him if he jumped without it, he has a deep-rooted joy and peace in his heart knowing that he\u2019s saved from sure death. This knowledge gives him the ability to withstand the mockery of the other passengers. His attitude toward those who gave him the parachute is one of heartfelt gratitude.<\/p>\n<p>Now listen to what the modern gospel says: \u201cPut on the Lord Jesus Christ. He\u2019ll give you love, joy, peace, fulfillment, and lasting happiness.\u201d In other words, Jesus will improve your flight. The sinner responds, and in an experimental fashion puts on the Savior to see if the claims are true. And what does he get? The promised temptation, tribulation, and persecution\u2014the other \u201cpassengers\u201d mock him. So what does he do? He takes off the Lord Jesus Christ; he\u2019s offended for the Word\u2019s sake; he\u2019s disillusioned and somewhat embittered&#8230;and quite rightly so.\u00a0 He was promised peace, joy, love, and fulfillment, and all he got were trials and humiliation.\u00a0 His bitterness is directed at those who gave him the so-called \u201cgood news.\u201d His latter end becomes worse than the first, and he\u2019s another inoculated and bitter \u201cbackslider.\u201d\u00a0 Instead of preaching that Jesus improves the flight, we should be warning sinners that they have to jump out of a plane. That it\u2019s appointed for man to die once and then face judgment (Hebrews 9:27). When a sinner understands the horrific consequences of breaking the Law of God, he will flee to the Savior, solely to escape the wrath that\u2019s to come. If we are true and faithful witnesses, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be preaching\u2014that there is wrath to come\u2014that God \u201ccommands all men every where to repent: because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness\u201d (Acts 17:30,31).<\/p>\n<p>The issue isn\u2019t one of happiness, but one of righteousness. It doesn\u2019t matter how happy a sinner is, or how much he is enjoying the pleasures of sin for a season, without the righteousness of Christ, he will perish on the day of wrath. Proverbs 11:4 says, \u201cRiches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivers from death.\u201d. Peace and joy are legitimate fruits of salvation, but it\u2019s not legitimate to use these fruits as a drawing card for salvation. If we continue to do so, the sinner will respond with an impure motive, lacking repentance.<\/p>\n<p>Can you remember why the second passenger had joy and peace in his heart? It was because he knew that the parachute was going to save him from sure death. In the same way, as believers we have joy and peace in believing because we know that the righteousness of Christ is going to deliver us from the wrath that is to come.\u00a0 With that thought in mind, let\u2019s take a close look at an incident aboard the plane.\u00a0 We have a brand-new flight attendant. It\u2019s her first day. She\u2019s carrying a tray of boiling hot coffee. She wants to leave an impression upon the passengers and she certainly does!\u00a0 As she\u2019s walking down the aisle she trips over someone\u2019s foot and slops the hot coffee all over the lap of our second passenger. What\u2019s his reaction as that boiling liquid hits his tender flesh? Does he go, \u201cMan that hurt!\u201d? Yes, he does. But then does he rip the parachute from his shoulders, throw it to the floor, and say, \u201cThe stupid parachute!\u201d? No, why should he? He didn\u2019t put the parachute on for a better flight. He put it on to save him from the jump to come. If anything, the hot coffee incident causes him to cling tighter to the parachute and even look forward to the jump.\u00a0 If we have put on the Lord Jesus Christ for the right motive\u2014to flee from the wrath that\u2019s to come\u2014when tribulation strikes, when the flight gets bumpy, we won\u2019t get angry at God, and we won\u2019t lose our joy and peace. Why should we? We didn\u2019t come to Christ for a better lifestyle, but to flee from the wrath to come.\u00a0 If anything, tribulation drives the true believer closer to the Savior.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, we have multitudes of professing Christians who lose their joy and peace when the flight gets bumpy.\u00a0 Why? They are the product of a man-centered gospel. They came lacking repentance, without which they cannot be saved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026<br \/>\nBlessings,<br \/>\nPastor Phil<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.\u201d (Gal 1:6-7) The Gospel means good news.\u00a0 Paul states that some have moved [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-730","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-bM","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/730","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=730"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/730\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=730"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=730"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=730"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":731,"date":"2007-06-26T17:44:38","date_gmt":"2007-06-26T17:44:38","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/06\/26\/what-gospel-do-you-believe-2-by-pastor-phil\/"},"modified":"2007-06-26T17:44:38","modified_gmt":"2007-06-26T17:44:38","slug":"what-gospel-do-you-believe-2-by-pastor-phil","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/06\/26\/what-gospel-do-you-believe-2-by-pastor-phil\/","title":{"rendered":"What Gospel do you believe 2?

If a believer lives in poverty, he\/she is living outside God\u2019s intended will. \u201cYou must realize that it is God\u2019s will for you to prosper\u201d (Copeland, Laws of Prosperity, p. 51).- Source: Word-Faith Movement , \u201cOther Doctrines,\u201d a Watchman Fellowship profile<\/p>\n<p>Those that preach a prosperity gospel make some grave errors.\u00a0 First, isn\u2019t it interesting that many of these preachers don\u2019t preach this gospel in the poorest areas of the world, where \u201cfinancial blessing\u201d it most needed, places like Calcutta India.\u00a0 Secondly, the preachers are selfish and have vein conceit desiring you to send your faith seed (your money) to their ministry, or should I say their bank account?\u00a0 Thirdly, they actually make it harder for people to get into the Kingdom, because the Kingdom of God then comes with a financial price tag, not simply laying one\u2019s life down to follow the Christ.\u00a0 It would follow suit then, that Hollywood celebrities don\u2019t need Jesus, because they are wealthy already.\u00a0 Is that a sign of God\u2019s blessing on Hollywood out of their right relationship with the Father?\u00a0 Fourthly, why are these prosperity preachers most often not using the financial gifts they receive through manipulating people with the World of God, to help the needy, to reach the unsaved?\u00a0 God can certainly flow finances through a believer, for what end?\u00a0 If anyone should have modeled a wealthy life, if according to the prosperity gospel, shouldn\u2019t it have been Jesus?\u00a0 He was born in a stable not a palace, as he grew up in common Jewish family.\u00a0\u00a0 Jesus made replied to one desiring to follow Him, \u201c\u2026The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head\u201d (Matt,. 8:20).\u00a0 This hardly sounds like the words of a wealthy man. Jesus said, \u201cFrom everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.\u201d\u00a0 Where are the prosperity preachers in their personal giving?\u00a0 Recall Peter when He was asked to give alms by a needy person, to which Peter replied, \u201c\u2026Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.\u201d\u00a0 Peter gave the man the biblical gospel and demonstrated it in faith and power!\u00a0 Proverbs 11:4 states, \u201cRiches profit not in the day of judgment, but righteousness delivers from death.\u201d\u00a0 If a millionaire dies without the Savior his money will not impress God.\u00a0 Jesus told the rich young ruler to sell all he had to follow Christ.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until the prodigal son lost all his money that he was humbled to repent toward God and his father.\u00a0 The prosperity preachers are not preaching the biblical gospel.\u00a0 Recall Simon the Sorcerer wanting to buy the power of the Holy Spirit.\u00a0 Peter said, \u201cThy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.\u201d\u00a0 Perhaps you have been financially blessed of God, use it for His Glory and not your own.\u00a0 W are not to \u201cname it and claim it!\u201d\u00a0 He tells me what to do, not the reverse that is why He is Lord!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Here are some links to further investigate the dangers of the Prosperity Gospel and the preaches associated with this false gospel.\u00a0 Please be wise, let God be the Lord of your heart and finances.\u00a0 Perhaps there is someone that you could financially bless, expecting nothing in return.\u00a0 Our Father has a way

But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be anathema (accursed).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We live in a world with the genuine and the counterfeit, the true and the false, the real and the fake.\u00a0 We have genuine currency (monies) and counterfeit.\u00a0 There are genuine works of art, and then there are frauds.\u00a0 Ask any magician and he will tell you that fooling people is certainly possible as they use optical illusion to illustrate that the hand is quicker than the eye.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore it should not be a surprise that there are false gospels in our time that attempt to go against the true gospel.\u00a0 Paul gave a sober warning that anyone that preaches a distorted gospel will be anathema, that is to say accursed.\u00a0 The gospel did not originate with man but with God, therefore who are we as humanity to come up with our own version of the gospel?\u00a0 We must under any circumstances veer off from the gospel that Jesus preached.\u00a0 The opening line of Paul\u2019s warning states,\u201d I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you, and want to distort the gospel of Christ.\u201d\u00a0 Turing to other gospels are always for selfish ambition and vain conceit as it puts the word of man above the Word of God.\u00a0 Many in evangelicalism having certainly gone off the beaten path that our Lord paved by His blood, His life and His Word, and have abandon it for a different gospel.\u00a0 This was happing in Paul\u2019s day, hence the reason that he writes, therefore it should be of no surprise that the false gospels still corrode many lives today.<\/p>\n<p>We live is a world that at one time used John 3:16 as the staple verse from the Word of God.\u00a0 Now many use a new verse as the staple verse, \u201cDo not judge, or you too will be judged (Matt 7:1).\u00a0 This is said because many don\u2019t want to call sin for what it is, sin.\u00a0 These same people have not looked to the balance of this verse out of John\u2019s gospel which reads, \u201cStop judging by mere appearances, and make a RIGHT JUDGMENT!\u201d\u00a0 When we use the Word of God we can call one that steals a thief, and one that tells lies, a liar.\u00a0 I close part one with a quote from author and Pastor, John McArthur from His book the gospel according to Jesus writes, \u201cThe gospel in vogue today holds forth a false hope to sinners. It promises them they can have eternal life yet continue to live in rebellion against God. Indeed, it encourages people to claim Jesus as Savior yet defer until later the commitment to obey him as Lord.\u00a0 It promises salvation from hell but not necessarily freedom from iniquity. It offers false security to people who revel in the sins of the flesh and spurn the way of holiness.

It was funny and we laughed about it but later when I sat down to think about it, I wondered, is that what most men think that is what marriage is all about, suffering?<\/p>\n<p>I want to present us with a ring that will replace the so called suffeRING and that is the CaRING that very necessary in a marriage. It&#8217;s easy to try and show that you care for your spouse in the presence of everyone but does it happen the same at home, in the absence of everyone. Would you be the same out there as you are in your home? The amplified version says 32, &#8220;And become useful and helpful and kind to one another, \u2026&#8221;. Three words used &#8220;USEFUL&#8221;, &#8220;HELPFUL&#8221; and &#8220;KIND&#8221; all falling under the &#8220;CaRING&#8221;. How can you show you care if you are not useful, helpful and kind? You will only be deceiving yourself. Being useful would mean always ready for service and being advantageous to your spouse and not a burden or liability. Helpful would be to render assistance or service as sign that you care. Kind is you being considerate.<\/p>\n<p>This is just a small encouragement to us in those little things we at times forget to do for each other to show that we care. Remember that you and your spouse are one. I see a way of having a CaRING is having a tender heart and not rigid heart. A heart of flesh and not a heart of stone. Stony hearts bounce things off, tender hearts accommodates, absorbs, evaluates, is willing to change, willing to learn. Tender to me would also mean, a ready heart already worked on. Out of this tender heart, forgiveness also flows. If you have a CaRING heart, even forgiving your spouse who has wronged you or you asking for forgiveness when you have wronged becomes easy.<\/p>\n<p>In the light of CaRING, we can change the course and the direction of our marriages for those who are because we are not looking at it as SuffeRING as some do but CaRING as God would want us to do. Our marriages are what we make it. Today think about the last time you gave your spouse a CaRING then start to undo what you have done and start doing what you have not done. With this CaRING, I vow to&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Ephesians 4:32, &#8220;And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you&#8221; Sometime back someone gave us something he considered a joke, he said, &#8220;when a man meets a special woman who he develops a relationship that will hopefully lead to marriage, it reaches a point [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-726","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-bI","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/726","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=726"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/726\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=726"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=726"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=726"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":727,"date":"2007-06-20T08:53:53","date_gmt":"2007-06-20T08:53:53","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/06\/20\/more-of-you-part-3\/"},"modified":"2007-06-20T08:53:53","modified_gmt":"2007-06-20T08:53:53","slug":"more-of-you-part-3","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/06\/20\/more-of-you-part-3\/","title":{"rendered":"More Of You, Part&nbsp;3"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>2Kings 6:8-23, &#8220;And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them&#8221;<br \/>\nTo strengthen what I shared on yesterday, I would like to go off the scripture verse above and use a different scripture that ties to this. In Mark 4 from vs. 35, after Jesus had been teaching on the parables, He told the disciples to cross with Him to the other side. This required a boat and as they journeyed something happened, Mark 4:37, \u201cAnd a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. 38 But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like Elisha, I believe Jesus knew that the moment they started crossing to the other side there was going to be a great windstorm. And knowing of what awaited them which was life threatening, He went to sleep at the bottom of the boat.\u00a0 He was fast a sleep in the midst of the storm beating the boat and the water beginning to fill the boat. He must have been very comfortable in the storm and instead of the disciples being encouraged of Jesus in the boat despite the storm, they panicked and became hysterical.<\/p>\n<p>Something to ponder on, how would you have dealt with the same situation?. You have the storm beating and filling the boat with water while Jesus is in the boat? Would you have been like the disciples? Here are some of the things if they had thought about would have made them comfortable in the storm. One, Jesus was present in the boat, that alone should have been comfort to make them comfortable. Two, did they think Jesus could drown? He was (is) God.\u00a0 Three, did they think the wind had power over Him? But no, they went to find Jesus where He was a sleep and launched a complaint and this is what they said Mark 4:38, \u201c\u2026\u201cTeacher, do You not care that we are perishing?\u201d. In the midst of the storm they felt left alone and hopeless with the assumption that Jesus did not care but come to think about it, Jesus cared enough for them to be present right in the midst of the storm. HIS PRESENCE WAS ENOUGH WITHOUT HIS ACTS.\u00a0\u00a0 When they woke Him up from the sleep, He dealt with the situation. He said, \u201cPeace, be still\u201d.\u00a0 The storm was not defeated when He spoke, it was defeated the moment He was present in the boat.<\/p>\n<p>This should be an encouragement to us that when Jesus is in this boat (US), we can never sink and drown simply because He cannot drown. I know for myself when the windstorm comes the first thing is panic then try to find ways to calm the storm instead of calming my nerves and encouraging myself that Jesus is present in this boat. What a comfort we have that Jesus is ever present even the times we feel we are facing storms that try to display His absence. He has said that He will never leave us, nor forsake us, that is His promise. Greater is He that lives inside of us than He that is in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Kings 6:8-23, &#8220;And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them&#8221; To strengthen what I shared on yesterday, I would like to go off the scripture verse above and use a different scripture that ties to this.

Elisha was an ordinary man with an extraordinary anointing. There is nothing good in him but the Power and the presence of God and so when you begin to see enemies scattered and put to shame, it&#8217;s not because they are threatened by you, it\u2019s because of the one greater in you. The bible says,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">in Psalm 68:1, \u201cLet God arise, let His enemies be scattered<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">\u201d. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">In the passage on 2 Kings 6, the king of Syria discovered that Elisha did not have an army, just his servant. Why would a king who has discovered that Elisha has no army send an army on horses and chariots to pursue after him? Of course they knew Elisha was not even wearing combat gear to face the Syria&#8217;s army. They could have sent maybe like 10 people or less and they would captured him without any problem. I believe the reason why they sent an army is because of what they had seen in Elisha. We face situations like that, facing the enemy of our soul but because of Him in us, we are at peace. It amazes me how we constantly bind an enemy whose existence is already threatened by the existence of the Savior. Yes there are days to bind him, not always. What did Jesus tell Peter, \u201c<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it\u201d. Let&#8217;s not forget who we are\u00a0 and whose we are<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">In the morning in vs. 15 the servant of Elisha woke up and went out and behold there was a great army surrounding the place where he and Elisha camped. Now let&#8217;s back up here for a minute, if you look in the previous vs. you will find that Elisha knew things that were done or said in secret, he was a prophet. I believe he already knew they were surrounded yet he was still able to sleep peacefully till morning. What an amazing thing, the presence of God made him comfortable in a situation that would make his servant terrified. I saw this with Peter who was able to sleep peacefully in jail and so was Daniel in the lion\u2019s den. This is where we are different from the unsaved, they can only sleep peacefully or be calm when they know for sure that everything is okay. Their peace comes when everything is going the right way for us believers we get it in both ways whether things be good or bad for it&#8217;s not even us but God inside of us. The bible says that the peace of God surpasses all human understanding. Mark the word the<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">peace of God<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">, it&#8217;s not even our peace but His peace. That is why I don&#8217;t get surprised when I see some Christians go through some things and yet they are still maintain peace, they should be worrying about it but they are not in fact they go to sleep. Hysterical people use more energy trying to worry and fix stuff but someone who has the peace of God inside has nothing to worry about. He can speak out peace because he has it in. Someone once said,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MAN WHO DOESN&#8217;T HAVE TO DO IT HIMSELF&#8221;.

I\u2019m not sure if he even knew how to use an arrow but he is feared of men in every land. In our text we see him as a prophet in Israel but during this time, Syria and Israel were at war. What has helping Israel was God on their side and that made Syria to really fear Israel. Now I understand why Moses would not go anywhere without the<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> presence of God, Exodus 33:14.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">God had made a covenant with Israel that He would fight and defend them. He would go before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire. Everywhere they went, they took over the land because God was with them and as long as the Lord was with them, their forces and powers doubled. Can you imagine everywhere you go and everything that you deal with, your enemies become subject to you simply because the presence of God is upon you? I believe that I can go anywhere, be anyone God wants me to be and survive anything as long as the presence of God is with me. I can cross the sea, climb the mountain, face the committee, face situations and survive, be a good leader as long as<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">His presence is with me for without Him, I can do nothing, John 15:5.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Putting our trust and submitting to God allows His presence to accompany us everywhere for we give Him permission to be the Lord of our lives and not just the Savior alone.<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> Psalm 37:23, &#8220;The good steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord&#8221;, Prov 3:5, &#8220;Trust in the Lord and lean not on thy own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">. How can one order our steps and direct our paths if He is not with us? We constantly need to seek His presence that we may overcome. Moses could only deliver the children of Israel because the presence of God was with him. He was not a warrior, he did not have an army, all he had as a stave of a shepherd and the Lord. That is all He needed to deliver the Israelites from their enemies. If you are ever going to do the impossible, it will happen because the Lord is with you.

Also an ambassador can be defined as an authorized messenger or representative. Let&#8217;s look at how it is presented to us in the bible, this name is used by the apostles as designating those who are appointed by God to declare His will&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>To sum it, an ambassador is a representative mostly for a country in another nation. An ambassador is not APPOINTED and not ELECTED. By that I mean, there are no ballots cast to be one. Within the fences of ambassador\u2019s offices in other countries are considered as the country they representing.\u00a0 We have been allowed an awesome opportunity as Christians to be Ambassadors for Christ here on earth, it&#8217;s a high rank. We are representing the Kingdom of God. We have not been elected but appointed by God, 1Peter 2:9, says &#8220;9 But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;&#8221;. We are chosen to represent the Kingdom of God every where we go and we have been allowed to have some type of dwelling that those who are running looking for shelter can find refuge in our midst for there is safety within. Paul writes to Timothy and shares with him a few things that he needs to keep in mind as a representative. As a representative, what you portray out there is what people will think of the kingdom you are representing. Paul encourages him number one not to allow any man to despise his youth. When we understand that we are not called on the merit of age or knowledge, we begin to look at ourselves the way God does. When God approached Jeremiah and told him that He had appointed him to be an ambassador, what did he say, &#8220;I am just but a child&#8221; and God tells him in Jeremiah 1:5, &#8220;5 \u201c Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet (ambassador) to the nations&#8221;. He already predestined each of us and He tells him not to be afraid for the calling was already .<\/p>\n<p>After Paul&#8217;s tells Timothy not to allow any man to despise his youth, he encourages him by telling him to be an example of the believers in other words, be a model, a pattern of the believers. You know what, it&#8217;s hard to represent the kingdom when your life is not right with God and that is because you will not know what is accepted by Kingdom of God. The bible says that a man&#8217;s ways are right in his own eyes but the end is destruction and that is why my prayer is as an ambassador is in, Psalm 25:4&amp;5, \u201cTeach me Your paths.<\/p>\n<p>5 Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation; On You I wait all the day&#8221;, Psalm 86:10, Teach me Your way, O LORD; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name.&#8221;. If we are going to be representatives, we got be learners of the word of God. We got to be taught in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in purity. A heavenly representative should have these qualities to back up what they confess. It&#8217;s one thing to confess, it&#8217;s another thing to live according to your confession. I know that even at Awards people talk about the Lord and all that, but I come back to look at their lifestyle and some lead other\u2019s astray and I say, Math 7:16, &#8220;Ye shall know them by their fruits&#8221;. We too cannot just speak what is right, we got to live by our confession otherwise we will have no fruits to show and we will be deceiving ourselves and others. With your confession, I want to see the fruit to back it up and the same is expected of me. I am an ambassador for Christ therefore I will represent Him and His kingdom down here on earth through the word, in my conversation, in charity, in spirit and in purity.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Timothy 4:12, &#8220;Let no man despise your youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in purity&#8221; According to the dictionary definition, an ambassador is a diplomatic official of the highest rank appointed and credited as representative in residence by one government or sovereign [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-723","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-bF","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/723","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=723"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/723\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=723"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=723"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=723"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":721,"date":"2007-06-14T18:52:31","date_gmt":"2007-06-14T18:52:31","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/06\/14\/bring-forth-what-is-inside-2\/"},"modified":"2007-06-14T18:52:31","modified_gmt":"2007-06-14T18:52:31","slug":"bring-forth-what-is-inside-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/06\/14\/bring-forth-what-is-inside-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Bring Forth What Is&nbsp;Inside"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Isaiah 37:3, &#8220;And they said to him, &#8220;Thus says Hezekiah:, &#8220;This is a day of trouble and rebuke and blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Christians ought to be plugged in a church to be fed, ministered to and to be used to serve. It&#8217;s good to come to receive, then reaches a point where the receiving time ceases and you not give, a time to maximize the gifts inside of you. The bible says that, &#8220;It&#8217;s blessed to give than receive&#8221;. When you give, you are not running dry as someone may want you to believe so. I find that I am more blessed and encouraged in giving encouragements and the reason is, the more I encourage, the more I get encouraged.<\/p>\n<p>You will agree with me that there are many good things that are happening and yet there is less strength to accomplish them. New responsibilities, ministries, positions, converts, seeds to be planted and yet many have no strength to bring them forth. People are scared of moving for they feel they will mess up, feel like they are not able and the like. There are certain gifts you know god has blessed you with, but there is no strength to fully bring them forth. You have desires and dreams, when you look at your current situation and the things that are standing on the way, you just can&#8217;t see how in the world you can deliver what has been invested in you.<\/p>\n<p>If it was not invested, it would be another story. I\u2019m talking about something that is tangible, something you can see the signs, something that you know you have but bringing it out becomes the problem. You are now stuck with alive baby inside of you because you have no strength to deliver. Believe me, many are going to end this life still carrying inside what they should have brought forth. King Hezekiah had the king of Assyria bring a lot of threats to his kingdom and the king of Assyria even went ahead to say that even God would not deliver Hezekiah and therefore he shouldn&#8217;t trust in Him. King Hezekiah had something inside of him and that is the trust that God was able and would deliver him and his people but I don&#8217;t think that there were so many people in his kingdom who had that kind of faith. Not only did he believe, he also confessed it and acted on his confession. He went to the temple with some of the elders and priests. He also sent a message to Isaiah the prophet. This was the message to Isaiah,\u00a0 Isaiah 37:3, &#8220;And they said to him, &#8220;Thus says Hezekiah:, &#8220;This is a day of trouble and rebuke and blasphemy;&#8221; I paused for a second and wondered why it was a day of trouble and I began to see that the people believed inside it could happen but there was no evidence on the outside to show that they were ready for what the Lord was going to do. It&#8217;s good to know it inside, but what is inside has to be practiced outside. You can believe that God is able but until you engage your faith into action and confess it, it will still be inside trapped. Romans 10:10, &#8220;For with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation&#8221;. It&#8217;s by the confession that you birth salvation. Believing alone will not help, confession will do you a greater service. The woman with the issue of blood believed inside, that is what kept her pregnant and when she began to confess, she began to push out what was inside of her.<\/p>\n<p>Isaiah 37:3, &#8220;&#8230;for the children have come to birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth&#8221;. There are certain things God has already placed in us, they are ready but the question is, are we ready? The gifting are at the peak of being birthed, the ministries are yet to be birthed but are you ready? there are preachers, prayer warriors, teachers, prophets and prophetess, pastors in our midst. Are you feeling like there is something in you that the Lord could birth but you have no strength, (enough faith to believe it can happen?). Are you still holding onto something that should have been birthed by now? I still have certain things that I&#8217;m pregnant with but have less strength to birth them. I have seen the signs, I know they are there and I can&#8217;t keep on holding them inside for they are due for birth. Help me Lord, I have new responsibilities I need to birth, moving to greater levels I need to birth, zeal to win souls I need to birth. It&#8217;s tough, scary and painful but I can&#8217;t die holding onto this thing inside of me. Lord strengthen my faith to birth what is inside.

We can be pulled by things that are enticing with a promise to give fulfillment and happiness only to find out later that it was a trap. One side of you pulls you to what is right, the other side pulls you to something that looks right. You are set in the middle trying to make a wise decision as to what path to take. It&#8217;s either black or white, no shades of gray in the middle; it&#8217;s either right or wrong can&#8217;t accept both at the same time and a choice has to be made. I&#8217;m amazed that some can have a foot in the church and have another in the world, they worship today tomorrow you see them doing something else, James tells us something interesting, he says that for you to be single minded, you need to draw nigh to God and God will draw nigh to you and as you draw nigh to God, God begins to cause you to see things clearly where you have to make a choice of cleansing your hands and purifying your heart. You will not know what is right until you have encountered with the truth.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">John 8:32, &#8220;And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> It&#8217;s not just a matter of knowing the truth, many already do, it&#8217;s a matter of knowing the truth, walking it, living it, exercising it as it has a way of making you a single minded person.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">John 14:6, &#8220;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh to then Father, but by me&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">We can see Jesus singling Himself out by calling Himself THE WAY, THE TRUTH, and THE LIFE. If He had used the word A in stead of THE, then He would be another option but when He said HE IS, then this teaches us that the only way we can have a single mind is by trusting in Jesus a lone for salvation, guidance, protection, provision and every other thing that we could ever need. A double minded person will try and have other options, like trust in God today but also have connections to psychic, or trust in God and have his faith on the lottery ticket in his hands.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to have focus, direction, purpose, vision, and conviction because he has the ability of changing his mind anytime.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Psalm 118:8, &#8220;It is better to trust in the Lord than to put your confidence in man&#8221;,<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">He says,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;Choose ye this day whom you will serve<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;, &#8220;<\/font><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Behold I have set before you curses and blessings, choose wisely<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">&#8220;. A single minded person will choose wisely without feeling pressured into something that he knows is not acceptable. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">James 1:8, &#8220;A double minded man is unstable in all his was&#8221;. I could say \u201c<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Double\u201d word is applying apply equality in the things that come in one&#8217;s way and now he or she is set to battle which way to go. The verse concludes by saying that such a person is unstable in all his ways simply because they will be tossed around by everything that comes their way. They will believe any doctrine that comes their way, they will always be convinced by others to take a different direction. <\/font><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Isaiah 26:3, &#8220;Thou shall keep him in perfect peace whose mind stays on thee&#8221;,<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">let&#8217;s keep our minds to stay (dwell) on Him,<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Romans 12:2, &#8220;And be ye not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove that which is good acceptable, and perfect will of God&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> The patterns and life style in this world would cause your mind and mine to wonder and that is why the bible says not to be conformed by it. Let our minds be transformed and renewed that we may prove (test) what is good not what we perceive to be good. Jesus had a single mind and Paul encourages us in<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Philippians 2:5, &#8220;Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus&#8230;&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">See how the mind plays one of the major roles in a human life, the devil attacks the mind and so the Lord deals with the heart first because if He can get to the heart, the heart will transform the entire body including the mind. All defeat, pride, lust, deceptions begin in the mind so we need to guard the mind all cost to think on what is acceptable will of God in Christ Jesus. Let&#8217;s have single minds which comes from looking unto Jesus the Author and the Finisher of our faith.

They bound him with bronze fetters, and he became a grinder in the prison. 22 However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaven&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If I was take a few words to describe Samson, I would say he was a miracle child number one. The mother was barren and was visited by an angel who promised her that God would touch her barren womb and she would bring forth a son. God had a purpose and a mission for the child to be born and we are told of it in Judges 13:5 For behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.&#8221; Samson was to be a consecrated child and the demonstration of God&#8217;s presence in his life was his hair growing and never cut from birth. This was to be an ordinary child with an extraordinary gift bestowed upon him by God. The symbol of his strength was in the 7 long locks of his hair. The parents were instructed on how to raise him after he was born and I believe they did.<\/p>\n<p>Judges 16:24, &#8220;&#8230;and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him. 25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move upon him at Mahaneh Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol&#8221;. One thing I can say, we were all miracle babies. In the midst of the complications and what could have happened, God sustained each of us because He had a purpose and a mission for us. The great things a parent can do for a child is pray for them, teach them God&#8217;s ways, speak God&#8217;s destiny in their lives and live by example. I believe that as a child is growing up before they are at the age they know the Lord and I don&#8217;t mean know about the Lord, God uses the parents to prepare them to know the Lord. I remember growing up, I was taught the things of God, taught how to live according to God&#8217;s ways. I remember at the age of 4 when my dad would take me to mission fields with him. He would preach and we would sing together but I did not know more of what it was all about. He kept on praying for me and his other children that in due time, they will come to know God and God use them. For me when I became of age, I didn&#8217;t want anything to do with God, something that I have seen with many kids who came from Christian families.<\/p>\n<p>Proverbs 22:6, says, &#8220;Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.&#8221; As we know God&#8217;s word is true, and this verse is true even though it may not sound like it, think of it this way, how many kids came from a Christian home, raised according to God&#8217;s ways, parents prayed for them, instilled great values, fed and clothed them and when they were of age and should have turned to God, they rebelled against their parents and more so God? How would we apply this scripture to this situation? Here it is, you train the child in the way he\/she should go and when he\/she is old, what you trained him\/her will not depart from his\/her life. They may try and go against it but it will always linger in their minds. Samson parents raised him God&#8217;s way and when he was of age and God began to use him, he also began to go against how his parents raised him.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve raised your children in God&#8217;s ways, remember that the teachings will not depart from them and God knows how to use those teachings to bring them back to His purpose and mission for their lives, so don&#8217;t be discouraged or give up, keep praying.

There are people including Christians who choose what they can believe in the bible and reject the rest. In their mind, they don&#8217;t see how such and such a thing could happen and so they sum it up as good stories to teach us something but not necessarily what happened. How many people find it hard to believe God parting the red sea or Noah and the ark? They conclude they are too good to be true. For me to understand that all things are possible, I have to go back to the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>Genesis starts with this line, &#8220;in the beginning GOD&#8221; and In the gospel according to John, he does not begin with Jesus&#8217; birth, or his genealogy or the beginning of his ministry, he takes us back to creation. If I can go back to the beginning and see how things began, I can understand the future for I know whose hand is on it. John starts his writing with vs. 1, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word&#8221;, in other words, in the beginning GOD. Before anything was created, God was already existing. Not restricted with time for He is eternal. God is the beginning and your life and my mine starts and ends with Him. If &#8220;in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&#8221;, then the truth is the bible is His Word and His Word has no lies or errors, we can trust His word.<\/p>\n<p>It all started with God who is the Word, He spoke His Word to what did not exist that it may exist. Only God in and of the beginning could create things out of nothing the concept many have a problem with. People can make things out of things, God made things out of nothing. As the Word, He spoke things into existence, that is creation, In Isaiah 55:11, this is strengthen with the bible saying , &#8220;So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it&#8221;. He created everything and there is nothing too difficult for Him.<\/p>\n<p>He created us (man) meaning created our spirit out of nothing but then did something that he did not do with any of His other creation and that is, He formed us out of something, Genesis 2:7, &#8220;And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being&#8221;. Of all the creation He spoke into existence, He further reached out to the ground and formed man which distinguishes us from any other creation. His hand has been on man from the beginning till now. That He was so mindful of man that He picked dust from the ground formed which I would say designed, breathed into His nostril the breath of life and man became a living being. What an amazing beginning, this should throw out any doubts you may have had about God of His word. Creating you was a miracle, saving you was the greatest miracle, His hand on your life is a continuous miracle. The beginning changes my destiny for &#8220;I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day&#8221; 2 Timothy 1:12. If you ever find yourself doubting whether things are possible, whether His hand is upon your life or whether His word is true, just take a trip back to the beginning<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 1:1, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, John 1:1-5, vs. 1, &#8221; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&#8221; To read the bible, you have to believe everything that is written.

He is not reducing or trying to make God in his own way, he understands who the Lord is and how the Lord is his help therefore he calls him My strength, My joy, My Hope, My healer, My deliverer, My confidence, My peace, My guide, My light, My redeemer. Lord becomes to us what we are not.<br \/>\nPsalm 27:5, &#8220;5For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; In the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock&#8221;. Where do you first run to when you are in trouble? do you run to your buddies or to the Lord first. When you fall, who do you call on? Psalm 18:3, &#8220;I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies&#8221;, Romans 10:13, &#8220;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&#8221;. When we call on the name of the Lord, the strong tower, we give Him permission to hide us in His pavilion (dwelling place) where no enemy enter. Not only will He hide me, He will also shelter me in His tabernacle. When He has blessed me, He shall set me high upon the rock where I can display His goodness. Everything the Lord is doing our lives is to bring Him glory so I give Him glory by praising Him and letting people know of what He has done in my life that someone somewhere can believe in Him too for a blessing.\u00a0 Set upon the rock is being set on Him for He is the Rock of Ages and what a blessing to know that He has raised me up above my enemies.<br \/>\nThe Lord is my everything, He is My mother and My father, my earthly parents are just demonstrating who He is to me. Psalm 27:10, &#8220;When my father and mother forsake me, The Lord will take care of me&#8221;. Glad know that even if we are forsaken by those who are close to us, He will not leave or forsake us. The bible says that He the Father to the fatherless, He is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.<br \/>\nPsalm 27:11, &#8220;Teach me You way, O Lord and lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies&#8221;. There is a great difference between knowing the ways of the Lord and knowing the acts of the Lord. The bible says that unto the children of Israel, God showed them His acts but unto Moses, He showed him His ways. When you only know the acts of the Lord, You will only rejoice when things are done but the moment nothing is happening, chances are, you will complain. Knowing the ways of the Lord changes the way you think and how you perceive God for even if He does not do it, does not mean He is not able. He could have delayed it, He could teaching you something, He is building a people with a destiny and so we rejoice in every step because we know His ways.\u00a0 Psalm 86:11, &#8220;Teach me your ways O Lord and I will walk in Your truth, unite my heart to fear you name&#8221;, Psalm 37:5, &#8220;Commit your ways to the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass&#8221;, Psalm 25:4, &#8220;Show me Your ways, Oh Lord, teach me thy paths, lead me in Your truth and teach&#8221;. Would you rather know the acts of the Lord or know His ways?<br \/>\nPsalm 27:13, &#8220;I would have lost heart, unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the LORD In the land of the living&#8221;, How many times I have felt like giving up, giving in and calling it a quit. KJ says, &#8220;I would have fainted&#8221;. Christ is our heartbeat, many times we faint because we stopped believing. David says that I was tempted to stop believing but that caused me to almost faint and loose heart. It&#8217;s was getting too much and the journey was long and tiring but I could not stop believing in Him to bring me to a place where I could see His goodness in the land of the living, the bible says, &#8220;The race is not for the swift neither is the battle for the strong but for those who endure till the end&#8221;, rest if you must but do not faint, don&#8217;t stop trusting God where you are, keep fighting the good fight of a soldier enduring shame as the elect of Christ. Believe God to bring you to a place where you can see His goodness in the land of the living.<br \/>\nPsalm 27:14, &#8220;Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord&#8221;, We will wait for the Lord and I don&#8217;t mean sit down and keep checking our watch to see if He is coming but doing what the waiter and the waitresses do, they wait on people who come to the restaurant. Their waiting means working, serving, reaching out, making sure that someone has what they need and so is with us, we have to believe God for greater things, but we have to reach out to God by doing something. When He calls me, I will answer for I will be somewhere working for the Lord. Your blessing and my blessings many times comes as a result of service so I wait on the Lord for HE IS MY EVERYTHING.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 27:1-14, &#8220;Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord&#8221; We looked at David taking time to personalize what the Lord is to him.

Well He has set a table before us therefore lets dine.<\/p>\n<p>The division of Psalms 27 talks about many things as the Psalmist is giving description of what the Lord is to him. The first verse he tells us that the Lord is his light, then his salvation, a strong hold, he mentions the beauty of the Lord, his helper and also mentions the goodness of the Lord. It&#8217;s hard to have a hero without knowing his strengths especially when you depend on him, in our case our Hero is Jesus but like David we got to know who He is to us. Many cannot move because they do not know or understand what the Almighty God is capable of handling and if that is not enough, they do not understand when they can call on the Lord, they don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s too late or too early to believe God for something but I would say that Psalm 46:1 says, &#8220;God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&#8221;. This verse alone sums it up for number one, God is our refuge to which I would say that we have enemies and overwhelming things but the Lord is our refuge, a place to hide. Not only is He our refuge, He is also &#8220;our strength&#8221; for He lives in side of us.\u00a0 We are going in His strength and not anyone&#8217;s. He is also &#8220;present&#8221; any time, all the time, never will He leave, He is always with us. I heard Him say, &#8220;Lo I will be with you always&#8221; and then He is &#8220;our help&#8221; in trouble and who does not face troubles?<\/p>\n<p>With this established, David tells us in verse 1&amp;2, &#8220;The Lord is my light and my salvation-whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life- of whom shall I be afraid? It is very important to personalize what the Lord is to you and not generalize it. When we generalize, we feel like He can do it for others but us. When we understand who God is to us, we can confidently refer to Him us our light and salvation. The Psalmists knows that he has enemies and an army stationed against him, but with God on his side, he is set even if there are more armies against him. 1Tim 1:12, &#8230;For I am persuaded that He is able&#8230;&#8221; meaning I am more than convinced that He can and He will so I will be confident not in myself but in Him.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 27:4, &#8220;4One thing I have desired of the LORD, That will I seek: That I may dwell in the house of the LORD All the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the LORD, And to inquire in His temple&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to believe God and do nothing about it, here we have a psalmist who believes God and puts his faith in God to seek the Him.\u00a0 Seeking the Lord has away of removing all the fears and doubts for the presence of the Lord like a fire consumes everything including that which is wet. When Elijah called fire from heaven, though we know it&#8217;s hard for fire to consume water and stones, the fire of God consumed everything. When we seek God, His fire will come down and consume the stones of pride in our lives, stones of doubt, and everything that will try and put off the fire. Yes He is around all the time and many times you may not feel Him but seeking Him gives you a chance to find Him. Then he says, &#8220;That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life&#8221;. Mmmm being in the house of the Lord? I wonder whether we all desire to be in the house of the Lord forever, cause to some, during the times they could be in the house of the Lord, they would rather do other things, may I remind you that the house of the Lord is the type of Ship that sails on top of the world. Again it&#8217;s the type of ship that sails on top of what the world is sinking in. The church is a place of refuge, yes we can meet God everywhere but I found that there is such a greater connection when I am in His house. David loved the house of the Lord that he gives this line to us in Psalms 84:10, &#8220;For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere, I&#8217;d rather be a door keeper in the house of the Lord than to dwell in the tents of the wickedness&#8221;. Imagine one day in the house of the Lord is better than days going parties, camping, vacation.\u00a0 &#8220;To behold the beauty of the LORD, And to inquire in His temple&#8221;. Behold is to view, observe, see, watch or take a look at the beauty of the Lord, His holiness, His Majestic splendor, His\u00a0 Excellency, how precious, gracious, merciful, powerful, present, the beauty of the Lord we behold when we come to seek Him. It&#8217;s in the process of beholding His beauty that we discover even more, He is Yahweh who has no beginning or end, He has no birth dates and He does not need anything to make Him complete for He is complete within Himself lacking nothing. In 1John 3:2, &#8220;&#8230;for we shall see Him as He is&#8221;, not as we perceive of Him or thought of Him but as HE IS. I found that the more I beheld His beauty, the more all my fears, doubt, confusion ran away for I allowed all these things to know who the Boss is, this have been the times I was reminded even more that if He does not come through for me, there will be no way out. Seek Him that you may see Him as HE IS.<br \/>\nThanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 27:1-14, &#8220;Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord&#8221; This is one of those days I have come in and did not know what the Lord would have me share on but our God is faithful, He&#8217;s words never fail for He is the Word and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-715","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-bx","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/715","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=715"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/715\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=715"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=715"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=715"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":733,"date":"2007-06-01T18:50:11","date_gmt":"2007-06-01T18:50:11","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/06\/01\/not-a-revised-edition\/"},"modified":"2007-06-01T18:50:11","modified_gmt":"2007-06-01T18:50:11","slug":"not-a-revised-edition","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/06\/01\/not-a-revised-edition\/","title":{"rendered":"Not A Revised&nbsp;Edition"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 119:89, &#8220;For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven&#8221;, Proverbs 30:5, &#8220;Every word of God is pure:\u2026&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I hate being deceived in anyway especially through the word of God preached by someone else. I am becoming very cautious about who preaching the teaching I listen as many today distort the word, preach error and heresy. They sound good and powerful but you find that it\u2019s not in line with the word of God if you study His word. There are people now who are trying to update the word of God thinking part of it is outdated. Just because many revised edition books go through revisions to keep up with the current world does not mean the bible falls under that category, it\u2019s content and meaning have never and will never change. You cannot take out anything or add anything to His word. The bible already states, \u201cFOREVER, O LORD, THY WORD IS SETTLED IN HEAVEN\u201d period. It addresses past, present and future.<\/p>\n<p>The word of God is God Himself revealed to us that to know Him. The word of God is the manual book for believers. His word is our light that guides us through this walk of life. God speaks to us through His to know what He requires of us. How will we know what is acceptable if we are not grounded and reading the word? In as much as we can be inspired through preaching, we have to be in a position where we can also get into the word and read it for ourselves and check it out. 2Tim 2:15, says &#8220;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&#8221;(KJV). The word of God cannot be repaired or changed, it is able by itself to do that which it purposes to do. His word has stood through the test of time. Psalm 119:89, &#8220;For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven&#8221;, His word is settled to which I can say it has defended itself and Christians know it&#8217;s ability to save, deliver, heal, provide, protect and the like. Over and over and over again we see the word going through the fire and coming out the same for we are told in Proverbs 30:5, &#8220;Every word of God is pure: &#8220;. His words are not corrupted and never will. Isaiah 40:8, &#8220;The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of the Lord shall stand forever&#8221;, If we are grounded in the word, we will stand.<\/p>\n<p>If you think the word is not being distorted today, think again. Today people want the bible to mean what they want it to mean rather than what the Author intended for it to mean. There are people who are now going back to the word of God and saying some of the things written were not actually what the bible meant when it said them or the bible was addressing the people of that time and not it\u2019s not applicable to our day so we have books and messages as revised edition to the word of God?. Do you know that there are people who are beginning to believe that David and Jonathan had a homosexual relationship? And so was Naomi and Ruth because the bible says they were close?. What\u2019s next?? We are living in times where if we don\u2019t know the word and grounded in sound doctrine, like many, we will be deceived, living a lie. We as Christians need to be discerning by the help of the Holy Spirit and His word that we may live by the truth that the truth may set us free. Be careful of who feeds you and be careful of those who try to revise the word of God to change the meanings.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 119:89, &#8220;For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven&#8221;, Proverbs 30:5, &#8220;Every word of God is pure:\u2026&#8221; I hate being deceived in anyway especially through the word of God preached by someone else.

Now it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, &#8220;Man of God, there is death in the pot!&#8221; And they could not eat it&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There was famine in the land of Gilgal. It wasn&#8217;t famine for truth or love, it was starvation for food. Now Elisha the man of God was with the sons of the prophets who I believe looked up to him as a great prophet and a leader. They knew him as a miracle worker too and even in the midst of this great famine, they believed God could provide a way through his servant Elisha. Elisha therefore tells his servant to Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophet vs. 39, So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, though they did not know what they were&#8221;. They were starving for food, in the process of setting the pot for stew, they still needed to find something to cook in that pot. Without knowing what to do, they bumped into some herbs and wild vine and cooked them anyway. Like these men, have you found yourself in the midst of something you knew you had to do, you wanted to do right and tried different things hoping they would work? I have. The bible says that after they cooked and served. It happened that as they were eating the stew, they cried out to the man of God saying, &#8220;there is death in the pot&#8221;. How is it that what is suppose to be good and sustain life was life threatening? How is it that in the midst of trying to live by the ten commandments to which many do only brings death? We want to live by the golden rule, do good that we may live but the more we eat from the pot of the commandments we find that there is death in it.<\/p>\n<p>Paul desired the stew of the law and when he started to eat from the pot of the law, he ran into a king size problem and he tells us in Romans 7:10, &#8220;And the commandment, which was to bring life, I found to bring death, 7:13, &#8220;Has then what is good (commandments) become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful&#8221;. Maybe Elisha would have not been affected by the stew which is a representation of Jesus who could eat from the pot of death and not die. It was to be a pot to restore life only that it brought death. I tried to live by the stew in the pot, it only brought me death because of my sinful nature that reminds me that I do not have a system that can defeat this death in the pot.<\/p>\n<p>2 Kings 4:41 So he said, &#8220;Then bring some flour.&#8221; And he put it into the pot, and said, &#8220;Serve it to the people, that they may eat.&#8221; And there was nothing harmful in the pot&#8221;, Is this not like what Jesus did for us, while there was death in the pot, he bled and died, rose and again and defeated death, now when we repent and put our trust in Him alone for our eternal salvation, we too have defeated death and we can eat from the pot and live because of what He has done. Elisha did not get rid of the stew and God also not get rid of the law. Elisha had flour put into the pot and served the people and so did God send His son in this pot we call earth and defeated its power over us therefore if you are not saved and are trying to live by the stew of commandments in this pot of life, rest be assured, there is death in the pot and only Jesus Christ has the cure for that stew.

I don&#8217;t know how many times I have talked about trusting in God to lead and then\u00a0 felt like I was by myself or I did not see how things were going to come out in the long run and if you&#8217;ve noticed, the Lord tells us things but He never explains Himself.<\/p>\n<p>When God called the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, the plan was to bring them to the promise land. When the Lord begins to do something, He already has an end result for it and so when He begins to do it, it&#8217;s not for Him to try and see if it would work but for Him to finish what He has began. We could start with Him and then give up but He will not. We see Him bring His people through the desert ultimately that He may bring them to the land He promised them. All of a sudden there are obstacles, barriers, partitions, walls, valleys just to mention a few. God did not tell them what it will take to bring them there meaning the process. God does not always tell us the PROCESS but the PURPOSE for if some of us knew the process, we would give up without going far. David was promised that He would be king, God did not tell him that He would wait 17years, be wanted dead by Saul and face many challenges. Joseph received a dream but he was not told the dream would nearly cost him his life (thrown into the pit, sold to Egypt, thrown in jail and then receive it. If these two guys ever knew the process, I bet they would have thought twice about the promise.<\/p>\n<p>While in the desert, the children of Israel were brought by the mountain Sinai and I believe they camped there for many days. The Lord may bring you through the desert but He will not leave you in the desert. That&#8217;s why we always need to be reminded that we are nomadic people. If we stop somewhere, we&#8217;ll be there for a season and not forever. One preacher said that, &#8220;never build a permanent decisions on a temporary situation&#8221; As nomadic people, we are always packed up so that we can pass over. If my friends are looking for me where I was yesterday, they will not find me for I am moving on. I may cry for a while, be broken, fall but I am not going to be down forever and don&#8217;t look for me down there cause I am passing over. It&#8217;s easy to settle at a place where you don&#8217;t fight anymore, quite and peaceful the same with the Israelites sitting by the mountain. God then said, &#8220;You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you\u00a0 northward&#8221; meaning it&#8217;s time to make a stand and move forward. Yes I brought you to this mountain but this was part of the process to get you ready for the promise land. I know how I struggle with this at times because I tend to be too territorial when I know for sure that God was just using that as a bridge. He may bring me to certain places just to rest and then move me to the next level. He wants me to go Northward as there is something about Northwards, it&#8217;s in His plan. Going forward would mean fighting our way through, as you read down in the same chapter, you see how they begun to fight many enemies that they may posses.<\/p>\n<p>They were not told that they would fight but that was part of the process. You and I should be thankful to God for not telling us what the process would be. This gave us the ability to trust Him through it all. Just like a blind man who needs someone else to lead him, we have God to lead us through the process. The process may not be easy but we sure know the promise and that is what keeps us humble. If He promised, sure enough He will accomplish it.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Deut 2:1-4, &#8220;&#8230;You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you\u00a0 northward&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to talk about trust and be led of God but when it comes to the actual action it becomes a little bit hard because of what we have trained ourselves to think of ourselves.

The Son of God created havoc for undertakers by speaking to their frigid merchandise. His voice was supernatural. A mere &#8220;Lazarus, come forth,&#8221; spoken to a corpse meant a nightmarish dilemma for the Bethany funeral director, because he was left with no body to deal with. Up until that moment, his business was mortally secure. Four days after the death, he had everything wrapped up, when suddenly, three words unraveled his inanimate toil.<\/p>\n<p>Reimbursement of all funeral expenses was just the beginning of the bad dream. Death was his living,\u00a0 and if this stranger from Nazareth continued to speak around graves, his business itself would soon be terminal. Jesus Christ was the undertaker&#8217;s nightmare because death bowed its vile knee to His voice, and the day is promised when all undertakers will hit the unemployment line!\u00a0 The raising of Lazarus snatched the profit from the undertaker; but the incident happened for the inestimable profit of humanity. It was the long-awaited fulfillment of what was spoken of by the prophets of old.

If any one be in Christ, he is a new creation, old things have passed a way and behold everything has become new, Paul tells us this in 2Cor 5:17. Salvation is the beginning in the life of a Christian. Many think hat once you get saved, then your life is complete. The term being born again, is like starting from the scratch and that requires a lot of growth. Salvation is free, the growth and the anointing you have to pay for it, it requires hard work.<\/p>\n<p>Mary and Elizabeth were both carrying seeds freely deposited in their wombs. The reason why they are carrying the seeds is because they are chosen. The bible says, &#8220;Many are called but few are chosen&#8221;, in our time it sounds like &#8220;many are cold but few are frozen&#8221; and that is because we want to stay saved and not ready to be used. We have been chosen by God to carry seeds. Every one has something that they can do for the Kingdom of God. These two have identified the seeds they are carrying, Mary is carrying the Messiah, the Savior of the world on the other hand Elizabeth is carrying the preparer of the way. Both have different gifts but they are significant. Not everyone is called and anointed to be a preacher, pastor, worship leader, manager or the like, you may have been called just to be an encourager, singer, worshiper or prayer warrior. Some have been called to reach out to certain people no one can reach but them. Being faithful in carrying that seed will cause you to be fulfilled. Going before God and trying to find out what He has planted in you will cost everything, you will linger longer before Him, He will put you at a place where He will strip your and begin to stir up the hidden anointing but it&#8217;s worth having it.<br \/>\nThe two women get to meet together and after greeting each other, Elizabeth&#8217;s baby in womb leaped with joy and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. There is something about getting yourself close to those who challenge you in your walk. My growth has always been through being challenged.\u00a0 Whether in prayer, reading the word, doing memory verses, preaching, I had someone somewhere provoking me to get to where I needed to be. They may have not told me but their life challenged me and I had to reposition myself.\u00a0 I had to adjust my life style, cut down some things that would hinder the anointing, I had to get more stuff that would help grow as I prayed more for the anointing. I haven&#8217;t reached where I believe I need to be but God is working it through me. &#8220;Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, Phil 2:12.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Do you realize you are not a cheerleader in the kingdom? you are a team player, put on your uniform, find the position in the field and be the player God wants you to be. Not every one can play defensive, some play offensive. Find your place in the kingdom and be active in it. Carry the seed, carry the fruits and change your entire surrounding cause you have the seed. Be pregnant with destiny that heights, depths, principalities, rulers of darkness, spiritual wickedness, things present not even the things to come will abort the seed inside of you. Use your talents God has given you because God has chosen you for a time like this. These are all hard work.

He fed us, ministered to us, provided for us and the like and we knew for sure that it was God&#8217;s will to be in that place, but we need to understand that there are times when the brook dries up meaning that which you thought would always be there is gone. The zeal you had for that position dried up, the patience you had for that thing dried up. At this time it&#8217;s very easy to say it may have not been God&#8217;s will for you to be there but the truth of the matter is, it was His will but for a season. When you are getting comfortable, He will relocate you so as to depend on Him even more. Change causes us to see God in different dimensions and change also allows us not to limit God in any way. If God provided away for you in this, believe that He has already provided another way for He is the way maker.<\/p>\n<p>Guys, the brook can dry up, your spiritual brook can dry up, zeal to serve others can dry up, finances can dry up, and jobs and positions can also dry up for we the believers are nomadic people always on the move climbing from glory to glory. Don&#8217;t expect to find some of us in the previous brooks for when they dried up, it was time to trust God for the next move.. Don&#8217;t be trying to revive a brook that dried up for what God has closed can no man open and what God has opened can no man close. Ask the Lord what direction to take, He has a lot of ways of blessing His people.<\/p>\n<p>My question to God is, why allow a brook to dry up while the three year period of no rain is still on? read from vs. 8 and you will see that God was providing another way and this time Elijah is to meet a widow who will provide for him. I bet Elijah went happy for God had provided a way but God did not tell him that the widow had only little oil and little flour to which she was just going to make the last bread for her and her son and thereafter die. Greater levels, greater service to others, greater miracles to be expected and so are greater challenges. At the brook he wasn&#8217;t serving and yet he had enough, at the widow&#8217;s, he is expected to serve while there is less than enough but the good news is that he is sent to rescue someone else. Thank God that when He relocates you, He has someone or some people in mind He desires you to reach. As He blesses them, He will bless you too. The bible says that &#8220;don&#8217;t be weary in well doing for in time you will reap if you don&#8217;t faint&#8221;. At first it was about his needs, now it&#8217;s about other people&#8217;s needs and his. Lord when the brook has dried up, send me to another place for there is still much to be done.<\/p>\n<p>Have a blessed weekend<\/p>\n<p>* Keep my wife and I in prayers, I fly out on Wednesday night to pick her up to come home after being away in college.

We know this for sure for the word of God says that in Isaiah 55:8&amp;9, &#8220;for my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my way, for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways&#8221; says the Lord. When you think that everything is out of control, He is in control, nothing escapes Him. Eccle 3:11, &#8220;He has made everything beautiful in His time&#8221;. We need to understand that it&#8217;s His time that counts and not my time.<\/p>\n<p>Elijah the prophet in 1Kings 17 has just prophesied to king Ahab that there would be no rain in Israel for a period of three years. If you look at chapter 16 of 1Kings vs. 33, &#8220;And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him&#8221;. Ahab was bad news, he had married a wicked woman by the name of Jezebel who turned his heart away from God. Anytime God is getting ready to do something in a land, He will always provide a way for escape for His children. Though the wickedness of Ahab provoked God to shut the heavens from providing rain, everyone in the land of Israel had to be affected by that circumstance regardless of whether they were righteous or not. It&#8217;s true even today people do things that cause others to suffer and yet they are innocent (I use that word loosely).<\/p>\n<p>I thank God that Romans 8:1, there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, Psalm 91, &#8221; for in times of trouble God will hide us under His pavilion in the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me for in the absence of everything that I need daily, Phil 4:19, He will provide according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Elijah has prophesied and the prophesy also affects him for he lives in Israel but He is faithful to take God at His word. 1Kings 17:2&amp;3, &#8220;Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, &#8220;Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan. And it will be that you shall drink from the brooks, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there&#8221;. Praise God for His plans and provisions, in as much as there is drought in the land, God had preserved a brook for His chosen man, and on the other hand, He has commanded the ravens to feed him with bread and meat. I would pause here for a sec. I understand something about the brook for it must have been flowing from the river Jordan, but how do you explain the bread, where was the bread and meat coming from? who was baking the bread? and how come the raven could not eat the bread? and to make it even interesting, the raven knew who Elijah was?.<\/p>\n<p>We will never fully grasp how God works but we sure love when He does the impossible. He is the God who takes less and does much with it. He is the God who does things that leaves you wondering how He did it and it&#8217;s for us also to understand that our ways are not His ways. How we see things are not how He sees them. When you least expect Him to move that is the time He will move. When you think that there is nothing around He can use, that is the time He will surprise you by taking that little thing and making something great out of it. There could be something around you, at your job, an idea, a seed at home you never thought He could use, but don&#8217;t be surprised to see the things you despised being used to get you to the next level.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Kings 17:1-7, &#8220;And it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land&#8221; It&#8217;s very easy to talk about God providing but waiting for Him to provide can be very difficult.

I needed to be challenged again by it this morning. I pray you<br \/>\nare too. Be blessed as you read it<\/p>\n<p>Prayer is not reserved for when we are in trouble, prayer is a daily communication with the Creator whether we are in need of something from Him or not. Prayer is the backbone that keeps him or her standing strong. It&#8217;s one thing to talk about prayers, it another thing to do it. We are told in James 1:22, &#8220;Be ye doers of the word not just hearers only deceiving your own self&#8221;. The word is not complete when it&#8217;s heard, it can only be complete when what has been received is put into practice. We could talk about faith, healing, provisions but unless we put it into practice we will be deceiving ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>Math 6:33, &#8220;But Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness&#8230;&#8221;. This is one of the scripture verses people know by heart, it has be used in the songs, quoted, used in sermons and the like but it&#8217;s kind of interesting how it started with a &#8220;BUT&#8221;. Any time someone uses the word &#8220;BUT&#8221;, there must have been something communicated earlier related to it and the &#8220;BUT&#8221; becomes a condition that comes with what had been said earlier. Let&#8217;s go back to vs. 31, &#8220;Therefore do not worry, saying, &#8220;what shall we eat? or drink? or what shall we wear? vs. 32 For after all these things the Gentiles seek. Your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things, vs. 33 BUT&#8221;. It&#8217;s already been established that God knows what we need and desire even before we look to Him but He says SEEK YE FIRST which means put God first, call on Him first, before you worry about anything and before you begin to bring things before Him, PUT HIM FIRST. You cannot confidently come to someone and ask them for something if you are not close to them, that just puts you in an awkward position. The word SEEK is very powerful, seek is to look for, search for, try to find, hunt for and that tells me that seeking God&#8217;s Kingdom is not an easy task for you have to search for it, you got to find it, you got to linger longer, you got to hunt for it. That is why prayer is not easy I struggle with it myself and even sharing on prayers becomes tough.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve looked at SEEK and now it says FIRST the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, mark the way it puts it, it doesn&#8217;t say bring all your requests, questions, and desires first, it says seek His Kingdom first meaning find God&#8217;s presence by worshipping Him, giving Him glory, honoring Him, Exalting Him for you are not seeking a small thing you are actually seeking a KINGDOM. There is more to the kingdom than the give me list we are prepared with. Seeking the Kingdom of God first humbles me as the awesome presence of God who presents and represents the Kingdom shows up and we are engulfed by the kingdom principles and all our fleshly ambitions and desires are consumed by the presence of God and now we pray &#8220;thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven&#8221;. I have been to prayer services and even heard people pray and the first things I heard was the give me list being presented to God. Where is seeking the Kingdom of God first and His righteousness? Our prayers can never be answered if we haven&#8217;t confessed our sins before God and therefore when we pray for righteousness, we are praying for purification, sanctification, washing and mercy, Heb 4:16, &#8220;let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need&#8221;. We have to obtain mercy before grace can abound and the only way we can obtain mercy is by admitting that we have sinned against heaven and are humbled by the fact that we have failed, then mercy is given and then when we are in need to which we always are, grace is offered. Now grace is not given to the qualifiers but to the ones who have been shown mercy. I believe that if we can develop how we come before God so seek His kingdom and His righteousness, at times the things that we were going to bring before Him would just be added even before we mention them. For if you go back to vs. 31&amp;32 it says, He knows that you need these things then shall be added to you. Hold here for a sec, it says all these things will be &#8220;ADDED&#8221; not &#8220;GIVEN&#8221;. Why added and not given? because in\u00a0 the process of seeking, you are changed, touched, forgiven, convicted, transformed and these are given as priority for we need them and now the other things we were bringing before Him are just additions to what we desired of Him.<\/p>\n<p>Mark 11:24, &#8220;What things so ever you desire when you pray, believe you receive them and you shall have them&#8221;. Remember we talked about the desires of our hearts? the more you spend time with God, the more He reveals to you and the more that becomes your desires. When you and I seek Him first, He will give us the Kingdom stuff, reveal to us more and we can begin to desire them and now we can pray for them to be fulfilled.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Math 6:33, &#8220;But Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be ADDED unto you&#8221; Wanted to share a message I shared on back in 2002 that was a blessing to me.

Always eager to hear, receive and be ministered to but what about us ready to give? and I&#8217;m not talking about finances but give time, help that is needed and more so bring people to the Kingdom?. We always come for us, I have seen this even with small ministries, everyone is trying to find out who is going to be there and what to expect and receive instead of what can I give or what can I do in this ministry. How about worship, many are waiting for God to give them a spirit of worship before they can worship. When I read the bible, we are the ones to worship God. David says, &#8220;I will not offer to the Lord what cost me nothing&#8221;, it&#8217;s our duty to give Him all the praises and not do it when we feel like. &#8220;We bring sacrifices of praise&#8221;, at times it will cost us.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus served the disciples in the last supper. He knew who will betray Him, deny Him and doubt Him yet He served them anyway. He knew He did not come to receive but came to give. He girded Himself with a towel, went down on His knees and washed His disciples feet regardless of who they were and what He knew about them, read it in John 13.<\/p>\n<p>We have been called to service, we are being raised for a time like this not just to be receivers but givers too. &#8220;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain&#8221;. There is no resurrection without death. The grain of wheat is very small but we are told of how significant it is when planted. We too as believers may be very small in the church and might not be known but the truth of the matter is, we are very significant. Your prayers, presence, support does make a difference because you are significant in the body of Christ. Look at the verse closely, it says unless the grain of wheat\u00a0 which refers to only one grain (individual), God calls His people as individuals, He does not call us as a group. We are called to die to self as the grain needs to fall on the dirt and die. Most of those who go up and stay up have had an experience of going down first.<\/p>\n<p>One has to fall on the ground and die, it&#8217;s because when anything falls into the ground, the outward appearance (shell) is consumed by the ground and real seed which is on the inside begins to show forth. We have to be stripped of self righteousness and feeling that we are a little bit better and be brought to a place where the ground consumes what we perceive ourselves and allow the Lord to transform the inside. This might not happen overnight as when it falls on the ground it remains by itself for a season before it shoots from the ground and later produces much grain. I don&#8217;t know about you but for me, preparation takes place in the closet and like the seed which is not seen when it begins to go through the process, results is all the other people will see.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot\u00a0 be effective in reaching if we are not willing to die to self, sacrifice or give time, money, talents etc. I was never anointed to sit on it but to utilize in reaching others.<\/p>\n<p>What do you have and what can you give?, are you always on the verge of receiving and never giving? Pray today that God will teach you how to fall on the ground like the grain seed\u00a0 and die to things that hinder your step to give. Give your time, talents, gifts, energy, experiences, knowledge, wisdom, love, patience, understanding and the list goes on.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 12:24, &#8220;&#8230;unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain&#8221; It&#8217;s easy for People to go to church on the basis of what they will gain, what God can do for us.

We a people who were once alienated because of our sinful nature were bought with a price that we might become heirs and joint heirs with the Father. Actually the bible says we were adopted. Anytime a child is adopted into a family, a process of documentation takes place that the child may officially belong in that family then he or she becomes an heir too.<\/p>\n<p>As an heir, we do not take things lightly and casually. We do not waste, manipulate or kid around with certain things we need daily especially when in trouble. It does bug me to hear people use the name of the Lord in vain while we believers use the name when we need help. Constantly I hear people use the name of the Lord as a disgust word when something happens to them and that does grieve me because it sounds like someone taking his father&#8217;s name and using it as a filth word. The bible says, &#8220;You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain&#8221;. This name cannot be misused just because it&#8217;s available, it&#8217;s a special name. I have come to discover that even Christians can use His name in vain when we say things like &#8220;oh my God&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;oh God&#8221; in things not suggesting calling His name but using it to express something.<\/p>\n<p>I want to use that name of the Lord in meaningfully. See we are told that just mentioning His name is enough to get the job done. Psalm 124:8, &#8220;our help is in the name of the Lord who made the heaven and earth&#8221;, Psalm 18:3, &#8220;I will call upon the name of the Lord who is worthy to be praised, so shall I be saved from my enemies&#8221;, Prov 18:10, &#8220;The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous run into it and they are safe&#8221;, Romans 10:13, &#8220;Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&#8221;. When enemies come like a flood, I will call upon His name, and so is when I am overwhelmed, I will run to His name for there is safety there. There is something about the name of the Lord that makes one want to pause for a second and begin to cherish it. That is the name that is above every name and at the mention of that name, every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. It&#8217;s not a disgusting name but a powerful name, when that name is mentioned demons tremble for they don&#8217;t mess with that name. So if the demons tremble at the mention of that name, how much more should we tremble at the mention of His name?.<\/p>\n<p>One day I was coming from school and it was snowing heavily in fact the classes were canceled. So driving down the hill from school, the car I was driving lost control and started skidding off the road down the hill heading towards the trees. Everything I tried to do to bring it back to control failed. Right before me there were so many trees I was heading to hit and all I could think of was the name of Jesus. I began to shout that name and believe it, the car missed those so many trees and landed in between two trees. It&#8217;s calling that name that saved me and the car that day. I left the car there that cold night to walk a couple of miles to make a phone call but I had every reason to praise Him. The car was towed out of the ditch the next day and believe it or not, the car did not have even a scratch on it. I&#8217;m glad that I called on that name.<\/p>\n<p>I want to cherish that name, I want reverence that name for in time of need I can call on Him. See I walk with Him, talk to Him, live for Him and worship Him so I don&#8217;t feel guilty when I call His name when I need Him. Let&#8217;s not wait until we are in trouble to know and call Him, let that be our daily routine and have His name reserved for those times when we really need Him. The bible says that blessed is he that comes in the name of Lord. I have come to work in His name, I will stand in His name, I will overcome in His name and I will not sit without saying anything to those who take His name in vain. There is something about His name!!!!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Exodus 20:3, &#8220;You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain&#8221; We have an awesome opportunity to be called the children of God.

Bury The Dead Yet, Part&nbsp;3"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>2Kings 4:8-37, &#8220;&#8230; it is well&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Shunammite&#8217;s son is dead, she may have been the only one who knew that the child was dead. Maybe she wanted to keep it to herself for now till she had the man of God say there was no more to hope for beyond facts. Maybe if everyone else knew including her husband, they would overwhelm her by their reaction to the situation, the reason she kept the news to herself. I have shared something things I was hoping for from God with some people, and their reaction was so discouraging that I wondered why I did not keep to myself and when God did it, then I would testify about it. I can now understand why some miracles Jesus, Elisha, Peter and the rest did, they kicked everyone out of the room. There are people who can be a distraction to what hoping for.<\/p>\n<p>When a person dies, the next move is to bury the person, it&#8217;s a simple as that. I would think this woman would notify the family and do the same as the fact remained, her son was dead. It&#8217;s not mentioned to us whether she began to mourn or anything of the sort, but we see her in motion and action. She remembers the promise and how the promise is a sign of abundance. Thank God for the great victories He gave you in the past, this will cause you to trust in Him again cause if He did it then, He can do it again.<\/p>\n<p>She takes upon herself to go into the man of God&#8217;s room and places the child there and leaves to find the man of God. God desires us to put our burdens before Him, in the sanctuary, in His house and then seek Him. In as much as the fact is my situation, dreams, desires have died before my eyes, I want God have the final say in it, UNTIL THEN I REFUSE TO BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND CHOOSE TO SEE WHAT I BELIEVE AND THAT IS SEEING IT FROM GOD&#8217;S WAY. While looking for Elisha, I believe she was encouraging herself in the midst of her troubled soul, full of sorrow yet speaking these words, &#8220;It is well with my soul&#8221; Because she could see the beam of light through hope at the end of the tunnel. That the same God who blessed her with a son through his servant, is the same God who would restore her son through the same man. She finally meets the Elisha the Man of God and the first question she is asked, &#8220;Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with your son? and she said it is well&#8221;. Not that &#8220;it SHALL be well&#8221; she says, &#8220;it is WELL&#8221;. The Man of God sends his servant to raise the child by putting Elisha&#8217;s stuff on the boy but that did not bring him back to life. There are some miracles God will not send any of the angels to do it, but He will show up Himself and do it. Finally Elisha shows up and the story line ends with a resurrection and once again the family is happy again because of a woman had concrete facts she did not deny yet chose to see truth in the midst of it by pushing her faith to see what she believed in the midst of believing what she saw.<\/p>\n<p>Why do we sometimes bury the dead quick? I&#8217;m a victim. We give up to quick even before involving God, we are too quick to get hold of the shovel to bury that which is hurting us simply because the things we thought would work out are dead. Many times we have no one to stand with us, pray with us or even encourage us. I want to encourage myself to day by speaking the same words, &#8220;It is well with my soul&#8221;, God is in control. If I can&#8217;t get someone to encourage me, I will encourage myself. Be your best encourager and let God take over. Let God be the final judge in your condition. In your ministry, finances, work, relationships, dreams and desires, let it go. I don&#8217;t know what would have happened if she buried the son, thank God she did not. As you read in other chapters through series of events, this woman was blessed even more because of her testimony.

She does not know that she is opening channels for blessings just because of her faithfulness. Her character towards her husband and people has opened doors for her to exercise the biggest faith in her life and after a season, she is receives the promise. Promise is always a sign of abundance.<\/p>\n<p>Today let&#8217;s explore more on the life of the Shunammite woman as we see how her faith gets boosted again after a series of things that causes her not to live by facts but by truth fueled by faith. It happened that after a couple of years when the boy was old enough he would go to the field to work with his father. One thing I need to point out is that whenever God blesses one person, someone else will also benefit from that blessing. You may not have much to share, but sharing your testimony would cause someone to trust God for their miracle. Her faithfulness causes the husband to have someone he can call his son. If you asked for it or was just bestowed on you, I would say, you are the first one the blessing and so the more you disperse and share the more you receive. Blessed is the hand that gives than the one that takes or receives.<\/p>\n<p>While in the field one day, the boy complained of headache and the father decides to bring him home. Something amazing is that the father does not know what to do and perceives that the wife would know what to do. I do respect women, for their courage (Esther), persistence (The woman with the issue of blood), prayers (Hannah), followers and teachable (Ruth) and they don&#8217;t give up until they have attained it. Thank God for the women, they know how to get blessings from the Lord. They linger longer, go to churches today and you will find that in the intercessory ministry are dominated by women (I&#8217;m in one). They stick with something till the end. There are so many women in the bible I could use as examples.<\/p>\n<p>The Shunammite woman has been given the boy and like the husband, she may have not known what to do, so she let the boy on her laps till noon and then he died. Oh my God, the promise is gone, how can this been? how did this happen?, wasn&#8217;t this suppose to be good forever? Should I hold my fist at God? With all these, fear grips, deception feelings find their way in, doubts replaces faith if allowed to. Our attitude and action at this hour matters a lot for what is over to you may not be over for the Lord. &#8220;Hold your peace, be still and know that I am God&#8221;, Psalm 46:10. Have you ever received a promise from above and people around you enjoyed them and the moment things started going wrong, they threw words back at you like, &#8220;didn&#8217;t I tell you this will not work?&#8221; Everything is laid back on your lap and only you with faith in God has the power to change it&#8217;s destiny. You will be the only one to have a passion to see it come to life again and that could mean going an extra mile to seek God for you. The fact is, you have something dead in your lap, the truth is, it&#8217;s not over till God says so. So don&#8217;t burry the dead yet until you have consulted the giver of the promise.

FACTS and TRUTHS. We are going to be seeing a lot of facts and less of truths in the natural but as we go deeper, we will begin to see more truths than facts. Facts are reality, can be seen and if not, there are proofs for them. Truths negates the facts seeing potentials in the midst of facts. Fact is, we are sinners, truth is, He has redeemed us from the curse of sin through His shed blood on the cross.<\/p>\n<p>In 2 Kings, the Shunammite woman is the type of woman than any man would desire to wife because of her character. She is the type that desires the best and is more concerned about other people&#8217;s welfare than hers. If that is not enough, she respects her husband to the extent that she will not execute any plans without consulting him. The greatest of all is that she is a woman of Faith, she is a history maker.<\/p>\n<p>It happens that a man of God (Elisha) often times came to town (Shunem) and she perceived that he was a man of God. She consults her husband about preparing a place for the man of God so that whenever he is in town, he can find a place to sleep, have rest and have good meal prepared for him. Over and over again this happens and the man of God chooses to bless her for her kindness her by calling those things which are not as though they were. She is promised a son despite the odds and facts that she could have been barren. The other fact is that her husband is old. A person&#8217;s character opens doors for greater miracles if that person can withstand truths that fuels faith in the midst of facts he or she cannot deny. Heb 11:1, &#8220;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&#8221;. Here is a woman who is about to receive what she did not ask for and her faith has to be boosted to believe it and receive it in spite of the fact that it&#8217;s nearly impossible. She has a promise to hope in the season in which it was promised.<\/p>\n<p>Has God promised you blessings through His word while serving Him?. Don&#8217;t give because He will elevate you in due season. His promise could be coming in the midst of concrete facts. And your faith is going to have to go beyond the facts to receive the promise. God is the only ONE can defy the laws of nature (facts) and demonstrate His Truths. The bible says that you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free as something could be a fact and not be the truth. Trust God for the biggest thing you could ever think of according to His will and ask Him to help your unbelief by giving you increasing your faith in the midst of concrete facts To continue&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Kings 4:8-37, &#8220;&#8230; it is well&#8230;&#8221; In the story we are about to look at deals with both FACTS and TRUTHS.

While you are still working on this, here comes another one; while trying to work on another one, here comes a new one. I tend to believe that everything has its season and how we deal with a situation during a certain season will determine the outcome. It&#8217;s easy to allow overwhelming situations to chock out peace, confidence and courage, as the weeds chock out good plants. Here is our encouragement.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nVs. 1 Hear my cry, O God, attend to my prayer, the first thing is prayer, have you prayed in and over your situation or did you wait for someone to come and lay hands and pray over you? Lay your own foundation and let someone else help you build the walls. I have met people that wanted some things happen in their lives and the first question I asked them, &#8220;Have you laid your foundation?&#8221;, you can help build the walls but foundation has to be laid by an individual. What is the foundation, faith. Vs. 2 From the ends of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed, Lead me to the rock that is higher than I, of course our hearts will get overwhelmed and so will our minds and our bodies but what happens when they get overwhelmed? Please don&#8217;t lead me to temptation, friends, neighbors, and programs, lead me to the rock not just any rock, But the Rock that is higher than I. Why the rock?, the rock cannot be overwhelmed, moved or shaken and if the rock is higher than I, I will make it my dwelling place while hiding under it. Vs. 3 For you have been a shelter for me, A strong water from the enemy, It&#8217;s encouraging to know in Prov 18:10, that &#8220;The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous run into it and they are safe&#8221;. Just His name alone is a strong tower in other words a strong rock. When you find yourself overwhelmed, calm your nerves, speak peace to yourself and find the rock that is higher than you. The bible says in Nehemiah 8:10, &#8220;&#8230;for the joy of the Lord is your strength.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The unbelievers ask me why I always have this joy even when things at times don&#8217;t go right or when I am overwhelmed, it&#8217;s because I have learnt the secret which\u00a0 is the joy of the Lord is my strength. Vs. 8, So I will praise Your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows. The writer concludes the chapter with this line as in the process of hiding under the rock, he will continue to praise and be glad and daily perform his vows. We have vowed to be the best we can be at our jobs, in our homes by God&#8217;s grace without complaining or murmuring &#8220;for it is God which works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure&#8221;, Phil 2:13. So keep on fighting the good fight of a soldier, enduring for He is your Rock of Ages, Strong Tower, Firm Foundation, Solid Rock, Anchor of you Life,<\/p>\n<p>To sum up, we are all children in warriors gear.

by Bob Brubaker submitted by John&nbsp;Bell"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>I wanted to finish but I wanted to quit. I was in a great deal of pain, so much pain that I couldn&#8217;t stand upright. As I got closer to the finish line I knew I had to keep pressing on and not quit. Thankfully, I made it and finished Ironman Arizona on April 15 by the grace of God. I fought through many difficulties and the biggest, coming back from being one breath from death just two years ago. LOOK WHAT GOD CAN DO!<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something about practicing the principle of stick-to-it-tive-ness in everything so it carries over the big things of life. Let&#8217;s look at this principle:<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it takes sticking it out to the end in order to win the battle. You can call it perseverance, you can call it patience, or you can call it stick-to-it-tive- ness &#8211; it&#8217;s a matter of finishing what you have started no matter what the cost. Self discipline is the artillery for battle within. The more we stick to the plan we set out to do and bring ourselves in line the more we&#8217;ll enjoy the sweet victories along the way. But there&#8217;s always a temptation in the loneliness of self discipline to give in and give up.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s an account in the Old Testament where David is reviewing the people in his life that have really meant something to him. Stuck in the middle of the list is a guy named Eleazar. Eleazar&#8217;s claim to fame in the eyes of King David was his &#8220;stick-to-it-tive-ness.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2 Samuel 23:9-10 Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty men, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim for battle. Then the men of Israel retreated, 10 but he stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead.<\/p>\n<p>David and his men went out and taunted the enemy. Can you hear them? &#8220;Here we are come and get us.&#8221; When the enemy decided they heard enough and started after David and his men &#8211; everyone retreated but Eleazar. It says he stood his ground. And did he ever. He stayed put until the job was done. He had every opportunity to run like the rest. He had every reason to give up. But he didn&#8217;t give up. He didn&#8217;t run away from the challenge. He stayed until the job was complete. Even when his hand grew tired he just held on all the more tightly and did not quit.<\/p>\n<p>What a lesson! You and I can find every excuse in the book to leave whatever we know we should do. We can find every reason to give up and join others not engaged in the job we are doing. We can allow our weariness to overcome us and give in to giving up. Or we can be like Eleazar and grip a little tighter, go on a little longer, until the job is done.<\/p>\n<p>It makes me think of the discipline it takes to compete as an athlete. It&#8217;s amazing how many people you see doing other things when you set out to train. There&#8217;s no glory in training and the distractions are many. Self discipline is a lonely job. Weariness can get the best of you if you let it. Or you can stick to it and know it will pay off in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>Paul in the New Testament was quite impressed with the discipline of athletes as he wrote: 1 Corinthians 9:24-27 Do you not know that in a race all the runners\u00a0 run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. 25 Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. 26 Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air. 27 No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s that &#8220;stick-to-it-tive-ness&#8221; again. Paul is not going to give up on the battle of self discipline. He knew he had to hold on just like Eleazar, and just like we do. Don&#8217;t let go. Stick to it. Keep your grip tight and you like Eleazar, and like Paul can find victory in your life too. When it comes to life &#8211; your walk with God, your marriage, your daily work, your training, your parenting, church life, etc. there&#8217;s no substitute for &#8220;stick-to-it-tive-ness.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, I wanted to finish but I wanted to quit.

Amos 8:11-13<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial Narrow\">Destruction was to come upon the city of Samaria which would be the cause of bitter mourning. Amos described the event in terms of a funeral for an only son.\u00a0 He continued the use of metaphorical language as he depicted a coming famine. It was no ordinary famine but one of the words of the Lord (v.11). He pictured men longing and searching for God\u2019s Word as starving people seek food or water (vv.12-13). But despite their search they received no word from the Lord. They had rejected the word, not realizing its great value, and had lost it forever (cf. Luke 17:22; John 7:34).<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial Narrow\">Isn\u2019t it amazing the magnitude of this famine?\u00a0 The Scriptures point out that even the lovely young women and strong young man would be affected by it.\u00a0 Young people are known for their strength.\u00a0 In Proverbs 31:3 King Lemuel\u2019s mother gave him and an oracle his mother when she said to him: \u201cdo not spend your strength on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings.\u201d\u00a0 Now even though this was a warning against sensual lust, the fact still remains that this king\u2019s mother was warning this young man not to allow his inner strength of character or virtue to be drained by an outside force.\u00a0 1 John 2:14 reads \u201c\u2026I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.\u00a0 The young were characterized by being strong, and having the Word of God living within them, and therefore overcoming the evil one.\u00a0 But, if there is a famine of the Word of God, not even the young will stand based on their youth alone!\u00a0 These need the Word of God flowing through their very veins!\u00a0 Just as one gets vaccinations and booster shots to keep up with their immunizations so to does one need to be vaccinated by the Word of God, and have daily booster shots of daily time reading, memorizing, and mediating on it.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><u><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial Narrow\">Illustration \u2013 Water or Money<\/font><\/strong><\/u><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial Narrow\">?<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial Narrow\">If you were offered a handful of $1,000 bills or a glass of cool water, which would you choose?

Amos described the event in terms of a funeral for an only son.\u00a0 He continued the use of metaphorical language as he depicted a coming famine. It was no ordinary famine but one of the words of the Lord (v.11). He pictured men longing and searching for God\u2019s Word as starving people seek food or water (vv.12-13). But despite their search they received no word from the Lord. They had rejected the word, not realizing its great value, and had lost it forever (cf.

To his astonishment, it was $50,000 plus \u201cmy Bible and all it contains.\u201d\u00a0 The youth was delighted to receive the money. However, he knew what the Bible contained, and because he wasn\u2019t into religion he didn\u2019t bother to open it. Instead, he put it on a high shelf. He gambled the $50,000, and over the next fifty years he lived as a pauper, scraping for every meal. Finally he became so destitute, he had to move in with his relatives. When he cleaned out his room, he reached up to get the dusty old Bible from the shelf. As he took it down, his trembling hands dropped it onto the floor, flinging it open to reveal a $100 bill between every page.\u00a0 The man had lived as a pauper, simply because of his prejudice. He thought he knew what the Bible \u201ccontained.\u201d\u00a0 The Bible has treasures, and spiritual nourishment you need for your survival.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">Can you imagine having a famine of the Word of God?\u00a0 Imagine Bibles taken off the shelves of stores all around the world.\u00a0 It is illegal in some countries to even own a Bible.\u00a0 What happens if and when that happens in this country?\u00a0 Which one book takes a definite stand against abortion, homosexuality, postmodernism, and a host of other controversial issues without compromise, but the Word of God?\u00a0 With the way the USA is going, I can see the continual moral decay, and the word of man taking more and more precedence over the Word of God.\u00a0 Postmodern thought desires to rob words of their meaning yielding the definition of words to the one that uses the word.\u00a0 Hence words therefore would have no meaning, while using words to define postmodernism thought.\u00a0 If words have no meaning then, the Word of God would also fall victim to this epidemic, and every devotion, sermon, conversation you\u2019ve had with a loved one would be empty and void of any meaning.\u00a0 Do you have the Word of God so settled in your heart, especially through Scripture memory (not memorizing the whole thing) that should that day come you know how to live God\u2019s Word without the thin lined pages of your Bible so easily accessible?\u00a0 Imagine the worst famine the world has ever seen, \u201c a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.\u201d It certainly happened in the Scriptures, perhaps it will happen again.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting that the famine wasn\u2019t one of food or water.\u00a0 Yet Job said, &#8220;I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food (Job 23:12),&#8221; and Jesus said in John 4:32-34, &#8220;I have food to eat that you know nothing about.\u00a0 Then his disciples said to each other, &#8220;Could someone have brought him food?&#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;My food,&#8221; said Jesus, is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.\u201d Furthermore in speaking with the women at the well &#8220;Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,<sup> 14<\/sup> but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.

The bible says,&#8221; God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&#8221;, Psalm 46:1. He is our present help when we face tough situations in life. He is the only one whom we can run to.<\/p>\n<p>Many times we become experts in asking and fail to come back to truly give thanks. In the bible there were ten lepers who came to Jesus crying for healing. After Jesus told them to go and show themselves to the Priest as sign of healing, they became healed on their way but only one came back to give thanks to the Lord. Jesus asked him what happened to the other nine who also received healing. The man who came back to give thanks was completely made whole meaning that his healing was not for a season but forever. How many times does God do things for us and we forget to give Him thanks and if we do, it&#8217;s one of those quick thanks. Remember when you went before Him to ask for that thing for days and when He finally came through for you, a quick two minutes thanks is all He got. I believe that when we give thanks, we are creating more channels for more blessings and not only that, when we give thanks, the blessing is sealed (completed)<\/p>\n<p>At times it&#8217;s not easy to give thanks when what you desire has not been released to you. What do we do when we apply for jobs, at the end we say, &#8220;Thanking you in advance&#8221; not knowing whether we will get it or not. I thank God in advance as a sign that I trust that He can do it and He will according to His will and in His time, so I thank Him in advance. He is the God who calls those things that are not as though they were because He knows that by the time He is done making it, it will become what He said it will be despite what it is today.<\/p>\n<p>David learnt the secret of giving thanks to the Lord and many places in the bible you hear him talking about giving thanks. Psalm 92, &#8220;It&#8217;s is good to give thanks to the Lord and sing praises unto my God&#8221; Oh give thanks to the Lord for His mercies endures for ever.<\/p>\n<p>You may say that you have nothing to thank God for, well you are a live today, you have a job, you have a place to live, you drive, the most important thing, you are saved. We have a reason to thank Him today, even when I thought that today I would ask Him for more stuff, I feel like I need to thank Him for many things that He has done, some of them haven&#8217;t come to pass yet but I thank Him for them. Let&#8217;s enter into His gates with thanksgiving in our hearts and into His courts with praise. Have a blessed day. Blessings Ev<\/p>\n<p>FYI. Please keep the need below in prayer.

He feared becoming a mere puppet in God\u2019s hands.\u00a0\u00a0 &#8220;So Miss Mears asked him to watch as she turned on a lamp. One moment it was dark, then she turned on the switch. She explained, \u2018The lamp surrendered itself to the electric current and light has filled the room. The lamp didn\u2019t destroy its personality when it surrendered to the current. On the contrary-the very thing happened for which the lamp was created: it gave light.\u2019&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ezra submitted himself to the Hand of the Lord upon his life and he wasn\u2019t a puppet that was forever to live a life of boredom under God\u2019s control.\u00a0 The very opposite was true.\u00a0 Because God\u2019s hand was upon Ezra\u2019s life to great things took place.<\/p>\n<p>First God \u201cextended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the king\u2019s powerful officials.\u201d\u00a0 God brought Ezra into favor with the king and his advisors.\u00a0 I shared in 2004 a message on how God can give you favor with the ungodly.\u00a0 How else other than God\u2019s hand being upon you can this happen.\u00a0 When an ungodly person is against the God you serve, and His cause that you live for it is a God thing when you are brought into favor with such a person.\u00a0 Secondly, King Artaxerxes had granted liberty to the Jews.\u00a0 God\u2019s hand brought courage to Ezra as well.

(Ezra 7:9-10)<\/p>\n<p>The book of Ezra whose name likely means, \u201cThe Lord Has Helped,\u201d shares the life of Ezra who served as a priest and teacher, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the LORD for Israel (7:11).\u00a0 A key phrase in his book is \u201cThe Hand Of The Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When I think of the classic movie Pinocchio I remember the very lonely woodcarver, Geppato, makes a wooden boy (a marionette) which magically comes to life. Pinnocchio longs to be detached from his marionette strings and\u00a0 wishes he could be a real, live boy and truly become Geppato&#8217;s son.<\/p>\n<p>Like Pinocchio many want to live lives with no strings attached.\u00a0 We don\u2019t desire anyone to control our lives because we want to be at the controls.\u00a0 However as a Christian God has cut the strings of our previous puppet master Satan from our lives.\u00a0 Pinocchio eventually runs away to the Land of Toys with his friend, Lamp-Wick.\u00a0 After five months of play, Pinocchio wakes up one fine morning and finds a great surprise awaiting him.\u00a0 His ears have become like those of a Donkey.\u00a0 In a little while he changes into a real Donkey and begins to bray Pinocchio, having become a Donkey, is bought by the owner of a Circus, who wants to teach him to do tricks. The Donkey becomes lame and is sold to a man who wants to use his skin for a drumhead.<\/p>\n<p>Like Pinnochio we have the tendency to run into sin, even though God has cut the strings from the enemy from our lives.\u00a0 The Apostle Paul said \u201cWhat shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 2 By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.\u00a0 The thing that makes the difference once having the strings of bondage cut, is to stay in the boundaries that God sets for our lives, by letting him control our lives.\u00a0 The repeated phrase \u201cthe hand of the Lord,\u201d is what kept Ezra walking in righteousness before His Lord and God.\u00a0 Because God\u2019s hand was upon Ezra, Ezra prepared his heart to seek God\u2019s law, and to do it, and to teach it.\u00a0 God was Ezra\u2019s authority and Ezra needed to make sure he pleased God just as you would like to please your employer.\u00a0 So Ezra prepared his heart (mind) by looking at his job desricption in God\u2019s Law to make sure he was fulfilling his priestly role in God\u2019s way.\u00a0 The desripction of Ezra\u2019s tasks and attitude would be layed out in the Law of God.\u00a0 Furthermore Ezra not only studied God\u2019s law he did it.\u00a0 James reminds us,\u00a0 \u201cDo not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.\u201d\u00a0 Satan is not moved by your reading, listening, singing, etc\u2026, of God\u2019s word, as long as you don\u2019t obey it.\u00a0 Obedience to god\u2019s Word is what Satan hates by God loves.\u00a0 Lastly Ezra went another step and taught God\u2019s Word to Israel.\u00a0 I imagine that Ezra and God desired that God\u2019s hand wold be upon all Israel and therefore they needed to be instructed in God\u2019s Law.\u00a0 Ezra was a reader, doer and teacher of God\u2019s Law and with God\u2019s hand upon him was God\u2019s ambassador to the people Israel.<\/p>\n<p>May the Lord help us all to walk with His hand upon our lives, seek His Word, Obey His Word and teach His Word.<br \/>\nUntil the nets are filled\u2026.Blessings Pastor Phil<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201c\u2026for the gracious hand of his God was on him. 10 For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the LORD, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel.

And who gave You this authority?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Jesus had a way of dealing with people (His disciples, Pharisees, those who came to listen to Him preach). His way of responding to their questions was different. For those who wanted to know the truth, He was ready to answer but for those who were asking questions to find away to pin Him down, He would turn around and answer their question with a question. I don&#8217;t know about you but I don&#8217;t like asking a question only to be answered with another question.<\/p>\n<p>The chief priests and the elders knew that Jesus was not doing anything of His own. He must have been sent, the authority He had (has) was not of Himself. Last week I took a team witnessing at a park, around 9pm a cop came over to ask everyone to leave the park. The reason we all obeyed his commands was because he had authority and all these could be reflected by his clothing, badge, the car he was driving. Had he come as an ordinary citizen without anything to show he was a man in authority, I don&#8217;t think any of us would have listened to him. Many listened to Jesus because He was a Man in authority and under authority. Instead of Jesus giving them an answer, he gave them a chance to answer their own question if they really cared to know 24 But Jesus answered and said to them, &#8220;I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things: 25 The baptism of John&#8211;where was it from? From heaven or from men?&#8221;. Remember John had authority when he preached and baptized. No man had given him the authority but God from heaven. With Jesus asking them this question, He already knew their thoughts and this was to expose their evil motives. Vs 25, &#8220;And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &#8220;If we say, &#8220;From heaven,&#8217; He will say to us, &#8220;Why then did you not believe him?&#8217; 26 But if we say, &#8220;From men,&#8217; we fear the multitude, for all count John as a prophet.&#8221; 27So they answered Jesus and said, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221; And He said to them, &#8220;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things&#8221;. To me this means, if by now you do not know by what authority I am doing this, it&#8217;s not worth telling you.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at a man who asked Jesus to exercise His authority , 5 &#8230;, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him, 6 saying, &#8220;Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.&#8221; 7 And Jesus said to him, &#8220;I will come and heal him.&#8221;\u00a0 8 The centurion answered and said, &#8220;Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed. 9 For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, &#8220;Go,&#8217; and he goes; and to another, &#8220;Come,&#8217; and he comes; and to my servant, &#8220;Do this,&#8217; and he does it.&#8221; 10 When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, &#8220;Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel. The centurion had his servants obey him because he had authority so he understood the power of authority, using what you&#8217;ve been given. Hasn&#8217;t Jesus also given us authority over the works of the enemy, so that when the devil comes and asks, by whose authority are we doing this, we can confidently say by the authority given to us by Jesus Christ. Sickness, lack, depression whatever it is can obey and leave because of that authority. If we came on our own, the enemy is ready to laugh at us, when we come in His name everything has no reason for not obeying. Instead of questioning His authority, we should exercise His authority.

I can picture the child that is asked to take out the garbage at a time he doesn\u2019t feel like it.  He gets up tears the garbage out of the can like he\u2019s going to war, rips the door open, slams the garbage in the outside can, blasts the cover on that can, and slams the doors coming back in the house while gritting his teeth, complaining.  Did the boy do what was right (obey), yes, however did he do it with a perfect heart (an honoring attitude), NO!      Similarly Amaziah when about to go to war was instructed by the man of God to decrease the size of army and fire the 1,000 mercenaries from northern Israel that he had just paid and hired.  Amaziah not understanding the ways of God could not initially reconcile in his mind how he could just throw his money away like that, and just let them go.  The man of God instructed him that he is to go with his original 300,000 soldiers, because God was not with the 1,000 hired men.  When you go to war, knowing your enemies verses your allies is crucial, and God has seen into the heart of these mercenaries.  The man of God responded to the \u201cwasted money\u201d issue in Amaziah\u2019s mind saying that God\u2019s help is far more then that, because it is He that has the power to help or hurt Amaziah in the battle.  Amaziah was optimistic and lead his troops as instructed and killed 10,000 men o Seir, while taking another 10,00 prisoners and then killing them as well.    Upon returning to Judah, Amaziah found that the disgruntled mercenaries, that he fired, had ransacked and plundered the towns of Judah killing 3,000 people.  Then the most ironic thing took place.  Amaziah knowing that it was in obeying God that he had been victorious, returns to a pillaged Judah, and instead of seeking the Lord, he set up idols, gods that he had stolen from the men of Seir and worshipped them as his gods and burned incense to them.  That leaves on scratching their hand in wonder does it not.  God\u2019s wrath was ignited and a prophet came and said, \u201cWhy do you consult this people\u2019s gods, which could not save their own people from your hand?\u201d  However instead of this time yielding to the words of the prophet, his real heart came forth.  Amaziah interrupted him saying, \u201cDid I ask for your opinion?  Shut up or get thrown out!\u201d  What a change in attitude.  That prophet took the authority to give the final word saying, \u201c\u201cI know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.\u201d  Amaziah was defeated and taken captive, and everything he had worked for was lost.  Eventually he fled to Lachish where he was tracked down and killed.    Jesus said apart from Me you can do nothing.  Although Amaziah had one victory, he tried to be successful apart from honoring God with a perfect, undivided heart.  He dishonoring, prideful attitude is what brought him to ruin and death.  His downfall ALL hinged on his eventual turning away from God completely.  It didn\u2019t need to turn out that way.

Have you ever wondered whether God could do something in your life or around you? I know many who are still stuck in this place of \u201dCAN HE?\u201d They are scared of praying because they don&#8217;t believe God can. I am in a place where I know HE CAN the only question is WILL HE what HE CAN? This has helped me to change even the way I pray because I don&#8217;t pray to God anymore about whether \u201cHE CAN\u201d that is settled, my question is will He do what He can. I used to get frustrated when I went before God because of those times I would go before Him and not get anything after I prayed. I got scared of going to ask Him anything but when He allowed me to see it differently, I started going to Him because He can whether He was going to do it or not was not question anymore, the question was did, did I trust Him enough to bring it to Him? The moment I come to Him, I know He can and believing Him causes me to know He will. The three Hebrew boys had something going on for them, they believed God could (CAN) deliver them from the fire, to them that was the main thing and they also believed that He would\u00a0 (WILL) deliver them but they said that even if He does not, just believing that He could (CAN) was enough to cause them to stand.

Zechariah prophesied, \u201cThis is what the LORD Almighty says: \u201cYou who now hear these words spoken by the prophets who were there when the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD Almighty, let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.\u00a0 We are the New Testament Temple, wherein God\u2019s Holy Presence (the Holy Spirit) abides.\u00a0 Paul speaks of putting on the armor of God in Eph. 6, to battle spiritually in PRAYER (v. 18)!\u00a0 The Psalmist wrote, \u201cBLESSED be the LORD my strength which teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight (Psa. 144:1).\u201d\u00a0 We need to be taught to have strong hands for war in the spiritual, just as a physical military soldier is taught war tactics, because the fight is \u201c\u2018Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,\u2019 says the LORD Almighty.\u201d\u00a0 Let\u2019s stop using our arguing mouths or the latest Christian book out there, but by the Living Book (His Word), and through His directive prayer, and in the Power of the Holy Spirit we engage prayer.\u00a0 Jude wrote, \u201cBut you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit.\u201d\u00a0 The Holy Spirit knows how to empower us with strong hands in prayer when we let go of control.\u00a0 Just think how much we always want a handle on things, because we yearn for control of everything, even that which is outside of our control.\u00a0 Perhaps this is why so many waste time in the area of worry that Evans shared on yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>In this area, it\u2019s not mom that knows best, but the Holy Spirit that knows best.\u00a0 \u201cIn the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God\u2019s will.\u201d\u00a0 God\u2019s desire is for us all to have strong hands in prayer, and allow the Holy Spirit to help us in prayer, because He knows the mind and will of God better then we do.\u00a0 When we have strong hands in prayer God\u2019s promise is that our work (because prayer is hard work, see Dan 10:20) will be rewarded by God.\u00a0 Therefore if we are not praying, we are living PRAYLESS lives, can we even expect such an insult to God to be rewarded, I say not!\u00a0 We need to actively, diligently, and fervently pray now.\u00a0 We need to be too busy NOT too pray, for when we work, we work, but when we pray God work!<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026.Blessings, Pastor Phil <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201cBe strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak for your work will be rewarded.\u201d 2 Chronicles 15:7 Israel\u2019s had been for a long season without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.\u00a0 And at this time Israel only sought God when trouble arose, and He was found [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-139","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-2f","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/139","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=139"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/139\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=139"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=139"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=139"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":326,"date":"2005-06-02T03:34:17","date_gmt":"2005-06-02T03:34:17","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2005\/06\/02\/157-that-thing-you-need\/"},"modified":"2005-06-02T03:34:17","modified_gmt":"2005-06-02T03:34:17","slug":"157-that-thing-you-need","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2005\/06\/02\/157-that-thing-you-need\/","title":{"rendered":"#157 that thing you&nbsp;need&#8230;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Our wants and needs are peculiar &#8230;

The neat thing about checking in your luggage, you don&#8217;t worry much, yes you think about it but you don&#8217;t worry about it because you know it will arrive. Yes a few times you hear of luggage misplaced but hard to hear a luggage got lost.<\/p>\n<p>When the Lord told Abram to move to a land He would show him, I bet Abram had a lot of things in his mind that qualified as baggage such as fear, anxiety, doubts, and what ifs. We do the same many times, worry about how our lives will turn out, our children, where they go, who they hang out with, worrying about who they will marry. On the other hand, you are worried about your marriage or whoever you will marry, worried if you are making the right decisions, worried about your health etc. Some even worry about worry itself and to be honest, worry is a killer. Abram believed God, checked in all the baggage he had and traveled light. Vs 5, Then Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother&#8217;s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they departed to go to the land of Canaan. So they came to the land of Canaan&#8221;. We too have an opportunity in this life to travel light knowing God will take care of us. You got to have faith that the Lord is able to carry your baggage while you sleep peacefully in the plane. Well, you might try doing what one fellow did. He worried so much that he decided to hire someone to do his worrying for him. He found a man who agreed to be his hired worrier for a salary of $200,000 per year. After the man accepted the job, his first question to his boss was, &#8220;Where are you going to get the $200,000 per year to pay me?&#8221; To which the boss replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s your worry.&#8221; God will not charge you for taking your worries, He wants you traveling light because He cares for you and wants to take care of you. I remember this hymn, Be not dismayed whate&#8217;er betide, God will take care of you; beneath his wings of love abide, God will take care of you. Chorus God will take care of you, through every day, o&#8217;er all the way; he will take care of you, God will take care of you. Trust the Lord, check in all your baggage through prayer and travel light.

the Lord has sent me to Bethel.\u201d\u00a0 However Elisha replied, \u201cAs surely as the LORD lives and as you live I will NOT leaven you.\u201d\u00a0 So together they went to Bethel.\u00a0 This scenario played out again when Elijah was called to Jericho.\u00a0 And again he told Elisha to stay and again Elisha refused to stay saying, \u201cAs surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.\u201d\u00a0 And if that wasn\u2019t enough it happened a third time when God called Elijah to Jordan.\u00a0 And again Elisha replied, \u201cAs surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.\u201d\u00a0 However the time would come when suddenly, as the two walked and talked together, a fiery chariot swooped between them and took Elijah in wind up into heaven (v.11). It was over in an instant. Elisha could but cry out in amazed tribute to his departed master-(v.12). Elijah was gone, although Elisha promised he would never leave his master, his master left him, and where he went Elisha could not go at this time, a separation was inevitable.<\/p>\n<p>Elisha would now take up Elijah\u2019s mantle (his cloak) which represented Elisha\u2019s transition to chief Prophetic Service in his masters\u2019 absence.\u00a0 Elisha asked (v.14) \u201cWhere is the Lord God of Elijah?\u201d\u00a0 Elisha did not have Elijah with him, but he still needed God to be with him Elisha exercised the requested double portion (v.9) of Elijah\u2019s spirit upon Elisha\u2019s life, as\u00a0 Elisha took up the mantle and did his first miracle of parting the waters (v.14) just as his master had done (v.8).\u00a0 Elisha needed God to be with him always not Elijah.\u00a0 God would say to Joshua \u201cAs I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.\u201d\u00a0 The apostle Paul wrote, \u201cAnd if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you.\u201d\u00a0 And Christ I have all the power of heaven and earth therefore go and make disciples of all nations and surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\u00a0 We need to know some will leave us, but the spirit of God in the life of the Christian never will as he stays in the presence of the Master.\u00a0 Thank Him for those that have taught you, and perhaps have left you with valuable training, but thank the Lord for His promise to never leave or forsake you as you do His work, and follow His blueprints.

At the very moment they present themselves, you weigh the possibilities of being the person to rise to the occasion while looking at who you are. I watched a comedy where this young man was afraid of swimming, he did not feel he could do it because he was just too terrified. On one particular day, he saw this girl fall in the pool drowning, he swallowed his fears and jumped into the pool to rescue the girl not knowing that he had fears before. But for a moment of time, he stepped into the occasion and did what he was afraid to do so as to rescue someone else.<\/p>\n<p>Esther found herself in a position of diving into the deep end to rescue the Jews who were about to be destroyed by Haman. She is the queen as we know, feeling safe but her people were not safe. Though Mordecai knew her niece was the queen and he could get whatever he might have wanted, his desire was to see all the Jews free. Of course we can now see that his fighting for Esther to be the queen was not just for Esther alone but for the Jews. But for a moment she\u00a0 has an opportunity to rise to the occasion to rescue the Jews even if it means perishing. Esther is being reminded that if she does not do it, there will still be deliverance for the Jews some how yet who knows whether she has come to the kingdom for such a time as this. Have you ever asked yourself why you are where you are for such a time as this? I don&#8217;t believe it was by coincident. Have you asked yourself why what you&#8217;ve been afraid to face present themselves and you either have to let them drown or jump to rescue because you have swallowed your fears? That job, ministry or calling you were afraid to step into because you were afraid you could not do it, for such a time as this, you&#8217;ve been presented with an opportunity. I believe that there are certain things you will never fully know you can do till you swallow your fears and jump to the deep end only to find you can swim.<\/p>\n<p>Upon being challenged by Mordecai, she sees that at the moment the fate of the Jews will based on the decisions she makes. Note something here, she is not known as a Jew to the king yet, neither is anyone allowed to present themselves before the king without being called. Appearing before this king without being summoned called for death and here is her response to Mordecai &#8220;16&#8221;Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me; \u2026 My maids and I will fast likewise. And so I will go to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish!&#8221; A young queen ready to lay her new career on the line. Ready to face her fears for the sake of her people. Ready to jump to the deep end. The moment she was ready to let go, God granted her favor with the king. When we are ready to loose it at a given moment that is when we find it. Great decision by Esther, great rescue for the Jews. You are where you are for such a time as this, ask the Lord to show you what you could do at a given moment to make a difference, swallow your fears and jump to the deep end.<br \/>\nBlessings Ev<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Esther 4:14, &#8220;&#8230; Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?&#8221; We know of opportunities that present themselves when least expected.

to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before him forever.\u201d<br \/>\n1Chronicles 15:2<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve heard it said, when all else fails read the instructions.\u00a0 God has given us His divine instructions within the Scriptures.\u00a0 However, many act independently of God\u2019s design and are upset when it doesn\u2019t return with God\u2019s blessing.\u00a0 If we want His blessing, we must follow His blueprints.\u00a0 Adam was told not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because he would die (God\u2019s blueprints).\u00a0 Adam and Eve would later dine on the forbidden fruit.\u00a0 In Num. 20:8, God told Moses speak to the rock (God\u2019s blueprints), but in Moses\u2019 anger he struck the rock (Moses blueprints).\u00a0 Let me now draw your attention to the story surrounding the Scripture above, and look at the failure of following God\u2019s blueprints.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The Ark of the Covenant was the golden chest housing the Two Stone Tablets of the Law &#8211; Ten Commandments, Aaron&#8217;s rod that budded, and the golden pot of &#8216;hidden&#8217; manna.\u00a0 The Scriptures say in 2 Sam. 6, and 1 Chron. 13 that \u201cThey moved the Ark of God from Abinadab\u2019s house on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding it.\u00a0 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled.\u00a0 The LORD&#8217;S anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark,\u00a0\u00a0 So he died there before God, because, \u201cbecause of his irreverent act.\u201d Since Uzzah was the one God struck, he must be the one that did not follow God\u2019s blueprints and paid dearly for it.\u00a0 RC Sproul writes that Uzzah\u2019s reaction was instinctive.\u00a0 He did what any pious Jew would do to keep the ark from falling into the mud, trying to stop the holy object from getting muddied.\u00a0 It was not a premeditated act of defiance against God, but a reflex action.\u00a0 Looking from hindsight his attempt seemed heroic.\u00a0 God didn\u2019t speak blessing upon him from heaven, but rather slaughtered him on the spot.\u00a0 Is that not a bit harsh?\u00a0 The Levites were the only ones consecrated to carry the Ark by the blueprints.\u00a0 Whenever the Ark was to be transported the Levites had to insert the poles into the rings, not even touching the Ark directly themselves.\u00a0 No provision was made by God for those hurrying the procedure by using an oxcart.\u00a0 His blueprints were known!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Many are offended by God\u2019s slaughtering of Uzzah, because we so easily follow our own blueprints, and are not struck down for it.\u00a0 God gave divine justice to Uzzah, as he acted presumptuously thinking his hand was less polluted then the mud.\u00a0 Sin is cosmic treason against a perfectly pure Sovereign.\u00a0 David was angry because the LORD&#8217;S wrath had broken out against Uzzah, but David quickly went back to God\u2019s blueprints to transport the Ark proclaiming, \u201cNo one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the LORD chose them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before him forever.\u201d\u00a0 Let\u2019s learn from their sin, and follow the blueprints first off (i.e. marriage\u00e0sexual intimacy\u00e0children).\u00a0 Solomon said it like this, \u201cFear God and keep his commandments (blueprints).\u00a0 God gives commandments not suggestions.\u00a0 Whose blueprints are you

For A Moment, Part&nbsp;1"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">Good morning,<\/p>\n<p><strong>Esther 4:1-17, 9 <u>The girl pleased him and won his favor<\/u>.&#8221;(NIV).<\/p>\n<p><\/strong>I am a firm believer of kingdom principles. If you careful look at how good things happen on a day to day basis, you can trace some attributes back to God&#8217;s kingdom principles applied knowingly or unknowingly. For today I would like to take a principal from the book of Esther and apply it to our day to day life. I had a different direction to go with the book but I am prompted to approach it from another angle.<\/p>\n<p>If you look at an job ad or if someone tells you of an opening, there are things you look at such as, the job, the requirements, the benefits etc, then you decide whether you are going for the job or not. We are told in the book of Esther that there was a job opening for the next queen. If you&#8217;ve read the book of Esther, you will find that the queen&#8217;s position was vacant because queen Vashti disobeyed the king and was dropped from her position. The ad for the position was to find a beautiful young virgin, and the one who pleased the king would be the next queen. We see this in the first 4 verses and then the scripture switches to concentrate on someone by the name of Mordecai who happens to be a Jew carried away captive from Jerusalem. He has his niece Esther whose parents died awhile ago and Mordecai took her as his daughter. <strong>Vs 5. &#8220;&#8230;The young woman (Esther) was lovely and beautiful&#8221;<\/strong>. Mordecai hears about the ad and feels her niece is qualified for the job. Yes she is a slave girl, does not even deserve to be recognized yet that is not a stop to what she can be. The kingdom principle teaches us that God has not put limitations in our lives, we are the ones who put limitations in what we can be or do. It&#8217;s our attitude that leads us to where we can go. The bible says, &#8220;<strong>Proverbs 23:7, &#8220;For as he thinks in his heart, so is he\u2026&#8221;. <\/strong>How many leave defeated lives though qualified because they have chosen to limit themselves. Many will stand before God one day and be showed what they could have been but because they never believed in themselves through God, they missed a lot.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one thing to have the qualifications, it&#8217;s another thing to be the man or woman right for the job. <strong>Vs 8. &#8220;When the king&#8217;s order and edict had been proclaimed, many girls were brought to the citadel of Susa &#8230;. Esther also was taken \u2026.. 9 <u>The girl pleased him and won his favor<\/u>.&#8221;(NIV). <\/strong>You know what fascinates me about this verse, many were called who had qualifications, only one was chosen. The beautiful slave girl. What made her different, she was able to sell herself. <strong><u>In job interviews, your qualifications allow you to be called for an interview, you now have to prove to the interviewer why you are the man or the woman for the job<\/u><\/strong>. You have to sell yourself. David before facing Goliath had to prove to Saul why he was the man for the job. At least for him he did not have the qualifications but still convinced the king by talking about his past successes. Remember the book of Esther has no name &#8220;God&#8221; in it but you can see the kingdom principles. You can go to an interview and not mention the name of God but apply the kingdom principles for you know who is backing you up in that interview. So many beautiful girls but one pleased the king and WON his favor. It does not say &#8220;she found favor but WON. This to means, she did something more than what the other girls did, she did sell herself through character, humility, hard work, charming, lovely. A slave girl encouraged to make one move and that changes her life completely, it was but for a moment for something this big to happen. To continue\u2026 Have you limited yourself? Have you ever thought about selling yourself? Blessings Ev<\/p>\n<p>FYI,<\/p>\n<p>We did a 5 part series on the book of Esther a few years ago.

say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;\u201d\u00a0 (Matt 5:43-44)\u00a0\u00a0 See Full passage (Matt 5:43-48)<\/p>\n<p>I believe that each one of us has people in our lives that are enemies.\u00a0 Who are the people in your life that seek your demise, hate when you move forward in life, try to get on your last nerve, and are vindictive and outright cruel to you?\u00a0 I gather that some name(s) just surfaced in your mind rather quickly.\u00a0 These enemies play a vital role in your life of you becoming more like Christ.\u00a0 God sent us an example (John 13:15) in His Son, that we should be conformed to His image (Rom 8:29) and walk as Jesus walked (1 John 2:6).\u00a0 What does any of this have to do with your enemies helping you to become more like Christ?<\/p>\n<p>Jesus pointed out that we are to love, bless, do good to, and pray for our enemies.\u00a0 \u201cIf we want to make a difference we must be different.\u201d\u00a0 Jesus continues by saying, \u201cFor if you love them which love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same? And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more than others? do not even the publicans so?\u201d\u00a0 The essence of what Jesus is saying is that if you follow Me (Jesus) and you treat your enemies the same way the world does how can you rightly say you are a Christian?<\/p>\n<p>Acts 6-7 tells the account of Stephen.\u00a0 He rehearsed the history of Israel to his Hellenistic compatriots that were disputing with him (6:9) showing themselves to be his enemies.\u00a0 Stephen \u201cpushed the envelope\u201d hard when he said to them, \u201cWas there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him-you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\u201d\u00a0 The truth hurt!\u00a0 \u201cUpon hearing these things, were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.\u201d\u00a0 And as these men ran upon Stephen to stone him, Stephen looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw Jesus standing NOT sitting on the right hand of God.\u00a0 As he is about to breathe his last breath he says, \u201cLord Jesus, receive my spirit\u201d\u2026and cried with a loud voice, \u201cLord, lay not this sin to their charge.\u201d\u00a0 Wow, Stephen has become so much like Christ in dealing with his enemies that his last dying words paralleled and were almost identical with Christ\u2019s and certainly in the same Spirit of our LORD (Luke 23:34).\u00a0 Read the gospels and examine how Jesus responded to his enemy Judas, to the point of allowing Judas to betray him with a kiss.\u00a0 Wow!\u00a0 Even as Christ was being verbally and physically abused He still died for sinners.<\/p>\n<p>Your response to your enemies speaks volumes of how Christ-like you are?\u00a0 How do you treat the Judas\u2019 in your life?\u00a0 Is it like our Master, or like our previous father, the devil?\u00a0 If you don\u2019t treat your enemies any different then the world does, then you are acting like your enemies.\u00a0 Ouch!\u00a0 When dealing with your enemies, show them Christ\u2019s love, share the gospel with them.\u00a0 When they curse you, bless them.\u00a0 When they show you hatred, purposefully be and do good unto them.\u00a0 At the time they persecute you and despitefully use you, pray for them.\u00a0 Proverbs says \u201cIf your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you.\u00a0 This is \u201cgodly revenge!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Oh Lord, may we bless, pray for and show kindness and love to those who are our enemies and those who are yours, in response to their treatment toward us .\u00a0 Blessings Pastor Phi<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201cYou have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbour, and hate your enemy \u201cBut I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;\u201d\u00a0 (Matt 5:43-44)\u00a0\u00a0 See Full passage [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-385","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-6d","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/385","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=385"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/385\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=385"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=385"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=385"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":126,"date":"2005-05-24T08:21:47","date_gmt":"2005-05-24T08:21:47","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2005\/05\/24\/attitude-check-2\/"},"modified":"2005-05-24T08:21:47","modified_gmt":"2005-05-24T08:21:47","slug":"attitude-check-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2005\/05\/24\/attitude-check-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Attitude Check"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Colossians 3:23, &#8220;And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Understanding the order of things should drive how we handle things.

He chose to do it for John 12:24, says &#8220;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone but if it dies, it will be able to bare much fruit&#8221;, His humility was to eventually help bare much fruit and though He understood that many would leave Him by Himself, He says the grain of wheat has to die and abide alone. We as believers at one point in our lives we&#8217;ll encounter with the same truth falling in the ground and abiding alone. It&#8217;s easy to stand and have people around you to support you but fall and see people&#8217;s reactions, some will stop believing in you, hanging out with you and start talking about your failure and the list goes on. They will be too quick to pass a judgment that you failed and it&#8217;s over, they failed to stick around for long to know that your going down did not mean it was over, your going down was a preparation for your coming up. Jesus had to go down first that in due season He could go up yet He did not fail though it seamed like according to everyone including the devil. Ephesians 4:8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. 9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth (which is hell)? 10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things.) People mostly concentrate on the part of going down, falling, dying and that is okay but wait till you see me rise again, resurrect for that will be the greatest accomplishment. In as much as we do not want to fall and yet we will fall, that is not a sign of failure,\u00a0 the sign of failure is when you have fallen and you are doing nothing about your failure. It&#8217;s when you begin to look at your failure as a bridge to allow God to resurrect you that causes you to pump life inside you and know that you will be broken, fail, and be alone but if you know your third day is coming, you will await for the resurrection for if Jesus died and rose, and everything that He did was to get you and I ready for the same things, we can go through it if it&#8217;s going to get us to the next level. God raised Jesus from the dead, we too shall be raised from any kind of death we find ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>Revelation 1:18, &#8221; I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death&#8221;. Don&#8217;t you love the way Jesus talks, He says I am He that lives and just a reminder, I was dead at one point and if that is not enough, I am not alive temporarily but forever more. He talks more about His life more than His death and He speaks of victory. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;you saw me die, that is good but did you see me rise? If you saw me die but never saw me rise, then you will be stuck in my death but when you see me rise then you will know our God gives second chances. As long as the past failures, brokenness and death are alive, the future is dead but the moment the past failure, death and brokenness and left in the grave, your future becomes vibrant for it&#8217;s not about past tense (used to) but present tense (now I am).<\/p>\n<p>Many saw Jesus die and to some that marked the end but when He came back to life, no one was there to witness yet He said that He would rise again on the third day. Many will see you go down and that is where they will dismiss you, but they will miss the opportunity of seeing you rise again. I pray that you will see yourself rising again on your third day for you are what you confess. In Proverbs it says as a man thinks in his heart, so is he&#8221;. I know you saw me go down, did you stick around to see me rise?<br \/>\nBlessings Evans<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Revelation 1:18, &#8221; I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death&#8221;.

Some have been given some very difficult names to pronounce. When you hear about some sickness, you wonder what part of the body they affect and what damage they can do to someone&#8217;s health. Each of these sicknesses are not given the same kind of treatments as each of them are different but this morning I introduce the One who has One medicine to cure all sicknesses, Jesus sent forth His Word. Jesus did not have fancy, difficult names for sickness, he summed them up and called them the spirits of infirmities. There are sick Christians who believe they are sick because God is punishing them for something they did, God is not the author of sickness, He is the author of healing. The bible says, &#8220;He sent forth his word and healed ALL our diseases because He is the God who heals us&#8221; (paraphrased). The Almighty God still heals and heals all sicknesses, let no one talk you out of that.<\/p>\n<p>The man who had been sick for 38 years waited every year for his healing. One day, when he least expected someone to visit him, Jesus shows up and asks him a simple question, &#8220;do you want to be made well?&#8221;. Why do we make things complicated when Jesus makes them simple? He&#8217;s question was simple but the man got into what was not done and should have been done. If you have tried everything and have failed, it can be hard to believe God in your situation. This man&#8217;s experience had hardened his heart to believe there was nothing different that could happen in his situation. That is why he was complicating things. With Jesus it&#8217;s not about what should have been done (past), it&#8217;s about now (His word sent forth). He can heal you now. He was in his situation 38 years and it took Jesus a second to heal him by sending His NOW word for the man to pick up his bed and walk. That is why I thank God because He is a God of now, He says in His word Joel 2:25 So I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, The crawling locust, The consuming locust, And the chewing locust&#8221;. He is willing to restore, it&#8217;s already in His agenda. The healing did not begin when He showed up, it began the moment He was willing to restore you when He went on the cross, Mathew 8:17, &#8220;He Himself took our infirmities And bore our sicknesses.&#8221; . Sickness eats people&#8217;s health, He says He wants to restore your health what sickness has eaten (your health, strength, joy, peace, confidence, faith etc). Sicknesses are like the swarming, crawling, consuming and chewing locust, they devour the health not anymore because it&#8217;s Jesus&#8217; word against the devours. When He asked the man, &#8220;do you want to be made well?&#8221;, the question was not necessarily to find out if the man needed healing, the question was to see if the man was ready for healing NOW. It&#8217;s about adjusting your faith to NOW as the restoration is now.

We are trusting God everyday to give us a fresh manna to feed us all. Let&#8217;s share today&#8217;s word<\/p>\n<p>One winter evening, I had just driven to school through the heavy snow. Reaching school, I was informed my classes were canceled. Driving back from school going down the hill, my car decided to have a mind of it&#8217;s own. I lost control of the car, I tried breaks, emergency breaks, tried to steer back on the road but nothing was happening. I saw the car heading down the hill heading towards the trees that were down in the ditch. At that point, no other name I could remember to call on but the name of Jesus. Despite all the trees that were waiting for me, I did not hit any of them, the car went right between. Calling upon that name is what saved me.<\/p>\n<p>There is something about that name. It bothers me when people use the name of the Lord loosely especially as a curse word. That name has power, it&#8217;s enough to get you out of a jam. You know of some powerful names out here but you can&#8217;t call on them when you are in trouble, they may not know you or have power to deliver and the most, they are limited to time and space, the Lord is different because He is ever present. The bible says, &#8220;the name of the Lord is a strong tower&#8221;, why a tower and not any other thing? Because a tower is a tall structure with the capability of standing alone. At the airports, towers are the control centers, all the communications about the landing and taking offs has to go through the towers, all signals through it, all routings are done through it. Incase of an emergency, the tower is notified. Without the tower, things would be in chaos. We thank the Lord because as a tower, everything goes through Him and we feel safe knowing we have called upon His name. From our devotion team, a lady emailed me to testify of how God saved her and her colleagues from a car accident over the weekend. The Lord was their strong tower that is why they were safe.<\/p>\n<p>The Lord offers His name as a tower to call on when you and I are in trouble Psalm 50:15, &#8220;Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me&#8221;, Psalm 91:15, &#8220;He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him&#8221;, Psalm 18:3, &#8220;3I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised;\u00a0 So shall I be saved from my enemies&#8221;.

Reaching school, I was informed my classes were canceled. Driving back from school going down the hill, my car decided to have a mind of it&#8217;s own. I lost control of the car, I tried breaks, emergency breaks, tried to steer back on the road but nothing was happening. I saw the car heading down the hill heading towards the trees that were down in the ditch. At that point, no other name I could remember to call on but the name of Jesus. Despite all the trees that were waiting for me, I did not hit any of them, the car went right between. Calling upon that name is what saved me.<\/p>\n<p>There is something about that name. It bothers me when people use the name of the Lord loosely especially as a curse word. That name has power, it&#8217;s enough to get you out of a jam. You know of some powerful names out here but you can&#8217;t call on them when you are in trouble, they may not know you or have power to deliver and the most, they are limited to time and space, the Lord is different because He is ever present. The bible says, &#8220;the name of the Lord is a strong tower&#8221;, why a tower and not any other thing? Because a tower is a tall structure with the capability of standing alone. At the airports, towers are the control centers, all the communications about the landing and taking offs has to go through the towers, all signals through it, all routings are done through it. Incase of an emergency, the tower is notified. Without the tower, things would be in chaos. We thank the Lord because as a tower, everything goes through Him and we feel safe knowing we have called upon His name. From our devotion team, a lady emailed me to testify of how God saved her and her colleagues from a car accident over the weekend. The Lord was their strong tower that is why they were safe.<\/p>\n<p>The Lord offers His name as a tower to call on when you and I are in trouble Psalm 50:15, &#8220;Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me&#8221;, Psalm 91:15, &#8220;He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him&#8221;, Psalm 18:3, &#8220;3I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised;\u00a0 So shall I be saved from my enemies&#8221;. Choose ye this day whose name you will call on when you are in trouble.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Proverbs 18:10, &#8220;The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous run to it and are safe&#8221; Pastor Phil has invited me to teach on prayers at their church this Saturday, please do keep me in prayers.

But my eye spared you&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>From experience, I think the most difficult people to forgive are the people you looked up to and trusted. If you know someone&#8217;s character, being told about what they have done might lead you to say, &#8220;That&#8217;s not like them&#8221;. It&#8217;s easier to deal with the ones you already know their nature than the ones who do things out of their character. We put such a high standard for the people we look up to and when they don&#8217;t live up to our expectations, we get hurt.<\/p>\n<p>David looked up to Saul as a role model, a man chosen and anointed by God. He had a godly son Jonathan who was David&#8217;s best friend. Even though it was known that the son of a king would be groomed to be the next king, Jonathan knew David would be the next king instead of him and he was still cool with it. Saul referred to David as a son, who even played for him and entertained him. Saul knowing that David would be the next king troubled him that he wanted David dead. So for many years David was on the run fleeing from Saul. At times Saul would repent, but right after that, he would plan again to kill him. What would you do when someone you valued, looked up to, respected, admired was out to assassinate every blessing in your life, lied on you, did mean things, disappointed you? The normal thought would be, &#8220;how about I give them a dose of their own medicine&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>David who was being pursued by Saul on this particular time in 1Samuel 23&amp;24, Saul brought over 3,000 men to pursue David who had about 600 men. When Saul and his men were exhausted from looking for David, they sat down to rest and they all fell a sleep. David and his men found them a sleep and his men encouraged him to kill his adversary. Remember God delivered Saul into David&#8217;s hands. What would you do? The power is in your hands, you feel it&#8217;s right to retaliate?. David might have also thought that revenge was justified but he chose not to. Later after he spared Saul and cut a piece of his robe, he says 1Samuel 24:1-22, vs. 10 Look, this day your eyes have seen that the LORD delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and someone urged me to kill you. But my eye spared you&#8221;. I believe God delivers people who have hurt and disappointed us into our hands and we have a choice to either revenge or give up the right to punish them. Had David killed Saul, I believe he would have messed up his future as the next king. Instead, he chose to forgive him by sparing his life and leaving him up to God. Un forgiveness tends to take power over the one who is holding onto it and God sets us up to situations where the power is in our hands and the choice is ours. Joseph had the power in his hands when God delivered his brothers into his hands and the choice was his. God delivered Jacob into Esau&#8217;s hands when He told him to go back, and Esau had the power in his hands to choose and he chose forgiveness. God sent His son into the world full of people who had failed God, who even the devil felt they did not deserve forgiveness. Jesus had the power to destroy all that failed Him, but He also had power to forgive. In short, the power to forgive or not to forgive is in our hands, God may deliver people who have hurt us deeply into our hands and how we handle them has everything to do with where we are going, the question is, can we give up our rights by forgiving and sparing them?. David didn&#8217;t have to punish Saul, God did; he didn&#8217;t have to kill to be the next king, God knew of the time. Romans 12:19, &#8220;Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, &#8220;Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings Ev<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Samuel 24:1-22, vs. 10 Look, this day your eyes have seen that the LORD delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and someone urged me to kill you.

Secondly, to carry your cross daily is to put down those things which crowd out the cross.\u00a0 John said, \u201cHe must increase, and I must decrease.\u201d\u00a0 We must lay down our lives, and embrace our cross.\u00a0 \u201cA condemned criminal was forced to carry one bar of his cross to the place of execution.

When an army is about to go to war the leader, in this case the king, must sit down and decide if he has the leadership to lead his men onto victory or defeat.\u00a0 There is a lot at stake in a war such as losing lives, losing or gaining land, and of course power.\u00a0 With war it has been said, \u201cto the victor goes the spoils,\u201d to what then is the consequence for the loser?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Jesus said that when one goes off to war, he must come to a resolve if he chooses to indulge in the war that he will fight to the finish.\u00a0 Why is one going to fight to the finish?\u00a0 Real warriors fight to win, and will not fight \u201cnot to loose.\u201d\u00a0 To the determined in a war, there is no second place, only defeat.\u00a0 Can a king with ten thousand soldier\u2019s defeat a king with twenty thousand is the question to contemplate? If one were to answer this question based on quantity of soldiers the answer would lean very much toward a NO!\u00a0 However, if one were to answer this question based on quality of them the answer may go either way depending upon the quality of the opposing armies.<\/p>\n<p>Why has Jesus likened a war scenario to being his disciple?\u00a0 Think of war, there are great victories, and also casualties.\u00a0 As a Christian the commitment that you make to your commander (Christ) and to the body of Christ (your fellow soldiers) should not be a flippant decision.\u00a0 The decision to follow Christ is a hard reality, because Jesus wants followers not \u201cfans,\u201d he is calling for disciples, those who would ultimately die for Him if they needed to.\u00a0 Does this describe you, or are you just along for \u201cthe ride?\u201d\u00a0 Living for Jesus is not a Sunday to Sunday thing, but a daily commitment, and one must wear the armor of God to fight in the spiritual war that Christians are engaged in (Eph. 6)<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, Jesus speaks of giving up everything to be His disciple.\u00a0 This is not necessarily saying that one need part with all earthly possessions and live a life of poverty.\u00a0 Rather a disciple is one that has yielded up all of his right because they have been bought with a price (1 Cor. 6:20) and therefore all possessions have changed ownership and now belong to the Lord.\u00a0 Disciples are merely caretakers, or stewards of the possessions.\u00a0 Disciples live a life wit the mentality of abandonment of things and their lives upon their trust in Christ.\u00a0 The rich young ruler (Mk. 10, Lk. 18), although desiring eternal life, refused to part with those things, the riches, that Christ called him to part with.\u00a0 He would not submit to Christ as Lord, and choose the treasures of this world rather then heavenly treasure, and therefore choose to be a disciple of the world rather then a disciple of Christ. There is a price to serve God, and Christ paid by His blood to purchase you from the enemy.<\/p>\n<p>Application:\u00a0 Where do you stand today?\u00a0 Do you feel the battles, in the midst of the war?\u00a0 Have you truly contemplated your decision to follow Him in abandonment?\u00a0 Are you living as a disciple of Christ or of one of this world?\u00a0 Are you willing to pay the price to serve Him?<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<br \/>\nPastor Phil<br \/>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201cOr suppose a king is about to go to war against another king.

I came from a Christian home, my parents started training me on Christian values at a very young age. At the age of four my dad would bring me to missions with him even sing together. One of the greatest things my parents did to pave ways in this life was pray was to pray their siblings. Not only did they pray for the current things at that age, they prayed for our future lives (our ministries, our mates, our children, our jobs etc). This shows me that it&#8217;s never too early to pray for the future of your kids.<\/p>\n<p>In my teenage years, I hated going to church, did not want anything to do with God, I went to church for the sake of going to church. Now that I think about my early teenage years I wonder how the above scripture applies. I was trained in the way I should go but what happened?, I backed away from it. How would you apply the last part &#8220;And when he is old he will not depart from it&#8221;? How many children have been brought up in Christian homes and later became the worse kids, some got into drugs, rebellious, ran away from home you name it. The only way I can understand this scripture is this, whatever you teach the child when he\/she is growing up will not depart from him\/her. The values I was taught, the prayers invested, the encouragement, the love and care would not depart from me even though I went my way. The prodigal son could run away from home, but he could never run away from what he was taught as a child. At one point in my life I just got tired of living outside Christ and God changed me inside out. During the time I was away from the Lord, my mom and dad kept on praying for me, loving me, caring for me until I was restored and forever I am grateful to God for them.<\/p>\n<p>From my experience, I think there are three important things that can help raise children, one and the most important is prayer, being able to lift them up before God and let God give you guidance, wisdom, and care for your children. Setting a strong foundation in Christ and paving a way for their future lives as young kids, teenagers, young adults, adults. Letting God help you raise up your kids. Hannah prayed for her son Samuel and then gave him to God to help her raise him. The other important thing is instructing them about the things of life, teaching them right and wrong, educating them. This enables them to make right judgments and choices in their lives as you now commend them to God. And the other which is as equally important is living an example. I would say that I have learnt more from my parents by observing how they live their life as Christians, as husband and wife, as parents, as workers and as citizens more than any teaching they could give me. Their life style has set up a standard to desire what they have. This has even helped me pick out my companion, taught me hard work, taught me that prayer changes things, taught me patience, taught me how to survive hardships. Their life style has taught me what hundreds of books would never teach. Children learn a lot by observing, so parents ought to live a life they would want their kids to live. Have a marriage based on L.O.V.E (L for Listening, O for openness, V for Value and E for Everlasting) if you want your children to have the same one day (producing after your kind). Do good, be hard workers, they will pick on that and live your life pleasing to the Lord. I go back to see where I have come from, see the things that I learnt, they are fresh in my mind and I am by the help of God putting them into practice, now I know what I was taught could never depart from me. My prayer is to produce after their kind in my family one day.<br \/>\nBlessings<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Proverbs 22:6, &#8220;Train up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not depart from it&#8221; There are some of those scriptures that leave you scratching your head, to me the above is one of them.

God amazes me in ways I would never imagine or think. Every time He messes my theology and I come to a place of surrender again. He is always doing something in our lives so that our confidence is not in ourselves or our ability but on Him alone.<\/p>\n<p>Why the does God love to raise the SECOND and not the first? What&#8217;s the second anyway?, Well God bypassed Cain the first born and blessed Abel the second. We see this again with Esau and Jacob, God blessed Jacob the second. With Manasseh and Ephraim, the blessing bypassed Manasseh and landed on Ephraim the second. Perez and Zerah had the same struggle at the time of delivery. Zerah was suppose to come out first and Perez overtook him. And the best of all these, Adam and Jesus. Adam was the son of God, Jesus (the second Adam) was (is) the ONLY begotten Son of God. Why is this so important? Because God always raises the unexpected. He always raises the least likely. This is not to show that God never blesses or raises the first born, this is to tell us that God has no favorites. Remember the first born always received the blessing and God is showing us that it&#8217;s not always going to be the one everyone is expecting to be blessed and used. You might have looked at someone you thought could be of more use in the ministry than you, don&#8217;t be surprised when He raises you in levels you could never imagine or think. You thought of yourself second, watch out.<\/p>\n<p>If you and I are going to be raised and used by God, we are going to bypass everything that we thought He could use in our lives and look at things we placed second (secondary). I am not dismissing the fact that He can take the gift He has placed in you and use it, I&#8217;m saying He can take that which you overlooked, the simple and silly to you. That which to you had no significance, He can make something great out of it. It&#8217;s not by ability that God raises people, it is by availability that he raises people. If you were waiting till you are able to be used, then you&#8217;ve missed the whole purpose of Him raising the second. Look at how Hebrews 10:9 begins, &#8220;Then said he, lo I come to do thy will, O God&#8221;. This does not suggest ability but availability (coming).\u00a0 &#8220;He taketh away the first, that He may establish the SECOND&#8221;, God is establishing which is to say He is bringing about the overlooked as He has something for the second. The second has a way of making us humble, reminding us that it&#8217;s about Him and not us. This is where our faith is elevated when you think of how God could take nothing and make something out of it. What have you put aside as second? Are you waiting till you are able to say Lord I have come to do thy will? Romans 8:30, &#8220;30 Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified. Rise up, be available to be used of Him, that is what He requires.<br \/>\nBlessings Ev<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Hebrews 10:9, &#8220;Then said he, lo I come to do thy will, O\u00a0 God, He taketh away the first, that He may establish the SECOND.&#8221; The above has been the theme verse for my life for many years, it changed my life completely.

He was playing with them in a way that suggested they would not live long. As he continued to play with them, an old wise man came to the little boy and asked if he could buy those birds to him. Looking at the condition of those weak, sick birds, the boy could not understand why a grown old, wise man was interested in paying so much for those birds leave alone taking them for free. That is when the boy understood that to him those birds were worthless but to the old man, those birds were of value to him.<\/p>\n<p>At times I sit and wonder whether I fully understand the love of God in my life. &#8220;His love is better than life?&#8221; is mind blowing and hard to comprehend. I tend to think at times that God loves me more based on how I live for Him. The days I mess us, I feel like He is going to send a calamity or something and I even wait for it. And the devil uses this to put me down. He may even accuse me of messing up and that might be true but God&#8217;s love is not based on who we are and what we have done. His love is based on what He did when He demonstrated His love on the cross through His Son. With this said, there is nothing we can do to make God loves us more, and there is nothing we can do to make Him love us less. His love is unconditional, has no strings attached and no boundaries, He is not prejudice and has no favorites. He loves us in spite of who we are. You may feel like God does not love you because of your background, the devil is a liar. God is love, He is the definition of love.<\/p>\n<p>To understand His love for me, I first need to understand the word redeem. It gives the precedent of what love is to me. Redeem is to recover ownership by paying a specified sum. Can I say I was worth redeeming? I was just like the little sick, weak birds with no value. That is how I felt, worthless. People tend to want to redeem something that is of value, what if it&#8217;s of no value? Isaiah 63:9. &#8220;In His love and in His pity He redeemed them(us)&#8221;. What did God see in us to redeem us? He must love us so much that regardless of who we were and thought of ourselves, He still loved us with an everlasting love and with that love, He stooped down to redeem us back. Job was sick and weak, his life was meaningless but he never forgot to remember that despite of who he was, God still loved him unconditionally and that is why he was confident to say Job 19:25, &#8220;For I know that my Redeemer lives, And He shall stand at last on the earth;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Because He has redeemed us, bought us by the blood of the Lamb, we can&#8217;t keep on putting ourselves down. Read Isaiah 35 and see how the redeemed appear, vs. 1 wilderness and dessert shall be glad for them, vs. 2. they shall blossom abundantly and rejoice, vs. 2. they shall see the glory of the Lord, vs. 3 they shall strengthen the weak, vs. 4, they shall encourage etc. God has set a highway that only the redeemed shall walk on. You can only return as the redeemed when you know how He loves you. Isaiah 35:10, &#8220;And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, And come to Zion with singing, With everlasting joy on their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, And sorrow and sighing shall flee away. If you&#8217;ve been down feeling worthless, feeling like you&#8217;ve messed big time and feeling like God loves you less, I am here to challenge us, the redeem of the Lord shall return, it&#8217;s time to return to the Lord as the redeemed. Live, speak, walk, stand like the redeemed.

Life outside Christ is not just hard but impossible. As a song goes, &#8220;We want to see Jesus lifted high a banner that flies across the land, that men might see that Jesus is the way to heaven&#8221;. It is a beautiful thing to represent Christ. To be His ambassador in this world. Christ MUST be exalted which to say, we must raise His rank, glorify, praise, worship and honor Him. That is the number one duty of man. It&#8217;s not about position, ministry or calling that is on top.<\/p>\n<p>I am fascinated by the life of John the Baptist, he is about 6 months older than Jesus in human form. He was sent to be a way maker for Jesus. John understood the concept of the older serving the younger. John baptized with water unto repentance, Jesus baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire. John did ministry way before Jesus began and some even thought he was the promised Christ. He kept on mentioning to them that he wasn&#8217;t neither was he a prophet. He was a just a voice crying out in the wilderness preparing the way for\u00a0 the Lord. John was an ambassador preparing people to meet Christ, the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. John was respected and people responded to his teachings, he kept on speaking of the One to come hence decreasing that the One who had not been reveled yet would increase. John 1:26, &#8220;I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know. 27 It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.&#8221; John had everything thing and everyone to elevate him but never once did he take the glory. He understood that everything that was happening in his life and his ministry was about Christ. Therefore everything that he did, he made sure that Christ outshine him. John lost two of his disciples to Jesus in John 1:37 and his thought, Christ must increase. People were getting concerned because Jesus was getting more fame, people followed Christ more than John but listen to John speaking John 3:29, &#8220;He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom&#8217;s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.\u00a0 John&#8217;s fulfillment came about knowing that he had exalted Christ. He understood his job perfectly.<\/p>\n<p>How does this apply to us as believers, number one to understand it&#8217;s not about us but Him. Our job is to exalt Christ every where we go. In the job how we act and behave will show whether Christ is increasing or decreasing. It will also show whether people see more of us or they see Christ more. The Spirit must arise that the flesh be removed. Our attitude towards people, His blessings, our callings and ministries will indicate whether we are decreasing and He is increasing or the other way round. See people were getting concerned that John was loosing his position and his response was John 3:30, He MUST increase&#8221; not He should increase or may increase but MUST. He made sure the &#8220;MUST&#8221; was in effect. John did not wait for Christ to overtake him by staying constant, he made sure he took more out of his life (decreased) for the sake of Christ. John could only bow because he was humbled, can we do the same?\u00a0 Saying Lord is about You and not us, more of You and less of us, Whole of You and none of us, You MUST increase but I must decrease. I will do everything that I can to make sure He increases. The bible says in 1Peter 5:6,&#8221;Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time&#8221; , did Christ exalt John in due season? Matthew 11:10-11 For this is he of whom it is written: &#8220;Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.&#8221;\u00a0 11&#8243;Assuredly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist. I want to humble myself that He may increase in my life while I decrease, I MUST exalt Him whatever the cost.

It&#8217;s good to come to receive but there reaches a point where the receiving time ceases and giving times begin, a time to maximize the gifting inside of you. The bible says that, &#8220;It&#8217;s blessed to give than receive&#8221; and I happen to have proven this, as you give, you are not running dry, you are gaining more. I get more blessed and encouraged when I am giving encouragements to someone else. The more I encourage, the more I get encouraged.<\/p>\n<p>You will agree with me that there are many good things happening and yet there is less strength to accomplish them. New responsibilities, new ministries, new positions, new converts, new seeds that need to be planted and yet many have no strength to bring them forth. People are scared of moving for they feel they will mess up things, they feel like they are not able and the like. You can testify of the gift&#8217;s God has given you but there is no strength to fully utilize them. How about desires and dreams and yet when you look at your current situation and the things that are standing on the way, you just can&#8217;t see how in the world you can deliver what has been invested in you. If it was not invested, I would not think much about it. But I am talking about something that is tangible, something you can see the signs, something that you know you have but bringing it out becomes the problem and now you are stuck with a baby inside of you for you have no strength to deliver.<\/p>\n<p>Believe me, many are going to end this life still carrying inside what they should have brought forth. King Hezekiah was threatened by king of Assyria, they even went a head to say that even God would not deliver Hezekiah and therefore he shouldn&#8217;t trust in Him. King Hezekiah had something inside of him and that is the trust that God was able and would deliver him and his people but I don&#8217;t think that there were so many people in his kingdom who had that kind of faith. Not only did he believe, he also confessed it and acted on his confession. There he went to the temple with some of the elders and priests. He also sent a message to Isaiah the prophet. This was the message to Isaiah,\u00a0 Isaiah 37:3, &#8220;And they said to him, &#8220;Thus says Hezekiah:, &#8220;This is a day of trouble and rebuke and blasphemy;&#8221; I paused for a second and wondered why it was a day of trouble and I began to see that the people believed inside it could happen but there was no evidence on the outside to show that they were ready for what the Lord was going to do. It&#8217;s good to know it inside, but what is inside has to be practiced outside. You can believe that God is able but until you engage your faith into action and confess it, it will still be inside not accomplishing much. Romans 10:10, &#8220;For with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation&#8221;. It&#8217;s by the confession that you birth salvation. The woman with the issue of blood believed inside, that is what kept her pregnant and when she began to confess, she began to push out what was inside of her, faith.<\/p>\n<p>Isaiah 37:3, &#8220;&#8230;for the children have come to birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth&#8221;.\u00a0 God has deposited things in us, they are ready but the question is, are we ready? The gifts are at the peak of being birthed, the ministries are yet to be birthed but are you ready? there are preachers, prayer warriors, teachers, prophets and prophetess, pastors in our midst. Are you feeling like there is something in you that the Lord could birth but you have no strength, (enough faith to believe it can happen?). Are you still holding onto something that should have been birthed by now? I know that I&#8217;m pregnant with some things but have I have less strength to birth them. I have seen the signs, I know they are there and I can&#8217;t keep on holding them inside for they are due for birth. Help me Lord, I have new responsibilities I need to birth, moving to greater levels I need to birth, zeal to win souls I need to birth. It&#8217;s tough and scary and painful but I can&#8217;t die holding onto this thing inside of me. Lord give me more faith to strengthen me to birth what is inside. The church, ministries, job, family needs you even more but you have to bring forth what is inside of you and utilize it. Bring Forth What Is Inside!!!!

Kennedy said, \u201cAnd so my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&#8221;\u00a0 I believe spiritually speaking that many people treat God as a big cosmic Santa Clause that they feel should be blessing their lives and keeping them out of harms way and tragedies reach.\u00a0 So the question is raised, what are you willing to do for God?\u00a0 Whatever your answer might be, serving God comes with a price.\u00a0 When some of you made an outward profession of your faith, you may have lost friends, been distanced by family, and seemed to have gained some new enemies.\u00a0 The cost of serving God is real, but many don\u2019t consider the price tag in their decision.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In Luke 14, Jesus speaks of the price of serving him by using four illustrations which are:\u00a0 family, self,\u00a0 building\/labor, and war.\u00a0 To show the emphasis on the price of serving he starts with the family structure by saying, \u201cIf any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.\u201d\u00a0 WOW, those are some hard words.\u00a0 Jesus uses what we commonly call a hyperbole, which is statement of extremes, contrasting love with hate for emphasis\u2019 sake. Jesus stresses that that as much as we treasure our spouse and family, and even our own life, there should be no one whom we love and value more than God, no one who takes precedence in our life. Jesus is to clearly be at the top of our love list, and the focal point of all our affections.\u00a0 To place love for another or anything else, including ourselves, above God is idolatry.<\/p>\n<p>When we heed the call to follow the Lord, we must leave behind certain things that would be a distraction to following Him.\u00a0 For Peter and Andrew it was their nets that they left behind.\u00a0 Likewise, when He called James and John they too left their nets, but also their boat and their father.\u00a0 The rich young ruler that desired eternal life was asked to part with his riches, he could not bring himself to do it, and Jesus just moved on.\u00a0 In Matthew 8:21-22 it states, \u201cAnother disciple said to him, \u201cLord, first let me go and bury my father.\u201d But Jesus told him, \u201cFollow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.\u201d\u00a0 Was Jesus unconcerned about the family businesses and family tragedies? No.\u00a0 However He was more concerned about His will, and having steadfast followers.<\/p>\n<p>Is Jesus telling us to downright forsake our families as a cost to follow Him?\u00a0 More accurately Jesus is touching on whomever or whatever is in your life that serves as a distraction to serve him, hence serving Him comes with a price.\u00a0 Let me illustrate in a practical way.\u00a0 Perhaps your family desires your presence at an Easter diner, but your local church is doing an outreach to the community the same day and you can help.\u00a0 What would be the real purpose for Easter, sharing about the risen Savior or eating with your family? My wife and I have had to make decisions as such.\u00a0 Does this mean that we love our families any less, by no means?\u00a0 However it does call for our lives to first and foremost commit to Him and His work, even before family at times.\u00a0 If He is our Father, we must weigh out our commitments under His Lordship.\u00a0 There is a price to serving the Lord, but it is certainly not without it benefits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recall the words of Peter saying to Christ, \u201cWe have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cI tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\u00a0\u00a0 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Application:\u00a0 What is God calling you to give up for the sake of following Him?\u00a0 Remember the price may be great at the moment, but the blessings to follow are even greater.

To my surprise, there are people who believed that God existed at one point but now He is not or if He is, He has abandoned His creation. Some believe the nature of man killed God. One man by the name of Friedrich Nietzsche is notable for having declared that God is dead and for having written several of his works in the presumption that man must find a new mode of being given the demise of God. To speak more on this, we have even people who walk as though God does not exist. Yes they may not verbally deny His existence, their actions reveals in their world He is dead.<\/p>\n<p>One of the reasons I hear the most is the fact that people can&#8217;t see how God could create in six days, that He has no beginning and has no end, has no end. If He is God, then who created Him. If He is present , then why is there suffering in the world? One prophet tried to understand God and his head hurt because no one can ever fully understand God. His ways are not our ways, His thoughts are not our thoughts, as high as the heaven is from the earth\u2026How the far is the heaven from earth? Can our small mind contain who God is?<\/p>\n<p>God is a live and well, I spoke with Him this morning. I could feel His presence moving in the air and I know that He is ever present. The thought that God is no longer existing therefore man can run their lives in the way they feel is pleasing to them makes me wonder where the world is getting to. I see crosses with Jesus still hanging on them, maybe some still are still hanged on the belief that Jesus died on the cross and may still be dead. The fact that the cross is empty and the fact the tomb is empty is an indication that He is a live. Therefore I don&#8217;t have to see the tomb to know that He is a live, I just need to call on Him. If we were praying to a dead God that would be insane but because we know He is alive and hears our prayers, we have no reason to run our lives as though He is no longer present. Revelation 10:5 The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised up his hand[a] to heaven 6 and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be delay no longer, 7but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets. I wonder why the bible not only said He lives forever (eternity), it adds and &#8220;ever&#8221;, well he has no beginning and he has no end. Can we deal with that?<\/p>\n<p>With the order of creation, by looking at everything that surrounds us, how can we not see God in them? I see God in people because they reflect what only God could reflect through them. It&#8217;s the fool who has closed his mind to block out what ought to reveal to him who God is. David says in Psalm 19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork. 2Day unto day utters speech, And night unto night reveals knowledge. 3There is no speech nor language Where their voice is not heard. He has shown us that He is God and He has reached to us because we are His. He has drawn Himself closer that we may not treat Him as though He never existed. And He has provided unto us to show us we can never do it alone.

Short powerful song sang in many churches. I was thinking about the song over the weekend and wondered what Lynn thought while writing this song. She must have done some homework to look at different things to compare with the Lord before writing the song.<\/p>\n<p>Not too long ago I was watching something on TV, there is this family that assembles motor bikes from scratch. As they continued with the process of making one bike, the metals used in making the bike did not look attractive and I did not see how it was going to come out until they took the metals and dipped them in a boiling silver then I saw how that metal turned in a silverish, mercury look, precious, clear looking metal.\u00a0 You could see yourself on that metal. Did Lynn see how silver changes the looks of things and all that was not great looking all of a sudden looked sharp and concluded that God was still more precious than silver? I know so too.<\/p>\n<p>She did not stop there, she says the Lord is more costly than gold. I watched another movie entitled &#8220;The Italian Job&#8221; and there were these many blocks of gold. I had never seen\u00a0 shinny gold like that. They were good looking so expensive that they had to be kept in a precious safe and guarded. One block was worth million of dollars yet the Lord is still more costly than all the gold in the world put together. Imagine walking on the streets of gold in heaven. That the glory of the Lord makes you see the quality and the value of the gold and still all that, He is more costly than it. Lynn could not see anything that could come even close. I could have stopped there because already didn&#8217;t see anything that can be compared to God.<\/p>\n<p>Lord you are more beautiful than diamond. I also saw a movie &#8220;Blue Streak&#8221;, one of the thieves broke into a jewelry store and picked out this huge piece of diamond. If the light hit on it, the radiance from it would blind the eye. It looked crystal clear, with a nice good looking shape. I am told that there are some diamonds that look flawless but if you look at it well with the magnifying glass, you can see in it some impurities. Then there are those diamonds that are called flawless, they are very rare and very expensive. Can you imagine the Lord being more beautiful than all the diamonds put together. He is so shinny, crystal clear, flawless. The are many people who could do anything to get silver, gold and even diamond but as for me nothing can be compared to the Lord. He is my Silver, my Gold, my Diamond, He is more than any of these things put together. Let people chase after all these in life, I will chase after Him. If you sing the song again, Lynn is not degrading these items all she says is the &#8220;Lord you are MORE&#8221;. She is not denying the fact that they have great value only not compared to the Lord. People tend to use some of these things to measure their worth, what can you use to measure God&#8217;s worth?<\/p>\n<p>1 Samuel 2:2, &#8220;No one is holy like the LORD, For there is none besides You, Nor is there any rock like our God&#8221;. I have searched around and there is no one, I mean no one who is like Him. He is unique within Himself lacking nothing. No god has even come close and never will. He is so Holy, no one is as Holy as He is. He is flawless that is how Holy He is. No none besides Him or above Him. He has no competition. Nor is there any rock like our God, gold and diamonds are rocks yet there is no ROCK like our God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1 Samuel 2:2, &#8220;No one is holy like the LORD, For there is none besides You, Nor is there any rock like our God&#8221;

And the LORD blessed Obed-Edom and all his household&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fascinating to know that the ark talked about in the bible only refers to two people. We have Noah&#8217;s ark and the ark of the covenant which signifies the presence of God. I could be wrong but I don&#8217;t hear anything about another ark. If you read about the ark again in the bible, you will find that they all fall back to these two arks. The ark that Noah built with direction given to him by God saved a family (8 humans), Noah and his wife with their three sons and their wives. Noah&#8217;s ark was a big ark that had it&#8217;s work for a season but when you talk about the Ark of God, though small in size by our look of it, it supersedes Noah&#8217;s ark that only saved eight souls. God&#8217;s ark, the ark of the covenant saved and blessed the Israelites.<\/p>\n<p>The Ark of the covenant had such a great significance, it was the center of Israel&#8217;s worship and Elohim (the strong Creator) performed many miracles by ark of the covenant.\u00a0 The purpose for the Ark of the Covenant was to symbolize Yahweh Elohim\u2019s visible throne on earth. The covenant was God&#8217;s promise to human race, a promise He would not break simply because He is God. Because people would not approach God directly then, I believe the ark of the covenant was to always remind the Israelites of God&#8217;s presence amongst them. To bring hope and strength as they faced many challenges especially their enemies. As already said, the ark did not just symbolize the presence of God, by it God also perfumed miracles. Victories over the enemies were obtained through it, people were blessed through it. This really troubled their enemies especially the Philistines that they decided to capture the ark but instead of gaining blessings and victories, it turned out to be a curse to them. The ark of the covenant could not be handled carelessly and could not just be handled by anyone. The way it ended in Obed-Edom&#8217;s house was because Uzzah reached out to support the ark of the covenant when it stumbled. God killed him for doing that. Not sure why but maybe he thought he could help God, or he thought his hands were clean and we know the main reason was a proper process of handling the ark did not take place. The Levites were the elected to handle the ark, they were consecrated for that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>What turned out to be someone curse turned out to be Obed-Edom&#8217;s blessing. I don&#8217;t think Obed-Edom did anything special for God to bless his house while the ark remained there. Ordinary guy letting God be God in his house. Maybe just worshipping and yet feeling unworthy to have the ark in his house but still glad that God chose to bless him in spite of. His spiritual life must have been blessed and increased, his marriage, his children, his business were blessed because God had his hands over his household. For three good months he was blessed, I don&#8217;t think after those three months he would have wanted the ark to leave. Just one touch from God is enough to change your life completely, the very reason we don&#8217;t want to let go of God. When you sought to have the presence of God, the first thing is, the enemy can&#8217;t stand it, second your life is defined by the presence of God, you see yourself a whole lot clearly in the light of His glory and you are changed in His presence. 1John 3:2, &#8220;Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is&#8221;. You are reminded of his covenant to mankind, His promises he made to His children and all you can desire is His presence and His blessing. Obed-Edom might have been an ordinary guy yet that did not stop God from reaching out to him. This is to let us know that it&#8217;s not just pastors, evangelists, key leaders who can have the presence of God, everyone can. Allow the Ark of the covenant to rest always in your life, in your family, business, in everything and everywhere you go. You too can be an ordinary person with an extra ordinary blessing.

tree.\u00a0 Upon leaving Bethany Jesus was hungry, and saw a fig tree in the distance, and therefore went over to it to satisfy his hunger.\u00a0 However upon at the tree he noticed that it only bore leaves, but NO fruit.\u00a0 Then Jesus spoke the words of cursing upon the tree, \u201cMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.\u201d\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t quite make much sense in light of Mark stating, \u201cHe [Jesus] found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.\u201d\u00a0 Why is Jesus cursing a tree for having no figs, but every other fig tree had the same testimony, \u201cbecause IT WAS NOT THE SEASON FOR FIGS.\u201d\u00a0 Was it reasonable for Jesus to curse the fig tree for not bearing its fruit out of season?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Christie in his book \u2018The Barren Fig Tree,\u2019 explains six weeks before figs were actually to bear upon the tree in April, the tree would have first have the foliage coating complete.\u00a0 Coincident with [this], and sometimes even before, there appears quite a crop of small knobs, NOT THE REAL FIGS, but a kind of early forerunner.\u00a0 They grow to the size of green almonds, in which condition they are eaten by peasants and others when hungry.\u00a0 When they come to their own indefinite maturity they drop off.\u00a0 These precursors of the true fig are call taqsh [\u201dpre-figs\u201d] in Palestinian Arabic.\u00a0 Their appearance is an indication, a sign, of the fully formed figs which were to appear six weeks later in.\u00a0 Mark says the time for figs had not come yet.\u00a0 However if the leaves appear without any taqsh [pre-figs], that is a sign that there will be no figs appearing six weeks later.\u00a0 Since Jesus was hungry and found nothing but leaves, leaves without any taqsh, he knew that it was an absolutely hopeless, fruitless fig tree, and said as much.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus said in John 15:5, \u201cI am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.\u201d\u00a0 And in Matthew 7:21-23 \u201cNot everyone who says to me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, \u2018Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?\u2019 Then I will tell them plainly, \u2018I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!\u2019<\/p>\n<p>People will say to Jesus on that day [Judgment Day], look at all the things I did in Your Name Jesus.\u00a0 In Your name we prophesied, cast out demons, performed miracles, we knew every worship song and joined the choir, we even started ministries, etc\u2026.\u00a0 God wants fruit in lives and many people will point to things in their lives, all of their spiritual accolades, but Jesus was saying to those in Matt. 7, \u201cAll I see in your life is leaves, but NO FRUIT.\u00a0 You did those things all right, but I NEVER KNEW YOU, because you never did ABIDE IN ME all that is plain to see now because all of your efforts are just leaves and that is not my will, my will was that you bear fruit.\u00a0 There is only one reason that you produced leaves instead of fruit, because you lived disconnected from me, although you were very religious, but you did NOT do my will, but YOUR OWN!\u00a0 Depart from me! Many do works for God, apart from abiding in Him.\u00a0 If faith without works, hence works with abiding, being connected to His heart and will is also dead (fruitless). If the life of Christ permeates a disciple, fruit will be inevitable, NOT leaves.\u00a0 May we give Him what He wants, FRUIT.<\/p>\n<p>Application:\u00a0 Are you bearing leaves or fruit in your life, because Jesus only honors fruit!<br \/>\nBlessings<br \/>\nPastor Phil<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201cThen he said to the tree, \u201cMay no one ever eat fruit from you again&#8230;\u201d Jesus spoke a destructive miracle into being!\u00a0 Of all the miracles that Jesus performed, none of them was of a destructive nature other then the cursing of the fig tree.\u00a0 Upon leaving Bethany Jesus was hungry, and saw [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-99","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-1B","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/99","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=99"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/99\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=99"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=99"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=99"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":333,"date":"2005-04-15T03:38:29","date_gmt":"2005-04-15T03:38:29","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2005\/04\/15\/147-who-is-dragging-who\/"},"modified":"2005-04-15T03:38:29","modified_gmt":"2005-04-15T03:38:29","slug":"147-who-is-dragging-who","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2005\/04\/15\/147-who-is-dragging-who\/","title":{"rendered":"#147 who is dragging who&nbsp;&#8230;?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>did the title puzzle you&#8230; !

The God who is out to bless His children far beyond what they could ever imagine or think. He has not reserved the blessing for some people but to everyone. I am fascinated by the fact that God has blessings for everyone, He has not withheld any blessing from anyone, what troubles me is people.\u00a0 See when God begins to bless you and take you places, you don&#8217;t have a problem with God but have a problem with people because people have a problem with you being blessed by God. This is not new, in the book of Genesis, the first murder occurred because someone was blessed. As long as Abel had not won the attention and the affection of God, Cain was alright, the moment Abel was blessed, Cain had an attitude with him. There was nothing in him to trigger jealousy and hatred for his brother until the blessing was bestowed on Abel. Cain takes his jealousy and frustrations and dumps it on his brother by taking his life. I saw this with Saul and David, as long as David had not won the attention of God and God in turn God blessed him, Saul was ok but the moment God began to bless David, Saul was out to take his life. What about when Jesus was born, king Herod heard Jesus king of the Jews was born. A little tiny baby was already a king\u00a0 being worshipped. The three shepherds were led of by the star to the place where a king who did not even have a throne here on earth was worshiped. Upon hearing all these, king Herod was out to destroy Jesus. All these three (Abel, David, Jesus) had something in common, &#8220;Blessed of God&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Where I&#8217;m I going with this? When God begin to bless don&#8217;t expect to be liked and well received by everyone. Blessings in your life are enough to trigger jealousy and hatred from some people. I hate to say this but I see this mostly among Christians. Christians who desire to see you blessed of God, they even talk about it and the moment God begins to bless you, they begin to give you attitude. They will try to assassinate your blessings, say things to make you feel guilty about being blessed, lie on you, trying by all means to put you down, saying things to kill your spirit then the blessing that you were suppose to enjoy, becomes a curse. People&#8217;s comments pierce you deep within, you try to explain yourself, you even try to hide the blessing or if revealed, you want to act like it is nothing for example, someone looks at a material thing God has blessed you with and says something nice about it and what do you do, you degrade the blessing by saying, it&#8217;s nothing, it was just a cheap, simple thing. Why are we afraid to enjoy God&#8217;s blessings? Hasn&#8217;t the bible said, &#8220;the living God gives us richly all things to enjoy?&#8221; Good family, good job, beautiful wife, handsome husband, well behaved children, blessed ministry, nice home, nice car (all things to enjoy) . If a person has a problem with you being blessed, ask them not take their frustrations on you but on God who blessed you. Why would you want to forfeit your blessing on someone else actions? Why should you get people&#8217;s approvals before you enjoy God&#8217;s blessings? After all God will not check with anyone if He should bless you. Those who are frustrated with you right know nothing about your history. They don&#8217;t know what you went through to get where you are, the mountains you had to climb, the valleys of the shadow of death you had to pass through. The days you would sit and wonder whether God had even a blessing for you. The days you felt like giving up, sat down and just cried your eyes out. Now that you are blessed of God, why should you continue to feel bad because someone has a problem with God blessing you? You and I need ask ourselves this question, &#8220;CAN WE STAND TO BE BLESSED?&#8221;. Can you stand to ride above what people say or think when you are blessed? Many people&#8217;s blessings are turning out to be curses because they have allowed people to make them feel bad about being blessed. It&#8217;s not people&#8217;s attitude that will cause God to bless you more, it&#8217;s your attitude towards the blessing. It&#8217;s how you respond and act upon it.\u00a0 2 Corinthians 1:20, &#8220;For all the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us&#8221;. Because God has promised to bless me and I am blessed, I refuse to act like I am not blessed and I refuse to let anyone make me feel bad about being blessed, I want to survive being blessed because he has given me all these blessings to enjoy. If I wait till everyone likes me to enjoy the blessings, I will waste everyday and I won&#8217;t be surprised if God stops blessing me. I enjoy the blessing, He gets the glory we call it a deal.<br \/>\nBlessings Ev<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1 Timothy 6:17, &#8220;Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.

Be blessed<\/p>\n<p>Mathew 5:13, &#8220;You are salt of earth&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago after getting off work and went home, upon reaching I decided to get a cup of nice, hot, spiced tea. Once I poured it into the cup, I found a dish with a substance I thought was sugar, being confident that was sugar, I scooped two spoon full into the tea, stirred it up and made the first sip, boy was I wrong. That was no sugar but salt, I missed my precious tea but understood the power of salt<\/p>\n<p>Salt is\u00a0 a colorless or white crystalline solid, chiefly sodium chloride, used extensively in ground or granulated form as food seasoning and preservative. It&#8217;s an element that gives flavor. This is it&#8217;s primary function.<\/p>\n<p>There is something about salt that we need to understand because it shows us what Jesus meant when He said, &#8220;You are the salt of the earth&#8221;. I just read somewhere that there are 14,000 uses of salt. Let&#8217;s look some of the things salt does. Small pinch of salt can make food taste,\u00a0 as for sugar, you might use more before you can make something taste. Salt is not made out of something like sugar, salt mostly are found around the lakes, oceans, streams. Salt are used to melt ice, we use salt it to preserve meat, treat wounds. salt creates thirst, salt stops colors from fading especially on clothing materials. I&#8217;m told that salt causes water to boil faster, it can be used to peel boiling eggs faster, greasy pans can be cleaned using salt.<\/p>\n<p>We have been made in a way that we can add flavor because we are salty. Everyone has a chance to do something, you can melt a hard heart, you can preserve by your salty words, you can treat wounds, you can create thirst for righteousness, you can stop precious things from fading away, you can clean using your words in other words, by all means you can be a salt that the Lord will use to restore someone. Remember that a pinch of salt can do greater things. You don&#8217;t have to be an expert, scientist, doctor, professional to salt someone else, all you got to do is remember what Jesus has called you, SALT and know where you get your salt from.<\/p>\n<p>Mathew 5:13, &#8220;&#8230; but if the salt looses it&#8217;s flavor, how shall it be seasoned? it is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men&#8221;, It is possible to loose your saltiness and that happens when you disconnect yourself from the stream of water where salt is found. We are to be like a tree planted by the river bearing our fruit (salt) in our season. Who wants to use salt that has no flavor? and who will want to use salt that is not effective?<\/p>\n<p>Check your personal life, do you consider yourself to be a salt? if you are, are you salting the people around you in every way the salt can be used? Are you stretched to the maximum in the sense that you are fully utilizing your saltiness to affect your surrounding? This is not for some people, this is for all believers who are connected to the living stream. Salt through prayers, encouragements, helping out, spending time with someone etc<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Due to some circumstances, Pastor will not bring the word today, here is a word I shared with our devotion team in August of 03.

3 &#8220;As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD , you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel. 4 For every living soul belongs to me, the father as well as the son-both alike belong to me. The soul who sins is the one who will die. 5 &#8220;Suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right. 6 He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor&#8217;s wife or lie with a woman during her period. 7 He does not oppress anyone, but returns what he took in pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked. 8 He does not lend at usury or take excessive interest. He withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges fairly between man and man. 9 He follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws. That man is righteous; he will surely live, declares the Sovereign LORD . 10 Suppose he has a violent son, who sheds blood or does any of these other things 11 (though the father has done none of them): &#8220;He eats at the mountain shrines. He defiles his neighbor&#8217;s wife. 12 He oppresses the poor and needy. He commits robbery. He does not return what he took in pledge. He looks to the idols. He does detestable things. 13 He lends at usury and takes excessive interest. Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he will surely be put to death and his blood will be on his own head. 14 &#8220;But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things: 15 &#8220;He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor&#8217;s wife. 16 He does not oppress anyone or require a pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked. 17 He withholds his hand from sin and takes no usury or excessive interest. e keeps my laws and follows my decrees. He will not die for his father&#8217;s sin; he will surely live. 18 But his father will die for his own sin, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people. 19 &#8220;Yet you ask, &#8216;Why does the son not share the guilt of his father?&#8217; Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees, he will surely live. 20 The soul who sins is the one who will die. The on will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of he wicked will be charged against him. 21 &#8220;But if a wicked man turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, e will surely live; he will not die. 22 None of the offences he has committed will be remembered against him. Because of the righteous things he has done, he will live. 3 o I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign LORD . Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? 24 &#8220;But if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked man does, will he live? None of the righteous things he has one will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness he is guilty of and because of the sins he has committed, he will die. 25 &#8220;Yet you say, &#8216;The way of the Lord is not just.&#8217; Hear, O house of Israel: Is my way unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust? 26 If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin, he will die for it; because of the sin he has committed he will die. 27 But if a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will save is life. 28 Because he considers all the offences he has committed and turns away from them, he will surely live; he will not die. 29 Yet the house of Israel says, &#8216;The ay f the Lord is not just.&#8217; Are my ways unjust, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust? 30 &#8220;Therefore, O house of Israel, I will judge you, each one according o his ways, declares the Sovereign LORD . Repent! Turn away from all your offences; then sin will not be your downfall. 31 Rid yourselves of all the offences you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, O house of Israel? 32 For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD . Repent and live!<\/p>\n<p>task :  Repent and live!  Its as simple as it can get.

When I first read this portion I personally felt the Lord should have given them all a piece of HIS mind. I wished He spoke some mind-boggling WORDS of wisdom, and make Caiphus and party run helter skelter searching for a counterfeit argument. Or may be, a MIRACLE that could shut the mouths of all the accusers for ever.<br \/>\nBut little did i understand then, that the Lord, who was in flesh and blood, was humbly coming under authority. He could have rightfully claimed HIS position as the HIGH PRIEST, but NO. Jesus the Christ instead choose to submit to the authority bestowed upon Caiphus the PRIEST. The priest was being wicked, but wait a second, He still held the chair. Jesus, who being in very nature GOD, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped. Phil2:6.<\/p>\n<p>This Good Friday, my beloved, let us sit back &#8211; and be quiet, both physically and mentally. Let us put aside all that we always have to say, and maintain SILENCE.

I would try and watch all the playoffs, I could, on TV. I&#8217;d play on weekday mornings and on weekends too. During the season my thoughts would always be oriented around the game. I realized over a period of time that I had absolutely no time allocated for God. I realized that the game was becoming more and more important to me than Jesus. So one day I gave my commitment to God, saying &#8220;Lord I am willing to give up this game, for your sake. I want to spend time with you&#8221;. I felt a lot relieved even as I said that prayer. Just about the same time, my sports shoes had given up on me. And I didn&#8217;t get myself another pair. I stopped playing the game. And for almost 6 months I kept myself away from it. It was tough all the way through. And one Sunday evening, the Lord spoke to me. He said, &#8220;Abhi, I want you to play today&#8221;. I was, for a moment, shocked. I knew it was the Lord, because I kept asking Him if He were serious, and a tremendous amount of peace descended over me. My heart leaped with joy. And that Sunday evening I had one of my best games ever. I was shooting well, laying it up well, I was stealing the ball &#8211; boy I was all over the court. I was worshipping the Lord that evening even as I played on the court. Something I would cherish forever.<br \/>\nToday, the Lord actually uses me as a witness at the court, where people from several nationalities come to play. Its a part of my ministry, today! I am usually the peace maker, when I see a potential brawl picking up, over a foul or a wrong call. If they need someone to call, its gottu be me! If someone was to ref&#8217; the game, I am the first choice. The guys wouldn&#8217;t use profanity, especially when I am around. A couple of them even wanted to come to church.

A child is expected to ask the father! That is how it is! There is no other way around it. Good stuff \/ bad stuff don&#8217;t matter!!

Isn&#8217;t that so cool!<br \/>\nI mean, just imagine! You first lift up your requests to the Father in Heaven, and ask Him for His will to be done. He then gives you the BEST! And also there are times, when we ask for stuff, and the Father denies them because, in SIMPLE terms, we are asking for something that doesn&#8217;t mean good for us. Or say put it this way, &#8220;Our Father in Heaven is a better judge, any DAY&#8221;. I&#8217;d seek His counsel!<\/p>\n<p>6.

Take time to read&nbsp;it."},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Payday Someday<br \/>\nBy Dr. R. G. Lee<br \/>\nArise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it. And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine . . And of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel (I Kings 21:18,19,23).<br \/>\nI introduce to you Naboth. Naboth was a devout Israelite who lived in the town of Jezreel. Naboth was a good man. He abhorred that which is evil. He clave to that which is good. He would not dilute the stringency of his personal piety for any profit in money. He would not change his heavenly principles for loose expediencies. And this good man who loved God, his family and his nation, had a little vineyard which was close by the summer palace of Ahab, the king &#8212; a palace unique in its splendor as the first palace inlaid with ivory. This little vineyard had come to Naboth as a cherished inheritance from his forefathers &#8212; and all of it was dear to his heart.<br \/>\nI introduce to you Ahab, the vile human toad who squatted upon the throne of his nation &#8212; the worst of Israel&#8217;s kings. King Ahab had command of a nation&#8217;s wealth and a nation&#8217;s army, but he had no command of his lusts and appetites. Ahab wore rich robes, but he had a sinning and wicked and troubled heart beneath them. He ate the finest food the world could supply &#8212; and this food was served to him in dishes splendid by servants obedient to his every beck and nod &#8212; but he had a starved soul. He lived in palaces sumptuous within and without, yet he tormented himself for one bit of land more. Ahab was a king with a throne and a crown and a scepter, yet he lived nearly all of his life under the thumb of a wicked woman &#8212; a tool in her hands. Ahab pilloried himself in the contempt of all God-fearing men as a mean and selfish rascal who was the curse of his country. The Bible introduces him to us in words more appropriate than these when it says:<br \/>\nBut there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel . . . And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him (I Kings 21:25,26; 16:33).<br \/>\nI introduce to you Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, King of Tyre (I Kings 16:31), and wife of Ahab, the King of Israel &#8212; a king&#8217;s daughter and a king&#8217;s wife, the evil genius at once of her dynasty and of her country. Infinitely more daring and reckless was she in her wickedness than was her wicked husband. Masterful, indomitable, implacable, a devout worshiper of Baal, she hated anyone and everyone who spoke against or refused to worship her pagan god. As blunt in her wickedness and as brazen in her lewdness was she as Cleopatra, fair sorceress of the Nile. She had all the subtle and successful scheming of Lady Macbeth, all the adulterous desire and treachery of Potiphar&#8217;s wife (Gen. 39:7-20), all the boldness of Mary Queen of Scots, all the cruelty and whimsical imperiousness of Katherine of Russia, all the devilish infamy of a Madame Pompadour, and, doubtless, all the fascination of personality of a Josephine of France. Most of that which is bad in all evil women found expression through this painted viper of Israel. She had that rich endowment of nature which a good woman ought always to dedicate to the service of her day and generation. But, alas! This idolatrous daughter of an idolatrous king of an idolatrous people engaging with her maidens in worship unto Ashtoreth &#8212; the personification of the most forbidding obscenity, uncleanness, and sensuality &#8212; became the evil genius who wrought wreck, brought blight and devised death. She was the beautiful and malicious adder coiled upon the throne of the nation.<br \/>\nI introduce to you Elijah, the Tishbite, prophet of God at a time when by tens of thousands the people had forsaken God&#8217;s covenants, thrown down God&#8217;s altars, slain God&#8217;s prophets with the sword (I Kings 19:10). The prophet, knowing much of the glorious past of the now apostate nation, must have been filled with horror when he learned of the rank heathenism, fierce cruelties and reeking licentiousness of Ahab&#8217;s idolatrous capital. Holy anger burned within him like an unquenchable Vesuvius. He wore the roughest kind of clothes, but he had underneath these clothes a righteous and courageous heart. He ate bird&#8217;s food and widow&#8217;s fare, but he was a great physical and spiritual athlete. He was God&#8217;s tall cedar that wrestled with the paganistic cyclones of his day without bending or breaking. He was God&#8217;s granite wall that stood up and out against the rising tides of the apostasy of his day. Though much alone, he was sometimes attended by the invisible hosts of God. He grieved only when God&#8217;s cause seemed tottering. He passed from earth without dying &#8212; into celestial glory. Every where courage is admired and manhood honored and service appreciated, he is honored as one of earth&#8217;s greatest heroes and one of heaven&#8217;s greatest saints. He was a seer who saw clearly. He was a great heart who felt deeply. He was a hero who dared valiantly.<br \/>\nAnd now with the introduction of these four characters &#8212; Naboth, the devout Jezreelite &#8212; Ahab, the vile human toad who squatted befoulingly on the throne of the nation &#8212; Jezebel, the beautiful adder beside the toad &#8212; and Elijah, the prophet of the living God, I bring you the tragedy of &#8220;Payday Someday.&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd the first scene in the tragedy of &#8220;Payday Someday&#8221; is:<br \/>\nTHE REAL ESTATE REQUEST<br \/>\n&#8220;Give me thy vineyard.&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money (I Kings 21:1,2).<br \/>\nThus far Ahab was quite within his rights. No intention had he of cheating Naboth out of his vineyard or of killing him to get it. Honestly did he offer to give him its worth in money. Honestly did he offer him a better vineyard for it. Perfectly fair and square was Ahab in this request and, under Circumstances ordinary, one would have expected Naboth to put away any mere sentimental attachment which he had for his ancestral inheritance in order that he might please the king of his nation &#8212; especially when the king&#8217;s aim was not to defraud or rob him. Ahab had not, however, counted upon the reluctance of all Jews to part with their inheritance of land. By peculiar tenure every Israelite held his land, and to all land-holding transactions there was another party, even God, &#8220;who made the heavens and the earth.&#8221; Throughout Judah and Israel, Jehovah was the real owner of the soil; and every tribe received its territory and every family its inheritance by lot from Him, with the added condition that the land should not be sold forever.<br \/>\nThe land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with Me &#8230; So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep him-self to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers &#8230; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance (Lev. 25:23; Num. 36:7,9).<br \/>\nThus we see that the permanent sale of the paternal inheritance was forbidden by law. Ahab forgot &#8212; if he had ever really known it &#8212; that for Naboth to sell for money or to swap for a better vineyard his little vineyard would seem to that good man like a denial of his allegiance to the true religion when jubilee restoration was neglected in such idolatrous times.<br \/>\nSo, though he was Ahab&#8217;s nearest neighbor, Naboth, with religious scruples blended with the pride of ancestry, stood firmly on his rights &#8212; and, with an expression of horror on his face and with tones of terror in his words, refused to sell or swap his vineyard to the king. Feeling that he must prefer the duty he owed to God to any danger that might arise from man, he made firm refusal. With much fear of God and little fear of man, he said: &#8220;The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee&#8221; (I Kings 21:3).<br \/>\nTrue to the religious teachings of his father with loyalty to the covenant God of Israel, he believed that he held the land in fee simple from God. His father and grandfather and doubtless grandfather&#8217;s father, had owned the land before him. All the memories of childhood were tangled in its grapevines. His father&#8217;s hands, folded now in the dust of death, had used the pruning blade among the branches, and because of this every branch and vine was dear. His mother&#8217;s hands, now doubtless wrapped in a dust- stained shroud, had gathered purple clusters from those bunch-laden boughs, and for this reason he loved every spot in his vineyard and every branch on his vines. The ties of sentiment, of religion and of family pride bound and endeared him to the place. So his refusal to sell was quick, firm, final and courteous. Then, too, doubtless working or resting or strolling as he often did in his vineyard hard by the king&#8217;s castle, Naboth had had glimpses of strange and alien sights in the palace. He had seen with his own eyes what orgies idolatry led to when the queen was at home in her palace in Jezreel; and Naboth, deeply pious, felt smirched and hurt at the very request. He felt that his little plot of ground, so rich in prayer and fellowship, so sanctified with sweet and holy memories, would be tainted and befouled and cursed forever if it came into the hands of Jezebel. So with &#8220;the courage of a bird that dares the wild sea,&#8221; he took his stand against the king&#8217;s proposal.<br \/>\nAnd that brings us to the second scene in this tragedy. It is:<br \/>\nTHE POUTING POTENTATE<br \/>\n&#8220;He came into his house heavy and displeased.&#8221;<br \/>\nNaboth&#8217;s quick, firm, courteous, final refusal took all the spokes from the wheels of Ahab&#8217;s desires and plans. Naboth&#8217;s refusal was a barrier that turned aside the stream of Ahab&#8217;s desire and changed it into a foiled and foaming whirlpool of sullen sulks.<br \/>\nAnd Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread (I Kings 21:4).<br \/>\nWhat a ridiculous picture&#8217; A king acting like a spoiled and sullen child &#8212; impotent in disappointment and ugly in petty rage! A king, whose victories over the Syrians have rung through many lands &#8212; a conqueror, a slave to himself &#8212; whining like a sick hound! A king, rejecting all converse with others, pouting like a spoiled and petulant child who has been denied one trinket in the midst of one thousand play-things! A king, in a chamber &#8220;cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion&#8221; (Jer. 22:14), prostituting genius to theatrical trumpery.<br \/>\nAhab went into his ivory house, while the sun was shining and the matters of the daytime were all astir, and went to bed and &#8220;turned his face to the wall&#8221; &#8211; his lips swollen with his mulish moping, his eyes burning with cheap anger-fire, his wicked heart stubborn in perverse rebellion against the commandment of God. Servants brought him his meal, plenteously prepared on platters beautiful, but he &#8220;would eat no bread.&#8221; Doubtless, musicians came to play skillfully on stringed instruments, but he drove them all away with imperious gestures and impatient growlings. He turned from his victuals as one turns from garbage and refuse. The conqueror of the Syrians is a low slave to dirt-cheap trivialities. His spirit, now devilishly sullen, is in bondage.<br \/>\nWhat an ancient picture we have of great powers dedicated to mean, ugly, petty things. Think of it! In the middle of the day, the commander-in-chief of an army seized by Sergeant Sensitive. General Ahab made prisoner by Private Pouts! The leader of an army laid low by Corporal Mopishness! A monarch moaning and blubbering and growlingly refusing to eat because a man, a good man, because of the commandments of God and because of religious principles, would not sell or swap a little vineyard which was his by inheritance from his forefathers. Ahab had lost nothing &#8212; had gained nothing. No one had injured him. No one had made attempt on his life. Yet he, a king with a great army and a fat treasury, was acting like a blubbering baby. Cannon ability was expressing itself in popgun achievement. A massive giant sprawling on the bed like a dwarf punily peevish! A whale wallowing and spouting angrily about because he is denied minnow food! A bear growling sulkily because he cannot lick a spoon in which is a bit of honey! An eagle shrieking and beating his wings in the dust of his own displeasure like a quarreling sparrow fussily fighting with other sparrows for the crumbs in the dust of a village street! A lion sulkily roaring because he was not granted the cheese in a mouse trap! A battleship cruising for a beetle!<br \/>\n&#8220;People there are, not a few, who have pipe organ abilities and make no more music for the causes of Christ than a wheezy saxophone in an idiot&#8217;s hands.&#8221;<br \/>\nWhat an ancient picture of great powers and talents prostituted to base and purposeless ends and withheld from the service of God! What an ancient spectacle! And how modern and up-to-date, in this respect, was Ahab, king of Israel. What a likeness to him in conduct today are many talented men and women. I know men and women &#8212; you know men and women &#8212; with diamond and ruby abilities who are worth no more to God through the churches than a punctured Japanese nickel in a Chinese bazaar! So many there are who, like Ahab, withhold their talents from God &#8212; using them in the service of the devil. People there are, not a few, who have pipe organ abilities and make no more music for the causes of Christ than a wheezy saxophone in an idiot&#8217;s hands. People there are, many of them, who have incandescent light powers who make no more light for God than a smoky barn lantern, with smoke-blackened globe, on a stormy night. People there are &#8212; I know them and you know them &#8212; with locomotive powers doing pushcart work for God. People there are &#8212; and how sad &#8217;tis true &#8212; who have steam-shovel abilities who are doing teaspoon work for God. Yes! Now look at this overfed bull bellowing for a little spot of grass outside his own vast pasture lands &#8212; and, if you are withholding talents and powers from the service of God, receive the rebuke of the tragic and ludicrous picture.<br \/>\nAnd now, consider the third scene in this tragedy of &#8220;Payday Someday.&#8221; It is:<br \/>\nTHE WICKED WIFE<br \/>\n&#8220;And Jezebel his wife.&#8221;<br \/>\nWhen Ahab would &#8220;eat no bread,&#8221; the servants went and told Jezebel. What she said to them, we do not know. Something of what she said to Ahab we do know. Puzzled and provoked at the news that her husband would not eat &#8212; that he had gone to bed when it was not bedtime &#8212; Jezebel went to investigate. She found him in bed with his face turned to the wall, his lips swollen with mulish moping, his eyes burning with cheap anger-fire, his heart stubborn in wicked rebellion. He was groaningly mournful and peevishly petulant &#8212; having, up to the moment when she stood by his bedside, refused to eat or cheer up in the least.<br \/>\nLooking at him then, she doubtless, as is the custom with women until this day, put her hand on his forehead to see if he had fever. He had fever-without doubt! He was set on fire of hell, even as is a wicked tongue (Jas. 3:6). Then, in a voice of &#8220;Sweet&#8221; solicitation, she sought the reason of his anger. She asked, to put it in the semi-slang language of our day: &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Big Boy?&#8221; But, in the words of the Bible: &#8220;Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?&#8221; (I Kings 21:5). Then, with his mouth full of grouches, with his heart stubborn in rebellion against the commandment of God, he told her &#8212; his every word full of mopish petulance:<br \/>\nBecause I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard (I Kings 21:6).<br \/>\nEvery word he said stung like a whip upon a naked back this wickedly unscrupulous woman who had never had any regard for the welfare of anyone who did not worship her god, Baal &#8212; who never had any conscientious regard for the rights of others, or for others who did not yield to her whimsical imperiousness.<br \/>\nHear her derisive laugh as it rings Out in the palace like the shrill cackle of a wild fowl that has returned to its nest and has found a serpent therein! With her tongue, sharp as a razor, she prods Ahab as an ox driver prods with sharp goad the ox which does not want to press his neck into the yoke, or as one whips with a rawhide a stubborn mule. With profuse and harsh laughter this old gay and gaudy guinea of Satan derided this king of hers for a cowardly buffoon and sordid Jester What hornet like sting in her sarcasm! What wolf mouth fierceness in her every reproach! What tiger fang cruelty in her expressed displeasure! What fury in the shrieking of her rebuke! What bitterness in the teasing taunts she hurled at him for his scrupulous timidity! Her bosom with anger was heaving! Her eyes were flashing with rage under the surge of hot anger that swept over her.<br \/>\n&#8220;Are you not the king of this country?&#8221; she chides bitingly, her tongue sharp like a butcher&#8217;s blade. &#8220;Can you not command and have it done?&#8221; she scolds as a common village hag who has more noise than wisdom in her words &#8220;Can you not seize and keep?&#8221; she cries with reproach. &#8220;I thought you told me you were king in these parts! And here you are crying like a baby and will not eat anything because you do not have courage to take a bit of land. You! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! You, the king of Israel, allow yourself to be disobeyed and defied by a common clodhopper from the country. You are more courteous and considerate of him than you are of your queen! Shame on you! But you leave it to me! I will get the vineyard for you, and all that I require is that you ask no questions. leave it to me, Ahab!&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite (I Kings 21:7).<br \/>\nAhab knew Jezebel well enough to know that she would do her best, or her worst, to keep her wicked promise. So, as a turtle that has been sluggish in the cold winter&#8217;s mud begins to move when the spring sunshine warms the mud, Ahab crawled out of the slime of his sulks &#8212; somewhat as a snake arouses and uncoils from winter sleep. Then Jezebel doubtless tickled him under the chin with her bejewelled fingers or kissed him peckingly on the cheek with her lips screwed in a tight knot, and said: &#8220;There now! Smile! And eat something. I will get thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite!&#8221;<br \/>\nNow, let us ask, who can so inspire a man to noble purposes as a noble woman? And who can so thoroughly degrade a man as a wife of unworthy tendencies? Back of the statement, &#8220;And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him&#8221; (I Kings 16:30), and back of what Elijah spoke, &#8220;Thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord&#8221; (I Kings 21:20), is the statement explaining both the other statements: &#8220;Whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.&#8221; She was the polluted reservoir from which the streams of his own iniquity found mighty increase. She was the poisonous pocket from which his cruel fangs fed. She was the sulphurous pit wherein the fires of his own iniquity found fuel for intenser burning. She was the Devil&#8217;s grindstone which furnished sharpening for his weapons of wickedness.<br \/>\n&#8220;The spiritual life of a nation, city, town, school, church, or home never rises any higher than the spiritual life of women.&#8221;<br \/>\nSearch the pages of the Bible all you will; study history all you please. And you will find one truth that stands out above some other truths. What is that truth? The truth that the spiritual life of a nation, city, town, school, church, or home never rises any higher than the spiritual life of women. When women sag morally and spiritually, men sag morally and spiritually. When women slump morally and spiritually, men slip morally and spiritually. When women take the downward road men travel with them. When women are lame morally and spiritually, men limp morally and spiritually. The degeneracy of womanhood helps the decay of manhood.<br \/>\nYes &#8212; we ask again &#8212; who can so degrade a man as a woman of wicked tendencies and purposes? Is not a woman without spiritual religion and love of God in her heart like a rainbow without color &#8212; like a strong poisoned well from which the thirsty drink &#8212; like a heated stove whose heat is infection &#8212; like kissing lips spread with deadly poison?<br \/>\nWhat a tragedy when any woman thinks more of paint than purity, of vulgarity than virtue, of pearls than principles of adornment with righteous adoration, of hose and hats than holiness, of dress than duty, of mirrors than manners! What a tragedy when any woman sacrifices decency on the altar of degradation &#8212; visualizing the slimy, the tawdry, the tinseled!<br \/>\nWe ask &#8212; just here &#8212; some questions. Who dominated the papacy in its most shameful days? Lucretia Borgia &#8212; a woman. Who really ordered the massacre of Saint Bartholomew&#8217;s day? Catherine de Medici &#8212; a woman. Who breathed fury through Robespierre in those dark and bloody days in France when the guillotine was chopping off the heads of the royalty? A woman &#8212; determined, devilish, dominant! Who caused Samson to have his eyes punched out and to be a prisoner of the Philistines, after he had been a judge in Israel for twenty years? Delilah &#8212; a woman! Who caused David to stake his crown for a caress? Bathsheba &#8212; a woman. Who danced Herod into hell? Herodias &#8212; a woman! Who was like a heavy chain around the neck of Governor Felix for life or death, for time and eternity? Drusilla &#8212; a woman! Who, by lying and diabolical stratagem, sent the spotless Joseph to jail because he refused her dirty, improper proposal? Potiphar&#8217;s wife. Who suggested to Haman that he build a high gallows on which to hang Mordecai, the Jew? Zeresh &#8212; a woman &#8212; his wife! Who told Job in the midst of his calamities, financial and physical, to curse God and die? A woman &#8212; his wife. Who ruined the career of Charles Stewart Parnell and delayed Home Rule for Ireland in the good days of good Queen Victoria? Kitty O&#8217;Shea &#8212; a woman. Who caused Anthony to throw away the world at the battle of Actium and follow the enchantress of the Nile back to Egypt? The enchantress herself, Cleopatra &#8212; a woman &#8212; the lovely serpent coiled on the throne of the Ptolemies.<br \/>\nSo also it was a woman, a passionate and ambitious idolatress, even Jezebel, who mastered Ahab. Take the stirring crimes of any age, and at the bottom, more or less consciously concerned, the world almost invariably finds a woman. Only God almighty knows the full story of the foul plots hatched by women.<br \/>\nBut we know enough to say that some of the foulest plots that have been hatched out of Satan&#8217;s incubator were hatched out of eggs placed therein by women&#8217;s hands.<br \/>\nBut let me say, incidentally, if women have mastered men for evil, they have also mastered them for good &#8212; and we gladly make declaration that some of the fairest and most fragrant flowers that grow in the garden of God and some of the sweetest and most luscious fruit that ripens in God&#8217;s spiritual orchards are there because of woman&#8217;s faith, woman&#8217;s love, woman&#8217;s prayer, woman&#8217;s virtue, woman&#8217;s tears, woman&#8217;s devotion to Christ.<br \/>\nBut as for Ahab, it was Jezebel who stirred him up to more and mightier wickedness than his own wicked mind could conceive or his own wicked hand could execute.<br \/>\nLet us come to the next terrible scene in this tragedy of sin. The next scene is:<br \/>\nA MESSAGE MEANING MURDER<br \/>\n&#8220;She wrote letters.&#8221;<br \/>\nJezebel wrote letters to the elders of Jezreel. And in these letters she made definite and subtle declaration that some terrible sin had been committed in their city, for which it was needful that a fast should be proclaimed in order to avert the wrath of Heaven.<br \/>\nSo she wrote letters in Ahab&#8217;s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth. And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people: and set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him Out, and stone him, that he may die (I Kings 21:8-10).<br \/>\nThis letter, with cynical disregard of decency, was a hideous mockery in the name of religion. Once get the recusant citizen accused of blasphemy, and, by a divine law, the property of the blasphemer and rebel went to the crown. &#8220;Justice! How many traitors to sacred truth have dragged the innocent to destruction!&#8221;<br \/>\nSurely black ink never wrote a fouler plot or death scheme on white paper since writing was known among men. Every drop had in it the adder&#8217;s poison. Every syllable of every word of every line of every sentence was full of hate toward him who had done only good continually. Every letter of every syllable was but the thread which, united with other threads, made the hangman&#8217;s noose for him who had not changed his righteous principles for the whim of a king. The whole letter was a diabolical death-warrant.<br \/>\nThe letters being written, must be sealed; and the sealing was done, as all these matters of letter writing and sealing were done, by rubbing ink on the seal, moistening the paper, and pressing the seal thereon. And when Jezebel had finished with her iniquitous pen, she asked Ahab for his signet ring; with that ring she affixed the royal seal. She sealed the letters with Ahab&#8217;s ring (I Kings 21:8). When Ahab gave it to her he knew it meant crime of some sort, but he asked no questions. Moreover, Jezebel&#8217;s deeds showed that when she went down to market, as it were, she would have in her basket a nice vineyard for her husband when she returned. She said to herself: &#8220;This man Naboth has refused my honorable lord on religious grounds, and by all the gods of Baal, I will get him yet on these very same grounds.&#8221; She understood perfectly the passion of a devout Jew for a public fast; and she knew that nothing would keep the Jews away. Every Jew and every member of his household would be there.<br \/>\n&#8220;Proclaim a fast!&#8221; Fasting has ever been a sign of humiliation before God. of humbling one&#8217;s self in the dust before the &#8220;high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity.&#8221; The idea in calling for a fast was clearly to declare that the community was under the anger of God on account of a grave crime committed by one of its members, which crime is to be exposed and punished. Then, too, the fast involved a cessation of work, a holiday, so that the citizens would have time to attend the public gathering.<br \/>\n&#8220;Set Naboth on high!&#8221; &#8220;On high&#8221; meant before the bar of justice, not in the seat of honor. &#8220;On high&#8221; meant in the seat of the accused, and not in the seat to be desired. &#8220;On high&#8221; meant that Naboth was put where every eye could watch him closely and keenly observe his bearing under the accusation. &#8220;And set two men, base fellows, before him.&#8221; How illegal she was in bringing about his death in a legal way! For the law required two witnesses in all cases where the punishment was death. &#8220;At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he . . . be put to death&#8221; (Deut. 17:6). The witnesses required by Jezebel were men of no character, men who would take bribes and swear to any lie for gain.<br \/>\nAnd let them &#8220;bear witness against him&#8221;! In other words, put him out of the way by judicial murder, not by private assassination. &#8220;And then Carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.&#8221; A criminal was not to be executed within a city, as that would defile it! Thus Christ was crucified outside the walls of Jerusalem! We see that Jezebel took it for granted that Naboth would be condemned.<br \/>\nAnd so one day, while Naboth worked in his vineyard, the letters came down to Jezreel. And one evening, while Naboth talked at the cottage door with his sons or neighbors, the message meaning murder was known to the elders of the city. And that night, while he slept with the wife of his bosom, the hounds of death let loose from the kennels of hell by the jewel-adorned fingers of a king&#8217;s daughter and a king&#8217;s wife were close on his heels. The message meaning murder was known to many but not to him, until they came and told him that a fast had been proclaimed &#8212; proclaimed because God had been offended at some crime and that His wrath must be appeased and the threatening anger turned away, and he himself, all unconscious of any offense toward God or the king, was to be set in the place of the accused, even &#8220;on high among the people,&#8221; to be tried as a conspicuous criminal.<br \/>\nTHE FATAL FAST<br \/>\n&#8220;They proclaimed a fast.&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd what concern they must have created in the household of Naboth, when they knew that Naboth was to be &#8220;set on high,&#8221; even in the &#8220;seat of the accused,&#8221; even before the bar of &#8220;justice,&#8221; because of a ferocious message calling religion in to attest a lie. And what excitement there was in the city when, with fawning readiness to carry out her vile commands, the elders and nobles &#8220;fastened the minds&#8221; of the people upon the fast &#8212; proclaimed as if some great calamity were overhanging the city for their sins like a black cloud pretending a storm, and proclaimed as if something must be done at once to avert the doom. Curious throngs hurried to the fast to see him who had been accused of the crime which made necessary the appeasing of the threatening wrath of an angered God.<br \/>\nYes, the rulers of Jezreel, either in dread of offending one whose revenge they knew was terrible, or eager to do a service to one to whom in temporal matters they were so largely indebted, or moved with envy against their own iniquity, carried out her instructions to the letter. They were ready and efficient tools in her hands. No doubt she had tested their character as her &#8220;butcher boys&#8221; in the slaughter of the prophets of the Lord.<br \/>\nAnd they did! &#8220;And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat down before him&#8221; (I Kings 21:13). Satan&#8217;s hawks ready to bring death to God&#8217;s harmless sparrow! Satan&#8217;s eagles ready to bury their cruel talons in God&#8217;s innocent dove. Satan&#8217;s bloody wolves ready to kill God&#8217;s lamb! Satan&#8217;s boars ready with keen tusks to rip God&#8217;s stag to shreds! Reckless and depraved professional perjurers they were! &#8220;And the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king&#8221; (I Kings 21:13).<br \/>\nThen strong hands jerked Naboth out of the seat of the accused. Doubtless muttering curses the while, they dragged him out from among the throngs of people, while children screamed and cried, while women shrieked in terror, while men moved in confusion and murmured in consternation. They dragged him roughly to a place outside the walls of the city and with stones they beat his body to the ground.<br \/>\nNaboth fell to the ground as a lily by hailstones beaten to earth, as a stately cedar uprooted by furious storm. His head by stones is crushed, as eggs crushed by the heel of a giant. His legs are splintered! His arms are broken! His ribs are crushed. Bones stick out from the mass of human flesh as fingers of ivory from pots of red paint. Brains, emptied from his skull, are scattered about. Blood splatters like crimson rain. Naboth&#8217;s eyes roll in sockets of blood. His tongue between broken jaws becomes still. His mauled body becomes &#8212; at last &#8212; still. His last gasp is a sigh. Naboth is dead &#8212; dead for cursing God and the king as many were led to believe!<br \/>\nAnd we learn from II Kings 9:26, that by the savage law of those days his innocent sons were involved in his overthrow. They, too, that they might not claim the inheritance, were slain. And Naboth&#8217;s property, left without heirs, reverted to the crown.<br \/>\nThus it came to pass that in an orderly fashion, in the name of religion and in the name of the king, Naboth really fell, not by the king&#8217;s hand, but by the condemnation of his fellow citizens. Yes, the old-fashioned conservatism of Naboth was, in the judgment of many, sorely out of place in that &#8220;progressive&#8221; state of society. No doubt Naboth&#8217;s righteous austerity had made him extremely unpopular in many ways in &#8220;progressive Jezreel.&#8221; And since Jezebel carried out her purpose in a perfectly legal and orderly way and in a &#8220;&#8216;wonderfully&#8221; democratic manner, we see a fine picture of autocracy working by democratic methods. And when these &#8220;loyally patriotic citizens&#8221; of Jezreel had left the bodies of Naboth and his sons to be devoured by the wild dogs which prowled after nightfall in and around the city, they sent and told Queen Jezebel that her orders had been bloodily and completely obeyed! &#8220;Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead&#8221; (I Kings 21:14).<br \/>\nI do not know where Jezebel was when she received the news of Naboth&#8217;s death. Maybe she was out on the lawn watching the fountains splash. Maybe she was in the sun parlor, or somewhere listening to the musicians thrum on their instruments. But, if I judge this painted human viper by her nature, I say she received the tragic news with devilish delight, with jubilant merriment. What was it to her that yonder, over twenty miles away, sat a little woman who the night before had her husband but who now washed his crushed and ghastly face with her tears? What did it matter to her that in Jezreel only yesterday her sons ran to her at her call hut today were mangled in death? What did it matter to her that outside the city walls the dogs licked the blood of a godly husband? What mattered it to her that Jehovah God has been defied, His commandments broken, His altars splattered with pagan mud, His holy Name profaned? What mattered it to her that the worship of God had been dishonored? What did she care if a wife, tragically widowed by murder, walked life&#8217;s way in loneliness? What did she care that there was lamentation and grief and great mourning, &#8220;Rachel weeping for her children because they were not&#8221;? What did she care if justice had been outraged just so she had gotten the little plot of land close by their palace, within which was evil girt with diadem? Nothing! Did pang grip her heart because innocent blood had been shed? Just as well ask if the ravenous lion mourns over the lamb it devours.<br \/>\nTrippingly, as a gay dancer, she hurried to where Ahab sat. With profuse caresses and words glib with joy she told him the &#8220;good&#8221; news. She had about her the triumphant manner of one who has accomplished successfully what others had not dared attempt. Her &#8220;tryout&#8221; in getting the vineyard was a decided &#8220;triumph.&#8221; She had &#8220;pulled the stunt.&#8221; She had been &#8220;brave&#8221; and &#8220;wise&#8221; &#8212; and because of this her husband now could arise and hie him down to the vineyard and call it his own.<br \/>\nIn her words and manner there was jubilant elation bordering on the satanic. &#8220;Arise!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Get thee down and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth. I told thee I would get his vineyard for thee. And I got for nothing what thou wast going to give a better vineyard for!&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which be refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead (I Kings 21:15).<br \/>\nIt was the plot hatched in her own mind and it was her hand, her lily-white hand, her queen&#8217;s hand, that wrote the letters that made this tragic statement true.<br \/>\nThe next scene in this tragedy of &#8220;Payday Someday&#8221; is:<br \/>\nTHE VISIT TO THE VINEYARD<br \/>\n&#8220;Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard.&#8221;<br \/>\nHow Jezebel must have paraded with pride before Ahab when she went with tidings that the vineyard which he wanted to buy was now his for nothing! How keen must have been the sarcasm of her attitude when she made it known by word and manner that she had succeeded where he failed &#8212; and at less cost! How gloatingly victorious were the remarks which she made which kept him warmly reminded that she had kept her &#8220;sacred&#8221; promise! What a lovely fabric, stained and dyed red with Naboth&#8217;s blood, she spread before him for his &#8220;comfort&#8221; from the loom of her evil machinations!<br \/>\n&#8220;And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it&#8221; (I Kings 21:16). Ahab rose up to go down &#8212; from Samaria to Jezreel. He gave orders to his royal wardrobe keeper to get out his king&#8217;s clothes, because he had a little &#8220;business&#8221; trip to make to hook over some property that had come to him by the shrewdness of his wife in the real estate market!<br \/>\nYes, Naboth, the good man who &#8220;feared the lord,&#8221; is dead; and Ahab expresses no condemnation of this awful conspiracy, culminating in such a tragic horror. Though afraid or restrained by his conscience from committing murder himself, he had no scruple in availing himself of the results of such crime when perpetrated by another. He flattered himself that, by the splendid genius of his queen in bloody matters, he, though having no part in the crime which did Naboth to death, might, as well as another, &#8220;receive the benefit of his dying.&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd you will notice just here that not one noble or elder had divulged the terrible secret which had given the semblance of legality to atrocious villainy. And, Ahab, rejoicing in the bloody garment woven on the loom of his wife&#8217;s evil machinations, gave orders to those in charge of livery stables to get ready his royal chariot for an unexpected trip. Jehu and Bidkar, the royal charioteers, make ready the great horses such as kings had in those days. Jehu was the speed-breaking driver of his day, known as the one who drove furiously. The gilded chariot is drawn forth. The fiery horses are harnessed and to the king&#8217;s chariot hitched. The outriders, in gorgeous garments dressed, saddle their horses and make ready to accompany the king in something of military state. Then, amid the chatter of prancing hoofs and the loud breathing of the chariot horses &#8212; eager-eyes, alert, strong-muscled, bellows-lunged, stouthearted, and agile of feet &#8212; Jehu drives the horses and the chariot up to the palace steps. Out from the palace doors, with Jezebel walking, almost strutting, proudly and gaily at his side, comes Ahab. Down the steps he goes while Jezebel, perhaps, waves a bejeweled hand to him or speaks a &#8220;sweet&#8221; good-by. Bidkar opens the chariot door. Ahab steps in. Then, with the crack of his whip or a sharp command by word of mouth, Jehu sends the great horses on their way &#8212; away from the palace steps, away from the palace grounds, away through the gates, away, accompanied by the outriders, away down the road to Jezreel!<br \/>\nWhere is God? Where is God? ls He blind that He cannot see? Is He deaf that He cannot hear? Is He dumb that He cannot speak? Is He paralyzed that He cannot move? Where is God? Well, wait a minute, and we shall see.<br \/>\nOver there in the palace Jezebel said to Ahab her husband:<br \/>\n&#8220;Arise! Get thee down and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth.&#8221; And over in the wilderness way, out where the tall cedars waved against the moon like green plumes against a silver shield, out where the only music of the night was the weird call of whippoorwill and the cough of coyote and the howl of wolf, out there God had an eagle-eyed, hairy, stout-hearted prophet, a great physical and spiritual athlete, Elijah. &#8220;And the Word of the Lord came to Elijah.&#8221; And God said to Elijah: &#8220;Arise, go down.&#8221;<br \/>\nOver here, in the palace, Jezebel said to Ahab: &#8220;Arise, get thee down!&#8221; And out there, near Carmel, God said to Elijah: &#8220;Arise!&#8221; I am so glad that I live in a universe where, when the Devil has his Ahab to whom he can say, &#8220;Arise,&#8221; God has His Elijah to whom He can say, &#8220;Arise!&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither be is gone down to possess it. And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine (I Kings 21:17-19).<br \/>\nAs Ahab goes down to Jezreel, the voice of Jehu, as he restrains the fiery horses, or the lash of his whip as he urges them on, attracts the attention of the grazing cattle in adjacent pasture hand. The sound of clanking hoofs of cantering horses resounds in every glen by the roadway. The gilded chariot catches the light of the sun and reflects it brightly, but he who rides therein is unmindful of the bloodstains on the ground where Naboth died. Dust clouds arise from the chariot&#8217;s wheels and wild winds blow them across the fields where the plowman or the reaper wonders who goes so swiftly along the highway. The neighing steeds announce to all that Ahab&#8217;s royal horses tire not in Carrying him down from Samaria to Jezreel. And soon many know that the chariot carried the king who was going down to possess what had reverted to the crown, even the vineyard of Naboth, which Naboth refused to sell to him. Would the &#8220;game&#8221; be worth the &#8220;candle&#8221;? Would Ahab learn that sin buys pleasure at the price of peace? We shall see &#8212; and that right soon!<br \/>\nAnd that brings us to the other scene in his tragedy of &#8220;Payday Someday.&#8221; It is:<br \/>\nTHE ALARMING APPEARANCE<br \/>\n&#8220;The word of the Lord came to Elijah.&#8221;<br \/>\nThe journey of twenty-odd miles from Samaria to Jezreel is over. Jehu brings the horses to a stop outside the gate to the vineyard. The horses stretch their necks trying to get slack on the reins. They have stood well the furious pace at which they have been driven. Around the rim of their harness is the foam of their sweat. On their flanks are, perhaps, the marks of Jehu&#8217;s whip. They breathe as though their great lungs were a tireless bellows. The outriders line up in something of military formation. The hands of ready servants open the gate to the vineyard. Bidkar opens the chariot door. And Ahab steps out into Naboth&#8217;s vineyard. There, no doubt, he sees, in the soft soil, Naboth&#8217;s footprints. Close by, doubtless, the smaller footprints of his wife he sees. Naboth is dead, and the coveted vineyard is now Ahab&#8217;s through the &#8220;gentle scheming&#8221; of the queen of his house. Perhaps Ahab, as he walks into the vineyard, sees Naboth&#8217;s pruning hook among the vines. Or he notices the fine trellis work which Naboth&#8217;s hands had fastened together for the growing vines. Perhaps, in a corner of the vineyard is a seat where Naboth and his sons rested after the day&#8217;s toil, or a well where sparkling waters refreshed the thirsty or furnished water for the vines in time of drought.<br \/>\nAhab walks around his newly-gotten vineyard. The rows of vines glisten in the sunlight. Maybe a breeze moves the leaves on the vines. Ahab admires trellis and cluster. As he walks, he plans how he will have the royal gardener to pull up those vines and plant cucumbers, squash, garlic, onions, cabbage and other vegetables that he may have his &#8220;garden of herbs.&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd while Ahab strolls among the vines that Naboth tended, what is it that appears? Snarling wild boasts? No. Black clouds full of threatening storm? No, not that. Flaming lightning which dazzles him? No. War chariots of his ancient enemies rumbling along the road? No. An oncoming flood sweeping things before it? No; not a flood. A tornado goring the earth? No. A huge serpent threatening to encircle him and crush his bones in its deadly coils? No; not a serpent. What then? What alarmed Ahab so? let us follow him and see.<br \/>\n&#8220;Ahab thought Elijah had been cowed and silenced by Jezebel, but now the prophet confronts him with his death warrant from the Lord God Almighty.&#8221;<br \/>\nAs Ahab goes walking through the rows of vines, he begins to plan how he will have that vineyard arranged by his royal gardener, how flowers will be here and vegetables yonder and herbs there. As he converses with himself, suddenly a shadow falls across his path. Quick as a flash Ahab whirls on his heels, and there, before him, stands Elijah, prophet of the living God. Elijah&#8217;s cheeks are swarthy; his eye is keen and piercing; like coals of fire, his eyes burn with righteous indignation in their sockets; his bosom heaves; his head is held high. His only weapon is a staff: his only robe a sheepskin, and a leather girdle about his loins. Like an apparition from the other world, like Banquo&#8217;s ghost at Macbeth&#8217;s feast, Elijah, with suddenness terrifying, stands before Ahab. Ahab had not seen Elijah for five years. Ahab thought Elijah had been cowed and silenced by Jezebel, but now the prophet confronts him with his death warrant from the Lord God Almighty.<br \/>\nTo Ahab there is an eternity of agony in the few moments they stand thus, face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul! His voice is hoarse, like the cry of a hunted animal. He trembles like a hunted stag before the mouths of fierce hounds. Suddenly his face goes white. His lips quiver. He had gone to take possession of a vineyard, coveted for a garden of herbs; and there he is face to face with righteousness, face to face with honor, face to face with judgment. The vineyard, with the sun shining upon it now, is as black as if it were part of the midnight which has gathered in judgment. Like Poe &#8216;s raven &#8220;his soul from out that shadow shall be&#8221; lifted &#8212; nevermore.<br \/>\n&#8220;And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?&#8221; (I Kings 21:20) and Elijah, without a tremor in his voice, his eyes burning their way into Ahab&#8217;s guilty soul, answered: &#8220;I have found thee: because thou has sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord.&#8221; Then, with every word a thunderbolt, and every sentence a withering denunciation, Elijah continued:<br \/>\nHast thou killed, and also taken possession? . . . Thus saith the Lord, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine . . . Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity . . . And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin! (I Kings 21:l9, 21,22).<br \/>\nAnd then, plying other words mercilessly like a terrible scourge to the Cringing Ahab, Elijah said:<br \/>\nAnd of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat: and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat (I Kings 21:23,24).<br \/>\nAnd, with these words, making Ahab to cower as one cowers and recoils from a hissing adder, finding Naboth&#8217;s vineyard to be haunted with ghosts and the clusters thereof to be full of blood, Elijah went his way &#8212; as was his custom so suddenly to appear and so quickly to disappear.<br \/>\nAhab had sold himself for nought, as did Achan for a burial robe and a useless ingot, as did Judas for thirty pieces of silver which so burned his palms and so burned his conscience and so burned his soul that he found relief in the noose at the rope&#8217;s end. And when Ahab got back in the chariot to go back to Jezebel &#8212; the vile toad who squatted upon the throne to be again with the beautiful adder coiled upon the throne &#8212; the hoofs of the horses pounding the road pounded into his guilty soul Elijah&#8217;s words: &#8220;Someday &#8212; the dogs will lick thy blood! Someday the dogs will eat Jezebel by the ramparts of Jezreel.&#8221; God had spoken! Would it come to pass?<br \/>\nAnd now we come to the last scene in this tragedy, &#8220;Payday Someday.&#8221; It is:<br \/>\nPAYDAY ITSELF<br \/>\nDid God mean what He said? Or was He playing a prank on royalty? Did payday come? &#8220;Pay Day &#8212; Someday&#8221; is written in the constitution of God&#8217;s universe. The retributive providence of God is a reality as certainly as the laws of gravitation are a reality.<br \/>\nAnd to Ahab and Jezebel, payday came as certainly as night follows day, because sin carries in itself the seed of its own fatal penalty.<br \/>\nDr. Meyer says: &#8220;According to God&#8217;s constitution of the world, the wrongdoer will be abundantly punished.&#8221; The fathers sow the wind and the children reap the whirlwind. One generation labors to scatter tares, and the next generation reaps tares and retribution immeasurable. To the individual who goes not the direction God points, a terrible pay-day comes. To the nation which forgets God, payday will come in the awful realization of the truth that the &#8220;nations which forget God shall be turned into hell.&#8221; When nations trample on the principles of the Almighty, the result is that the world is beaten with many stripes. We have seen nations slide into Gehenna &#8212; and the smoke of their torment has gone up before our eyes day and night.<br \/>\n&#8220;&#8216;Ichabod&#8217; will be written about the church that soft-pedals on unpleasant truth or that stands not unwaveringly for &#8216;the faith once delivered.'&#8221;<br \/>\nTo the home that has no room for the Christ, death and grave clothes are certain. &#8220;Ichabod&#8221; will be written about the church that soft-pedals on unpleasant truth or that stands not unwaveringly for &#8220;the faith once delivered&#8221; &#8212; and it will acknowledge its retribution in that it will become &#8220;a drifting sepulcher manned by a frozen crew.&#8221;<br \/>\nA man can prostitute God&#8217;s holy Name to profane lips if he will, but he is forewarned as to the pay-day in the words: &#8220;The lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain (Ex. 20:7).<br \/>\nA man can, if he will, follow the way of some wicked woman; but God leaves him not without warning as to the payday, in the words:<br \/>\nHe goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life . . . For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her. Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death (Prov. 7:22,23, 26, 27).<br \/>\nPeople can drink booze, if they will, and offer the damnable bottle to others, if they will, but the certainty of &#8220;Payday Someday&#8221; is read in the words: No drunkard &#8220;shall inherit the kingdom of God,&#8221; (I Cor 6:10) and in the words: &#8220;At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.&#8221; (Prov. 23:32). The certainty of &#8220;Payday Someday&#8221; for all who regard not God or man is set forth in the words of an unknown poet:<br \/>\nYou&#8217;ll pay. The knowledge of your acts will weigh<br \/>\nHeavier on your mind each day.<br \/>\nThe more you climb, the more you gain,<br \/>\nThe more you&#8217;ll feel the nagging strain.<br \/>\nSuccess will cower at the threat<br \/>\nOf retribution. Fear will fret<br \/>\nYour peace and bleed you for the debt;<br \/>\nConscience collects from every crook<br \/>\nMore than the worth of what he took,<br \/>\nYou only thought you got away<br \/>\nBut in the night you&#8217;ll pay and pay.<br \/>\nChurchill expressed the certainty of God&#8217;s retributive justice when, speaking of Mussolini, he said.<br \/>\nMussolini is swept into the maelstrom of his own making. The flames of war he kindled burn himself. He and his people are taking the stinging lash of the whip they applied to Ethiopia and Albania. They pay for Fascist sins with defeat, despair, death. Mussolini&#8217;s promise of life like a lion turns into the existence of a beaten cur!<br \/>\nYears before the statesman, Winston Churchill, spoke these words, Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his Compensation wrote:<br \/>\nCrime and punishment grow out of one stem. Punishment is a fruit that unsuspected ripens within the flower of the pleasure that concealed it. Cause and effect, means and ends, seed and fruit, can rot be severed, for the effect already blooms in the cause. The end pre-exists in the means &#8212; the fruit in the seed.<br \/>\nPaul Lawrence Dunbar showed wisdom as great as the wisdom of Churchill and a knowledge of Nature&#8217;s laws as great as Emerson&#8217;s knowledge when he wrote the autobiography of many individual sinners in these poetic and potent words:<br \/>\nThis is the price I pay &#8212;<br \/>\nJust for one riotous day &#8212;<br \/>\nYears of regret and of grief,<br \/>\nAnd sorrow without relief.<br \/>\nSuffer it I will, my friend,<br \/>\nSuffer it until the end,<br \/>\nUntil the grave shall give relief.<br \/>\nSmall was the thing I bought,<br \/>\nSmall was the thing at best,<br \/>\nSmall was the debt, I thought,<br \/>\nBut, O God! &#8212; the interest.<br \/>\nAll these statements are but verification of Bible truth:<br \/>\nWhoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him (Prov. 26:27).<br \/>\nTherefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them (Prov. 1:31,32).<br \/>\nEven as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same (Job 4:8).<br \/>\nFor they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind (Hos. 8:7).<br \/>\nThe gods are just &#8212; and of our vices make instruments to scourge us.<br \/>\n[BaptistFire editor&#8217;s note: this last quote is obviously a literary reference, but one in which we are unfamiliar. If any of our kind readers know the source of this reference we would appreciate an e-mail .]<br \/>\nWhen I was pastor of the First Baptist Church of New Orleans, all that I preached and taught was sent out over the radio. In my &#8220;fan mail&#8221; I received letters from a young man who called himself &#8216;&#8221;Chief of the Kangaroo Court.&#8221; Many nasty, critical things he said. Sometimes he wrote a nice line&#8211;and a nice line was, in all the vulgar things he wrote, like a gardenia in a garbage can. One day I received a telephone call from a nurse in the Charity Hospital of New Orleans. It was about this fellow who so often dipped his pen in slop, who seldom thrust his pen into nectar. She said: &#8220;Pastor, there is a young man down here whose name we do not know, who will not tell us his name. All he will tell us is that he is chief of the Kangaroo Court. He is going to die. He says that you are the only preacher in New Orleans that he has ever heard &#8212; and he has never seen you.<br \/>\nHe wants to see you. Will you come down?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; I replied. And I quit what I was doing and hurried down to the hospital.<br \/>\nThe young nurse met me at the entrance to the charity ward and took me in. A glance around showed me cots on the north side, cots on the south side, beds on the east side and beds on the west side &#8211; and clusters of cots in the center of the huge ward. In a place by itself, somewhat removed from all other cots and beds, was a bed on which lay a young man about nineteen or twenty years of age &#8212; big of frame, though the ravages of disease had brought a slenderness. The nurse, with little ado, introduced me to the young man, saying: &#8220;This, sir, is the Chief of the Kangaroo Court.&#8221;<br \/>\nI found myself looking into two of the wildest, weirdest eves I have ever seen. As kindly as I could, I spoke, saying &#8220;Hello.&#8221; &#8220;Howdy do?&#8221; he answered in a voice that was a discourteous and furious snarl &#8212; more like the voice of a mad wolf than the voice of a rational man. &#8216;&#8221;Is there something I can do for you?&#8221; I asked as kindly as I could speak.<br \/>\n&#8220;No. Nothing! Not a thing. Nothin&#8217; &#8216;tall! &#8212; unless you throw my body to the buzzards when I am dead &#8212; if the buzzards will have it!&#8221; he said, with half a shout and with a sort of fierce resentment that made me wonder why he had ever sent for me.<br \/>\nThen his voice lost some of the snarl &#8212; and he spoke again. &#8220;I sent for you, sir, because I want you to tell these young fellows here something for me. I sent for you because I know you go up and down the land and talk to many young people. And I want you to tell &#8217;em, and tell &#8217;em every chance you get, that the Devil pays only in counterfeit money.&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;Oh! I wish I could tell all men and women and all boys and girls everywhere to believe the truth that Satan always pays in counterfeit money, that all his pearls are paste pearls, that the nectar he offers is poisoned through and through.&#8221;<br \/>\nOh! I wish I could tell all men and women and all boys and girls everywhere to believe the truth that Satan always pays in counterfeit money, that all his pearls are paste pearls, that the nectar he offers is poisoned through and through. Oh, that men would learn the truth and be warned by the truth that if they eat the Devil&#8217;s corn, he will choke them with the cob.<br \/>\nI stayed with this young man nearly two hours. Occasionally he spoke. There was a desperate earnestness in the young man&#8217;s voice as he looked at me with wild eyes where terror was enthroned. After while I saw those eyes become as though they were glass as he gazed at the ceiling above. I saw his huge lean chest heave like a bellows. I felt his hand clutch at mine as a drowning man would grab for a rope. I held his hand. I heard the raucous gurgle in his throat. Then he became quiet &#8212; like a forest when the cyclone is long gone.<br \/>\nWhen he died, the little nurse called me to her, excitedly. &#8220;Come here!&#8221; she called.<br \/>\n&#8220;What do you want, child?&#8221; I asked.<br \/>\n&#8220;I want to wash your hands!&#8221; She meant she wanted to wash my hands with a disinfectant. Then she added &#8212; with something of fright in her words, &#8220;It&#8217;s dangerous to touch him!&#8221;<br \/>\nThe Devil had paid the young man off in counterfeit money.<br \/>\nBut what about Ahab? Did payday come for him? Yes. Consider how. Three years went by. Ahab was still king. And I dare say that during those three years Jezebel had reminded him that they were eating herbs out of Naboth&#8217;s vineyard. I can hear her say something like this as they sat at the king&#8217;s table: &#8220;Ahab, help yourself to these herbs. I thought Elijah said the dogs were going to lick your blood. I guess his dogs lost their noses and lost the trail.&#8221;<br \/>\nBut I think that during those three years, Ahab never heard a dog bark that he did not jump.<br \/>\nOne day Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, visited Ahab. The Bible tells us what took place &#8212; what was said, what was done:<br \/>\nAnd the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses (I Kings 22:3,4).<br \/>\nSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead (I Kings 22:29).<br \/>\nAhab, after Jehoshaphat had promised to go with him, in his heart was afraid, and had sad forebodings, dreadful premonitions, horrible fears. Remembering the withering words of Elijah three years before, he disguised himself &#8212; put armor on his body and covered this armor with ordinary citizen&#8217;s clothes.<br \/>\nAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle (I Kings 22:30).<br \/>\nThe Syrian general had given orders to slay only the king of Israel &#8212; Ahab.<br \/>\nBut the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel (I Kings 22:31).<br \/>\nJehoshaphat was not injured, although he wore his royal clothes.<br \/>\nAnd it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him (I Kings 22:32,33).<br \/>\nWhile war steeds neighed and war chariots rumbled and shields clashed on shields and arrows whizzed and spears were thrown and swords were wielded, a death-carrying arrow, shot by an aimless and nameless archer, found the crack in Ahab&#8217;s armor.<br \/>\nAnd a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot . . . And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the Word of the Lord which He spake (I Kings 22:34, 35, 38).<br \/>\nThus we learn that no man can evade God&#8217;s laws with impunity. All of God&#8217;s laws are their own executioners. They have strange penalties annexed. Stolen waters are sweet. But every ounce of sweetness makes a pound of nausea. Nature keeps honks pitilessly. Man&#8217;s credit with her is good. But Nature collects. And there is no land to which you can flee and escape her bailiffs. Every day her bloodhounds track down the men and women who owe her.<br \/>\nBut what about Jezebel? Did her payday come? Yes &#8212; after twenty years. After Ahab&#8217;s death, after the dogs had licked his blood, she virtually ruled the kingdom. But I think that she went into the temple of Baal on occasions and prayed her god Baal to protect her from Elijah&#8217;s hounds.<br \/>\nElijah had been taken home to heaven without the touch of the deathdew upon his brow. Elisha had succeeded him.<br \/>\nAnd Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead: And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber; Then take the box of oil and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door and flee, and tarry not. So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead . And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain. And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel. And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel . . . And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijab: And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And be opened the door, and fled (II Kings 9:1- 7,9,10).<br \/>\nJehu was just the man for such an occasion &#8212; furious in his anger, rapid in his movements, unscrupulous, yet zealous to uphold the law of Moses.<br \/>\nThen Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication. And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saitb the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then they basted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king (II Kings 9:11-13).<br \/>\nMounting his chariot, commanding and taking with him a company of his most reliable soldiers, furiously did he drive nearly sixty miles to Jezreel.<br \/>\nSo Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram. And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace? So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again. Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziab king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jerreelite. And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many? And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah. And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in tlie portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the Lord laid this burden upon him; Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the Lord; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the Lord (II Kings 9:16-26).<br \/>\n&#8220;And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it.&#8221; Pause! Who is Jehu? He is the one who, twenty years before the events of this chapter from which we quote, rode down with Ahab to take Naboth&#8217;s vineyard, the one who throughout those twenty years never forgot those withering words of terrible denunciation which Elijah spoke. And who is Jezebel? Oh! The very same who wrote the letters and had Naboth put to death. And what is Jezreel? The place where Naboth had his vineyard and where Naboth died, his life pounded out by stones in the hands of ruffians. &#8220;And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.&#8221;<br \/>\nJust here I think of what the poet, Leslie Savage Clark, wrote:<br \/>\nFrom the palace casement she looked down,<br \/>\nQueenly, scornful, proud,<br \/>\nAnd watched with cold indifferent eyes<br \/>\nThe weary ragged crowd.<br \/>\nOf the wage of sin she never thought,<br \/>\nNor that a crown might fall &#8230;<br \/>\nNor did she note the hungry dogs<br \/>\nSkulking along the wall.<br \/>\nAnd as Jehu, the new king by the will and word of the lord, entered in at the gate, she asked: &#8220;Had Zimri peace who slew his master?&#8221; And Jehu lifted up his face to the window and said, &#8220;Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs. And he said, Throw her down&#8221; (II Kings 9:30-33).<br \/>\nThese men put their strong men&#8217;s fingers into her soft feminine flesh and picked her up, tired head and all, painted face and all, bejeweled fingers and all, silken skirts and all &#8212; and threw her down. Her body hit the street and burst open. Some of her blood splattered on the legs of Jehu&#8217;s horses, dishonoring them. Some of her blood splattered on the walls of the city, disgracing them.<br \/>\nAnd Jehu drove his horses and chariot over her. There she lies, twisting in death agony in the street. Her body is crushed by the chariot wheels. On her white bosom are the black crescent-shapes of horses&#8217; hoofs. She is hissing like an adder in the fire. Jehu drove away and left her there.<br \/>\nAnd when he was come in he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king&#8217;s daughter. And they went to bury her: hut they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands (II Kings 9:34, 35).<br \/>\nGod Almighty saw to it that the hungry dogs despised the brains that conceived the plot that took Naboth&#8217;s life. God Almighty saw to it that the mangy lean dogs of the back alleys despised the hands that wrote the plot that took Naboth&#8217;s life. God Almighty saw to it that the lousy dogs which ate carrion despised the feet that walked in Baal&#8217;s courts and then in Naboth&#8217;s vineyard.<br \/>\nThese soldiers of Jehu went back to Jehu and said: &#8220;We went to bury her, O king, but the dogs had eaten her!&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd Jehu replied:<br \/>\nThis is the word of the Lord, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel. And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel (II Kings 9:36, 37).<br \/>\nThus perished a female demon, the most infamous queen who ever wore a royal diadem.<br \/>\n&#8220;Payday Someday!&#8221; God said it &#8212; and it was done! Yes, and from this we learn the power and certainty of God in carrying out His own retributive providence, that men might know that His justice slumbereth not. Even though the mill of God grinds slowly, it grinds to powder.<br \/>\nYes, the judgments of God often have leaden heels and travel slowly. But they always have iron hands and crush completely.<br \/>\nAnd when I see Ahab fall in his chariot and when I see the dogs eating Jezebel by the walls of Jezreel, I say, as the Scripture saith: &#8220;O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments; then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea&#8221; (Isa. 48:18). And as I remember that the gains of ungodliness are weighted with the curse of God, I ask you: &#8220;&#8216;Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not?&#8221; (Isa. 55:2).<br \/>\nAnd the only way I know for any man or woman on earth to escape the sinner&#8217;s payday on earth and the sinner&#8217;s hell beyond &#8212; making sure of the Christian&#8217;s payday on earth and the Christian&#8217;s heaven beyond the Christian&#8217;s payday &#8212; is through Christ Jesus, who took the sinner&#8217;s place upon the Cross, becoming for all sinners all that God must judge, that sinners through faith in Christ Jesus might become all that God cannot judge.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Payday Someday By Dr. R.

And I know what exactly made it a beautiful event.<br \/>\n-God&#8217;s abundant mercy&amp;grace and.<br \/>\n-Your prayers. I can&#8217;t thank you enough!<br \/>\nThe whole thing was a wonderful affair. Of all the 1200 strong relative circle who were a part of the wedding celebrations, I was the only one who knew that Jesus Christ was Lord and saviour. Most of them heard of Him, and my faith in Him. A few thought I was crazy &#8211; a few thought I was a rebel child, someone who discarded his own religion\/culture\/tradition for a foreign one &#8211; a few felt I was some kind of a abnormal human being &#8211; and a few thought I should be just left alone. But regardless of all this Jesus inside me did win many a people&#8217;s hearts. Many commended that I was a great host. Many personally told me I was very well behaved, and carried with me all the while, great warmth and affection. Many felt really welcomed and enjoyed their stay. Many asked when was my big day. A few even asked me questions about my faith and were wanting to know if they could come to Church. And MANY asked me for prayers.<br \/>\nPraise Jesus for all that!<br \/>\nThe devil kept trouble shooting every now and then.<br \/>\n&#8211; First, we would suddenly run out of drinking water. But even before anyone realized, the vendor turns up with more than sufficient cans of fresh drinking water. I hadn&#8217;t even prayed!<br \/>\n-A seepage hole at the venue, begins to leak, causing the area to stink. The guests had come and it was causing terrible inconvenience. I began to pray, and in a matter of three minutes, the stewards who were around covered up the leaking area with carpets and sprayed up the entire place with fresheners. The job was very well done. It was fresh like never before.<br \/>\n-As per South Indian tradition, the wedding ceremony was a day long event, all at the venue. And it being a humid day, all were tired. Sometime late in the afternoon, the boy&#8217;s side asked for us to arrange for some tea&#8217;s(tea is a popular drink in south India). Now, the kitchen was closed as per the deal with the vendor, and the cooks were gone, as it was way beyond the lunch hour. This was crucial, as we being the girls side had to take care of all the arrangements. To get it from a restaurant outside meant another half hour. But suddenly out of no where someone had already arranged for a huge case of tea, hot and delicious. I just don&#8217;t know how and from where. I couldn&#8217;t thank God enough.<br \/>\n-The vendor charges were billed to exactly half the amount that we anticipated. And the arrangements were top class. Everyone simply loved it. It still beats me!<br \/>\nI sensed the Lord must have placed thousands of His angels all over the place to take care of the wedding arrangements. Just for my sake. Isn&#8217;t His LOVE amazing.

I\u2019ll read the chapter and then I will read a portion also from the 18th to the 19th chapter as the background might be clear in our minds. &#8220;And there was a man of Mount Ephraim whose name was Micah.&#8221; A little background if you please. There was a situation where the Amorites refused to allow the people of the tribe of Dan to any access to Jerusalem and they crowded them up into Mount Ephraim. It is a sad thing when the people of God allow the world to crowd them into an awkward position. So they were unable to get to Jerusalem and we find, out of this comes the problems that we are about to see.<\/p>\n<p>Judges 17:1- 18:6<\/p>\n<p>And there was a man of Mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.<br \/>\nAnd he said unto his mother, &#8220;The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.&#8221; And his mother said, &#8220;Blessed be thou of the Lord, my son.&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, &#8220;I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the Lord from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore I will restore it unto thee.&#8221;<br \/>\nYet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image; and they were in the house of Micah.<br \/>\nAnd the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.<br \/>\nIn those days, there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.<br \/>\nAnd there was a young man out of Bethlehem-Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.<br \/>\nAnd the man departed out of the city from Bethlehem-Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And he came to Mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.<br \/>\nAnd Micah said unto him, &#8220;Whence comest thou?&#8221; And he said unto him, &#8220;I am a Levite of Bethlehem-Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd Micah said unto him, &#8220;Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give the ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.&#8221; So the Levite went in.<br \/>\nAnd the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.<br \/>\nAnd Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.<br \/>\nThen said Micah, &#8220;Now know I that the Lord will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.<br \/>\nJudges 18:1<br \/>\nIn those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.<br \/>\nAnd the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, &#8220;Go, search the land&#8221;; who when they came to Mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.<br \/>\nWhen they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned in thither, and said unto him, &#8220;Who brought thee hither? And what makest thou in this place? And what hast thou here?&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd he said unto them, &#8220;Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd they said unto him, &#8220;Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd the priest said unto them, &#8220;Go in peace; before the Lord is your way wherein ye go.&#8221;<br \/>\nJudges 18:14<\/p>\n<p>Then the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, &#8220;Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what ye have to do.&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man, the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.<br \/>\nAnd the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.<br \/>\nAnd the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.<br \/>\nAnd these went into Micah\u2019s house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, &#8220;What do ye?&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd they said unto him, &#8220;Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest; is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd the priest\u2019s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.<br \/>\nSo they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.<\/p>\n<p>Well, there\u2019s the story. This isn\u2019t part of the actual history of the Judges, this is a gathering together of some accounts that enable us to see the social condition in that period when every man did as seemed right in his own eyes and there was no king in Israel. So we understand that Micah was unable to get to Jerusalem and perhaps for some kind of devote reason he decided he would build a replica of the temple on his own property. He built what he thought would be an appropriate building and he made the instruments of the tabernacle, for these are part of the furnishings : The ephod, included among them, but then he also gathered some of the things from the people around him; the teraphim, the images which God had forbidden.<\/p>\n<p>But you see, nevertheless, there was a desire to get along as best he could. So he took a little bit of the world and a little bit of Israel, that which had been revealed by God, and he sort of mixed them up, until he had something that he thought might please the Lord. Then of course he was delighted beyond words when a wandering young preacher came along from Bethlehem, Judah. He was a Levite, his mother was of the tribe of Judah. Though he himself was a Levite, God had given permission through Moses that the Levites might marry into other tribes and they might join themselves to other tribes.<\/p>\n<p>So this young man didn\u2019t like the living, and every Levite was provided for, but he had wanderlust and an itching foot and so he started off to see if he couldn\u2019t do better for himself that was being done. He felt that being a Levite was good, but there should be opportunities associated with it, and so he came to the house of Micah. There he waited and there he was invited in and asked to become the priest. And Micah made a deal with him. He said, &#8220;If you\u2019ll be my priest, be my father and priest, then I\u2019ll give you ten shekels and a shirt&#8221; It says a &#8220;suit&#8221;, but you understand that the people of the day wore what would be called a gelavia, a long sort of an outsize, well I was going to say a nightgown, I don\u2019t know if that is exactly what it is but it is appropriate at least, something like that. And he gave him a suit of clothes or a change of apparel and his food and ten shekels a year.<\/p>\n<p>This was pretty good living for him and so he decided that he would stay there and enter into the mixture of idolatry and so on that was in the house of Micah. But the people of Dan came along, they were suppose to have driven out the Amorites, but the Amorites were too difficult, and they wanted to find someone that was a little easier to get out. And they came to, as you\u2019ve read, to Micah\u2019s house and the Levite told them to go ahead. Then you find that they discovered that there were people after the manner of the Zidonians at Laish. They were peaceful and no one was there to protect them, and so they figure this would be a very good place to take some land for themselves. When they came with the men that were sent to conquer this area they figured that since they found the land through the young Levite, it would be splendid to have his assistance.<\/p>\n<p>And so they went into the house of Micah, took all the things that he had made and it cost a good bit of money, because at least two hundred shekels had been given for this one piece of furniture. And so they just took it all, made it theirs and took the Levite. Rather hard on Micah, but you\u2019ll notice the young Levite was able to adjust himself to this. It was amazing how flexible he was and how easily he could accommodate himself to such changes when there was a little rationalization along the way &#8211; As soon as he could begin to see that it was far more important to serve a tribe than one man\u2019s family. And he could minister to so many more, why he could see the wisdom of this and he could justify it. With no real strain of conscious he could make the adjustment, hold his hand over his mouth while they took the furniture out of the little chapel that Micah had built. But he was a wise man nonetheless, rather than go along at the front which put him in a place of danger or at the rear which put him in a place of danger, I say he was a wise man, he put himself right in the middle. So that if Micah had sent any of his servants to get him he was safe with soldiers on every side.<\/p>\n<p>What can we call this and how will it apply to our days generation? Would I be out of line if I were to talk to you for a little while about utilitarian religion and expedient Christianity? And a youthful God? I would like to call attention to the fact that our day is a day which the ruling philosophy is pragmatism. You understand what I mean by pragmatism. Pragmatism means if it works it\u2019s true &#8211; if is succeeds it\u2019s good. And the test of all practices, all principles, all truth, so called all teaching, is do they work? Do they work? Now &#8211; according to pragmatism, the greatest failures of the ages have been some of the men God has honored most.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, whereas Noah was a mighty good ship builder, his main occupation wasn\u2019t ship building, it was preaching. He was a terrible failure as a preacher. His wife and three children and their wives are all he had. Seven converts in 120 years you wouldn\u2019t call particularly effective. Most mission boards would have asked the missionaries to withdraw long before this. I say as a ship builder he did quite well, but as a preacher, he was a failure. And then we come down across the years to another man by the name of Jeremiah. He was a might effective preacher, but ineffective as far as results were concerned. If you were to measure statistically how successful Jeremiah was, he would probably get a large cipher. For we find that he lost out with the people, he lost out with royalty, even the ministerial association voted against him and wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him. He had everything fail. The only one he seemed able to please was God\u2026\u2026but otherwise he was a distinct failure. And then we come to another well known person, the Lord Jesus Christ, who was a failure from judging all the standards. He never succeeded in organizing a church or denomination. He wasn\u2019t able to build a school. He didn\u2019t succeed in getting a mission board established. He never had a book printed. He never was able to get any of the various criteria or instruments that we find and are so useful; I\u2019m not being sarcastic at all, they are useful. And our Lord preached for three years, healed thousands of people, fed thousands of people, and yet when it was all over there were 120\u2026.500 to whom he could have revealed Himself after His resurrection. And the day that He was taken, one man said, &#8220;If all the others forsake you, I\u2019m willing to die for you.&#8221; He looked at this one and said, &#8220;Peter, you don\u2019t know your own heart. You\u2019re going to deny me three times before the cock crows this morning.&#8221; So all men forsook Him and fled. By every standard of our generation or any generation, our Lord was a single failure.<\/p>\n<p>The question comes then to this, what is the standard of success and by what are we going to judge our lives and our ministry? And the question that you are going to ask yourself, &#8220;Is God an end or is He a means?&#8221; And you have to decide very early in your Christian life whether you\u2019re viewing God as an end or a means. Our generation is prepared to honor with single honor anyone that\u2019s successful regardless of whether they settled this problem or not. As long as they can get things done or get the job done, or, &#8220;It\u2019s working, isn\u2019t it?&#8221;, then our generation is prepared to say, &#8220;Well, you\u2019ve got to reckon with this.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And so we\u2019ve got to ask ourselves at the very outset of our ministry, and our pilgrimage, and our walk, &#8220;Are we going to be Levites who serve God for ten shekels and a shirt?&#8221; Serve men perhaps in the name of God, rather than God. For though he was a Levite and performed religious activities, he was looking for a place. A place which would give him recognition, a place which would give him acceptance, a place which would give him security, a place where he could shine in terms of those values which were important to him. His whole business was serving in religious activities so it had to be a religious job. He was very happy when he found that Micah had an opening. But he had decided that he was worth ten shekels and a shirt, and he was prepared to sell himself to anyone that would give that much. If somebody came along and gave more, he would sell himself to them. But he put a value upon himself and he figured his religious service and his activities were just a means to an end and by the same token God was a means to an end.<\/p>\n<p>Now in order to understand the implications of that in the twentieth century, we\u2019ve got to go back 150, 100 years at least, to a conflict that attacked Christianity. Just after the great revivals in America with Finney, the Spirit of God having been marvelously outpoured onto certain portions of our country, there came an open attack on our faith in Europe under the higher critics. Darwin had postulated his theory of evolution; certain philosophers had adapted it to their philosophies, and theologians had applied it to the Scripture. And so about 1850, you could mark the opening of a frontal attack upon the Word of God. Satan had always been insidiously attacking it. But now it was open season on the Book, open season on the Church, and Voltaire could declare that he would live to see the Bible become a relic and just have it placed only in museums; that it would be utterly destroyed by the arguments that he was so forcefully presenting against it.<\/p>\n<p>Well, what was the effect of this? The philosophy of the day became humanism. And you could define humanism this way: Humanism is a philosophical statement that declares the end of all being is the happiness of man. The reason for existence is man\u2019s happiness. Now according to humanism, salvation is simply a matter of getting all the happiness you can, out of life. If you\u2019re influenced by someone like Nietzsche, who says that &#8220;The only true satisfaction in life is power and that the power is its own justification&#8221;, and that after all, the world is a jungle. And it is therefore up to the man to be happy, to become powerful, and become powerful by any means he can use. For it is only in this position of ascendancy or as we saw in the worship of Molech that one can be happy. This would produce in due course, a Hitler who would take the philosophy of Nietzsche as his working, operating, principles and guide, and would say of his people, that, &#8220;We are destined to rule the world.&#8221; Therefore any means that we can use to achieve this is our salvation.<\/p>\n<p>Somebody else turns around and says, &#8220;Well, no. The end of being is happiness, but happiness doesn\u2019t come from authority over people, happiness comes from sensual experience.&#8221; So you would have the type of existentialism that characterizes France today, that\u2019s given rise to beatnicism in America and to the gross sensuality of our country. Since man is essentially a glandular animal, whose highest moments of ecstasy come from the exercise of his glands, salvation is simply to find the most desirable way to gratify this part of a person. And so this became the effect of humanism, that the end of all being is the happiness of man. John Dewey, then an American philosopher influencing education, was able to persuade the educators that there were no absolute standards. Children shouldn\u2019t be brought to any particular standard, that the end of education was simply to allow the child to express himself and expand on what he is and find his happiness in being what he wants to be. So we had cultural lawlessness, when every man could do as seemed right in his own eyes and we had no God to rule over us. The Bible had been discounted and disallowed and disproved according to what they said. God had been dethroned &#8211; He didn\u2019t exist. He had no personal relationship to individuals. Jesus Christ was either a myth or just a man &#8211; so they taught, and therefore the whole end of being was happiness. The individual would establish the standards of his happiness and interpret it.<\/p>\n<p>Now religion then had to exist because there were so many people that made their living at it, so they had to find some way to justify their existence. So back about the time in 1850, the church divided into two groups. The one group was the liberals, who accepted the philosophy of the humanism and tried to find some relevance by saying something like this to their generation, &#8220;Ha, Ha\u2026.we don\u2019t know there\u2019s a heaven; we don\u2019t know there\u2019s a hell. But we do know this &#8211; that you\u2019ve got to live for 70 years! We know there\u2019s a great deal of benefit from poetry, from high thoughts and noble aspirations. Therefore it\u2019s important for you to come to church on Sunday, so that we can read some poetry, that we can give you some little adages and axioms and rules to live by. We can\u2019t say anything about what\u2019s going to happen when you die, but we\u2019ll tell you this, if you\u2019ll come every week and pay and help and stay with us, we\u2019ll put springs on your wagon and your trip will be more comfortable. We can\u2019t guarantee anything about what\u2019s going to happen when you die, but we say that if you come along with us, we\u2019ll make you happier while you\u2019re alive.&#8221; And so this became the essence of liberalism. It has simply nothing more than to try and put a little sugar in the bitter coffee of their journey and sweeten it up for a time. This is all that it could say.<\/p>\n<p>Well now, the philosophy of the atmosphere is humanism; the chief end of being is the happiness of man. There\u2019s another group of people that have taken hum bridge with the liberals; this group are my people, the fundamentalists. They say, &#8220;We believe in the inspiration of the Bible! We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ! We believe in hell! We believe in heaven! We believe in heaven!!! We believe in the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ!&#8221; But remember, the atmosphere is that of humanism. And humanism says the chief end of being is the happiness of man. Humanism is like a miasma out of a pit; it just permeates everyplace. Humanism is like an infection, an epidemic &#8211; it just goes everywhere. So it wasn\u2019t long until we had this, that the fundamentalists knew each other because they said, &#8220;We believe these things!&#8221; They were men for the most part that had met God. But you see, it wasn\u2019t long until having said, &#8220;These are the things that establish us as fundamentalists!&#8221; The second generation said, &#8220;This is how we become a fundamentalist! Believe the inspiration of the Bible! Believe in the deity of Christ! Believe in His death, burial, and resurrection! And thereby become a fundamentalist!&#8221; And so it wasn\u2019t long until it got to our generation, where the whole plan of salvation was to give intellectual assent to a few statements of doctrine. And a person was considered a Christian because he could say, &#8220;Ah hah&#8221; at four or five places that he was asked. If he knew where to say &#8220;Ah hah&#8221;, someone would pat him on the back, shake his hand, smile broadly, and say, &#8220;Brother, you\u2019re saved!&#8221; so it had gotten down to the place where salvation was nothing more than an assent to a scheme or a formula, and the end of this was that salvation was the happiness of man, because humanism has penetrated. If you were to analyze fundamentalism in contrast to liberalism of a hundred years ago, as it developed, for I am not pinpointing it in time, it would be like this: The liberal says the end of religion is to make man happy while he\u2019s alive, and the fundamentalist says the end of religion is to make man happy when he dies. But again! The end of all of the religion it was proclaimed was the happiness of man. And where as the liberal says, &#8220;By social change and political order we\u2019re going to do away with funds, we\u2019re going to do away with alcoholism and dope addiction and poverty. And we\u2019re going to make Heaven on earth and make you happy while you\u2019re alive! We don\u2019t know anything about after that, but we want you to be happy while you\u2019re alive!&#8221; They went ahead to try and do it only to be brought to a terrifying shock at the first World War and utterly staggered by the second World War, because they seemed to be getting no where fast.<\/p>\n<p>And then the fundamentalists, along the same line, are now tuning in along this same wavelength of humanism. Until we find it something like this: &#8220;Accept Jesus so you can go to heaven! You don\u2019t want to go to that old, filthy, nasty, burning hell, when there is a beautiful heaven up there! Now come to Jesus so you can go to heaven!&#8221; And the appeal could be as much to selfishness, as a couple of men sitting in a coffee shop, deciding they are going to rob a bank to get something for nothing! There\u2019s a way that you can give an invitation to sinners, that just sounds for all the world like a plot to take up a filling station proprietor\u2019s Saturday night earnings without working for them. Humanism is, I believe, the most deadly and disastrous of all the philosophical stenches that\u2019s crept up through the grating over the pit of Hell. It has penetrated so much of our religion. And it is in utter and total contrast with Christianity! Unfortunately, it\u2019s seldom seen. And here we find Micah, wants to have a little chapel, and he wants to have a priest, and he wants to have prayer, and he wants to have devotion, because, &#8220;I know the Lord will do me good!&#8221; AND THIS IS SELFISHNESS! AND THIS IS SIN! And the Levite comes along and falls right in with it! Because he wants a place! He wants ten shekels and a shirt and his food! And so in order that he can have what he wants, and Micah can have what they want, They sell out God! For ten shekels and a shirt! AND THIS IS THE BETRAYAL OF THE AGES! And it is the betrayal in which we live. And I don\u2019t see how God can revive it! Until we come back to Christianity. As in direct and total contrast with the stenchful humanism that\u2019s perpetrated in our generation in the name of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s become so subtle that it goes everywhere. What is it? In essence it\u2019s this! That this philosophical postulate that the end of all being is the happiness of man, has been sort of covered over with evangelical terms and Biblical doctrine until God reigns in heaven for the happiness of man, Jesus Christ was incarnate for the happiness of man, all the angels exist in the\u2026..Everything is for the happiness of man! And I submit to you that this is Unchristian! Isn\u2019t man happy? Didn\u2019t God intend to make man happy? Yes. But as a by-product, and not a prime-product.<\/p>\n<p>It was that good man that\u2019s so admired by the fuzzy thinkers of our day, out there in Africa, dear Dr. Schweitzer; bless his heart, he\u2019s a brilliant man. A philosopher, doctor, musician, composer &#8211; undoubtedly a brilliant man. But Dr. Schweitzer is no more Christian than this rose, and he would call it a personal insult if he were to say he was a Christian. He doesn\u2019t see Christ as having any relevance to his philosophy or life. Dr. Schweitzer is a humanist. Dr. Schweitzer was sitting on the bow of the boat going up the broad Congo river toward his station, watching the Belgian government officials with their high power rifles, shooting at the crocodiles sunning on the mud flats along the river. They were expert marksmen. They would use these dumb-dumb bullets that would explode inside the crocodile and just send them spinning up into the air, from the contraction of muscles. You say, &#8221; How do you know so much about it?&#8221; Well , to my shame, I was guilty of the same thing in the Nile. And they were there; this was what their sport was. They bagged them, and they kept count and they\u2019d put strings around the place where their gun was and have a little place for the gun and then they\u2019d tie knots so that they could see how many crocodiles they killed. A colossal waste of life! And it was there that Schweitzer saw the essence of his philosophy. And do you know what it is? Three words &#8211; Reverence for life\u2026.. Reverence for life. Crocodile life, human life, and other kinds of life. My friend, George Kline, who was with us last week and is going back to the Gabon, was just about 50 or 60 miles away from this Dr. Schweitzer\u2019s station. You know, Dr. Schweitzer is so convinced of reverence of life, that he doesn\u2019t like to sterilize his surgery. He has the dirtiest surgery in Africa, because bacteria are life and he doesn\u2019t want to hurt any of the good bacteria with the bad, so he just sort of, let\u2019s them all grow together. His organ broke. Someone had sent him an organ and the means of playing it. Mr. Kline is an expert organist and an organ repairer as well, so he went over to see Dr. Schweitzer, and Dr. Schweitzer said, &#8220;George, do you think you can fix my organ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I wouldn\u2019t be surprised &#8211; let me try it.&#8221; So he took the back off and to his amazement he discovered a huge nest of cockroaches. With characteristic, American enthusiasm and zeal, George started trampling all over the cockroaches not to let a one of them get away. And the good doctor came out &#8211; his hair standing straighter than it had for a long time, and because of his anger, he shouted, &#8220;You stop that right now!&#8221; &#8220;Why? They\u2019re ruining your organ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;That\u2019s alright, they were just being true to their nature, &#8220;he said, &#8220;You can\u2019t .&#8221; So one of the boys came in and said, &#8220;It\u2019s alright Mr. Kline.&#8221; And he reached down, very tenderly picked them up, and put them in a little bag, and crimped the top, and he put each cockroach in, and they took them out into the jungle and let them loose.<\/p>\n<p>Now here was a man that believed his philosophy, reverence for life. Utterly committed to it! Utterly consistent! Even when it came to the matter of cockroach or microbe. Do you see? This is humanism, this is consistency.<\/p>\n<p>Now I ask you; What is the Philosophy of Missions? What is the Philosophy of Evangelism? What is the Philosophy of a Christian? If you\u2019ll ask me why I went to Africa, I\u2019ll tell you I went primarily to improve on the justice of God. I didn\u2019t think it was right for anybody to go to Hell without a chance to be saved. So I went to give poor sinners a chance to go to heaven. Now I haven\u2019t put it in so many words, but if you\u2019ll analyze what I just told you , do you know what it is? Humanism. That I was simply using the provisions of Jesus Christ as a means to improve upon human conditions of suffering and misery. And when I went to Africa, I discovered that they weren\u2019t poor, ignorant, little heathen running around in the woods looking for someone to tell them how to go to heaven. That they were Monsters of Iniquity! They were living in utter and total defiance of far more knowledge of God than I ever dreamed they had! They deserved Hell! Because they utterly refused to walk in the light of their conscious, and the light of the law written upon their heart, and the testimony of nature, and the truth they knew! And when I found that out I assure you I was so angry with God that on one occasion in prayer I told Him it was a mighty little thing He\u2019d done &#8211; sending me out there to reach these people that were waiting to be told how to go to heaven. When I got there I found out they knew about heaven, and didn\u2019t want to go there, and that they loved their sin and wanted to stay in it.<\/p>\n<p>(Brother Paris speaks with great passion in this paragraph) I went out their motivated by humanism. I\u2019d seen pictures of lepers, I\u2019d seen pictures of ulcers, I\u2019d seen pictures of native funerals, and I didn\u2019t want my fellow human beings to suffer in Hell eternally after such a miserable existence on earth. But it was there in Africa that God began to tear through the overlay of this humanism! And it was that day in my bedroom with the door locked that I wrestled with God. For here was I, coming to grips with the fact that the people I thought were ignorant and wanted to know how to go to heaven and were saying, &#8220;Someone come and teach us!&#8221;, actually didn\u2019t want to take time to talk with me or anybody else. They had no interest in the Bible and no interest in Christ, and they love their sin and wanted to continue in it. And I was to that place, at that time, where I felt the whole thing was a shame and a mockery, and I had been sold a bill of goods! And I wanted to come home. There alone in my bedroom as I faced God honestly with what my heart felt, it seemed to me I heard Him say, &#8220;Yes, will not the Judge of all the earth do right? The heathen are lost, and they\u2019re going to go to Hell, not because they haven\u2019t heard the gospel. They\u2019re going to go to Hell because they are sinners, who love their sin! And because they deserve Hell. But\u2026\u2026I didn\u2019t send you out there for them. I didn\u2019t send you out there for their sakes.&#8221; And I heard clearly as I\u2019ve ever heard, though it wasn\u2019t with physical voice but it was the echo of truth of the ages, finding it\u2019s way into an open heart. I heard God say to my heart that day something like this, &#8220;I didn\u2019t send you to Africa for the sake of the heathen, I sent you to Africa for My Sake\u2026.They deserved Hell! But I love them! And I endured the agonies of Hell for them!!!! I didn\u2019t send you out there for them! I SENT YOU OUT THERE FOR ME\u2026 Do I not deserve the reward of my suffering? Don\u2019t I deserve those for who I died?&#8221; And it reversed it all!! And changed it all!! And righted it all!! And I wasn\u2019t any longer working for Micah and ten shekels and a shirt! But I was serving a living God! I was not there for the sake of the heathen. I was there for the Savior that endured the agonies of Hell for me, who didn\u2019t deserve it. But He deserved them, (the heathen). Because He died for them.<\/p>\n<p>Do you see? Let me epitomize, let me summarize. Christianity says, &#8220;The end of all being is the glory of God.&#8221; Humanism says, &#8220;The end of all being is the happiness of man.&#8221; And one was born in Hell, the deification of man; and the other was born in heaven, the glorification of God! And one is a Levite serving Micah, and the other is a heart that\u2019s unworthy serving the living God, because it\u2019s the highest honor in the universe.<\/p>\n<p>What about you? Why did you repent? I\u2019d like to see some people repent on Biblical terms again. George Whitefield knew it. He stood on Boston Commons speaking to twenty thousand people and he said, &#8220;Listen sinners &#8211; you\u2019re monsters &#8211; monsters of iniquity! You deserve Hell! And the worst of your crimes is that criminals though you\u2019ve been, you haven\u2019t had the good grace to see it!&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you will not weep for your sins and your crimes against a Holy God, George Whitefield will weep for you!&#8221; That man would put his head back and he would sob like a baby. Why? Because they were in danger of Hell? No! But because they were &#8220;monsters of iniquity&#8221;, that didn\u2019t even see their sin or care about their crimes. You see the difference? The difference is, here is somebody trembling because he is going to be hurt in Hell. And he has no sense of the enormity of his guilt! And no sense of the enormity of his crime! And no sense of his insult against Deity! He\u2019s only trembling because his skin is about to be singed! He\u2019s afraid and I submit to you that where as fear is good office work in preparing us for grace, it\u2019s no place to stop. And the Holy Ghost doesn\u2019t stop there. That\u2019s the reason why no one can savingly receive Christ until they\u2019ve repented. And no one can repent until they\u2019ve been convicted. And conviction is the work of the Holy Ghost that helps a sinner to see that he is a criminal before God and deserves all of God\u2019s wrath. And if God were to send him to the lowest corner of a devil\u2019s Hell forever and ten eternities, that he deserved it all! And a hundred fold more. Because he\u2019s seen his crimes.<\/p>\n<p>This is the difference between twentieth century preaching and the preaching of John Wesley. Wesley was a preacher of righteousness that exalted the holiness of God. When he would exalt the holiness of God, and the law of God, and the righteousness of God, and the justice of God, and the wisdom of His requirements! And the justice of his wrath and his anger! Then he would turn to sinners and tell them of the enormity of their crimes and their open rebellion and their treason, and their anarchy. And the power of God would so descend upon the company, that on one occasion it is reliably reported that when the people dispersed there were 1800 people lying on the ground, utterly unconscious! Because they had a revelation of the holiness of God and in the light of that they\u2019d seen the enormity of their sins and God had so penetrated their minds and hearts that they had fallen to the ground! It wasn\u2019t only in Wesley\u2019s day; it was also in America, New Haven, Connecticut, Yale. A man by t he name of John Wesley Redfield had continuous ministry for three years in and around New Haven. Culminating in the great meetings in Yale Ball, the first of the Yale Balls\u2019 back in the 18th century. The policeman were accustomed during those days, if they saw someone lying on the ground, to go up and smell his breath. Because if he had alcohol on his breath they\u2019d lock him up; but if he didn\u2019t, he had Redfield\u2019s disease. And all you needed to do if anyone had Redfield\u2019s disease was just take him into a quiet place and leave him until he came to. Because if they were drunkards, they\u2019d stop drinking, and if they were cruel, they\u2019d stop being cruel, and if they were immoral, they gave up their immorality. If they were thieves, they returned what they had. For as they had seen the holiness of God, and seen the enormity of their sin; the Spirit of God had driven them down into unconsciousness because of the weight of their guilt! And somehow in the overspreading of the power of God, sinners repented of their sin and came savingly to Christ.<\/p>\n<p>But there was a difference! It wasn\u2019t trying to convince a &#8220;good&#8221; man that he was in trouble with a &#8220;bad&#8221; God. But that it was to convince Bad men that they had deserved the wrath and anger of a Good God! And the consequences were repentance, that lead to faith, and lead to the life. Dear friends, there\u2019s only one reason &#8211; one reason for a sinner to repent: and that\u2019s because Jesus Christ deserves the worship and adoration and the love and the obedience of his heart. Not because he\u2019ll go to heaven. If the only reason you repented, dear friend, was to keep out of Hell, all you are is just a Levite serving for ten shekels and a shirt! That\u2019s all! You\u2019re trying to serve God because He\u2019ll do you good! But a repentant heart is a heart that has seen something of the enormity of the crime of playing god and denying the just an righteous God the worship and obedience that He deserves!<\/p>\n<p>Why should a sinner repent? Because God deserves the obedience and love that he\u2019s refused to give Him! Not so that he\u2019ll go to heaven. If the only reason he repents is so that he\u2019ll go to heaven, it\u2019s nothing but trying to make a deal or a bargain with God.<\/p>\n<p>Why should a sinner give up all his sins? Why should he be challenged to do it? Why should he make restitution when he\u2019s coming to Christ? Because God deserves the obedience that He demands!<\/p>\n<p>I have talked with people that have no assurance that sins are forgiven. They want to feel safe, before they\u2019re willing to commit themselves to Christ. But I believe that the only ones whom God actually witnesses by His Spirit and are born of Him, are the people, whether they say it or not, that come to Jesus Christ and say something like this, &#8220;Lord Jesus, I\u2019m going to obey you, and love you, and serve you, and do what you want me to do, as long as I live, even if I go to Hell at the end of the road, simply because you are worthy to be loved, and obeyed and served, and I\u2019m not trying to make a deal with you!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Do you see the difference? Do you see the difference? Between a Levite serving for ten shekels and a shirt or a Micah building a chapel because God will do you good, and someone that repents for the glory of God.<\/p>\n<p>Why should a person come to the cross? Why should a person embrace death with Christ? Why should a person be willing to go, in identification, down to the cross and into the tomb and up again? I\u2019ll tell you why &#8211; because it\u2019s the only way that God can get glory out of human being! If you say it\u2019s because he\u2019ll get joy or peace or blessing or success or fame then it\u2019s nothing but a Levite serving for ten shekels and a shirt. There is only one reason for you to go to the Cross, dear young person &#8211; and that\u2019s because until you come to the place of union with Christ in death, you are defrauding the Son of God of the glory that He could get out of your life. For no flesh shall glory in His sight. And until you\u2019ve understood the sanctifying work of God by the Holy Ghost taking you into union with Christ in death and burial and resurrection, you have to serve in what you have and all you have which is under the sentence of death: human personality, and human nature, and human strength, and human energy. And God will get no glory out of that! So the reason for you to go to the cross isn\u2019t that you\u2019re going to get victory &#8211; you will get victory. It isn\u2019t that you\u2019re going to have joy &#8211; you will have joy. But the reason for you to embrace the cross and press through until you know that you can testify with Paul, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ..&#8221; (Galatians 2:20) It isn\u2019t what you\u2019re going to get out of it, but what He\u2019ll get out of it, for the glory of God. By the same token, why aren\u2019t you pressed through to know the fullness of the Holy Spirit? Why aren\u2019t you pressed through to know the fullness of Christ? I\u2019ll tell you why &#8211; Because the only possible way that Jesus Christ will get glory out of a life that He\u2019s redeemed with His precious blood, is when He can fill that life with His presence and live through it his own life.<\/p>\n<p>The genius of our faith wasn\u2019t that we were going to go through the motions like a Levite that was hired to serve God. No, No! The genius of our faith was that we\u2019d come to a place where we knew we could do nothing, and all we could do would be to present the vessel and say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, you\u2019ll have to fill it. And everything that\u2019s done will have to be done by You and for You.&#8221; But oh, I know so many people that are trying to know the fullness of God, so that they can use God.<\/p>\n<p>A young preacher came to me down in Huntington, West Virginia. He said, &#8220;Brother Reidhead, I\u2019ve got a great church. I\u2019ve got a wonderful Sunday School program, go a radio ministry &#8211; growing. But I feel a personal need and a personal lack, I need to be baptized with the Holy Ghost, I need to be filled with the Spirit. And someone told me God had done something for you and I wonder if you could help me.&#8221; I looked at the fellow, and you know what he looked like? ME. Just looked like me. I just saw in him everything that was in me. You thought I was going to say &#8220;me before&#8221;. No. Listen dear heart; if you\u2019ve ever seen yourself you\u2019ll know you\u2019re never going to be anything else than you were. For in me and my flesh there\u2019s no good thing. (Romans 7:18) He looked like me.<\/p>\n<p>He was like a fellow driving up in a big Cadillac, you know, to someone standing at the filling station, saying &#8220;Fill her up, bub, with the highest octane you\u2019ve got!&#8221; Well, that\u2019s the way it looked. He wanted power for his program. God is not going to be a means to anyone\u2019s end. I said, &#8220;I\u2019m awfully sorry, I don\u2019t think that I can help you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, suppose you consider yourself coming up with a Cadillac. You\u2019ve talked about your program, you\u2019ve talked about your radio, you\u2019ve talked about your Sunday School and church. It\u2019s very good. You\u2019ve done wonderfully well without the power of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; That\u2019s what the Chinese Christian said, you know, when he got back to China. &#8220;What impressed you most about America?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The great things Americans can accomplish with out God.&#8221; And he, (the young preacher) accomplished a great deal, admittedly without god. Now he wanted something of power to accomplish his ends even further. I said, &#8220;No\u2026.no\u2026you\u2019re sitting behind the wheel and you\u2019re saying to God, &#8220;Give me power so I can go.&#8221; You won\u2019t work. You\u2019ve got to slide over.&#8221; But I knew the rascal, because I knew me. I said, &#8220;No, it will never do. You\u2019ve got to get in the back seat.&#8221; And I could see him leaning over and grabbing the wheel. &#8220;No,&#8221; I said, &#8220;it will never do in the back seat.&#8221; I said. &#8220;Before God will do anything for you, you know what you\u2019ve go to do?&#8221; So he said, &#8220;What?&#8221; I said, &#8220;You\u2019ve got to get out of the car, take the keys around, open up the trunk lid, hand the keys to the Lord Jesus, get inside the trunk, slam the lid down, whisper through the keyhole, &#8220;Lord &#8211; look. Fill her up with anything you want and you drive, it\u2019s up to you from now on.&#8221; That\u2019s why so many people you know, do not enter into the fullness of Christ. Because they want to become a Levite with ten shekels and a shirt. They\u2019ve been serving Micah, but they think if they had the power of the Holy Ghost they could serve the tribe of Dan.<\/p>\n<p>It will never work. Never work. There\u2019s only one reason for God needing you and that\u2019s to bring you to the place where, in repentance, you\u2019ve been pardoned for His glory. And in victory you\u2019ve been brought to the place of death that He might reign. And in the fullness, Jesus Christ is able to live and walk in you. Your attitude is the attitude of the Lord Himself, who said, &#8220;I can do nothing of Myself&#8221; (John 8:28) I can\u2019t speak of myself. I don\u2019t make plans for myself. My only reason for being is for the glory of God in Jesus Christ. If I were to say to you, &#8220;Come to be saved so you can go to Heaven, come to the Cross so that you can have joy and victory, come for the fullness of the Spirit so that you can be satisfied,&#8221; I would be falling into the trap of humanism. I\u2019m going to say to you dear friend, if you\u2019re out here without Christ, you come to Jesus Christ and serve Him as long as you live whether you go to Hell at the end of the way Because he is worthy!<\/p>\n<p>I say to you Christian friend, you come to the cross and join Him in union, in death, and enter into all the meaning of death to self in order that He can have glory. I say to you dear Christian, if you do not know the fullness of the Holy Ghost, come and present your body a living sacrifice, and let Him fill you, so that He can have the purpose for His coming fulfilled in you and get glory through your life. It\u2019s not what you\u2019re going to get out of God, it\u2019s what He is going to get out of you.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s be done, once for all, with utilitarian Christianity that makes God a means, instead of the glorious end that He is. Let\u2019s resign. Let\u2019s tell Micah we\u2019re through. We\u2019re no longer going to be his priests serving for ten shekels and a shirt. Let\u2019s tell the tribe of Dan we\u2019re through. And let\u2019s come and cast ourselves at the feet of the nail pierced Son of God and tell Him that we\u2019re going to obey Him, and love Him, and serve Him, as long as we live, because HE IS WORTHY!<\/p>\n<p>Two young Moravians heard of an island in the West Indies where an atheist British owner had 2000 to 3000 slaves. And the owner had said, &#8220;No preacher, no clergyman, will ever stay on this island. If he\u2019s shipwrecked we\u2019ll keep him in a separate house until he has to leave; but he\u2019s never going to talk to any of us about God. I\u2019m through with all that nonsense.&#8221; Three thousand salves from the jungles of Africa brought to an island in the Atlantic and there to live and die without hearing of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>Two young Moravians heard about it. They sold themselves to the British planter and used the money they received from their sale, for he paid no more than he would for any slave, to pay their passage out to his island for he wouldn\u2019t even transport them. As the ship left it\u2019s pier in the river at Hamburg and was going out into the North Sea, carried with the tide, the Moravians had come from Herrenhut to see these two lads off, in their early twenties. Never to return again, for this wasn\u2019t a four year term; they sold themselves into life-time slavery. Simply that as slaves, they could be a s Christians where these others were. The families were there weeping, for they knew they would never see them again. And they wondered why they were going and questioned the wisdom of it. As the gap widened and the housings had been cast off and were being curled up there on the pier, and the young boys saw the widening gap, one lad with his arm liked through the arm of his fellow, raised his hand and shouted across the gap the last words that were heard from them, they were these: &#8220;MAY THE LAMB THAT WAS SLAIN, RECEIVE THE REWARD OF HIS SUFFERING!&#8221; This became the call of Moravian missions. And this is the only reason for being, That the Lamb that was slain, may receive the reward of His suffering.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>attached is a very popular sermon. something that has been downloaded over 22000 times&#8230; the best I&#8217;ve read so far&#8230;lengthy but a must read! spread it like wild fire!

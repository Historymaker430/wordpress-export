She waited on Naaman\u2019s wife. 3 Then she said to her mistress, \u201cIf only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy.\u201d 4 And Naaman went in and told his master, saying, \u201cThus and thus said the girl who is from the land of Israel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>People, come in all shapes and sizes.\u00a0 People seem to split apart from one another by ethnicity, social status, language, occupation, etc\u2026.\u00a0 However I love to look at those that God chooses to carry out His will.\u00a0 The Scriptures states that God is no respecter of persons.\u00a0 Peter refused to reach out to the Gentiles at one point in his ministry.\u00a0 God therefore gave him a vision in Acts while he was up on a roof a great sheet came down of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.\u00a0 God said to Peter, \u201cKill and eat,\u201d but Peter replied, \u201cNo Lord.\u201d\u00a0 D. James Kennedy said, \u201cYou cannot say, \u2018No, Lord,\u2019 and mean both words; one annuls the other. If you say no to Him, then He is not your Lord.\u201d\u00a0 Peter eventually understood God\u2019s lesson to him, and submitted to God\u2019s will.\u00a0 This is why the Scriptures states, \u201cThen Peter opened his mouth and said:\u00a0 \u201cIn truth I perceive that God shows no partiality.\u00a0 Evans often shares, \u201cGod doesn\u2019t call the qualified, He qualifies the called.\u201d\u00a0 God can use whosoever he chooses, to reach whosoever He calls to repentance.<\/p>\n<p>In 2 Kings 5, God uses a slave girl to reach Naaman, Commander of the Syrian army and turn his heart toward the Lord.\u00a0 This girl was taken from Israel and saw the leprosy of her master, Naaman.\u00a0 She had compassion upon him and brought word to her mistress, \u201cIf only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria!\u00a0 For he would heal him of his leprosy.\u201d\u00a0 Naaman had a high profile job, he was extremely wealthy, popular, and was in the midst of war against the Arameans.\u00a0 As far as social status, the slave girl was far below Naaman.\u00a0 However God used her to reach Naaman.\u00a0 Naaman brings this news to the King of Syria, and the King sent a letter with Naaman to the King of Israel, and Naaman brought, \u201cten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothing,\u201d which was in the vicinity of three-quarters of a billion dollars (The IVP Bible background commentary : Old Testament).\u00a0 The girl told Naaman to go to the prophet, but Naaman first went to the King of Israel.\u00a0 The King tore his clothes saying, \u201cAm I God, to kill and make alive, that this man sends a man to me to heal him of his leprosy?\u201d\u00a0 Elisha hears what is going on, and tells the King to send Naaman in to him.\u00a0 Naaman is told by Elisha to go and wash in the Jordan River and bob up and down seven times.\u00a0 Naaman thought that this was the most ridiculous prescription for healing, considering the Jordan was forty miles away, to a river that was not known for being the cleanest of waters.\u00a0 Initially, pride began to rise in Naaman\u2019s heart as he disapproved of washing in the Jordan saying, \u201c12 Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?\u00a0 Naaman eventually humbled himself and made the trip to the Jordan River, dipped seven times, and his leprosy was healed.<br \/>\nIn the Scriptures, leprosy was a type of sin.\u00a0 Just as the young slave girl saw the problem, so we must see the (leprosy) sin in the lives of people, no matter who they are, and lay the weight of God\u2019s Law upon them that they too might humble themselves to be washed in the living water of Jesus Christ.\u00a0 Thank God for the slave girl who gave Naaman directions which brought him to humble himself before God.\u00a0 Will you be like the slave girl, and be an ordinary witness to the many you see daily who will die in their sin without the living water of Jesus Christ?<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phi &lt;&gt;&lt;<br \/>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u00a0\u201cAnd the Syrians had gone out on raids, and had brought back captive a young girl from the land of Israel.

In the beginning we looked how Jesus had fed five thousand men with bread and how when He began to speak to His disciples He was talking about Himself as the bread of life. Through the process of revealing who He was and defining who the disciples were was to get them ready for greater works. Read it for yourself and you will see the Pharisees and the Sadducees attacking Peter and John the same way they attacked Jesus. All hell was breaking loose but Peter and John we not moved &#8217;cause their identity did not come from any man but Christ. They knew who they were in Christ and that gave them the courage and boldness to respond to questions asked and be firm on what they believed.<\/p>\n<p>In the early verses of Acts we see Peter feeding about 5 thousand men with the BREAD OF LIFE (God&#8217;s word), sounds familiar, Christ fed 5 thousand men with natural bread.\u00a0 They are later asked by what means they were able to perform miracles with boldness, read Peter&#8217;s response in Acts 4:10, &#8220;Let it be known to you all, and all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man (people)) stands here before you whole, vs. 11 This is the stone which was rejected by your builders, which is become the chief cornerstone&#8221;.\u00a0 Amen!!! Christ is the stone that the builders rejected but praise to God He was and still the chief cornerstone and can no one change that fact. And being that He is the chief cornerstone of our lives, we are able to stand boldly like Peter and speak the truth, speak with confidence, face new situations and not be entangled by what we perceive or know about what we have been called. If you look at the life of Peter from the time he was defined to the time of him seeing these things happen, he faced many things and I believe people labeled him but that did not abort what Christ had defined him. Christ said, &#8220;Upon this Rock (Himself), He will build a church (Peter)&#8230; and now see it.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy to adjust your life to something new when you are used to being called something else, Paul&#8217;s tells us, &#8220;This is one thing I do, forgetting what is behind and pressing on for those things which are before, I press towards the mark of the high calling (definition) (paraphrased) Phi 3:13&amp;14. I was talking to a friend of mine who shared with me how when He was growing up, he was always told that he would never amount to anything and he has lived with that for many years and therefore he is afraid to make any moves for he believes he can never be good at anything. You may be feeling the same but He who has defined us has seen our future and with Him in control, let Him be the one to perfect it. You may not change people&#8217;s opinion about you but you can change to see yourself the way God does. He is the Potter and we are the clay. His hand is on the clay, making it the vessel He wants it to be. The devil&#8217;s is not the potter, thank God otherwise he would make us the instruments of unrighteousness. No one can define you like Him therefore choose to allow Him to be the one to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Math 16:5-20, &#8220;&#8230;thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it&#8221; Let&#8217;s conclude the series by looking at the book of Acts 4.

Our existence has everything to do with God. We&#8217;ve talked about Christ, the Bread of Life also we have touched on how is defining us that we may know who we are in Christ. Let&#8217;s see how Defines Peter, Vs 18, &#8220;And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&#8221;. This is a very powerful line Jesus uses to define Peter. The first thing, He mentions his name &#8220;You are Peter&#8221;, I wondered why He\u00a0 would start this way. Didn&#8217;t Peter know his name that he needed not to be reminded of it?\u00a0 Let&#8217;s take look at why I believe He began this way. I believe this was to show Peter that Christ knew him from the beginning and He had already defined Peter and therefore there was nothing changing in him but being perfected to be who Jesus had already started in his life. He sounded like the same Peter but He was not the same Peter. It was him but it wasn&#8217;t him and by this I mean, he did not know what had been invested in him. Jesus was beginning to stir up a potential birthed by the Holy Spirit that would redefine who he was, not according to the world but according to God. &#8220;Unless the Lord builds the house&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And upon this rock I will build my church&#8221;, what rock is Jesus referring to?, we know that Peter in the bible is another name for the rock but see something powerful out of this. Turn with me to the book of Psalm 18:46, &#8220;The Lord lives and blessed be my Rock, let the God of my salvation be exalted&#8221;. Jesus Christ is the Rock that Lives and I believe that what He was telling him was that upon me (Jesus) in you (Peter), I will build my church (build a minister, build an evangelist in other words make him a vessel to be used to reach many) for we opened with Psalm 127:1 that talks about the Lord building the house. He is the already laid foundation that our lives may be built upon\u00a0 1Cor 3:11, &#8220;For other foundation can no man lay other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221;. What a joy to know that I am not laying any foundations for Christ laid it on the cross when He died for my sins and that I am not building my life for His word says that unless He does it, it cannot be done.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it&#8221;, I thought that if He is building my life upon the foundation He has laid then I&#8217;m set?, not quite for we still have to face many things everyday. The bible does not tell us that we will not have the gates of hell against us,\u00a0 the bible says they will not prevail against us for what God has built, can nothing move. Isaiah 54:17, &#8220;Now weapon fashioned against us shall prosper&#8230;&#8221;, indeed they will be formed but they will not prosper because God has defined us to be a people who can stand in every circumstance and every situation for our lives are built on him the Rock that cannot be moved. You&#8217;ve got to be somebody in the kingdom for the gates of hell to fight you. The enemy will try and stop you from knowing who you are in God&#8217;s kingdom but thanks be to God, in the midst of our confusion, challenges, and weakness, none of this changes the content of the package.

Like Jesus, I get a little be curious to know how people define who I am. Jesus knew who He was (is) no doubt about that. He&#8217;s definition did not come from men but His Heavenly Father. Matt 3:17, &#8220;And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, &#8220;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased&#8221;. He knew men tried to define Him only to stand by what His Father had defined Him by. So He gets to a place where He wants to know from the disciples what men perceive of Him. vs. 14, &#8220;so they said, &#8220;some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets&#8221;. We labeled by men every day, not everyone thinks of you as someone God has created and has a destiny for. I am not surprised about how people even go as far as changing their minds about you based on your circumstances. If you do not know the content of the package (what&#8217;s in you), what you are labeled can affect you in so many ways.<\/p>\n<p>Do you sometimes wound yourself by your own opinions about who you think you are? assassinating\u00a0 how God has defined you because of what you perceive yourself to be. When you now talk to God, you talk to Him about who you see yourself while He talks to you about who He made you to be. Jesus was labeled as one of the prophets, John, Elijah and the rest. Remember that He knows who He is and what He has come to do but people&#8217;s opinion about Him does not change the content of the package. At least He knows what people think about Him, now the question comes to the people whom He has walked with, taught and fellowshipped with and He asks them the same question, vs. 15, &#8220;He said to them, &#8220;but who do you say that I am?&#8221; I believe that a good friend who really knows you well will know who you really are and not label you they way they want to or the way the world looks at you. vs. 16, &#8220;Simon Peter answered and said, &#8220;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&#8221;. Amen!!!!. Can you imagine someone adding to what you already know about yourself? it&#8217;s a sign of completion. I believe Jesus wanted them to understand who He really was so that they will not doubt Him when He sends them out. This must have been a turning point for the disciples for it was revealed to them by God.<\/p>\n<p>You will agree of those times someone spoke something to you that confirmed what you already received. I know the world is not going to change it&#8217;s opinion about me and you, I am discovering more about who I am in Christ and no one can take that a way from me. Any one who tries to say something contrary to what God has defined me to be is a liar and should not be part of my life cause he or she will not build me up, but those who are seeing me through the eyes of God, will encourage me, strengthen me and help me achieve that goal of being who God has called me to be. The bible says choose your friends wisely for they know how to help bring the best out of you for they see you the way God&#8217;s does. Jesus had true friends the disciples, yes he does minister to everyone but when it comes to intimate stuff, He turns to His immediate friends.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 17, &#8220;Jesus answered and said to him, &#8220;Blessed are you Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven&#8221;. Blessed are those who calls you what God has called you, I&#8217;m blessed to know that my identity is not reduced to what I&#8217;ve got to face today or everyday, it&#8217;s not even based on my struggles in life, it&#8217;s based on what He has called me and if you don&#8217;t agree with what He has called me, I would rather choose to believe what He says about me over what you say about me. This ought to be our attitude when dealing with people, Psalms 139:14,&#8221;I will praise thee oh Lord, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, great are thy works oh Lord and my soul knows it well&#8221;. Anyone who does not agree with me or you on that is a liar and we choose to believe what God says about me and you over what the rest might think. Choose ye this day who will define you!!! Boy friend or girl friend might try, husband or wife may also try but God who holds you in the palm of His hands knows you in and out, He knows you from the beginning to the end, He says that the very hair on our head are numbered, not counted Math 10:30. He is the one who will not change His opinion about what He has said about you.

It\u2019s a word that will transform and revolutionize certain minds for it is a life changing word. It&#8217;s a word with power. Please take some time to read this passage because in the end I will connect it with<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Acts 4.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Please read the word to prove what I share with you, check it out for yourself and prove it.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">2Tim 2:15, &#8220;Study to show thyself approved, a workmanship that needs not to be a shamed, rightly dividing the word of the truth&#8221;<\/font><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Vs 5-7, Now when His disciples had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread, then Jesus said to them, &#8220;Take heed and be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees&#8221;. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s because we have not taken bread&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> In one hand, Jesus had been walking with the disciples, teaching them, performing miracles in their presence on the other hand Jesus had His attackers, the Pharisees and the Sadducees who were constantly on His case. On this particular time, the Pharisees and the Sadducees came asking Him to show them a sign from heaven before they could believe. Jesus full of wisdom did not yield to their questions for He responds to them in<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">vs. 4 &#8220;A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">I kind of stopped and pondered for a second the sign that the prophet Jonah gave and it came to mind how he preached the wrath of God as a sign he was sent by God and the people knew for sure he wasn&#8217;t speaking of his own words but the words of God. The sign was given for the human kind to have an opportunity to decide who to follow. Today we still have so many people looking for signs before they can believe but the creation alone is a sign and declares the Majesty of the Lord. The fact that we can live is a sign that He loves and cares for us. Waiting for a sign to know whether He loves and cares for you? the gift of life, to stand and walk, to think and reason are signs He is in control.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Vs. 8-10 talks about the miracles Jesus did while He was with them. He reminds them of the time he fed 5 thousand men with 5 loaves of bread and again He shares with them about how he fed 4 thousand men with 7 loaves of bread. He is talking to them of the natural that ultimately He may bring them to the spiritual. He says.<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">Vs 11, &#8220;How is it you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning the bread&#8221;.<\/font><\/strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">They believed He is talking to them about the natural bread and how they forgot to carry bread to eat. Jesus explains to them how he supplied bread in the natural but being that they did not carry bread, they needed to remember that the<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">BREAD OF LIFE<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> was already with them. That the<\/font><strong> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\">BREAD OF LIFE<\/font><\/strong><font size=\"2\" face=\"Univers 45 Light\"> was more than enough to feed all men. He is getting them ready for a greater task and therefore He is beginning to impart in them some truth about what they need to know about Him and about themselves in Him.

Crucifixion and death of our Lord was predicted, Jesus Himself talked about it. He talked about how one of His disciples betraying Him, tried, crucified, die and be buried but He does not leave it there, He talks also about His resurrection. For if He died and did not rise then the whole point of dying would have been in vain. Let me make a point here, &#8220;there can be no resurrection without death&#8221;. For one to resurrect there has to be death; for one to rise up, there must be a fall; and for one to be saved, they must be living in sin.<\/p>\n<p>They paid someone to have Him killed and then some people to keep Him dead. People not knowing what He is doing, He had borrowed an empty tomb for His use just for a weekend for He knew that His time in there is going to be very short after all He keeps on telling His disciples that He will die and on the third day resurrect. Didn&#8217;t we hear Him say that He will destroy the temple and build it in three days? People who should have kept the word had lost hope, had mourned and all the consolation they had\u00a0 was knowing Jesus body was is in the tomb, the reason they would bring spices to anoint His body.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s first day of the week, they came to do they had been doing since they laid Jesus in the tomb, these faithful women Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James and other women with them who not only cared about the Master when He lived but also cared for Him when He was dead, they were dedicated to doing what they believe was right and they did it early in the morning. The bible says in\u00a0 Isaiah 55:6, &#8220;Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call upon His name while He is near&#8221; another verse in Deut 4:29, &#8220;But if from thence thou shall seek the Lord thy God, thou shall find Him, if thou shall seek with all thane heart&#8221;. Every day they sought and found the body as that is what they were looking for but on this particular morning, the normal wasn&#8217;t normal anymore for number one, they found the tomb stone rolled away; number two, the body was missing; three, the guards who were paid to guard the body were no where to be seen and four two men stood before them in shining garments.<\/p>\n<p>Luke 24:5&#8243;&#8230;why do you seek the living among the dead?. The two men shinning in other gospels they are recorded as angels began to talk to them saying, &#8220;why are you looking for the living among the dead?&#8221;. It was good to come to the tomb and anoint the body but we needed to understand that He wasn&#8217;t going to be in there forever. Yes the body was there but the Spirit was a live.<\/p>\n<p>We too have the tendency of going back to the grave yard to look and care for the dead and I&#8217;m not talking about physical death but spiritual death, we hang around the tombs, we spend our time there caring for the dead but we need to wake up to know that we are living and we got to be looking for the living for we are alive ourselves. If I&#8217;m going to the grave yard, I&#8217;m going there to have someone resurrected and not hang out there for the one whom I serve is not in the tomb anymore. There are so many who are still behaving as though Jesus is in the tomb still dead but I got news for you, He is risen, He is not dead anymore for I have been asked the same question, &#8220;why am I looking for the living among the dead Vs 6, &#8220;He is not here, but risen! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee Vs 7 saying, &#8220;The son of man must be delivered unto the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again&#8221;. The empty tomb is a sign that He is no longer there and does not need it, another thing after He resurrected, He did not stick around the grave yard for He did not belong there. If Christ lives in you, you have been resurrected and therefore your dwelling place is not with the dead but with the living. Romans 14:9, &#8220;For to this end Christ died, and rose and revived, that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living&#8221;. He is the only one who can be the Lord of both. He hanged out there for a short time because our sins led Him there but He rose, He defeated death, moved out. This is a sign for us, when we come back to life, we are out. Why are you still hanging around the grave looking for someone who is no longer there, unless you are there for another reason? why are you hanging around those people and hanging around those places where you know for sure is a grave yard (spiritually dead?) Sin causes spiritual death but when you have been saved, you are resurrected from the spiritual death and no more can you hang around the tombs for you do not belong there. You might have belonged there at one time but when you came back to life, God will not seek you among the dead but among the living. He did not deserve to be in the tomb but for the sake of men He did Romans 5:8, &#8220;But God demonstrates His love towards us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us&#8221;. Was in the tomb, not anymore;<\/p>\n<p>Happy Easter<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 24:1-12, &#8220;&#8230;why do you seek the living among the dead?

Hebrew custom establishes the idea that Jewish parents name their children based on certain characteristics. Barabbas means \u201cson of the fathers\u201d; that is, \u201cBar\u201d means son and \u201cabbas\u201d means fathers. Growing up, I bet Barabbas thought he was something special. He was the hope of Jewish history (son of the fathers). His name suggests that the Jewish nation had a lot riding on his shoulders (son of the fathers). Barabbas was the product of the long line of Jewish wise men and sages (son of the fathers). He embodied and represented them. Little is known about his parents other than that they were political figures and did not raise him themselves. It is said that Barabbas was raised by the community- being groomed for a purpose. He was not raised with a lot of discipline.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, Barabbas came on the scene during the interim between the old and new testaments. At that time, the Jewish people were subject to Roman power. Some said that Barabbas was a \u2018robin hood\u2019 character. He was hot-headed, quick tempered, and had little difficulty using violence to accomplish his goals. To him, the end justified the means and he didn\u2019t mind doing whatever he wanted, whenever, or by whatever means necessary. This lifestyle got Barabbas on Rome\u2019s top ten list of wanted men. He had led a revolt in which several Roman soldiers were killed. He had stolen from the roman and Jewish treasuries. He was known for ambushing people and taking their belongings to finance the initiatives of his motley crew. And, interestingly, we find him (the son of the fathers) in Roman custody when he is first mentioned in the gospels.<\/p>\n<p>Romans kept their notorious criminals in a jail that was located in the garrison of soldiers. This jail would be equivalent of the maximum-security prisons of today. This jail was about a half mile from the governor\u2019s palace and tribunal.<\/p>\n<p>The story opens with the Roman governor judging the case of Jesus. And, the governor gives the people a choice of choosing Jesus, the Son of God, or, Barabbas, the son of the fathers. Jesus was divine, Barabbas was not. Jesus was Son to God the Father and heir to heaven, Barabbas was son of human people and heir to a collapsed history and dejected people. Jesus represented choosing the divine while Barabbas represented choosing the least admirable qualities in us all. Truly, there was no comparison and the obvious choice of the people should have been to choose Jesus. Instead, the Jewish people chose Barabbas; the lesser figure, the substitute, the crook, the man.<\/p>\n<p>But, this is not where I want us to contemplate. Let\u2019s contemplate the story as it unfolds from the viewpoint of Barabbas. He was locked up about a half mile from where Jesus was at. From where he was located, Barabbas could hear the words of the crowd as they shout their responses in unison.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine living close enough to Yankee Stadium whereby you could hear the chants of the crowd.\u00a0 While you don\u2019t hear the umpires, yet you can easily hear the crowd shouting \u201clet\u2019s go Yankees\u201d or \u201cde-fense\u201d. You can predict what are going on because you can hear the crowds\u2019 woes, boo\u2019s, chants, and their cheering.\u00a0 Now leave Yankee stadium, if you will, on this Resurrection Sunday, and go with me to the jail cell of one, Barabbas.<\/p>\n<p>So, here\u2019s Barabbas- locked up in jail. Now, remember, he could hear the crowds shouting in unison &#8211; but he couldn\u2019t hear the governor. He hears the crowds scream:<\/p>\n<p>1. Not this man, but Barabbas<br \/>\n2. Crucify him, crucify him<br \/>\n3. We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar\u2019s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar<br \/>\n4. Away with him, away with him, crucify him<br \/>\n5. His blood be on us, and on our children.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nCan you imagine what was going on in the mind of Barabbas? He had been in custody for a long time. He had not seen the face of another common\u00a0 person nor had he had a visitor in years, besides a Roman soldier.\u00a0 By this time, he was accustom to seeing the routine faces of the roman guards. No doubt he thought that the people had betrayed him- after all, he did all of his bad deeds FOR them, right? How dare they turn on him like this? He just heard the death sentence be pronounced on him.\u00a0 This may sound all too familiar, but the crowd that perhaps once supported him was not turning on Barabbas, the son of the fathers, but on Jesus, the Son of God.<\/p>\n<p>Now, imagine the dread and the fear that seized his soul. Imagine what the other prisoners thought or said to their \u201cchampion\u201d as they heard the sentence. No doubt a reverent, dreadful silence fell over the place. I imagine that there was a long wait. And then, they heard the footsteps and the keys clinging in the distance- getting closer and louder. They heard the guards returning for Barabbas. For all intents and purposes, they all, including Barabbas, thought Barabbas was going to be summarily executed. But, something happens when the doors are opened to his cell, and the instruments of death tell him that he was free to go. Imagine the fear- yet excitement he felt as the chains and the instruments of his captivity and imprisonment were removed. Then, imagine the solemnity that gripped him when he was told or came to realize that Jesus took his place!<\/p>\n<p>Application:\u00a0 This is the week of Christ\u2019s passion. As we reflect on these events, let\u2019s consider how many times we chose Barabbas over Jesus in our lives.\u00a0 Let us not forget the significance of the story. In Barabbas\u2019s mind- he was as good as dead. He heard the death sentence. But, Christ took his place. It is entirely possible that Barabbas went on to live a holy life after that. Perhaps, he realized the true meaning of the exchange and sacrifice that Christ made on HIS behalf- and it was enough to turn him around and truly live a life that was worth his dying for.<\/p>\n<p>You may be Barabbas today locked up in the jail cell of your sins. Perhaps you will have diner today, with Barabbas, one that is chained to their own sins.\u00a0 Will you be like the Roman guard that released Barabbas?\u00a0 How you ask.\u00a0 Simple, show a person, a family member,\u00a0 a loved one a friend, a neighbor, your mother, your father, your children, that they have violated God\u2019s Holy Law, His 10 Commandments, and therefore are on death row, deserving of God\u2019s capital punishment, eternity in hell, because they are in bondage to their sins.<\/p>\n<p>This sounds harsh.\u00a0 Does it?\u00a0 Does it not sound harsher, perhaps evil, to let one you say you say you love, die in their sin.\u00a0 We love getting together with family, but that is not what Easter, Resurrection Day is all about.\u00a0 It\u2019s always been about Jesus, his death, his burial, and most importantly HIS RESURRECTION!<\/p>\n<p>Tell your loved one, AFTER YOU HAVE HELPED THEM TO SEE THEIR SIN AND THEIR BONDAGE that Jesus died in their place to set them free. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if today, there were those that repented and put their trust in Jesus Christ.\u00a0 What are you waiting for, you may or may not have tomorrow and the following days to live.\u00a0 If you have not repented, and put your trust in Christ, today is the day.\u00a0 If you have not been a true and faithful witness then when you sit with your family, talk in a side room, be faithful to your Lord.<\/p>\n<p>When you hear give us Barabbas, think, give us, Michael, Andrea, Anthony, my dad, my mom, my children because you desire them to be released but the Son of God, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p>May God richly bless you as you obey,<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil, and David<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Focus: Matt 27:1-26; Mark 15:1-15; Luke 23:1-25; John 18:39-19:16 Barabbas was a Jewish national\/zealot.

The two disciples did not really know what they were asking. The way to privileged position in the messianic kingdom is not by grabbing for power but by relinquishing it through suffering and death. Jesus explains this to them by using the analogies of the cup and baptism. The cup, symbolizing trouble and suffering, is found in the OT. &#8220;In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs&#8221; (Ps 75:8). &#8220;Rise up, O Jerusalem, you have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of his wrath, you who have drained to its dregs the goblet that makes men stagger&#8221; (Isa 51:17; cf. also Mark 14:36; Jer 49:12; Ezek 23:31-34).\u201d<br \/>\nNot understanding Jesus, They said to him \u201cWe are able.\u201d\u00a0 Jesus responds, \u201c\u201cYou will indeed drink the cup that I drink\u2026\u201d\u00a0 If Jesus was the ultimate cup bearer then what cup would the disciples drink?\u00a0 In a sense they can and will drink from his cup of suffering. James would become the first apostolic martyr (Acts 12:2); and John would suffer exile on the Isle of Patmos, A.D. 63 (Rev 1:9).\u00a0 Jesus is the ultimate cup bearer of course.\u00a0 However, He is calling those that are His to be willing to lay down their lives for Him.\u00a0 Laying down ones\u2019 life is a daily process.\u00a0 If one cannot give Christ their time, talents, and treasures, how can one give one\u2019s life for Him?\u00a0 In closing the words of a song by Christafari, \u201cHe died for me, so I live for Him, he gave His life, for me, so I can give mine to Him, He became like me, so I can become like Him.\u201d\u00a0 How are you drinking the cup today?\u00a0 You may desire the cup be taken away, even as Jesus prayed, \u2026take this cup from me,\u201d however w ill you pray like Jesus, \u201cNot my will, but Thy will be done.\u201d\u00a0 Realize as you pray Thy will be done, you must also pray, my will be gone.\u201d\u00a0 Do His will and see, God will never let you down.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil<br \/>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, But Jesus said to them, \u201cYou do not know what you ask.

The man of God Elijah was suicidal because of discouragement. The Israelites became discouraged when they faced challenges in the wilderness. It&#8217;s the same thing even leaders face today, discouraged from failing and discouraged by other people. Discouragement is the absence of courage. It deprives courage, hope or confidence.<\/p>\n<p>David too was discouraged at one time. He had killed Goliath, he was a commander of six hundred. They subdued many enemies. While they were away in battle one time, the Amalekites invaded Ziklag where they had camped with their families. The Amalekites took away their wives, children, possessions and burnt the whole place down. The bible says, vs. 4 Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep&#8221;. I remember about 15 years ago, coming from school one day only to find that robbers had broken into our house in our absence and nearly cleaned us out leaving us with nothing but things of no great value. Imagine things my parents had worked hard for many years to gain were all gone in one day. Like David and his men, we sat down and wept until there was no power left in us. The people who could encourage each other were all weeping because they were all victims. What do you do when there is no one around to encourage you? Or when the people you are close are in no position to encourage you?<\/p>\n<p>You would imagine David&#8217;s men standing together in this but in Vs 6\u00a0 &#8220;&#8230; David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters&#8221;, this was like adding salt to injury. When no one can encourage you, and those who should be standing with you are out to distress you, either you can choose to be discouraged like the Israelites or pick up yourself like David and do something about it.<\/p>\n<p>In the midst of pain upon pain, David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. He chose to draw strength from God who is never discouraged. Jesus was left alone in his hour of need when the disciples scattered. One had betrayed Him, the other had denied Him. In the midst of excruciating pain and suffering, He encouraged Himself in the Father and the Father gave Him grace to endure. It was just for a little while before it was all done. I can imagine David thinking about the goodness of God, how God helped him fight many enemies, how God was his refuge and strength, a very present help in time of need. The more I believe he drew from the word of God, the more he got encouraged. This was not his courage, this was God&#8217;s courage driving away discouragement. He was encouraged that he turned around to encourage those who were discouraged.<\/p>\n<p>The last week was tough for me, was not feeling well, then my car broke down with a huge bill to fix it. This all happened while sharing on the devotion &#8220;it&#8217;s a set up&#8221;. In the midst of it all, I encouraged myself in the Lord to know God is in control. I have learnt that I am my best encourager for I know exactly how I feel and I know what dose of courage medicine to apply where. You can not draw courage from without, you can draw from within. David did it IN the Lord so can you. Look at what the Lord has done, get into His word, get encourage in Him for when no one else can, you can in Him. Don&#8217;t let the devil see you sweat or tell you no one cares. Trade in your discouragement for encouragement.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1 Samuel 30, vs. 6, &#8220;&#8230; but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God&#8221; (KJV) Believers fight the spirit of discouragement many times.

These three men must have been inspiring one another, encouraging themselves to stand through it all.

Men who were once ordinary men standing for the Lord were now being referred to as servants of the Most High God, what a relationship!!! They come out of the fire and being inspected, they discovered that they had lost no hair, their clothes and they were not even smelling smoke. This tells me that when God delivers you, you will not look or smell like where you came from. Everyone will wonder whether you have been in the fire<\/p>\n<p>God wants to raise a people who can go through the fire and not loose their testimony, joy, peace and even confidence for He knows how to control the thermostat the enemy thought had control over. The law of the land is changed because of three men who came to a land they did not know about, face things they did not anticipate. They thought they came to work while God brought them to demonstrate His power through them. All along it was a SET UP for the Babylonians to see the true Most High God through 4 obedient young men. One shall chase a thousand, two shall put ten thousand to flight, three shall chase a hundred thousand and four shall put a million to flight. It&#8217;s not about addition its about multiplication, we come together we double, triple our forces.\u00a0 Certain laws around us opposing the work of God can change if we are willing to stand and pray.<\/p>\n<p>Remember the other day I quoted Job 23:10, &#8220;&#8230; After He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold?&#8221; well they made it out as gold with a greater testimony, greater faith, reached many people through their experience and got promotions not because of their qualifications but because of their stand. It was a set up all a long.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t give up if you are in the midst of the furnace of fire, you are being refined for the next move. By the way, He is not through with us yet, I wonder what kind of set up He has in store for His people?

Note this was no ordinary fire. The bible says, for the sake of these men, the furnace was heated 7 times hotter than the usual and we know 7 is God&#8217;s number, the number of perfection. Which makes me believe this king may have been doing God&#8217;s will without him even knowing. In one sense he thinks he is destroying, on the other sense he does not know that &#8220;ALL things work TOGETHER for GOOD for those who love God and to those WHO ARE CALLED according to HIS PURPOSE&#8221;.\u00a0 Not only did they throw them in the fire, they also threw their belongings present with them at that time. Can you see how when the enemy attacks, he is out to destroy you and everything reminding him of you?<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t blame people who the enemy is using to throw me in the fire like those three men. If anything they are doing me a favor by letting God demonstrate His power and for His words through me\u00a0 after all, Isaiah 54:17, &#8220;No weapon fashioned against thee shall prosper and any tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shall condemn&#8221;, Mathew 16:18, &#8220;And I say, thou at Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<\/p>\n<p>Situations may NOT change, the ability to endure in such a condition is a unique blessing\u00a0 that is why I can quote confidently 2Tim 1:12, &#8220;For the which cause I also suffer this things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and I&#8217;m persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him on that day&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While in the fire, the first thing that happens, the ropes used to bind them got burnt by the fire. God will not allow you to go through something still bound by the enemy, He would rather not change the situation but loose you from fear, confusion and frustrations and let you be comfortable in the midst of the tough situation demonstrating His power. He knows that if He can loose you, you can survive (swim with the sharks). The greatest thing about Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego being in the fire, the son of God manifested Himself in the fire. He was always lived in them partially because the bible says in 1John 4:4, &#8220;Ye are of God ye little children for you have overcome them, for greater is He that lives inside of you than He that lives in the world&#8221;. I&#8217;m blessed to know that if He did not rescue me, He was with me in the midst of the fire with me. He did not go away or left me fight by myself. Now that He has been living inside of me, through my situation He reveals Himself so that my adversaries, friends, family members and colleagues may see Him in away that they had never seen Him before. If He wasn&#8217;t with me in the fire, I would freak out and more so be dead but I&#8217;m glad that He is there when I need Him the most. When you are in the fire, you don&#8217;t even fight for people to see Him for in the midst for your positive attitude, people will wonder what makes you different and when they take a closer look, they see Jesus. Don&#8217;t be discouraged by what you have to deal with, you do not know how many lives you are affecting by remaining steadfast through it all. 1John 3:2, &#8220;&#8230;but we know that when He shall appear we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Four men walking back and forth in the fire, I would expect them to want to get out of the fire but it seams as if they were comfortable in the fire. The presence of God will make you comfortable in tough situations. Everyone will be cursing, swearing and doing things under pressure but you will be keeping it cool.

I believe with all of my heart that there are times we are allowed to be in some places to see who we are like. Someone said that when the pressure is applied in one&#8217;s life, it&#8217;s to shows you of what&#8217;s in your heart and what you really stand for. King Neb&#8230; had made a god of his own for his people to worship, the people of Babylon were idol worshippers. For some unknown reasons he makes this idol at time when the four righteous men were in the his land. I am beginning to see a set up in the whole story. After he had finished making it, he commanded everyone to bow and worship the image he had made, no one excluded. Anyone who defied his order to worship his god, was to be thrown into a burning fiery furnace set for them.<\/p>\n<p>This is terrible for we have four men righteous, they&#8217;ve served the Lord all their lives now\u00a0 being tested in a foreign land? Here is a comforting word in Job 23:10, &#8220;&#8230; He knows the way that I take, after He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold&#8221;, This is where your faith is tested to see whether you live by faith, sight or by feeling. The bible says in Hebrews 11:6, &#8220;For without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he that comes to God must first believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him&#8221;. They have walked with God by faith now their faith is put to a test.<\/p>\n<p>Out of the story we know, let&#8217;s pull out some truths from it. Remember the bible says that the enemy is the accuser of brethren? Well we see it in this case too as the rest who saw these three men refuse to bow reported them to the king. Interesting to note that the enemy is persuasive, he does not give you only one chance to change, he will keep on persuading you to go the opposite. In the wilderness satan did not give Jesus only one chance and so was this king who gave the boys a chance again to change their minds but these men were steadfast and so was Jesus, unmovable and unchanged. May we pray for the Lord give us this kind of boldness these men had when they said, &#8220;King we are not careful in answering you in this matter, we know that our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods &#8220;. Are we believers ready to face anything for the sake of the call in our lives or if something shakes our faith we will take an exit? It&#8217;s not easy to walk with Christ, a choice has to be made. All over the world there are Christians dying for their faith simply because they have refused to deny Christ. Rom 8:38&amp;39, &#8220;For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor the things to come. Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To continue, I hope to get to the core of this message in the morning.<br \/>\nThanks<br \/>\nEvans<br \/>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Tim 1:12, &#8220;For the which cause I also suffer this things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and I&#8217;m persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him on that day&#8221; In Daniel 1, Daniel and friends are introduced, in Daniel 2, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-669","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-aN","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/669","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=669"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/669\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=669"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=669"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=669"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":668,"date":"2007-03-27T17:58:39","date_gmt":"2007-03-27T17:58:39","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/03\/27\/its-a-set-up-part-1\/"},"modified":"2007-03-27T17:58:39","modified_gmt":"2007-03-27T17:58:39","slug":"its-a-set-up-part-1","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/03\/27\/its-a-set-up-part-1\/","title":{"rendered":"It&#8217;s A Set Up, part&nbsp;1"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>2Tim 1:12, &#8220;For the which cause I also suffer this things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and I&#8217;m persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him on that day&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Shall we take a look at three men in the book of Daniel chapter 3:1-30. These men are Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego, three Jews serving in the land Babylon under the king Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel is the main character in this book but besides him we are told of his friends who came with him from the land of Israel. These young men were brought over for a task to serve the king. If you look in the 1st chapter vs. 4, it says &#8220;&#8230;young men in whom there was no blemish, but good looking, gifted in all wisdom, possessing of knowledge, and quick to understand, who had the ability to serve in the king&#8217;s palace&#8221;. All these four young men had the qualification needed for the job but they had something even greater, God in their lives. They were not brought because God was in their lives, they were brought because of their abilities only that the king did not know that those qualities were gifts from God. They were clothed with humility, hard workers, pure, and holy just to add to the list. If the king knew these were God&#8217;s men, he might have changed his mind for he was living in idolatry.<\/p>\n<p>In as much as the King thought that He had picked these men, the truth of the matter is God picked these men for a task in the land of Babylon. Anywhere the Lord sends us though we might have the qualifications to get us there like these men, we need to understand that there is a greater purpose for our being there. We may be serving in the king&#8217;s palace, serving in a job, in a home, or community and have some sought of idea why we are there. As time goes by, you begin to learn God had something bigger than what you thought. You begin to see why He opened that door. May be God gave you this job not just to make money as the primary reason but to reach out to people through prayers, love, encouragement. The bible says in 2Corinthians 4:7, &#8220;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power maybe of God and not of us&#8221;. This line blows my mind for I am understanding that wherever I am planted, it&#8217;s not about me but about God. Whatever He does in my life should not bring glory to myself but to Him. Begin to take the glory and the credits and you will see how He will lift those gifts out of you and place it on someone who will give Him glory. He is a jealous God and He will not share His glory with any one. Anything He does is to give us a chance to lift Him up, John 12:32, &#8220;And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me&#8221;. When you are working, lift Him up, humble yourself to know He qualified you to be there, and as you lift Him up, He will draw some of the people you work with, encounter with for it&#8217;s all about Him. Mathew 5:16, says &#8220;Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your heavenly Father&#8221;. Once again we see the good works we do make people glorify God and not us for it&#8217;s all about Jesus. Daniel,\u00a0 Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego were brought to the land of Babylon mainly to do good works and in return men of that land would glorify God as we will see.<\/p>\n<p>This is just an introduction to what we are going to get to but I want us to see things differently as we venture into the journey God has called us as workers in our jobs, workers in the ministry and even in our homes. I believe God is setting some people up for something awesome and extraordinary, humble yourself to be a vessel He can use. 1Peter 5:6&amp;7, &#8220;humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due season, casting all your cares upon Him for He cares for you&#8221;.

I hope to finish it this week but let me talk about something that I usually find hard to talk about simply because it&#8217;s the type of thing you have to experience. In 1John 3:1 starts us with the love of the Father and he says Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us. I could stop there for this is just a good word, this no ordinary love this is an extraordinary love, it&#8217;s the type of love that we have not earned it has just been bestowed upon us.<\/p>\n<p>Not too long ago Pastor Phil shared on &#8220;Does God have a need?&#8221;, in other words, was God craving for love that He had to make us to love Him? No, God did not need us to love Him, He chose to create us then commended His love towards us.\u00a0 Think of the heart of man according Jeremiah 17:9, &#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, who can know it? &#8230;&#8221;.\u00a0 How can you love such a being with wickedness? This tells me that He loved me with an everlasting love that despite who I am and what I have done to which He knows perfectly well, He still commanded His love towards me. God had no business loving us and to leave us thinking, He had no reason to send His son into the world. John 3:16 a common verse, &#8220;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son&#8221;. Perfect love gives the best, God loved the sinners in the world that He gave. Perfect love finds us empty and fills us up, that is what the Lord did for up when He saved us for we were wretched and empty. Perfect love over looks our flaws and still loves us anyway.<\/p>\n<p>The perfect love allowed us to be called the sons of God when we were worthy to be. Remember the prodigal son who went to a far country and wasted all the wealth that he had inherited, when He came home, all he desired was to be made a servant but the Father welcomed him with open arms, embraced him, kissed him, loved him and welcomed him home. What a perfect love!!!!! He deserved to be thrown out because of what he did, he came back knowing that he was not worthy to be a son any more and yet the Father bestowed love upon him and made him a son again. If watched the movie &#8220;John Q&#8221;, it&#8217;s a movie depicting perfect love as we see a child who is about to die because of heart failure and because the Father loves him so much, he is willing to do whatever it takes to have his son well. Everyone has given up to the fact that he can live but the Father refuses to believe anything outside his healing. He comes to appoint where is willing to sacrifice his heart that his son might live. The child does not know much about what this love is all about but the Father demonstrates by willing to die for him. Romans 5:8, &#8220;But God commanded His love towards us that we were yet sinners, Christ died for us&#8221;. Christ absolutely had no reason to go through a horrible death just for the sake of the people who will still fail anyway but because God commanded his love towards us, He was willing to die for the ungodly. He has loved me with an everlasting love and with that love, He has drawn us to Him. God is the lover of our soul first then our bodies. if He loves our souls, he loves our entire being in spite of who we are. I&#8217;m amazed by that. If you don&#8217;t feel loved by anyone, gather courage, stand right in front of the mirror and say, &#8220;He loves me&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I want each of us to know this morning that God loves us individually and collectively, let not the devil whisper to you that because you failed in an area he has stopped loving you. His love is not based on what we did or do but what He did and is doing. His love fits like a glove,\u00a0 accept it.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1John 3:1, &#8220;Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God&#8221; I have not finished the series on &#8220;Raised From Among Them&#8221; yet.

The moment you make the choice, the Lord will perfect it.\u00a0 Psalms 150:6, &#8220;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Isaiah 61:3, &#8220;&#8230;To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for the mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they maybe called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified&#8221;. There is a time to mourn, at time to be down, a time to get discouraged but you can never be in the same place forever, you got rise up for the Lord is changing you to fit in the atmosphere and giving you what you do not have to so as to praise Him. Number one, He is giving us beauty for ashes, other translations says a crown of beauty instead of ashes. He is making us worth something and then here comes the oil of joy for the mourning. No joy, no praise and there is a difference between being happy and being joyful. Being happy goes with the mood while being joyful goes with what is given and choosing to make it work regardless of what you have to face. The bible says that the joy of the Lord is my strength, His joy gives you strength to endure. Number three, He gives us the garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness. Well to me this is the main thing and as you can see that a garment of praise has been made but you and I have to grab it and put it on for many are wearing the garments of heaviness. Garments of heaviness in this case could be stress, frustrated, pressure, overwhelmed by what you have to deal with. You have a choice to remove the garments of heaviness and put on the garments of praise and say, &#8220;I have so much to do and the more I try to reduce my work load, the more they keep on coming, I know that I should be whining and complaining and I should be putting a face but I choose to take off the garments that pull me down and put on the garments of praise for you have entrusted me with these loads of work and you will not give me more than I can handle&#8221;. Thank you for giving me the grace to endure, I praise you for the best in me is coming out under all this pressure. This makes me to be calm in the midst of my storm. Many are seeing me deal with things differently and it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;ve got everything together but because you have given me a new garment&#8221; This ought to be our attitude for the same God who has allowed so much work to come our way is the same God who will give us enough grace and strength to make it but the only way we will make it is by adjusting our attitudes and taking what He has set aside to help us make it through the day and that is the garments of praise.<\/p>\n<p>In 2chronicles 20: when King Jehoshaphat was faced by a great army, he proclaimed a fast throughout the land and all people including animals cried to God and in vs. 15, a word comes to them saying they didn&#8217;t need to fight in this battle for the battle was the Lord&#8217;s. Therefore they thought to themselves, if the Lord is going to fight for us, we can do something else, we can praise Him. The moment they began to praise the Lord, The Lord\u00a0 was moved by their praised that He set an ambush upon the enemy. The king and his people did not see God fight but they saw the results. You praise Him and you will not see Him fight, you will only see results. Walls of Jericho came down under the power of praises and shouts. Put on the garments of praise this morning and let the praise go before you as you start the day.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Mathew 21:16, &#8220;&#8230;Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants, You have perfected praise&#8221; I have come to believe to know someone really well, see how they deal with pressure.

It&#8217;s easier to encourage someone who is going through hard times and even see them coming out of it but when it comes to me facing the same things, I find it hard to encourage myself..<\/p>\n<p>Talking about prophet Ezekiel, he preached a message of hope to the exiles in Babylon yet the people he spoke to did not see things the way he spoke them. I&#8217;m not sure whether him speaking made a difference in his life but still he spoke. Ezekiel 37 is a very familiar passage about the valley of the dry bones. A place anyone would want to avoid. No one wants to go to the valley or live in the valley, people would rather live in a plain land or more so live up the hill. Celebrities love to build houses up the hill, a place where everyone can see their property. God in this case brings Ezekiel to the valley and not just any valley but a valley full of dry bones. Valley often times is associated with death, Psalm 23:4, &#8220;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death&#8230;&#8221;, a place of no hope, a dry place, a creepy place, in simple, a place with no life. I will submit that greater miracles happen in the valley. I tend to see more of God&#8217;s greatness through my times in the valley. Not that I want to be in the valley but I appreciate the times that I have been in the valley, it was a place of preparation for me. Did not like it, but it was vital. The Spirit of the Lord led Ezekiel in the valley, caused him to pass by all the bones, saw how they were so many and very dry. Look around you and see so many dry bones, dry marriages, dry community, dry churches, dry relationships, dry city, dry life. Very discouraging when you see all these and can do nothing about them.<\/p>\n<p>Ezekiel 37:3, &#8220;And He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, can these bones live?&#8230;&#8221; what would you say if you were asked the same question. Can this marriage survive, relationship, life, the lost, backsliders you name it, can they be restored? It puzzles me when I face myself with these questions. We have prayer requests that come in, people who need healing, people who need their jobs restored and I ask myself the question, can it be done? how about you, can you see a desire that has been dead for many weeks, months, years being restored? The same question God asked Ezekiel is the same question we are being asked this morning, can these bones live????<\/p>\n<p>Ezekiel 37:3, &#8220;&#8230;so I answered, &#8220;O Lord God, You know&#8221;. What a wise answer, if he said they could live and God did not do anything, Ezekiel would have been a liar and if he said they could not live and God made them live, he would have still been a liar. What I&#8217;m I saying, the outcome of a situation depends on what He does. I don&#8217;t know whether people will be healed, He knows and so is a marriage, job and all things that you have given up hope on. Could it be the answer God was looking for? probably. God knows what dilemma you and I are in and the answer of it lies in His hands. This is what I call &#8220;HE CAN&#8221;, whether He is going to do it or not is not an issue, the issue is &#8220;CAN HE?&#8221; Whether God is going to do it or not moves me less, my dilemma is can I trust His hands to know what to do? There are people who come to God to ask for something but don&#8217;t believe HE CAN do it, they are just giving it a try to see if He has the ability to make it happen.<\/p>\n<p>If God is going to do it, He is going to have to use something to make it happen. Martha and Mary sent a message to Jesus to come and heal their brother who was sick, Jesus did not show up until Lazarus was four days dead . They understood that the outcome of the situation lied in the hands of Jesus, John 11:22, &#8220;But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You&#8221;. Jesus called Lazarus out of the tomb, God spoke through Ezekiel. Ezekiel 37:4, Again He said to me, &#8220;Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord! vs. 5, Thus says the Lord God to these bones: &#8220;surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live&#8221;. What would you do if you were told to speak life into what you can&#8217;t see life in? This prophet who said God knows is asked to prophesy life into these bones. Mark this, IT&#8217;S THE WORD OF GOD AGAINST THE CURRENT SITUATION. &#8220;Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God&#8221; and this is what He is basing his faith in, what God has spoken. It did not matter what had happened and how he could not see them come back to life, the instruction was simple, prophesy in My name.<\/p>\n<p>You can try and make some sense out of your situation and not see it work out, leave it in the hands of God and when God gives you a word, speak life into it. Remember it is His word and not yours. If it backfires, shift the blame on Him but I heard Him say, &#8220;My word shall not return void&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;I am not a man that I should lie&#8230;&#8221; I see so many dry bones around me, the life of those dry bones are in His hands, all I can do is prophesy according to His word, do the same.<br \/>\nThanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Ezekiel 37:1-14, &#8220;And He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, can these bones live?&#8221; It&#8217;s easier for me to talk to someone about hope, peace and faith.

When no one had faith to face the giant, David did. Everyone including the king did not feel David is ready for he is young, inexperienced and had training background. I&#8217;m reminded of these words, &#8220;The battle is the Lord&#8217;s&#8221;, David was just an instrument at the right time to be used to finish what God had started.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>vs. 38, &#8220;So Saul clothed David with his armor&#8230;&#8221;, you can&#8217;t fight in someone else armor, BE YOURSELF. If they could not use it to get victory, how do they expect you to use it to get one? Use what you know works for you because you have tested and proven it. May be Saul\u00a0 thought, since Goliath is equipped and ready, trying to dress David with armor could have helped. All David needed was his point of REFERENCE (what God had done in his life before) and TRUST of what God was going to do if remained himself. When you get a chance for a new position, make a difference, witness etc, I would encourage you to be yourself. David could not fight with what he had not proven and so are we.<\/p>\n<p>1Samuel 17:40, &#8220;Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook&#8230;&#8221;. This is the core message. David took his staff not anybody&#8217;s and went to the brook and picked out five smooth stones. This to me has a great significance for stones represent good skills to win a battle. We are shown where he picked them from, the brook. The bible says, &#8220;you shall be like a tree planted by the waters, Elijah was brought to the brook, The bible says, &#8220;Jesus is the living water&#8221;, &#8220;out of your belly shall flow rivers of life&#8221;. This shows that David was picking what he needed from God. Mark this, the stones were smooth and polished not just any stone. Have you and I picked the smooth stones from the brook of God to overcome?. Talents, abilities, strengths to mention a few?. On your job resume, you talk about your abilities and strengths, right?. The employers tend to look at some of this because they become an advantage to what they are looking for. If you have smooth stones of meeting deadlines, honesty, dependable, adaptable and the like, this would add to your qualifications. You have to pick out your smooth stones to get you anywhere. What are your smooth stones? David picked his from the brook. Where do you get yours from?<\/p>\n<p>Just to go back a little bit to what I have shared, it is true we have Goliath&#8217;s around us who blasphemes the name of the Lord everyday and we say nothing. People who use the name of Jesus as curse word, instead of using a four letter filth word to express disgust they take the holy name and use to instead. Suppose you are married and someone used your wife&#8217;s or husband&#8217;s name as a curse word, how would you feel? would you sit there and take it in? We do that many times, people take the Lord&#8217;s name in vain and we say nothing. Goliath was defying the name of the Lord and no Israelite said nothing until one young man came to the field and could not stand it.<\/p>\n<p>1Samuel 17:45, &#8220;&#8230;You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, &#8230;&#8221;, many believe that the stone brought the giant down but I believe what David spoke to the giant melted his heart and showed God so strong. All Goliath now saw was not David but God in David and the stone was an outward evidence to the rest of what God could do. Your smooth stone will only finish the job God has started in you. Your confession is, &#8220;I am able with God&#8217;s help&#8221;. We pray give us a chance as long as we know we can truly depend on God to see us through. David might have not had what was required for the battle in the natural sense but in the spiritual sense he did. My prayer is, &#8220;Lord, give us a chance and we will show You so strong before men&#8221;.

Let&#8217;s go back to 1Samuel 17:4, &#8220;And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath from Gath, whose height was six cubits and spans&#8221; Read it until vs. 7, 4 verses talks about nothing but how the giant was dressed for battle. The bible wants us to see something about this man. Just reading how equipped he was, I could see why the Israelites were afraid of him. This is no ordinary sizable man. I wondered why the bible wouldn&#8217;t just say he was a giant and a champion. I believe the Lord wants us to know that our enemy is not a wimp as many may think. He is prepared for you and I at any given moment. Goliath was more qualified, trained, prepared, ready, equipped, eloquent, developed, sophisticated, protected, confident, threatening and a fighter, what chance did David have? All the trained men, who have all that it takes to battle could not face the giant. Wondered why the bible does not even take time to describe how Saul was dressed for the battle?. The Lord would have us know that no matter how big, strong and well prepared the enemy might be, our stand is in 1John 4:4, &#8220;ye are of God, little children for you have overcome them: because for greater is He that is in you, that he that is in the world&#8221;. You might stand at a place looking at the position God allowed you to encounter with and you see how it is prepared with it&#8217;s requirements and boy you get scared silly as whether you can handle it. If you know who you are in Christ and Christ brings you to see what you did not even ask for, that is a sign that He will qualify you to overcome it. I have seen this work in my life, God brought me to something that I wasn&#8217;t even qualified for as the description showed me how that Goliath was dressed but &#8220;God is not a respecter of persons, He is a respecter of principles&#8221;. If God brought you to this point, believe that He will take you to that point, Philippians 1:6, &#8220;Being confident of this very thing, that He which has began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is the concept David learnt when the rest could not and with that in mind he set himself to fight the giant and the first obstacle was his brothers. 1Samuel 17:28, &#8220;Now Eliab his older brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab&#8217;s anger was aroused against David..&#8221; Sounds familiar?, not everyone is ready for your progress, some say, &#8220;there is no way you can make it&#8221;, &#8220;there is no way you can have that position&#8221;, &#8220;there is no way you can change that department&#8221;, &#8220;you have nothing it takes to make a change, look at us who are more qualified and should do it but we are not because we are unable&#8221;. To make the matter&#8217;s even worse, the brother accused him of coming to watch the war, accused him of pride, and was reminded of where he belonged in the wilderness with the sheep. What would you do if you have believed in yourself and God to make it then you have someone in the church, in the home, a friend discourage you? they speak death into you saying, &#8220;there is no way you can make it?&#8221;. David would have said, &#8220;well you are right, I will pack up my stuff and go home&#8221;. This was not his attitude, if he went back home, that would mean he couldn&#8217;t trust God enough, already he knows that he did not come to the battle ground to watch yet he has been accused of it, he begins to see that God set him up cause he wasn&#8217;t looking for this job. He just knows that he has a chance to show God so strong among His people.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself this question, maybe you were not looking to be somewhere but God&#8217;s graciously brought you to that place, you know of your limitations, you have things and people trying to discourage you from doing what is right, something that will bring honor to His name. You have a chance to make a difference, you know who is in you, what will you do about it?. Is your desire to have a chance?

It ministered to me and I hope it does minister to you for the first time or for the second time. Be blessed.<\/p>\n<p>I have heard and come across people with hidden potentials yet to be discovered. In the entertainment industry we hear about people being discovered because of their talents. I have heard stories of humble beginning. Often times you hear about a struggle from the beginning especially with rejections and words spoken that they were not good enough but later they broke through.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone desires a chance to be able to show what they have within, their talents, abilities, skills, performance, products. A chance to be a boss, husband, wife, teacher, worker, grand parents etc. Very few people are interested in being paid to keep quite as most people will always cry, &#8220;give me a chance to show what I can do&#8221;. Don&#8217;t we see this in the work force? people who see new positions that they may not have all the qualifications needed but they believe in themselves that given a chance, they can do it. A belief that you can offer something and make a difference can push you to desire a chance. Our chance as believers is not to show off, but make God look big in the eyes of men. He is already big let&#8217;s not forget that, but for the people in the world, we need to show them how Big Our God is. 2Chronoicles 16:9, &#8220;For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself so strong on behalf of those whose hearts are loyal to Him&#8221;. He has given us a chance to show Him so strong.<\/p>\n<p>There is a big difference between knowing what to do&#8230;and doing what you know. Most people know what to do but they cannot propel and believe in themselves that they can do it. They have potentials hidden.\u00a0 David and Goliath is a story that reveals some things that are vital in our lives. We know David&#8217;s position, he is a shepherd boy, taking care of sheep and smells like one. Though young, he is good at what he is does, he is faithful in his job. An opportunity rises when his father sends him to the battleground to bring food to his brothers. Again we see that he is also obedient in the sense that he does what he&#8217;s been asked to do. I&#8217;m not sure whether he loved to take care of the sheep when his brothers were soldiers in the army but I do know that he knew his job pretty well. He was faithful and obedient in doing so. You may not like what you do, but can you be still good at it, faithful and obedient while trusting God to elevate you in due time?. I believe God sees our attitude in what we do and if we cannot be content first with where we are, we will not be content when we move because before long&#8230;you know the rest. Anyway, David has a chance to be all he can be while still attending to the sheep.<\/p>\n<p>1Samuel 17:20, &#8220;So David rose in early in the morning&#8230; and took the things and went as Jesse (his father) had commanded him&#8221;, I say boldly that God was setting this young man up. He does not know what awaits him, maybe he never saw himself beyond being a shepherd boy but his obedient leads him to serve his superiors (his brothers) without murmuring and complaining. Now David coming to the grounds finds that the enemies are not fighting each other, he has just left what he brought with the supply keeper, runs to the battle ground to greet his brothers and in the process of time, he hears about Goliath sending threats to the Israelites. David has just learnt that no one including the king has the capability of facing this giant. They rehearse to him what will happen to any man who can kill Goliath. It&#8217;s like hearing, a job description and the benefits. The job is to kill Goliath, benefits are great riches, a hand of king&#8217;s daughter in marriage and exemption from taxes. What an opportunity, who is he? what chance does he have?. We&#8217;ll tackle more on it tomorrow.

Besides him, there were so many people who had different issues in their lives that caused them to be the outcast of the society. The pool of Bethesda was a pool where many people with different kind of sickness were brought to and once a year, an angel of God would come down and stir the water and whoever jumped in first was healed of any kind of sickness they had. The man who is most talked about in the story had been sick for 38 years and I bet that the moment he became sick, they brought him to the pool but every year he missed jumping into the pull. I know that friends who had been with him and for him in the beginning after some time gave up on him and he kind of gotten used to being the same way and being in the same place.<\/p>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t amazing that we all go through and deal with different things that leave us impotent, handicapped, paralyzed, lame and broken. The things we need to do, we don&#8217;t do because of our nature and situations. At times we are looking for help and when we think we got it, something jumps a head of us and we miss it and now we have to wait for another cycle because we don&#8217;t see how it can happen again soon. Before you know it, you give up trying like the man and you seat by the pool of Bethesda just watching people get healed. Then thoughts linger in your mind that the victory is not for you because you have not strength to move from point A to point B. Every time you try to rise, you fall back to the same place because your legs that ought to function are impotent. Every time something good is about to happen, someone says something that gets into your nerve causing you to forfeit your opportunity for victory.<\/p>\n<p>You may have strengths and victories in many areas but there is that part that does not function well. I still struggle with many things that at times I wonder whether I will jump on time and not forfeit.\u00a0 One day after many years Jesus shows up during a Passover feast. Remember that it&#8217;s a feast, everyone is supposed to have a good time but some people somewhere are nursing their failures by the pool of Bethesda. I would imagine Jesus seating with everyone to feast but He goes to the pool to minister to people. Thank God that when I cannot get to Him, He can get to me. He comes down and He knows that this man had been in terrible condition and asks him &#8220;&#8230;do you want to be made well?&#8230; I believe that in as much as this man was sick, He needed to ask him for some people don&#8217;t want to get out of their situations as they are looking for sympathy and special help. He&#8217;s reply, &#8220;&#8230;Sir I have no man&#8230;&#8221;. He cares for me that He will come to my rescue and when I have tried programs and methods of getting delivered from my struggles, He shows up asking me the same question, &#8220;do you want to be well, victorious, free, strong, move forward? Jesus tells the man to pick up his bed and go home. Imagine carrying the thing which has been carrying you for many years. Walking on top of what you were once sinking in. What is that thing that has caused you to be impotent, handicapped, paralyzed, lame and broken, it could be jealousy, hatred, unforgiveness, lust, pride, stinginess and more and you desired to be free from them and so you tried to free yourself through different methods but still failed. It&#8217;s like this man who every time tried to jump but missed it. It&#8217;s not by might, nor by power but by my Sprit says the Lord. Thank God He has come at the right time asking me the same question and my answer is , &#8220;It&#8217;s not my will to be like this, want to be made well (free)&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 5:1-15, &#8220;&#8230;Sir I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up&#8230;&#8221; Now a certain man who had infirmity for 38years happened to be at a pool introduced to us in the story.

You may not know what it is but it&#8217;s there. We all have different gifts and talents and that makes Christianity exciting. There is something about being together in unity that paves away for gifts and talents to be realized. God allows us to have different measures of gifts that when shared, our growth increases. The bible says that we collectively are like a human body that has hands, legs, head etc. They are all working together and can function but not fully without the help of the other. The leg cannot tell the hands &#8220;I don&#8217;t need you&#8221; neither can the mouth tell the eyes that it doesn&#8217;t need it. They all have different functions but they all work together. Psalm 133:1, &#8220;Behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>God calls Moses for a task and the first thing that God tells Moses that He will be used to deliver the children of Israel out of bondage. He is scared to death and we know why, he had killed an Egyptian and ran away. He was safe and peaceful where he was. Then here comes God telling him that He will send him back from where he came from. Remember that Moses was a prince in the land of Egypt at one time and then later refused to be one when he discovered he was not an Egyptian. A onetime prince becomes a killer then a fugitive and here comes God sending him back to where he killed. I believe that at one point in life God will send some people to places they came from, not to be part of it again but to be a deliverer to them that perish. When God does send you back to deliver them, you will not go under your own strength or power but His.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy to go back to where you have come from when everyone there already knows your history especially when you messed up big time. You are not sure as to whether they will listen to what you have to say or not, but when God\u00a0 sends you, signs and wonders will a company you if you believe. How often times do we talk to God about what we think is going to happen, how we will fail and yet He is telling us to just believe. God goes as far as demonstrating\u00a0 what he will do and the question Moses is asked is, &#8220;What is that in your hand?&#8221; He said, &#8220;A rod&#8221;. A rod? what&#8217;s up with the rod? Is this is the means the Lord will use to deliver His people?. God is the source and He has chosen to use the things that we have as the means to get the job done. When there is something in your life that you do not think the Lord will use, that is exact thing He will use. Be it your voice, smile, words of encouragement, little help, giving, being there for someone who needs help, a touch, prayers. To you it maybe small and insignificant but to God it is something that He can use. Don&#8217;t you ever loose the rod you have in your hand thinking it&#8217;s nothing, what you have can work wonders in someone&#8217;s life and when you know how to use it, let no one cause you to forfeit by telling you that it&#8217;s not necessary, if it&#8217;s working for you, you got to stick with what is working for you. In fact you ought to be the best in it. You may never know the impact you will be making as you use the rod in your hands. Moses delivered the children of Israel using the same rod which was considered the rod of a shepherd. Pharaoh had a mighty powerful army, God did not sent Moses with a backing army. He sent him with a rod of a shepherd and His presence.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been waiting for something bigger than what you have before being used, I&#8217;ve got news for you, &#8220;What you have is what you need&#8221;, your faithfulness in small things will open new channels for greater things.

Let every man be quick to hear (a ready listener), slow to speak, slow to take offense and to get angry&#8221; (AMP)<\/p>\n<p>Words that come out of our mouths are very powerful. They either do good or do damage. I think words can really cut deep and may take long time to heal compared to a natural deep cut. I have said some things that I did not mean to or came out the wrong way and I wish I could take them back cause they did such a great damage. Isn&#8217;t it amazing that God created only one mouth and two ears which would indicate we need to listen more than actually speak? If it wasn&#8217;t for my mouth, I would have gotten myself into less trouble.<\/p>\n<p>James encourages believers by saying, &#8220;Let every man be quick to hear (ready to listen)&#8221; first. Even the judge before he delivers a verdict first listens to the case. Listening lets you process what goes in, then applying\u00a0 wisdom as to how it will come out. Those who are quick to speak lack the wisdom that is required to process what will come out of the mouth. You know of those times things came out of your mouth you wished you took time to process in your mind before speaking them out. One of the barriers to communication in marriages is, couples tend to be quick to speak and slow to listen when it should be the other way round. What happens is that our mouths are loaded with words ready to fire. We want our points to come across first and therefore what is being said is not being taken in to be processed and brought out in wisdom. Under pressure we speak words we don&#8217;t mean and once they are fired, they cannot come back. We can also do this with our kids. There are parents who just want to tell their kids what they must do neglecting the opportunity to listen to what their kids have to say. Some have belittled their kids by what they say to them. The kids should get their definition from home. Mom and dad who are raising them are the ones to affirm them. Listening may not mean you do what they say but giving them a place to air their voices, this would also let you know which areas they are growing in and which areas you need to help them develop. Parents say, &#8220;kids don&#8217;t listen&#8221;, and now kids are saying, &#8220;parents don&#8217;t listen&#8221;. Listening is hard but vital.<\/p>\n<p>Then James says, &#8220;slow to speak&#8221;, The order of things, &#8220;quick to listen&#8221; then &#8220;slow to speak&#8221;. This is not talking about speaking slowly but being careful about what you say and how you say it. This does require wisdom for in the process of being hasty to speak, corrupted words may be close. Proverbs 10:19, says, &#8220;In the multitude of words sin is not lacking, But he who restrains his lips is wise&#8221;. There is safety in listening than speaking.<\/p>\n<p>If we become great listeners and slow to speak, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if offenses and being angry were minimized because of the order of things. Listening shows you value what someone has to say and without listening, we will continue to battle without great solutions. Be quick to listen and slow to speak, you could save yourself a lot of heartache.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, James 1:19, &#8220;Understand, my beloved brethren.

He is the greatest deceiver that has ever lived and we know his mission from John 10:10, &#8220;The thief commetth not but for to kill, steal and destroy&#8221;. Those have been his greatest tools not forgetting another major one deception. Being that he is cunning, he goes for his tricks, which will lead to deception, kill, steal and destroy. He is very smart and he knows how to play his cards well. Eve becomes the first victim to be deceived into doing what was not acceptable to God by listening to the serpent and taking the fruit and eating it. He knows that if he can get one, he will get many for man has a way of destroying others too. The fruit was not bad looking vs. 6. &#8220;so when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and desirable to make one wise, she took of it&#8217;s fruit and ate it&#8221;. Question, where was Adam when all this were happening, He is to be the priest of the field, giving directions and leading, he is to tend to the garden and have dominion over all the things God created. Well the woman eats the fruit and offers Adam who does not resist and immediately their eyes opened. In line of the story, we see it even today, people who have been deceived may want companion and that would mean deceiving someone else. I have heard this phrase, &#8220;If I go down, I&#8217;m taking you with me&#8221;, I will blow your cover, I will use something I know about you to bring you down for it&#8217;s not right for you to stand strong while I am dealing with this&#8221;. Been in a position where some one tried to make your life miserable because they could not stand being miserable themselves?<\/p>\n<p>The moment deception is activated and one&#8217;s eyes are opened, it robs them of the dignity they had. It also robs them of confidence and ability to stand as guilt and shame get on the drivers seat to take over. vs. 12&amp;13, &#8220;The man said, &#8220;the woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate&#8221;, And the Lord said to the woman, &#8220;what is this you have done?&#8221;. The woman said, &#8220;The serpent deceived me, and I ate&#8221;. One of the destroyer of people is not deception even though deception is lethal but not willing to take responsibility for their actions. The bible says that, &#8220;He who covers his sins will not prosper&#8221;. This is what I call shifting blames, instead of people taking responsibility for what they have done, they blame it on someone else. She tricked me, he betrayed me, she used me, he made me do it. Instead of Adam confessing his failure and asking for forgiveness and maybe God forgiving him, he is blaming it on Eve and Eve blames it on the serpent. You cannot expect healing by shifting blames on someone else. God is to wise to allow someone else destiny to be determined by someone else actions. When David committed adultery with Bathsheba, he did not go around blaming where he was standing or how the woman might have been bathing out there on purpose to make him fall, no, he said &#8220;it&#8217;s me Lord who has a problem and against thee have I sinned&#8221; Psalm 51, &#8220;create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me&#8221;. Have you been blaming everything and everyone for where you are? The process of healing is admitting that you have failed and asking the Lord to help you with your weakness and failures.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 3:13, Vs. 1 &#8220;the serpent (devil) was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made&#8221; Vs. 1 &#8220;begins by saying, &#8220;the serpent (devil) was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made&#8221;.

Do you know that there are so many things that could be avoided if people were praying?

I read\u00a0 that Zacchaeus was a Jew but he was collecting taxes for the Romans. Being of short stature and cunning, this might have made the Jews dislike him therefore he might have thought, &#8220;I will get rich and maybe people will respect me&#8221;. When he got rich, still much wasn&#8217;t changing and he must have been getting frustrated. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if depression creped in, fear, insecurity and the like for we are not told that he was happy even in his riches. One thing we know about when he heard that Jesus was in town, he desired to see Jesus vs. 3 , &#8220;And he sought to see who Jesus was&#8221;, He sought which in other words mean trying to find, asking questions, looking around by all means that he would see who Jesus was. The crowd was blocking him from seeing Him but he was determined to see Jesus. Mat 6:33, &#8220;Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness&#8221;, we got to be a people who are willing to seek the kingdom of God first, yes we have our own strengths and abilities but behind those also lies deception, confusion and fear and just like Zacchaeus knowing all about himself and his failures and partly his success, he desires to see this Man that everyone followed created a thirst. He must have heard that Jesus healed the sick, raised the dead, did wonderful things but what would Zacchaeus really need to see Jesus for? he wasn&#8217;t sick in the body and he wasn&#8217;t going to make extra money if he saw Him, there must have been emptiness in him that he needed someone to fill and so he sought. There are certain blessings, healings, restorations that will not appear until we seek diligently and that takes time, prayer, effort, patience, trust, confidence in God.<\/p>\n<p>Situations and people can discourage you from seeking God. People blocked his view, and no one cared enough to give him space to see Jesus. Everyone minded their own business and may I say that though many saw Jesus, most of them were not as hungry as Zacchaeus. Desperate people take desperate measures, they will pray desperate prayers for they are certain that only God is their source of hope and if He does not show up, that will be the end of them. I thank God because He has allowed me to seek Him that I may find Him, to call on Him that He may answer me, to knock at His door that He may open. There will be obstacles but we got to keep doing what we know.<\/p>\n<p>Vs. 4, &#8220;So he ran a head and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way&#8221;. Here is a man who is seizing the moment for this opportunity can pass him by and he refuses to allow it to pass him by. I know of the times I went to pray before God and there were so many hindrances for the flesh tried to stop me from praying but I would still fight hard for I knew God was going to give me a breakthrough so I climbed a tree of praise. You begin to praise God in your hindrances, you will climb a spiritual tree bringing you closer and closer to Him where He can recognize you. God inhabits the praises of His people. If you struggle to be able to lock in, include worship and praises in your prayers and you will see how you will climb a spiritual tree higher than the things that wants to stop you.<\/p>\n<p>Vs. 5, &#8220;And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at house&#8221;. I&#8217;m glad that in spite of everything, He has seen me and my God He knows my name. This is what I would call going past the gates of praise into His sanctuary where it&#8217;s one on one. Psalms 9:10, &#8220;And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou oh Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee&#8221;. Not only does He see him, He calls him by his name, and then tells him to come down for today Jesus would be his guest. He has stolen the show without knowing but not for wrong motives or selfish ambitions but for a change, 1John 3:2, &#8220;&#8230; and when He shall appear, we shall be like Him for we shall see Him as He is&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Vs6&amp;7, &#8220;So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully, but when they saw it, they all complained saying, &#8220;He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner&#8221;. For the first time someone accepted Zacchaeus for who he is without judging him, he is grateful and so are we that when no one else could accept us the way we were, our desire to know Him caused us to be noticed by Him and offered to be under our roofs. I thank God for the times I have been able to call on Him for those were the times He revealed Himself so strong, the times when I felt that He could have had better things to do when I stopped Him, through my desire to see Him and then going extra mile to climb higher through worship and prayers, He took notice of me. 1John 1:4, &#8220;Ye are of God ye little children, for you have overcome them (obstacles), for greater is He that lives inside of you, than He that lives in the world&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As you read the rest of the portion of scriptures, as Jesus was in his house, Zacchaeus was convicted and began to change his ways of living, transformed by the renewing of his mind and the best thing he received, salvation. Vs 9, &#8220;today salvation has come to this house&#8221;. What is hindering you from seeing and meeting Jesus today and always? When was the last time you felt His presence? Are you worshipping and praying like you should? Do something about your situation for there is a divine appointment.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 19:1-10, &#8220;&#8230;Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at house&#8221; The devo is a little bit long but worth reading!!

As soon as the gospel has been received by faith in Christ alone for salvation, the Christian life has to be lived. Someone said, &#8220;It&#8217;s faith alone that justifies, but the faith that justifies can never be alone&#8221; Another interesting thought, &#8220;Good works are such that a man is neither justified by them or without them&#8221;. Let me stress this point one more time before I move on, we are not saved by works but by faith alone and now that we are saved, our life of faith is demonstrated by works. So when I read James, I learn that he is not teaching me about FAITH PLUS WORKS, he is teaching me about FAITH AT WORK. Can I now say boldly that it&#8217;s impossible to show faith without works? For me yes, not sure about you.<\/p>\n<p>This principal has worked personally in my life as a Christian. When I came to work for this company, God did not tell me to come and work here, I knew what was acceptable according to His word and I acted on it by faith trusting His leading and guidance. That if it was not His will, then the door would be shut. I had faith, I put that faith to work by making phone calls, going for interviews, taking qualifying tests and here I am today. God blessed me. This was a clear indication of faith at work for something that was way bigger than me. I had the opportunity to sit and pray and pray by faith for God to move but I had to learn that God needs something in my life to work with. Proverbs 18:22, &#8220;He who finds a wife finds a good thing, And obtains favor from the LORD&#8221;, Based on this scripture, I applied the same principal. I prayed for a wife by faith then put that faith to work in finding my beautiful bride. I had to pray with my eyes opened, searching scriptures to know what was acceptable in God&#8217;s word and when I did, I prayed for God&#8217;s will to either keep the door open or shut it. Had I just sat down, prayed by faith and done nothing, I would not be married today. I have so many testimonies that came about through the same principal. What I&#8217;m I saying, God has graciously given us something to work with, given us freedom within the guidelines of His word. Now we begin to operate within the guidelines by faith. All these have one thing in common, they came about that God may be glorified.<\/p>\n<p>vs.26 &#8220;For as the body without the spirit is dead, so FAITH without WORKS is dead also..&#8221;. How best can we now understand this verse, if the body had the spirit to give it life and the body did not move, then it will be hard to see the spirit at work but when we see the body moving, we know it&#8217;s not by it&#8217;s own strength and ability but by the spirit inside of it that gives it life. The same would now apply to works which reveals it&#8217;s fuel, faith. I can also say &#8220;it&#8217;s not works that drives faith, it&#8217;s faith that drives works, see the difference?&#8221;. What have you believed God for through prayer, inline with His word, had faith and did nothing beyond that faith? I know that God deals with people differently, but I would have not known His will for my life had I not put my faith to work.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, James 2:14-26, vs. 24, You see then that a man is JUSTIFIED by works, and not by faith only. vs. &#8220;For as the body without the spirit is dead, so FAITH without WORKS is dead also..&#8221; As I continue to read, I discover more how James did not write an evangelistic message, rather [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-655","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-az","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/655","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=655"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/655\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=655"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=655"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=655"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":653,"date":"2007-03-07T07:27:09","date_gmt":"2007-03-07T07:27:09","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/03\/07\/the-motivated-messenger-and-their-message-by-pastor-phil\/"},"modified":"2007-03-07T07:27:09","modified_gmt":"2007-03-07T07:27:09","slug":"the-motivated-messenger-and-their-message-by-pastor-phil","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/03\/07\/the-motivated-messenger-and-their-message-by-pastor-phil\/","title":{"rendered":"The Motivated Messenger and their Message, by Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Due to weather conditions, the devotion is coming in late, be blessed Ev<\/p>\n<p>For &#8220;whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved.&#8221; 14 How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?

And Works"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>James 2:14-26, vs. 24, You see then that a man is JUSTIFIED by works, and not by faith only. vs.26 &#8220;For as the body without the spirit is dead, so FAITH without WORKS is dead also..&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There can be a dilemma in understanding Faith and works from Paul and James&#8217; teaching. Paul taught being &#8220;justified by faith alone&#8221; and here comes James teaching being &#8220;justified by faith and works&#8221;. We would stand and wonder which is which, are we &#8220;justified by faith alone&#8221; or are we &#8220;justified by faith and works&#8221;?. We need to understand what levels both of these men of God placed faith to silence what someone may have thought as contradiction in the bible.<\/p>\n<p>To the Romans Paul writes, &#8220;So we are made right (Justified) with God through faith and not by obeying the law (NLT) Romans 3:28&#8221;. If you read the accounts of Paul&#8217;s writings in reference to being &#8220;justified by faith alone&#8221;, you will learn this was in reference to salvation (ROOT), the beginning of a Christian life. Galatians 2:16, &#8220;knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified&#8221;, in other words, there is nothing you can do of yourself to be saved. If we were to be saved by the deeds of the law (keeping the 10 commandments), then Christ going to the cross was in vain. Many religions teach getting to heaven by works and whenever I witness to people, I constantly hear them talk about their good works getting them into heaven. For our beginning, getting saved, the root of a Christian is based on Faith ALONE in Jesus Christ for our eternal salvation.<\/p>\n<p>Where does the faith by works fall in place according to James? This is in reference to already born again Christian bearing FRUIT. The evidence of faith in you will be seen by how you bear fruit. What Paul taught was the foundation which no man can lay but Jesus Christ, what James is teaching is building the walls on what is already established. James is talking about practical living which is necessary in the life of a believer. From my own experience as a Christian, if I did not add works to my faith, I would be stagnant. There are some who would like to have faith and then sit and do nothing about it. They are not willing to put wheels to their faith and see what direction God would direct them. Some are waiting for the Lord to audibly speak to them before they can act on something by faith. I am like David who faced Goliath by faith and added works to which God commended him for. The bible says in Proverbs 10:32, &#8220;the lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable&#8221;. What is acceptable is stated clearly in the manual book the BIBLE.<\/p>\n<p>Read how James is applying what is acceptable James 2:14 &#8220;What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, &#8220;Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,&#8221; but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit&#8221;. How can I apply this to my faith and works, if I was in a position to meet a brother&#8217;s needed, I could pray that God provides for him by faith. Then the Lord would show me how He has already provided for my brother through me. With that, when I meet that need by faith, I can trust God to replenish what I gave out at this time another time. I know we have faith, do we have works to accompany faith?<\/p>\n<p>To continue.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, James 2:14-26, vs. 24, You see then that a man is JUSTIFIED by works, and not by faith only. vs.26 &#8220;For as the body without the spirit is dead, so FAITH without WORKS is dead also..&#8221; There can be a dilemma in understanding Faith and works from Paul and James&#8217; teaching.

What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me? Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers? Where can I get meat for all these people?

Have them come to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you. I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them.

Ev<\/p>\n<p>Ephesians 5\u00a0 : 23 &#8220;Christ is the head of the church , his body&#8221;, I Corinthians 12 : 12-31 &#8220;The body is\u00a0 a unit, though it is made of many parts; and though its parts are many, they form one body&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Let us think of our human body&#8230; Head and then other parts of the body&#8230;.all in order&#8230;well placed..well designed. well arranged by our Creator &#8230;each organ for a specific purpose &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>1. Christ Himself is the Head . Church represents the body. Members of the church are all organs of the same body.\u00a0 Entire body has to accept the directions,\u00a0 instructions and commands delivered by the head (infact , the brain in it) . Any idea generated by the head has to be accepted and implemented by the body.\u00a0 If not, they cannot get synchronized. It&#8217;s also placed on the top, a symbol of superiority and leadership . Do we have God as the Lord\u00a0 of our life \/church ?<\/p>\n<p>2. Different organs of the body, All organs are put in place by our maker to do different functions but for a common purpose, sustenance and growth of the body .We all are meant to do different functions prepared for us. It is not for someone to look down upon another for doing a work of less honor.<\/p>\n<p>3. Connection between body and the head &#8211;\u00a0 The body cannot function properly if both head and body are not together. There is no life, in fact.\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever thought is generated in the head(brain) has to be obeyed by the body and\u00a0 then implemented. There is no second thought to this.\u00a0 Head is the source or origin of thoughts. Each and every organ of the body be it a nail or a toe, has to obey the commands of he head. Now,\u00a0 are we all\u00a0 under total control of our head, Christ ?<\/p>\n<p>4. Connection between parts of the body- All the parts of the body are closely knit or may be well knit. Some parts may be less honorable,some may be less important but some may be very important and some in a honorable position&#8230;But there should be a feeling of BELONGINGNESSirrespective of the status\/ position\/condition in the church&#8230; Do we have this sort of feeling?<\/p>\n<p>5. Unity &#8211; There should be complete unity in the church. If one part of the body is injured, the entire body feels the effect of that injury and treatment takes places to bring healing to the part injured. Yes\u00a0 , in the similar way, we ought to treat all our fellow members in the church with due respect that we all form parts of the same body created for the glory of God.<\/p>\n<p>Paul writes to Thessalonians\u00a0 in I Thessalonians 4 :9-10 &#8220;And in fact you do love ALL the brothers throughout Macedonia&#8221; Irrespective of differences, they loved everyone. Do we similarly care for our fellow beings if they are in need\/pain\/suffering\/disease ?<br \/>\nGod the Father desires to see this body grow into maturity , into His image\/His likeness.. Shall we all pray that this mighty army &#8211; the body\u00a0 closely knit with Christ as the leader, march victoriously to meet the Lord in the air&#8230;.!

He looks (to overlay, spy) to see things and hides his face.\u00a0 He also experiences pleasure (desire) and savors the smell of acceptable sacrifices.<\/p>\n<p>The term eisegesis [ahy-si-jee-sis] is an interpretation, esp. of Scripture, that expresses the interpreter&#8217;s own ideas, bias, or the like, rather than the meaning of the text. Hence when one reads Scripture, one may filter the text through oneself, the culture one lives in, the values or lack of one holds, one&#8217;s upbringing, etc&#8230;.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The proper method of interpreting Scripture is to use exegesis which is allowing the Scripture to interprets itself through proper hermeneutical study.\u00a0 Norman Geisler shares four stages of biblical interpretation:<\/p>\n<p>Observation &#8211; What do I observe in the test Interpretation &#8211; What is the author trying to convey Evaluation &#8211; What does the passage signify in today&#8217;s culture Application &#8211; What does God want me to do to apply this to my life in a practical way?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Hence eisegesis (reading into the text), is not legitimate exegesis (reading out of the text).<\/p>\n<p>The question of how to interpret the Bible is not a minor issue. It is, in a sense, one of the battlegrounds for our souls. If Satan had a list of what he does not want us to do, Bible study would be at the top, along with evangelism, prayer and worship. Through study of Scripture we learn who Jesus is and are enabled to become like Him. How can we become like Him, if we do not know what He is like? Devotional studies are important, but they must result from a serious study of Scripture. The apostle Paul prayed that the Colossians might be &#8220;filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding&#8221; (Col.<br \/>\n1:9).\u00a0 This is the reason why Evans and I try to stick closely to bring you theologically sound devotions and give you healthy food so you can grow thereby to become more like Jesus Christ in every facet of your life.<\/p>\n<p>Be like the Bereans who when Paul preached &#8220;&#8230;received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, We&#8217;ve all experienced preachers and politicians showing to be inspirational and charismatic in their sermons, speeches, and writings.

It&#8217;s a good testimony when you stand and testify of how God brought you out. I would like to develop another testimony not on how the Lord brought us out but how the Lord made us comfortable in the midst of the storm, in the lions den (Daniel), in the furnace of fire (Shadrack, Meshack and Abednego), in prison (Paul, Silas, Peter). What these men had in common was that at one point they were faced by a trial and they found themselves in places of destruction but instead of the Lord changing their situation, He made them comfortable in the midst of their trials for He was in control of their destiny. How do I know they were comfortable in their trials, I don&#8217;t hear them crying and screaming to be let out of their trials, do you?.<\/p>\n<p>Paul begins by praising God because He deserves all the praises, then He talks about His attribute relevant to this message. He says, &#8220;3Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221;. If in trouble, can you gather strength and begin to praise and not complaint? Praise be to God, what wonderful God He is, Mighty, Glorious, Sovereign, He knows all things and can do all things. This alone should be enough to make us comfortable in the storm because thinking about who He is and talking about Him eliminates all the fear and doubt and we begin to get comfortable because we know He is bigger than the situation and He has all things under control. &#8220;He is the father of compassion and the God of ALL comfort&#8221;. You might think that being in trouble shows that He cares not but the truth of the matter is, He cares more than we could imagine or think, the men I mentioned above did know, the whole reason they could be comfortable. They knew God cared and that there was something bigger than the their trials God was going to accomplish. Then Paul says, &#8220;He is the God of ALL Comfort&#8221; which if may use these words would mean a feeling of freedom from worry or disappointment, the opposite of what the world teaches<\/p>\n<p>Think of Daniel who was thrown in the lions den because he was doing what was right in the eyes of God. While the king who according to his command had Daniel thrown in the den was troubled and loosing his sleep, Daniel on the other hand I believe was laying his head on the lions falling a sleep peacefully, he says &#8220;My God sent His angel and shut the lions&#8217; mouths, so that they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; &#8220;. What of his testimony could have been bigger, being delivered from the den or sleeping comfortably in the lions den? See the Lord did not get rid of the situation (lions), His sent His angels for comfort then shut the lions mouth. It will be safe to say, he might have not been in a hurry to cry for deliverance in the den. Mark this, I&#8217;m not saying he was happy to be in the den, I&#8217;m saying, he was comfortable in the den. To break Comfortable into two words &#8220;COMFORT&#8221; and &#8220;ABLE&#8221;, I can be anxious free knowing His grace is sufficient for me, and He is able to deliver me. Those two perfects the word comfortable to which I need right in the middle of trials. Can trust God to make us comfortable in the trials so that we don&#8217;t loose our testimony, composure, joy, faith simply because He is the God of all comfort and He has sent His comfort to make us comfortable in the midst of the trials. By this you can comfort many who come your way.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks,<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Corinthians 1:3Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, 4who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God&#8221; (NIV) If you are anything [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-645","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-ap","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/645","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=645"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/645\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=645"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=645"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=645"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":642,"date":"2007-02-19T07:54:44","date_gmt":"2007-02-19T07:54:44","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/02\/19\/i-am-still-here\/"},"modified":"2007-02-19T07:54:44","modified_gmt":"2007-02-19T07:54:44","slug":"i-am-still-here","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/02\/19\/i-am-still-here\/","title":{"rendered":"I Am Still&nbsp;Here"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 118:17, &#8220;I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of the LORD&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A question once asked, &#8220;Why are we here on earth?&#8221;, someone responded, &#8220;to live this life to the fullest&#8221;. I wouldn&#8217;t say that is the reason why we are here primarily, that is what we do while we are here. God designed the earth, populated it and finally created man to fit into what He had created. God being a God of order did not create man on the first day. And when He created man, He had a plan and purpose for his life, to glorify Him. No one is here by accident but by the divine will of God. The question then you ask yourself, &#8220;if I am here, why I&#8217;m I here and how long am I going to be here? Until what He had planned for me is fulfilled.<\/p>\n<p>Acts 14, Paul had been moving from city to city preaching the gospel. Many believed on the name of the Lord Jesus and got saved but there\u00a0 were some Jews who stirred up strife trying to confuse some of the\u00a0Gentiles that believed. When this wasn&#8217;t working as fast as they wanted it to work, they had an idea to get rid of Paul. One time they tried to stone him and Barnabas. When they learnt about it, they escaped from Iconium to Lystra and Derbe but later they were followed there. Acts 14:19, &#8220;Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead. 20, &#8220;But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city (NIV). How would you react if you learnt that what God wanted you to accomplish was in jeopardy?<\/p>\n<p>The life you held dear is threatened by challenges of life. You make an tempt to progress yet there is such a great opposition from people and situations, words stoning you, frustrations and fears stoning you. Paul was preaching GOOD NEWS, that did not exempt him from being\u00a0stoned then left for dead butt there was something God had invested<br \/>\nand deposited in Paul that was not ready to be terminated yet. It\u00a0looked like he was going down the drain, his life in danger, few friends and more enemies, not wanted in cities but his mission was not\u00a0complete. When we understand what God has called us to do, come high water and hell, saints might be shaken but none of it will terminate the work God has started. Jesus was almost stoned to death, nothing could happen to Him because His time had not come. Paul&#8217;s time had not come, therefore the stones couldn&#8217;t kill him. When they dragged him out of the city supposing he was dead, he picked himself up and went back into the city. &#8220;I AM STILL HERE&#8221;, you or anyone will not destroy what God has started, He finishes what He has started, Philippians 1:6, &#8220;being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ&#8221;. Are you glad you are still here regardless of what you went through in your childhood and the last few painful episodes in your life?.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 118:17, &#8220;I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of the LORD&#8221;, This scripture is for those like Paul who know the calling and the destiny in their lives. What you know about God in you will cause you to look the situation in the eye and say, &#8220;I shall not die, but live&#8221;, my faith in God will not die, my hope, my vision, my desire, my calling, my spirit, my destiny, my dreams will not die. I may be bruised and limp but the fact that I can still see these things at distance will keep me alive. You live because God started something in you. Pick yourself up where the enemy has left you to die, wipe off the dust, go back to the city and let the enemy know, &#8220;YOU ARE STILL HERE&#8221;, That is your testimony, &#8220;God is still on the throne. 2 Timothy 1:12, &#8220;For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day&#8221;. Why still live?, &#8220;TO DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD&#8221;, I live because He lives in me therefore I am still here till He is done with me.<br \/>\nDeuteronomy 30:19, &#8220;I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<br \/>\nEvans<br \/>\n* Our daily morning devotion&#8217;s 5th anniversary is around the corner February 27th, we give God all the glory for this far He has brought us.

Print a label on the package, &#8220;RETURN TO SENDER&#8221;, Don&#8217;t hold on to a package that will explode on your face. Jesus is sending the package of deaf and dumb spirit back to where they came from. Watch this in vs. 26, &#8220;Then the spirit cried out, convulsed him greatly, and came out of him&#8221;, the command was so strong that all the junk began to terrorize the young boy for the last time as they gathered all their belongings to leave. There are some things that don&#8217;t leave without a fight, the bible says in 2Corinthians 10:4, &#8220;the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds&#8221;. The things that were in this boy were strong holds. See no word shall return void that proceeds from the mouth of Lord. Jesus had spoken, the unclean spirits had no choice but to leave and the young boy had no choice but to be free.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And when the unclean spirits left, he became as one dead and so many said, &#8220;he is dead&#8221;, I thought Jesus did it? how come the child looks dead, the people around him have already passed the judgment that he is dead, I don&#8217;t know what the father of the child might have felt at that moment for as long as he was being terrorized at least he was a live now he is dead? Hold on! Phil 1:6, &#8220;Be confident in this very thing, that He which hath began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ&#8221;. What people thought and what looked like did not intimidate Jesus. He might have been the only one with a different look at things yet he was not moved by what people thought. He knew that what He had started, He was able to complete it. Do not be intimidated when you have believed God for something and it looks like it&#8217;s not going as desired and everyone around you is telling you not to believe in the Jesus stuff.\u00a0 Linger longer, watch again, the process is not complete, something to ponder on, When did you ever hear that Jesus FAILED?<\/p>\n<p>Mark 9:27, &#8220;but Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose&#8221;, AMEN, AMEN. Is the Lord wonderful or what? He did not touch this boy from the beginning, even at the time of rebuking the spirit. But when everyone thought he was dead, He reached out and took him by the hands and lifted him up. His complete restoration came as a result of Him touching him and raising him. Isn&#8217;t it amazing to see that the Lord is out to raise His people and not leave them down, how about His touch, He is not just interested in speaking victories our lives, He is also interested in touching us, raising us up.<\/p>\n<p>I got to stop for this is just too good, a father&#8217;s son is restored, his faith is boosted even more, his son is healed, has a sound mind and the best thing that could ever happen to both is encountering with the Savior and the Lord. In conclusion, if Jesus was not moved by your past situation and the present condition of this boy, and then He was not intimidated by the request of the father when the disciples could not do it and finally He is not intimidated by the comments from the crowd saying that the child is dead, why not begin to trust Him with your past, present and future for He is the same yesterday, today and forever more He changes. He is moved by your feelings and not intimidated by your situations.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Mark 9:14-29,&#8221;&#8230;But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us&#8221; To conclude, let&#8217;s see the man&#8217;s faith and Jesus power did.

If you doubt someone&#8217;s ability, then how will you have faith in them? &#8220;WHEN&#8221; is the word of assurance, that is the word of faith this father needed. He needs help for his son, but he also needs help to believe that it can be done. My prayer is that we will take our faith of &#8220;IF&#8221; and move it to &#8220;WHEN&#8221; for that is where the Lord would have us put our faith. He can do it period, it&#8217;s just a matter of WHEN. The bible says that, &#8220;He makes all things beautiful in His time&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mark 9:23, &#8220;Jesus said to him, &#8220;If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes&#8221;, The Lord&#8217;s power mixed with our faith produces victory. I don&#8217;t know how one can receive something if they don&#8217;t believe that the one they are coming to has the capability of doing it. See the Lord is telling him that all he has to do is believe, not analyze, try and see what is around that can be used to make it happen. Your job and my job is to believe that is all the Lord requires of us, then He will take care of the rest. All things are possible to him that believes, to confirm this, many times when Jesus reached out to people, what did He say? &#8220;Your faith has made thee whole&#8221; It&#8217;s our faith in God that makes all things possible. Hebrews 11:1, &#8220;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen&#8221;, we all hope for something from the Lord that hasn&#8217;t been revealed yet and we haven&#8217;t seen it, yet but we are trusting and believing that with time it will come. What people hope for, they look forward to receiving it as opposed to someone who is not sure. However big or small the thing you hope just remember that the size does not intimidate Jesus for there is nothing too difficult for Him. Jesus may ask you to push a huge rock but that does not mean He expects you to move it.<\/p>\n<p>Mark 9:24, &#8220;Immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, &#8220;Lord, I believe; help my unbelief&#8221; ,\u00a0 NIV translation puts the last portion this way &#8220;I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief&#8221;, this line sounds confusing for one instant he says he believes and then says help my unbelief. He believed the healing could happen at the same time he was not so sure to what extent. He also believes it could\u00a0 happen but he was not as calm as Jesus and so his prayer was that Jesus would boost his faith to the level of His, to see things the way Jesus did. I have the faith in God to know that He can, now I need my faith to be elevated to a greater level where I can be calm about it, no be intimidated by situation any more for I have faith that negates the facts. If you have unbelief, ask the Lord to help you overcome it for whatever you requested of Him is already settled now faith is the vehicle the Lord will use to bring it to pass. Can you see how this father is so open to admit his weak faith and asking for help? his admission and seeking resulted to something greater than what he had before meeting Jesus. Faith established not just for today&#8217;s miracle but even greater things to come.<\/p>\n<p>I can now see why Jesus was not too quick to heal the boy till he<br \/>\nestablished faith in his father. So don&#8217;t freak out when what you<br \/>\nprayed for is delayed, you could still be in &#8220;Faith Class&#8221;<br \/>\nbeing prepared for something bigger than the current situation. The<br \/>\ncurrent situation is a faith booster, it&#8217;s an eye opener. It also<br \/>\nteaches you that Jesus cares that is why He is moved by our feelings<br \/>\n&#8230;.

The \u00a0father is describing the condition of his son. It must have broken his heart to be helpless while the son was already in a helpless stage. This was not something that recently started, it&#8217;s been with him since he was young . I believe that there were occasions when he was okay and then there would come times when he would be seriously attacked. In as much as each father want to see their children become somebody in life when they grow up, all this father \u00a0can do is try to keep his son a live. I don&#8217;t know about you but I see this kind of thing happening in my life often times. There are times I feel so fine and there are so many victories coming my way and then there comes times when I am thrown on the ground by the attacks from hell, at times I have been thrown into the fire and water with the aim to destroy me, there have been times where I wasn&#8217;t sure of what was going on. Then there came times when the thing I was battling with left me for a season and I kind of rejoiced that I wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with it anymore, before long it came back again.

Just because we are in the presence of God does not stop the enemy from doing his dirty work. The moment they brought the boy to Jesus, instead of the evil spirits leaving, they put a show. They did the same things they had been doing to him before they brought him to the Lord. The things the enemy used to do to you before you got saved, he is still doing it today especially now that you belong to the kingdom if you are saved. If he was on your case with bitterness before you crossed over, check again and see if it left you, how about pride, lust and even fear. You know what amazes me about the story is that when all these things were happening, Jesus just stood there and watched, not even moved an inch, not even intimidated and yet it was never a sever site to watch. You and I have to remember that Jesus is moved by our feelings when we are in tough situations, but he is not intimidated or moved by the issue. He does not leave when the going gets tough for us.<\/p>\n<p>We have this joy that no matter what the enemy does as long as we are in God&#8217;s presence, all will be well. Even if the situation does not change His presence alone gives us comfort that He has all under control.

Often times people don&#8217;t excel because of what they have believed a lie leaving them condemned. All they have left is to nurse all the failures and defeats they encountered previously. As long as I have breath in me, I&#8217;m going to keep pumping life in me and let myself know that regardless of what I have gone through as long as it did not kill me, it gave me an opportunity to understand that greater things have been deposited in my spirit not to be terminated prematurely. You and I did not come this\u00a0 far to call it a quit, we still got to look for ways to make it with God on our side search for that water brook with living water.<\/p>\n<p>A loving father in my text has a child who has is deaf and dumb. Many diseases that Jesus healed, He did not get into details trying to figure out when it started, what the symptoms were etc but for some unknown reasons, he asked for more details on this particular case. He tries to get some information about who this child is and what he has. I do believe with all my heart about being specific with the Lord, general prayers have never worked for me that well and so when I have an issue, the first thing is to identify what it is, the symptoms, what it&#8217;s doing to me, with that I bring it to the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Just before Jesus shows up in the scene vs. 14, &#8221; &#8230; one of the crowd answered and said, &#8220;Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a mute spirit&#8230; So I spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they could not&#8221;. We see a caring father who is out to get help for his son, he brings his son in search for Jesus. Instead of finding Jesus, he met His and I can imagine the father of the child thinking that since these people had been with Jesus, they must have seen what Jesus regularly did and therefore they could perform the same miracles unfortunately, they were unable.<\/p>\n<p>The questions I am pondering on is, was it because they were never equipped to do the job or was it a job just for the Master? Jesus tells us in John 14:12, &#8220;verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than this shall he do&#8221;, with that verse, it&#8217;s very clear that Jesus would have loved to see His disciples do what He had been doing, the things He had been teaching them. Mark 9:19, &#8220;He answered him and said, &#8220;O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bare with you?&#8221; to me this implied that He needed not to be there for the healing to take place for He had already given them power to heal, let&#8217;s see it in Mark 16:17&amp;18, &#8220;And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover&#8221;. What a word from the Lord, He says, these signs shall follow you only if you believe (faith) and not just faith, but faith in the Author of it, Hebrews 12:2,&#8221;&#8230;looking unto Jesus the Author and the finisher (perfector) of our faith&#8221;.\u00a0 No way of doing it without faith in Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>We got to have faith that He who is in control is bigger than the situation and the circumstances around you and I. The reason why many cannot trust God with their situation is because they limit God. To increase your faith, begin to praise Him, magnify His name, talk about His names, His nature and you will see how your faith elevated to a greater level. With faith elevated, what you are dealing with will be too small in your eyes for you will be seeing it the same way the Lord is sees it. Understand that whatever is impossible with man is possible with God; whatever gets out of man&#8217;s control does not get out of the Lord&#8217;s control. Have faith in God and the signs of victory, rain, joy, peace shall follow you for what intimidates you does not move Him. All the disciples needed in this case was faith and the name and the job would be done. We too need the faith and the name to help us through it.

Jesus goes to Bethany and while in route, Lazarus dies. This death so moved Jesus that He cried. God then manifested His ultimate power by restoring Lazarus to life. Through this awesome miracle, many people came to believe in Jesus. <\/p>\n<p>God&#8217;s overall intent for humanity is to have life and to enjoy it. When considering the abundance of natural and spiritual gifts He has bestowed upon us to achieve this end, we can do nothing but marvel in the excellence of His work as our hearts are filled with such transcendent joy that we can barely comprehend the full heights of His splendor. Everything God does, has done, and will do involves the furtherance of His desire that we have, enjoy, and preserve life. I want you to consider this point. Think about the commandments of God. The only things that God has forbidden are those things that will cut our lives short! Think about it. I challenge you to name a single thing that God has forbidden that does humanity any good. God only wants us to walk in the beauty of creation experiencing life without insulting His majesty by reducing our dignity through base living. <\/p>\n<p>The chief priests who represented the established church of the day harassed the Lord at every opportunity despite overwhelming evidence signaling His Identity. We are not told why Lazarus was sick, but it was clear that even the last effect of sin and the ultimate condition of man was eclipsed by the love of God, which brought life. The established church witnessed God&#8217;s great work and shortly decided that they would KILL Lazarus. <\/p>\n<p>Imagine that. The Lord Jesus raises a man from the dead and because the chief priests were so fixated on limiting Jesus&#8217; actions and preventing Him from expelling the death that resulted from the law that the chief priests decided to assassinate Jesus and flat-out MURDER Lazarus. They wanted to kill Life itself- the Source of Life, and all things that Life impacted. <\/p>\n<p>Much can be said about all of this. I want us to remember that the mission of Christ&#8217;s church is to champion life and remember to value people over systems, rules, laws, and religions- all of which create and maintain death. Beloved, our agenda in this society encompasses more and is broader than our struggle against abortion. Jesus has the ability to remedy every irritant that impacts humanity and is presently restoring life and setting at liberty every thing that encounters His Presence and embraces His Word. Whenever people were in danger, Jesus did not miss a single opportunity to suspend the mechanism that empowered death in order to allow life to prevail. Let us go into the world with the same mission. Our message? Receiving the gospel brings spiritual life and obeying the gospel causes natural life to take on new dimensions that will ultimately bring about the fulfillment that we all seek, as our will is conformed to His! <\/p>\n<p>Blessings, <\/p>\n<p>David Jackson <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 11:10-11, &#8220;But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&#8221; 11 These things He said, and after that He said to them, &#8220;Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.&#8221; The Lord Jesus is with his disciples one day and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-636","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-ag","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/636","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=636"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/636\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=636"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=636"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=636"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":635,"date":"2007-02-08T14:48:25","date_gmt":"2007-02-08T14:48:25","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/02\/08\/duty-calls-by-melissa-milbourn\/"},"modified":"2007-02-08T14:48:25","modified_gmt":"2007-02-08T14:48:25","slug":"duty-calls-by-melissa-milbourn","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/02\/08\/duty-calls-by-melissa-milbourn\/","title":{"rendered":"Duty Calls, By Melissa&nbsp;Milbourn"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<br \/>\nAs we are encouraging our devotion team members to take opportunity to share, we have had a few come in and here is one submitted by Maria Chilkuri.

And if you wind up owing Uncle Sam money, you love it even less. But paying our taxes is our duty. As Christians it&#8217;s especially important that we take care of our taxes, for we wear His Name. In Matthew 17 Jesus is speaking of paying the temple tax. He asks &#8220;from whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes, from their own sons or from others?&#8221; &#8220;From others,&#8221; Peter answered. &#8220;Then the sons are exempt,&#8221; Jesus said to Peter. &#8220;But so that we may not offend them, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first catch; open it&#8217;s mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours&#8221; (vs. 25-27).<\/p>\n<p>You see, Jesus should have been exempt. His Father was King over all the earth! As the Son of God, He did not owe anyone anything. However, because He did not want to offend anyone, He paid anyway. Oh and the way He paid! &#8220;Peter, go catch a fish, and in its mouth you&#8217;ll find the money!&#8221; I love it! Our God is Jehovah-Jireh &#8230;He is our provider. Is anything too hard for Him?!<\/p>\n<p>I titled this devotion &#8220;Duty Calls&#8221; because I figured if I titled it &#8220;Pay your Taxes&#8221; no one would read it! J But it is our duty to pay our taxes, and God honors our submission to governing authority. If you&#8217;re short on money and dreading paying taxes, know that nothing is too hard for Him. Call on the Lord today &#8230;He is our provider. Dear Lord, may we be ever mindful and thankful for the country we live in, and may we call on you to provide all that we are lacking. In Jesus&#8217; Name, Amen.<\/p>\n<p>Application Steps:<\/p>\n<p>Be joyful. Be grateful. Focus on all the blessings God has given you. Trust Him. Reflections: Consider how Jesus, of all people, should not have had to pay taxes, but He did anyway. Is your financial household in order? Power Verses: Genesis 22:14 &#8220;and Abraham calleth the name of that place Jehovah Jireh because it is said this day in the mount, &#8216;Jehovah doth provide.&#8221; (Young&#8217;s Literal Translation) Jeremiah 32:27 &#8220;I am the Lord, the God of all mankind.

for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Acts 12:1-3, &#8220;Now about that time Herod the king stretched his hand to harass some from the church. Then killed James the brother of John with the sword. And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also&#8221;. Before Jesus Ascended into heaven, He told His disciples of what to expect John 16:33, &#8220;These things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace, in the world you will have tribulations, but be of good cheer I have overcome the world&#8221; then we see the disciples experiencing the same things Jesus had prepared them on. When Jesus was leaving the earth, He reminded the disciples of what was to come in His absence at the same time He but also gave them assurance of how He would be there to stand with them and soon after He left, tribulation started, Stephen was stoned to death, James is killed and Peter was next.<\/p>\n<p>Here is my question, why is it easy to wait for something to happen before we make a move? Acts 12:5, &#8220;Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for Him by the church&#8221;. In another version says &#8220;but prayer was made without ceasing&#8221;. This is what I would call intercession, intercession someone standing in the gap on behalf of someone else. Prayer warriors are like the attorneys in the courts of law fighting for those who cannot fight for themselves. They understand the law well (God&#8217;s word) and the promises in His word. I don&#8217;t know whether there were people who stood in the gap on behalf of James but suppose they had interceded for him the way they interceded for Peter, I believe God would have intervened. Peter had several attorneys standing in the gap, pleading with God to spare his life and so they prayed without ceasing, continuously, fervently, purposefully, earnestly, and diligently. Praying without ceasing is not praying without stopping but praying without giving up and there is a big difference in that. I could pray for something today for half an hour and stop but that does not mean I have given up, I will pray again for it tomorrow and the days to come and that is praying without ceasing. 1Thes 5:17&amp;18, &#8220;Pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you&#8221;, Ok I understand the idea of praying without ceasing, but how would I explain, &#8220;in everything give thanks for this is the will of God&#8221; does that mean for my problems I give thanks? how about for my afflictions and frustrations? does that mean I give thanks for that is His will?. No, the will of God is to praise and give Him thanks even in the midst of the situation, giving Him thanks IN IT and not FOR IT. Giving thanks is a sign of &#8220;I have faith that you will bring me out of it&#8221;, I don&#8217;t see it now but I know you will. Giving thanks is appreciating what He is doing even at that given moment. Giving thanks is choosing to believe His report over what you heard, know about or what you are in. Giving thanks is knowing that He already had an escape plan for you even before you got into it. I believe that the church that was praying for Peter was giving thanks in advance.<\/p>\n<p>You got to have someone you can confide in when it comes to praying for there are times when you will be so much overwhelmed that you will need someone to cover you in prayer. I&#8217;m talking about prayer partners, Peter must have been weary and tired and being bound between two guards must have been tough but the prayer of the saints kept him peaceful that he could comfortably sleep in his condition.\u00a0 You can be comfortable in a storm because someone is standing in the gap pleading your case. Like Peter, do you have those interceding for you without ceasing?<\/p>\n<p>* Due to an emergency yesterday, I was unable to deliver the devotion but praise God I witnessed to two young men Thomas and Patrick who work for an auto shop. They were both receptive to the gospel. Please keep them in prayers to repent and put their trust in Jesus alone for their eternal salvation.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Thes 5:17&amp;18, &#8220;Pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you&#8221; Acts 12:1-3, &#8220;Now about that time Herod the king stretched his hand to harass some from the church.

Then there are those times I just don&#8217;t have the strength to pray because I am so much in pain, distressed, confused, overwhelmed and the list goes on. Those are the times I need someone to pray for me. And who better pray for me than the one who sits on the right hand of God the Father making intersession for us.<\/p>\n<p>Why do we pray and conclude with &#8220;In Jesus name&#8221;? In the gospels, I see only John reporting to us of what Jesus said about His name in reference to asking (praying). John 14:13 &#8220;And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son&#8221;,\u00a0 In one instant He says, &#8220;if you ask in My Name, I WILL that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the Son, then He also says, John 16:23, &#8220;And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you&#8221;. Is this not an indication that we can ask Jesus directly in His name or ask the Father in His Son&#8217;s name? Why would Jesus who is God be interceding when He is God to be called on and has everything?<\/p>\n<p>Romans 8:34, &#8220;Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us&#8221;. Jesus has the power to condemn, yet He has not. Is He risen? Yes He is, the power of God raised Him from the dead. He has ascended to heaven sitting at the right hand of God, His rightful place and is interceding for us. While He was on earth especially before He was taken to be crucified, you can see Him interceding for mankind.<\/p>\n<p>Here is what I believe the reason Jesus encouraged us to pray to the Father in His name. Who did better understand what mankind goes through than Jesus?, he was tempted, he was ridiculed, he lost his friend, attacked, betrayed, denied, rejected in his home town, his brothers doubted him, carried heavy cross to the mountain, felt the pain of being crucified to mention a few. So when we pray while facing some of the things He faced, He intercedes for us before Father by saying, &#8220;I know how it feels to go through what so and so is going through, I have been there&#8221;. When I face challenge and I just can&#8217;t find strength or words to pray, I say, &#8220;Jesus, please pray for me&#8221;. He understands my infirmities better, He has been in my shoes. And who understands better\u00a0 both sides of heaven operations and earthly operations? Jesus does, 1 Timothy 2:5, &#8220;For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus&#8221;. What are you facing today that you just don&#8217;t know or have no strength to pray about it? Do you know that you can call on the greatest intercessor to intercede for you because He knows your situation better? I am facing some challenges I need Him to pray for me cause I just don&#8217;t know how to.

Samuel then went to Ramah.<\/p>\n<p>Can you imagine if one were a king, but had no kingdom?\u00a0 This is where David found himself for a time, when he was first anointed to be the King of Israel.\u00a0 The prophet Samuel was in mourning for Saul, the current one in the position of king, because Saul had been disobedient to God.\u00a0 The Lord had taken the Kingdom away from Saul (1 Sam 15:28) to give it to another better than Saul.\u00a0 That other person became none other than David.\u00a0 At this point David had been a shepherd boy, he did not have a fancy resume&#8217; that &#8220;qualified&#8221; him to be king.\u00a0 However I appreciate the word that I&#8217;ve heard Evans often say to people, &#8220;God does not call the qualified, He qualifies the called.&#8221;\u00a0 David became a King without a kingdom for quite a number of years.\u00a0 Many seem to forget that although we are bound by time, God is not.\u00a0 Sometimes we also forget the following truths as well.<\/p>\n<p>1. God chooses whoever he wills &#8220;I have chosen one of his sons to be king.&#8221;\u00a0 God sets up authorities and God tears down authorities.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t forget who is really running the universe!\u00a0 God is still in charge, and there is still no authority greater than He.\u00a0 God will raise up whosoever He chooses.\u00a0 Ray Boltz sings a song which says, &#8220;when others see a shepherd boy, God may see a king.&#8221;\u00a0 God chose David, because of how God was going to work in David&#8217;s life.\u00a0 What has God chosen you for?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>2. God anoints His chosen vessel for His chosen will, &#8220;&#8230;Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him&#8230;&#8221;\u00a0 When God calls you for something, he will anoint you for the task.\u00a0 Even though David at this point was a king without a kingdom, he was still anointed for the position of king.\u00a0 This kind of thing boggles our minds especially in America because we are very selfish people.\u00a0 We want instant gratification.\u00a0 We have minute rice, instant coffee, TV diners, etc&#8230;.\u00a0 We are a microwave generation.\u00a0 God works more like a farmer that plants the seed, and over time, as we are bound by time, the change begins to take place.\u00a0 What ministry has God anointed you to?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>3. God will give you power, &#8220;&#8230;and from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came upon David in power.&#8221;\u00a0 If you want to see the character of a man, give him power.\u00a0 Many people want power for there own selfish purposes.\u00a0 However, God gives power to carry out His purposes.\u00a0 If God calls you, anoints, then He will empower you.\u00a0 That is why God has empowered the church with the Holy Spirit to be His witnesses.\u00a0 We need only to walk in the power He has given us to do the task He has called us to do.\u00a0 Are you walking in God&#8217;s power, anointed by Him, to accomplish His will for you?\u00a0 Jesus said, &#8220;But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&#8221;\u00a0 Are you seeking and saving the lost?\u00a0 God has given you a Kingdom, the Kingdom of God; your Father is a King which makes you royalty.\u00a0 Now GO and serve your King in obedience!<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<br \/>\nPastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Sam 16:1 The LORD said to Samuel, &#8220;How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel?

It does not make sense but that is the simple instruction, faith in the basics. They didn&#8217;t have to do anything, only look and you will live. Killed by serpents or delivered by a serpent both brought by God.<\/p>\n<p>What puzzles me is why God would use a serpent when in the bible often times the serpent is in reference to evil. Remember in the garden the devil inform of a serpent was cursed. We know for sure that there is nothing good in us, in fact the bible says, &#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things, and DESPERATELY WICKED&#8221; Jeremiah 17:9 which would mean, we are destroyed by cursed evil poisonous venom already sipping through our system chocking out whatever life is left. The bible continues to say, &#8220;a soul that sins shall die&#8221; Ezekiel 18:20. Is this not clear that we can die slowly having been bitten by the serpent sin and the only way to live is to look at another serpent lifted up on a pole? We can understand the serpent that kills, the dilemma we have is the serpent hanged on the pole . Would we say God is associating Himself to a serpent? Of course we know the serpent on the pole is a symbol of deliverance but why a serpent lifted up on a pole?<\/p>\n<p>Jesus comes later in the NT and refers back to the serpent Moses made and raised up on the pole. John 3:14 14 And as Moses lifted up the<br \/>\nserpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life&#8221;. Now the symbol of the serpent on the tree is becoming clear, the Israelites needed the serpent of bronze on the pole to live, we needed Jesus being lifted up on the cross and dying for us to be saved but how can a serpent have similarity to Jesus? The first serpent talks of evil, the made serpent talks of judgment and it hanging on the pole symbolizes Jesus hanging on the cross the one that bore all our sins. 2 Corinthians 5:21, &#8220;For He made Him who knew no sin TO BE SIN FOR US, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him&#8221;. He identified with us and on the cross, He became sin for us without Him sinning that we would be saved. The reason the Father could not look at Him directly was because of our sin on him identifying with us. While on earth, Jesus always referred to God as His Father, I don&#8217;t recall reading that He ever referred to Him as &#8220;My God&#8221; until when he was crucified that you hear it, Matthew 27:46, &#8220;&#8230;Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, &#8220;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?&#8221; that is, &#8220;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221;. This shows us a picture of how sin separated us completely from God, it took away His presence for us. For our sin to diminish and live, Jesus in the image of a man had to be lifted up on the cross (pole). In John 12:32, &#8220;And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to Myself.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Numbers 21:9 &#8220;So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, he lived&#8221;. We have all been bitten by the fiery serpent of sin (our nature of sin) and some of us have already looked to the serpent on the pole (Jesus who knew no sin made to be sin for us) and we have\u00a0 been saved by repenting of our sins and putting our trust in Jesus alone for our eternal salvation, what about you who has not done that, what are you waiting for? Tomorrow is promised to no one, today is the day of salvation. If you died in your sins, God will be forced to give you judgment unless Jesus on the cross bore your sins. Under the killing serpent you have no hope, under delivering serpent, there is hope for eternity.

There are times they trusted God, then moved from trust to murmuring and complaining. Always comparing their current situation to the old. I don&#8217;t think of any people that God perfomed miraccles in their midst like the israelites. The miracles God performed for them were not small miracles. If anything, the big miracles should have boosted their faith but as we know, it only did for a short time then they forgot and went back to murmering and complaining. It&#8217;s interesting to note that whatever they asked of God, God provided. One instant appears in Numbers 21 where the Canaanite&#8217;s fought against Israel taking some of them as prisoners, looking at the situation, Israel made a vow to destory their cities if God delivered them in their hands to which God hearkened to their prayers and they urttely destoryed the Canaanites.<\/p>\n<p>As they journedyed, once again the people became discouraged, spoke against Moses and God about no water, no food even though they had food, they were now calling it worthless ffood. God Almighty had provided, had worked miracles, had gone before them by night as a pillar of fire and by day as a cloud of wind. What else would God do for them?. Before they spoke against Moses but as time went by, they moved from just speaking against Moses but also against God. 6 So the LORD sent fiery serpents (venomous snakes) among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died.They may have faced some challenges on the way but not challenges that took away life. I&#8217;m yet to come across where they sat down and thank God for everyhting He had done for them. I was wondering why serpents and he is what I thought about, it was like God saying, &#8220;If you think your situation is bad, I can make it worse, I&#8217;m in control of everything&#8221;, the fiery serpents bit the Israelites and they died in great numbers. So what happens, vs. 7 The people came to Moses and said, &#8220;We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray that the LORD will take the snakes away from us.&#8221; So Moses prayed for the people&#8221;.(NIV) In looking at the way God treated the Israelites, I will say they were really spoiled. Anything they wanted and asked for, God provided but watch this, this time when they admitted they had sinned against both God and Moses, they asked Moses to pray that God takes away the snakes from them. In other words, not God&#8217;s will but their will, after all anything they asked they received, well God had a different plan.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 8 &#8220;Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.&#8221; This is a clean indication of God sending the Israelites back to basics of faith. In Egypt for 400 years they believed God would send a deliverer. That was the faith they had and stood on. There was no clear indication of God coming through for them but they held on. The things God did later for them did not boost their faith and I can imagine the Lord taking them back to the days of humble beginning. The message from the Lord to Moses was simple, the situation would not change (the snakes would continue to bite and kill), the Lord made a way of escape through a made serpent hanging on a pole. Anyone bit if looked at it recovered. Simple faith, God taking the foolish thing, something that is humbling and using it to humble a stubborn people. Like the Israelites, we may not complain and murmur audibly but out actions speaks it clearly. Our eyes are so closed to what God has done that we complain about what we have maybe calling it worthless and getting discouraged on the way because we want things our way. Yes you can point the days the Lord did exactly what you asked of Him, what happens when He changes the way He answers your prayers? When will we learn that God owes us nothing, as a matter of fact, we owe it all to Him. He has blessed us in spite of, we complain and murmur yet he is patient with us. We speak against those that lead us like Moses. May the Lord help us.

(Mark 14:33-36)<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned in Take it Away Part 1, I found the trilogy the Lord of the Rings by J.R. Tolkien to have a great parallel to Christ in the Garden. Just as the character Frodo Baggins was given a burden to carry that no other could carry for him, Jesus could not ultimately give to another to carry out for Him. Not my will but thy will be done was the prayer of Jesus. Not only did Jesus ask three times for something to be taken away from Him, but so did His servant The Apostle Paul.<\/p>\n<p>Paul writes in 2 Cor. 12, &#8220;And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. 8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. 9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ&#8217;s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.&#8221; God knew that Satan was going to buffet Paul and allowed it to occur anyway. This buffeting means to beat black and blue, to smite so as to cause bruises and livid spots. This is like a boxer that buffets his body, handles it roughly, discipline it by hardships. As metaphor it to give one intolerable annoyance to beat one out, or wear one out (The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible).<\/p>\n<p>We read here that Paul prayed and Christ responded by reminding Paul that the grace that Christ gave to Paul was to sustain him when the messenger of Satan beat on him. Many have a wrapped understanding of what grace truly is. Grace is God&#8217;s unmerited favor, which Paul had been given because Paul was called by God for such a time as this to accomplish God&#8217;s will amidst a time when preaching Christ was punishable by physical torture. Recall Paul&#8217;s conversion on the road to Damascus, Paul too was on his way to be the thorn in the flesh to many Christians. Then Jesus converted His heart reminding Paul that it is hard to kick against the pricks. He was telling Paul, the more that you kick against Me the more you are being like a stupid ox that kicks against its wagon in its stubbornness only to actually be kicking the huge nail that sticks out from the wagon. The more Paul kicked the more that he was hurting himself. Now the more Paul is experiencing the thorn in the flesh, the attack of Satan, the more Christ is supplying the grace that Paul needs to endure. Life is certainly not easy, dare I say most of the time. There actually is a purpose to our trials, but we focus on the beating that we feel, rather then look to the beating that Christ endured to supply grace to us in or time of need.<\/p>\n<p>We forget that we see through a glass darkly (1 Cor. 13:12) Paul writes, &#8220;For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal (2 Corinthians 4:17-18 NIV).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When Paul prayed take it away, Christ answered take my grace which is sufficient to use on the very thing you want taken away. Christ uses our pains to show Himself strong in our lives. Think of Joseph in prison, Daniel in the lions den, and countless others. What will be your story as you experience your thorn in the flesh?

What strikes is a pair of doves lived in that desert, a rare case that not many times one hears! One day a heavy storm broke and the doves were disillusioned as to how would they go out to get their food, even if it meant dry tweeds from wild plants and worried to leave the nest with their newly born chicks. It was heavy showers of rain for hours, thunders, uncontrolled and untamed loud screaming wind blowing madly from here to there, it began to get cold and dark, the little doves were home with their chicks, sheltering them under their wings, warming them.<\/p>\n<p>The chicks were quivering from hunger, they hadn&#8217;t eaten for a few hours now, their young &amp; fragile wings were wet with rain water and the nest had been blown from its place to edge of the tree due to heavy winds. The doves were in the midst of a trauma, something like this had never happened in the desert land where they lived all their lives &#8211; this was rather phenomenal , irrespective they were heart-broken and worried, desperate for the showers to stop, their thirst was long quenched but they were getting more severely hungry now, drooping below to cover ever so closely their children from falling off the nest.<\/p>\n<p>The female dove looked at the male dove, as if asking him to miraculously stop the winds- wondering and hopeful that something would happen &#8211; The male dove rose up, fluttered his wings, leaving his chicks beneath him there, and his beloved, he flew out and above to the open sky while the rain still poured, he rested on a naked branch and prayed &#8211; Lord, you are the maker of heaven and earth and all in between, thank-you for the rain Lord for this desert became more than a graveyard, not a leaf to bring home to my children &#8211; Though it may look dark and spooky, and thunders may hurt their ears but we know you are a faithful God that loves us beyond measure and knows what he is doing and is in control, so I pray Lord and thank you again, though I&#8217;m too small before your wonders and might but I believe that where I am right now is just the right place that you have chosen me to be. For where there&#8217;s the desert that&#8217;s the only place where I can long for water, for where there&#8217;s barrenness, that&#8217;s where I hope for fruits. Lord I see that if I was not in this place, amidst this situation, I would not know what rain means. Thank-you again for hope for tomorrow Lord.<\/p>\n<p>We are like these little doves, wherever we are, we may feel like we are in a desert, we maybe panting and thirsty for something different, for a change, a hike, a job change, a boss change etc. etc but God knows us since He created us and He assured that He is &#8220;faithful&#8221; &#8211; He knows what&#8217;s best for us today and tomorrow. It will be the same sun that will shine tomorrow, same moon that will light the sky , everything will look like it was from before but its only God&#8217;s blessings that renew every morning.<\/p>\n<p>Lamentations 3:22 &#8220;Because of the LORD&#8217;s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.&#8221;23 They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. Instead of waiting for tomorrow, count your blessings today, count them now for &#8220;now&#8221; is what matters! If you really have to wait then wait on Jesus &#8211; Matthew8:27 &#8220;Even the winds and the waves obey him!&#8221; Lamentations 3:24 I say to myself, &#8220;The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him.&#8221; Lamentations3:25 The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him.<\/p>\n<p>Conclude- Matthew 6:34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Wait patiently for God to instruct you until you receive your rain showers.<\/p>\n<p>It is written in the Bible about what God said to Us: Matthew 6:25 &#8220;Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?<\/p>\n<p>Matthew 6:28 &#8220;And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you?<\/p>\n<p>By Peggy Hawk<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Once there was a pair of doves living in the wilderness, not knowing where they would get their next season of rain in the desert land where they were naturally born &#8211; This was a dry, hot and desolate place, no food, no water &#8211; Total hopelessness &#8211; They longed for a difference, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-607","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-9N","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/607","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=607"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/607\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=607"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=607"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=607"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":606,"date":"2007-01-25T14:50:57","date_gmt":"2007-01-25T14:50:57","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/01\/25\/the-cost-of-being-blessed-part-2-by-sis-marina\/"},"modified":"2007-01-25T14:55:59","modified_gmt":"2007-01-25T14:55:59","slug":"the-cost-of-being-blessed-part-2-by-sis-marina","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/01\/25\/the-cost-of-being-blessed-part-2-by-sis-marina\/","title":{"rendered":"The cost of being blessed part, 2, By Sis&nbsp;Marina"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<br \/>\nThis devotional spoke volumes to my spirit and I pray that it speaks to your spirit also&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;we are in a race and staying focused on the prize is the ultimate goal&#8230;.read and be blessed and encouraged&#8230;.. I Corinthians 9:24&#8230;..&#8221;Run to win.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Seasoned long-distance runners have learned to focus on endurance, not just speed. They pace themselves so that as they approach the finish line they can pull out all the stops. Paul says, &#8220;I&#8217;m running hard for the finish line&#8230;.giving it everything I&#8217;ve got&#8230;..I&#8217;m not going to get caught&#8230;.telling everyone else&#8230;.then missing out myself&#8221; (I Cor. 9:26-27). For spiritual long distance runners, quitting isn&#8217;t an option. Despite some delays and disappointment along the way, they know they&#8217;d never be satisfied just sitting on the sidelines cheering for those who have paid the price to run the race. So if you&#8217;re that kind of person&#8212; one who needs to attain the hope of your calling and fulfill your God-ordained purpose&#8212;go for it! And don&#8217;t forget, Jesus said, &#8220;Great gifts mean great responsibilities&#8221; (Luke 12:48). Winning will cost you in terms of pressure, criticism, loneliness and sacrifice.<\/p>\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the secret to staying power? Paul said, &#8220;Jesus&#8230;.finished this race&#8230;.because He never lost sight of where He was headed&#8230;.He could put up with anything&#8221; (Hebrews 12:2). You&#8217;ll only endure the pain when you&#8217;ve something to look forward to. God exposes us to opposition and criticism to strengthen our character. That way when greater blessings (and responsibilities) come, we wont crack. Success comes only when you&#8217;re committed and have the passion to cross the finish line. So the questions is: can you stand to be blessed? When the pressure is on, will you say like Nehemiah, &#8221; My work is too important to stop&#8221; (Neh 6:3)? If your answer is yes, get your eye on the goal, &#8220;RUN TO WIN&#8221; and you&#8217;re sure to cross the finish line!<\/p>\n<p>Our pray today is : Almighty and heavenly Father, we know that we are in a race and the goal is our prize from you saying&#8221; WELL DONE, GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT&#8230;.but we know that the enemy will throw all sorts of things in our way to steer us away from you and your purpose, I pray that we continue to stay focused and know that you are faithful and more than able to continue the work that you have started in us and through us. Be blessed and stay in the race. Amen. Sis Marina<\/p>\n<p>Please keep the following needs in prayers.

But they thought to do me mischief. 3 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? (Nehemiah 6:1 &#8211; 3)<\/p>\n<p>What distracts you? When you sit in a class or at church and are trying to be focused what are the things that draw your attention away? When you are at work and trying to diligently stay on task, what tends to deviate you from your task? Nehemiah was in a situation whereby he was doing a task for God, rebuilding the wall of the temple, and a distraction came to try to divert him from his task. Nehemiah said, &#8220;Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) (6:1)&#8221; He was busy working diligently for God. Nehemiah teaches us about being diligent and how to stay on task for the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>1. Distraction will try to trap you. &#8220;Come let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono.&#8221; Ono was located seven miles southeast of Joppa near Lod (Lydda). It may have been proposed as a kind of neutral territory, but Nehemiah recognized the invitation as a trap. Temptation will always try to draw you away, and trap you, from what God has called you to do. Some are easily distracted at the slightest thing when it comes to being committed to God&#8217;s work, but Nehemiah recognized the trap. These enemies tried distract Nehemiah and take him away from his task.<\/p>\n<p>2. Distractions display disobedience. &#8220;But they thought to do me mischief.&#8221; The purpose of those trying to distract Nehemiah was to divert him from the task. Temptation (distraction) itself is not sin, but yielding to it is. Perhaps they wanted Nehemiah to go out to eat, or to have &#8220;fellowship&#8221; with him. If Nehemiah went to Ono he would be seven miles away from the task at hand. However he sensed that they were scheming against him. Nehemiah was being diligent and obedient to the Lord&#8217;s work.<\/p>\n<p>3. Distraction must be met with Determination &#8220;&#8230;I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease. Nehemiah was doing a GREAT WORK for the Lord, building the wall of the Temple for Him. When his three would be distractions tried to divert him from his task, he said, I CANNOT COME DOWN. He couldn&#8217;t find it in his heart to allow his diligence to be sidetracked, or even slowed down. I picture Nehemiah working and talking at the same time, sending the messenger with his determined word for his enemies, that he refused to come down off the wall to go seven miles away from his ministry. Do you have that kind of commitment to laboring in ministry, whether you are paid or not (as I am not, as Evans is not) for ministry? Nehemiah then gives his reason for not being diverted when he asked, &#8220;WHY SHOULD THE WORK CEASE?&#8221; Why should our ministry for the Lord cease? Many distractions will try to lure you to trap you and cause you to be disobedient to God. Nehemiah met distraction with determination. &#8220;WHY SHOULD I LEAVE AND COME DOWN TO YOU.&#8221; If Nehemiah would have gone he would have placed his distraction on a higher priority than God&#8217;s work.

We have always encouraged but only few have responded. Be a blessing as you are being blessed. Ev<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it&#8211;&#8221; Luke 14:28 (KJV)<\/p>\n<p>How many times have you prayed for a specific thing without realizing how much it would ultimately cost you? Success always comes with a price tag. Being blessed can be such hard work. Everything God gives us requires maintenance. When He placed Adam and Eve in the garden, they had to take care of it. Jesus said when you are &#8220;planning to build&#8230;.sit down and figure the cost.&#8221; For example, when God blesses you, don&#8217;t expect everyone around you to be happy for you and congratulate you on being blessed because it doesn&#8217;t happen that way at all. Some people figure that your blessing came at their expense. That&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t want you to move ahead faster then they do, they are envious and jealous of your prosperity and blessings. The real reason why this happens is that they want what God has given to you, but they&#8217;re not prepared to pay the price that you have paid for this\/these blessings.<\/p>\n<p>James says, &#8220;For where envy and self-seeking exists, confusion and every evil thing are there.&#8221; (James 3:16). And it is not just your enemies that you have to watch our for; betrayal often comes from within your own ranks or within your own circle of friend, sisters\/brothers in Christ and the like. Jesus sat at the table with John, the beloved on one side and Judas the betrayer on the other. One was close enough to lay his head on Jesus&#8217; breast while the other had sufficient access to betray Him with a kiss. You need to know who&#8217;s sitting at your table or who&#8217;s in your circle!<\/p>\n<p>However, as painful or hurtful as it is to be criticized by people you respect and trust, it&#8217;s worst to go astray from the course God&#8217;s made for you to travel in order to gain their acceptance and friendship and such. As good as it feels to be affirmed and recognized, at some point in time, you need to stop and ask yourself, &#8220;How much am I willing to sacrifice to be blessed?&#8221; Your answer will determine your destiny!<\/p>\n<p>Prayer: Lord God, keep me focused and stayed on you for I am humbling myself to be your servant and to stay in this race, help me to not go astray from your purpose and will for my life. I pray that anything that you see in me that shows envy or jealousy, remove it from me and place contentment for what I have and encouragement for my fellow man&#8230;&#8230;.help me to stay in the race and count all costs&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;in Jesus&#8217; Name&#8230;&#8230;.AMEN.

He takes care of that which He has started. I wish many more people would take marriage seriously like He does. Proverbs 18:22, &#8220;He who finds a wife finds a good thing, And obtains favor from the LORD&#8221;. Let&#8217;s see what favor one obtains from the Lord when he or she is married.<\/p>\n<p>The story of Abraham and his wife fascinates me. The bible talks about Abraham being 75 years old in Genesis 12 and just like women&#8217;s age are not always disclosed, the bible does not give us Sarah&#8217;s age and all the women said, &#8220;AMEN&#8221;. We can definitely rule out that she wasn&#8217;t very young as her age was not far from Abraham&#8217;s. What amazes me is that even at her age which could be around 60&#8217;s, she was still pretty, good looking, beautiful, a knock out. What does this mean, that which God has started, He preserves the wife of your youth. Psalms 103:5, &#8220;Who satisfies your mouth with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle&#8217;s&#8221;. You will agree with me that there are certain people you went to school with who look aged, why? because some worries has caused them to age quickly. When you are in the Lord and you are a touched to a bless Vine, your beauty will always shine cause He will be renewing you everyday for your husband.<\/p>\n<p>Abraham in Genesis 12 comes to Egypt with a beautiful wife and he knows that the people of Egypt might kill him and take his wife. So he makes an agreement with her to pretend to be his sister. Pharaoh tries to take Sarah to be his wife and God brought so many plagues and calamities in Pharaoh&#8217;s kingdom. Another favor, God will protect the married. I see Abraham&#8217;s little weakness not being able to stand strong to defend his wife, but God goes a head to fight for his wife. I know many feel scared that someone would pounce and hit on their wives. Scared that some one could snatch them away but I believe God will protect when husbands release their wives in God&#8217;s hands. After 15 more years, Abraham is now 90, comes to Gerar, Abimelech&#8217;s territory and Sarah is still the bomb. Once again Abraham agrees with her to call her his sister. Abimelech desires to take another man&#8217;s wife without knowing. Watch this, Genesis 20:3, &#8220;&#8230;God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, &#8220;Indeed you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man&#8217;s wife.&#8221; When Abraham could not fight and defend his wife God did and would not allow any man to touch his wife. Someone might say, &#8220;It seams as if God is only fighting for the women, how about those men who also find themselves in situations&#8221;. Abimelech launched a complaint saying that Abraham deceived him into thinking that Sarah was his sister. Had he known, he would have not desired someone&#8217;s wife. I love God&#8217;s response, Genesis 20:6, &#8220;And God said to him in a dream, &#8220;Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her&#8221;. Wives, God will protect your husbands from sinning against God. He will bring His convictions, lead them in the right track that all his attention will be on no one but you. Even if you are not married yet Abraham, know that God is protecting your Sarah somewhere and no man will lay his hands on her for God is saving her for you. If your are Sarah, know that God will protect you from predators like Pharaoh and Abimelech keeping you safe and sound for your Abraham.<\/p>\n<p>Your youth can be renewed everyday because you&#8217;ve learned to trust God with your companion. Instead of worrying on what could happen to the<br \/>\none you love and who could be eyeing him or her, you got to keep praying for one another to keep you safe and sound.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<br \/>\nEv<br \/>\nGod&#8217;s servant<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Thought of sharing a message I shared on back in 04, be blessed.

It is rare where we work, on the roads with motorists, at times with parents and kids, husbands and wives. Less or no kindness in the department stores. There are a few I&#8217;m scared of dealing with, they are not kind at all. Ever been somewhere seeking help only to be rude to? your presence was not noticed at all, got a lousy service? I have. How about on the phone? Giving the best service hoping that in return you get one right there or some other time then it does not happen. I tend to hear this line a lot, &#8220;What&#8217;s the point of being kind when you don&#8217;t get it in return&#8221;. Can&#8217;t even smile at anyone because of what they did to you or what someone else did to you. Kindness does not look at who is right or wrong, it looks for opportunities to make a difference in a person&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p>Kindness is having feelings befitting our common nature. It&#8217;s also showing tenderness or goodness, being considerate and helpful. Why do we have a world where people will want to help you only when have some serious needs but on a day to day basis, that&#8217;s hard? You can give money to charity but cannot help your colleague who needs help to accomplish one thing for the day in your department. Seeking small help but put on hold for hours because it wasn&#8217;t very necessary to help you at that time. It does disturb me to be in a position that you cannot face certain people because you already know who they are and their character. Facing them means, either you will come back miserable or be given a look or a comment that makes you wonder why you had to be there to seek their help in the first place. Kindness is not about what you can gain out of a situation but an opportunity to lighten someone&#8217;s day. Someone might not need a help from you but a soft answer is an act of kindness. The bible says I believe in Proverbs, that a soft answer turns away wrath. Ephesians 4:29, &#8220;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for the necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers&#8221;. I don&#8217;t see the need why one should be kind to someone in their presence and speak evil things behind their back. If you stepped in to help, help with a true heart, desiring to do it because you know it is the right thing to do. When you walk to a department store and you see something on the floor, picking it up and putting it on the shelf is an act of kindness. I know we can have this thought, &#8221; why should I\u00a0 when someone is paid to pick it up, I&#8217;m just a customer?&#8221;. We many times make things complicated for nothing. Proverbs 19:22, &#8220;What is desired in a man is kindness&#8230;&#8221;, what a way to summarize what people out there need. Proverbs 31:26 talks about a virtues woman as a woman who on her tongue is the law of kindness.<\/p>\n<p>Kindness also goes with appreciation. It&#8217;s good to appreciate someone who has done good job. Giving honor to where honor is due. It&#8217;s a terrible thing to snatch things and leave. If someone does something for even if it&#8217;s their job description or deserve it, it&#8217;s good to be kind and appreciate their good work, thank them. This is an encouragement that their work is not taken in vain. I have been learning more on the art of kindness and how it affects people. Some time ago I took time to send kind words to everyone in my department, highlighting each one&#8217;s strength, ability and how those have impacted me as a worker. Those words really touched each of them, made a difference. Kind words softens the heart and makes the heart merry. How often do you and I take time to appreciate someone, say kind words for having helped not just people who went out of their way but even people who did what they were suppose to do.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever we do, we do it unto the Lord, 2Peter 1:7, &#8220;to godliness brotherly kindness, and brotherly kindness love&#8221;. It is a good thing to be kind to all manner of people everywhere. It may not be a big deal to you but the person who receives it values and cherishes it. That is what Paul is telling us, Ephesians 4:32, &#8220;And be kind to one another, tender hearted, &#8230;&#8221;. Note that he is not giving guidelines as to which type of people in what type of circumstances. Any time you are dealing with any type of person, exercise your act of kindness. It could be a smile, act of service, soft answer, good directions, stepping out of your way to give a hand etc. You never know what kind of impact you could be making in someone&#8217;s life. Maybe they have been having a terrible day and you could be the one to change their day by your act of kindness. I know of people who cannot even greet you, go out of your way and greet them. Do it unto others before they do it unto you, make compliments without complicating things, send notes to them or their bosses to appreciate their good work.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Ephesians 4:32, &#8220;And be kind to one another, &#8230;&#8221; Kindness is rare in our world today.

At times men can be insensitive, arrogant and pushy not caring about the feelings of other people especially their wives. It&#8217;s amazing how easy it is to be nice to everyone but the one you love and married to, Te whole reason HONORING the wife becomes hard. Peter tells us to give HONOR to our wives, other bible versions say RESPECT. I feel that HONOR goes far beyond respect. We often see honor given to whoever honor is due and also given to those who have earned it. In our case, it&#8217;s not about giving honor because they deserve it, but because the bible says so. I could break H.O.N.O.R in this way, H is for Help, O for Openness, N for Nurture, O for Observant, R for Romance and Respect.<\/p>\n<p>HELP &#8211; Husbands, our wives need our help be it with the housework, with the children, run errands. We are Honoring God and our wives when we step in to help in whichever way we can to make their work easy. Even Christ, the demonstration of a husband to the church also helps us in our day to day live. Some husbands have a bad mentality that some jobs are left for wives therefore they will not step in to help even if the wife needs it. We are all created equal and yes there are some things expected of the wife that does not mean husbands are exempt from them. We can love by demonstrating.<\/p>\n<p>OPENNESS &#8211; It&#8217;s hard for husbands to be open and real. Our wives feel they are part of our lives when we open up to them on what we are facing a day to day basis. A wife can be frustrated when she knows that her husband is facing a challenge but not willing to trust her with his feelings. I believe your wife can feel honored when she knows that her husband can confide in her and not feel his manly hood is threatened by his vulnerability. This would also go with spending time with our wives. They want us to engage them conversations, a feeling of closeness and belonging.<\/p>\n<p>NURTURE &#8211; A wife feels honored when she feels that he husband is out to protect, support and encourage her. Bringing out the best in her without belittling her or treating her as dirt. See the verse says, &#8220;giving HONOR to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, &#8220;, mark the word, &#8220;WEAKER&#8221;, it doesn&#8217;t say WEAK which would mean that though they are strong, husbands are much stronger than them and that strength is to be used to make them feel safe and comfortable and not superior. We can nurture with gentle words, thoughtful gifts, by helping them develop their inner beauty.<\/p>\n<p>OBSERVANT &#8211; Every wife will agree they feel honored when their husbands are observant, taking notice and complementing the good things they do,\u00a0 be it cooking, fixing their hair, dressing, taking keen interest in their day to day activities.<\/p>\n<p>ROMANTIC &#8211; In the light of love other gifts they may flower but love is the only power. Marriage ought to be exiting and fun despite some other things that come up. Some feel that marriage is a trap, some have chosen singleness and called it freedom. Those who are happily married know it different, they have learnt that it is a commitment. They have learnt that God is glorified in their marriage when they are committed to it and they do whatever it takes to loves and respect their spouses. We have to learn to love more, be affectionate, warm, tender, admiring and showing it by our treatment. Going out of our way to hug, cherish, speak words of love, send love notes, surprise dinner home cooked or outing. Our wives can feel honored.<\/p>\n<p>There is more about honoring that we could get into but let me stop with this line again, In the light of love other gifts they may flower but love is the only power. We can see new gifts flower as we honor our wives in the way that pleases God. By the way, Husbands if you don&#8217;t honor your wife, forget about your prayers being answered, the bible says so. We have a job to do!!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Peter 3:7 &#8220;Husbands, likewise, dwell with them (wives) with understanding, giving HONOR to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered&#8221; We as husbands are called to dwell with our wives with understanding to which I will [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-624","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-a4","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/624","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=624"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/624\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=624"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=624"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=624"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":623,"date":"2007-01-17T14:52:33","date_gmt":"2007-01-17T14:52:33","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/01\/17\/take-it-away-by-pastor-phil\/"},"modified":"2007-01-17T14:52:33","modified_gmt":"2007-01-17T14:52:33","slug":"take-it-away-by-pastor-phil","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/01\/17\/take-it-away-by-pastor-phil\/","title":{"rendered":"Take It Away, by Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.

In this Garden Jesus cried out three times to God to take something away from Him. Jesus desired that &#8220;this cup&#8221; be taken from Him. Recall when Christ was at the Lord&#8217;s Supper with His twelve, and he proclaimed that the cup was the cup of His blood, the cup of the New Covenant. In His humanity, He did not want to go through with the cross. Did God take the cup from His only Son at the request of Jesus? No he did not. Why does God not take that thing from us at times that we so desire Him to take from us? What is God showing us?<\/p>\n<p>First, THERE IS A MISSION TO ACCOMPLISH. Jesus had a mission to accomplish, and if God were to take away the cup, then Jesus would have not fulfilled His mission. God has given a mission to each one of His children to accomplish. However you may want God to take away the &#8220;cup&#8221; from you, whatever your cup is. If God were to take it away how would you accomplish the mission that God set out for you? Do you know the mission that He has called you to? If your desire is to please the One that has called you, then you may ask Him to remove something from you, but His desire is for you to fulfill your mission, and somehow that thing that perhaps you may despise may be the very thing that God needs to use to fulfill His will in you.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, A SORROWFUL SOUL HONORS GOD. I&#8217;ve heard it said that the soul is described as the mind, will and the emotions. There are two types of sorrow, godly sorrow and worldly sorrow. Jesus&#8217; soul possessed a sorrowful at having to drink from the cup that He desired to be taken from Him. Although your soul may be sorrowful, God knows that He is not giving you too much that you can&#8217;t handle with His hand upon your life. The Scriptures says that Jesus sweat great drops of blood, as He was under such tremendous pressure to do the Will of His Father.<\/p>\n<p>Thirdly, YOU HAVE CLOSE FRIENDS, BUT THE CUP (BURDEN) IS YOURS. Jesus had his three inner circle, Peter, James, and John nearby. Although they meant well, and were even in the Garden with Him, Jesus went through the heart anguish alone, with His Father. There may be those that mean well, there may be those that are close, but you find them sleeping as you are struggling. I believe that the three meant to stay awake and pray for Jesus, but their strength couldn&#8217;t carry themselves let alone Jesus Christ. Have you ever experienced those closest to you perhaps desired to help, they were there for you, they journeyed with you into places and at times others would not dare go with you? These are the ones that if they knew how to take &#8220;the cup&#8221; from you, probably would, but God would not dare allow them to take it. I am reminded of Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as He struggled with the mission of destroying the ring of evil. Jesus struggled to eradicate sin and redeem humanity from the curse of the Law and the power of Satan. Do you desire others to take the cup from you? Realize that your closest loved ones can&#8217;t take it, because it is not theirs to take, God gave it to you.

No sensible person would want to labor in a field they feel will not yield anything to them. How can you have a dream that appears to give you a dead end promise yet still hold on? I am trying to understand what kept Joseph standing.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nJoseph had a dream as described in Genesis 37, a dream of greatness. A dream showing that his family would one day bow before him. It was a dream that suggested that people would serve him. A dream that was full of life and hope. What was there to stop this dream from coming to pass? at that time there seamed nothing until his angry brothers who tried to kill him sold him as a slave. As a slave, he served Portiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, a dream going the opposite direction. Later thrown in prison after being lied on.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe last place a person with a dream wants to find him or herself is in prison. Prison takes away your freedom, puts a restraint on you, slows you down, puts you on halt, limits you. It appears to be a dead end something you may be feeling this morning concerning your job, marriage, ministry. Like Joseph, you found yourself in some type of prison while in pursuit of your dream with no hope to progress any further. You can see God elevating everyone else but you. In stead of the Lord sending people to help you, He is sending people to you to help them and some that you&#8217;ve helped forgot about you. Joseph interpreted dreams for Pharaoh&#8217;s butler and baker and their dreams came true while his dream had not been fulfilled and he said to the butler in Genesis 40:14, &#8220;But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house&#8221;.\u00a0 The bible says in vs. 23 Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him&#8221;. In prison for two more years after the first dreams were fulfilled and the butler restored. He is finally remembered when Pharaoh had a dream and when no one could interpret, he did.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nWhat is the message behind this story, I believe Joseph was learning about serving and not being served. This is in line with Isaiah 40, &#8220;But they that WAIT upon the Lord&#8230;&#8221;, I used to think that the wait here meant to continue as one is in expectation of then I learnt that &#8220;WAIT&#8221; here was equivalent to a waiter or waitress waiting (serving) people. Joseph&#8217;s strength was in the waiting (serving) knowing he was serving God in every state. If you read the story again, you will learn that his blessing did not come about till he had served others. Which tells me that God cares about us putting other people&#8217;s needs first, that if you want to be great in God&#8217;s kingdom then you have to learn to be a servant of all. God referred to the prophets and leaders in the bible not by their titles but called them servants based on serving others. That is where their strength was, that is what keep them standing, that is what renewed their strength. &#8220;&#8230;they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint&#8221;. Joseph learnt to sow above what he was facing and not fly away. He could not be weary in his run neither could he faint in his walk , he learnt to wait. When he got to the top, guess he continued to do, he waited. Some today cannot go any further because they have not learnt to serve others which is selfishness if you look at it to which I have learnt that unless we understand that whatever God is doing in our lives, He has someone else in mind to tap into what He is doing. If God is going to bless you, raise you, fulfill your dream, it&#8217;s not just about you but about some people He has in mind. If God is going to anoint you, it&#8217;s not for you to feel good about being anointed, the anointing is to serve others. God First, Others second, You third.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Isaiah 40:31, &#8220;But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint&#8221;. \u00a0 It&#8217;s easy to do something when what to expect as the outcome especially if you know it&#8217;s [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-622","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-a2","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/622","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=622"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/622\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=622"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=622"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=622"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":621,"date":"2007-01-12T14:48:21","date_gmt":"2007-01-12T14:48:21","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/01\/12\/the-sure-foundation-is-christ-part-2\/"},"modified":"2007-01-12T14:48:21","modified_gmt":"2007-01-12T14:48:21","slug":"the-sure-foundation-is-christ-part-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/01\/12\/the-sure-foundation-is-christ-part-2\/","title":{"rendered":"The Sure Foundation Is Christ, Part&nbsp;2"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>1Corinthians 3:1-23,\u00a0 &#8220;vs11 For no one can lay any foundation other<br \/>\nthan the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221; NIV<\/p>\n<p>We defined foundation and looked at how possible at times it is to look to man as foundation rather than look at man God uses to lay a foundation. At Corinth, Paul had laid a good foundation &#8220;Jesus Christ and Him crucified&#8221; but instead of them building on THIS foundation, they started trying to redefine the foundation which moved them from the spiritual growth to become carnal minded. Thank God that Paul came back to correct their understanding and thank God He is correcting the understanding of those who missed it.<\/p>\n<p>Paul laid a foundation, but he was not the foundation. Paul and Apollos were nothing, God was ALL. Without God, their labor was in vain. He says, &#8221; &#8220;vs11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221;. God has already laid His foundation on His word the bible, no one can go around and lay another foundation. Many Religions have tried over and over again to lay another foundation instead of building on THIS foundation laid. I refuse to be called a religious person simply because being born of God is not about religion but RELATIONSHIP. Many religion teach that you have to find your way to God by doing the so called good works while Christianity based on the word of God teaches that it&#8217;s only by grace we are saved. Grace lays the foundation that we could never lay and there can be no other foundation again thereafter. Jesus said in John 14:6, &#8220;I am THE way and THE truth and THE life. No one comes to the Father except through me&#8221;. &#8220;THE&#8221; tells us that it&#8217;s only by Him the sure foundation comes about.<\/p>\n<p>10&#8243;By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert (master) builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds&#8221; The main work of a master builder is contribute knowledge rather than labor, if Paul had laid a foundation &#8220;Jesus Christ and Him crucified&#8221;, then now he is giving knowledge that they will need to build themselves while others also help them. He also warns them to be careful of how they build. How we each build matters, Paul writes, 12If any man builds on THIS foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, 13his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man&#8217;s work. 14If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. 15If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames. These verses challenge me because I understand that to build on THIS foundation, it&#8217;s not about happiness as many teach, it&#8217;s about something bigger than that, Romans 14:17 tells\u00a0 &#8221; for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men&#8221;. You can see that happiness is not a material towards building an everlasting building, righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit are THE KEY materials. Happiness comes and goes. The rest of good things are benefits for serving. So let&#8217;s build on THIS foundation with the KEYS that will survive the fire rather than benefits that will not. The KEY materials are the pillars that hold the building. So who is our sure foundation &#8220;Jesus Christ and Him Crucified&#8221;, therefore let&#8217;s be careful that we do not blindly exalt one that lay foundation and let&#8217;s be careful that the master builder gives us the right knowledge that we will use to build on THIS foundation. Let&#8217;s careful about how we build.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Corinthians 3:1-23,\u00a0 &#8220;vs11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221; NIV We defined foundation and looked at how possible at times it is to look to man as foundation rather than look at man God uses to lay a foundation.

The process and outcome of it is traced back to the foundation and\u00a0 how the foundation is laid will determine the basis on which a thing stands. Foundation is the defining moment of what we are made off. Parents try to lay a foundation for their children, husbands and wives try to establish a foundation for their marriage and so is a church, a corporation, schools etc. If the foundation is wrong, anything built on it may be crooked, not survive for long and is very dangerous. This is the whole reason it takes time to lay foundation. And from looking at how foundations are laid especially in buildings, it has to go down first before it comes up.<\/p>\n<p>Paul addressed Christians at Corinth not as spirited men, those who he believe to have matured. He found that the people who should have been growing were not because they were trying to define again the foundation already laid. Instead of building on what was already laid, they were still dealing with petty issues such as jealousies, quarrelling and divisions fighting over who to follow Paul or Apollos. I see this problem even today where people are disputing on whose teaching to go by, who to follow, causing the same problems Paul found at Corinth. If you don&#8217;t know and understand the foundation then like the Corinthians, you will try to establish a foundation laid by man. The problem is, man fails, what happens when your favorite preacher stumbles and falls, would you fall too If your foundation is laid on him, where will your destiny be?. What about you mentor, your spiritual leader.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a05, What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe-as the Lord has assigned to each<br \/>\nhis task (NIV). It&#8217;s interesting to note the &#8220;WHAT&#8221; used in this verse rather than &#8220;WHO&#8221;. &#8220;WHAT&#8221; addressed their laboring service as opposed<br \/>\nto &#8220;WHO&#8221; that addressed their personalities. Those who followed Paul might have chosen him because of his personality and style of doing<br \/>\nthings and so were those who followed Apollos. He reminds them that him and Apollos were channels through which they believed. Their<br \/>\nteaching was not for people to believe in them but the message they brought to them as assigned by God. Here is how he ties himself to<br \/>\nApollos,\u00a0 vs. 6, I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. 7,So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but<br \/>\nonly God, who makes things grow&#8221;. Paul and Apollos were both laborers, the controlling factor in what they were doing was LABORING and not<br \/>\nSUCCESS. Now I understand why Apollos ministry was not a threat to Paul&#8217;s he understood they were co laborers. Yes they were different in<br \/>\ntheir ministries but they were building on a foundation already laid. Today we see competition and insecurities among preachers, pastors,<br \/>\nleaders on who can be the most successful maybe business wise, size of congregation, size of budget, facilities and we can easily get sucked<br \/>\nin all these that we follow men&#8217;s teaching principals rather than God&#8217;s. The key factor in this chapter is God who MADE IT GROW. The<br \/>\nplanting by Paul and the watering by Apollos was nothing if God did not make it grow. This establishes this fact, &#8220;The creation and<br \/>\nfostering of faith is God&#8217;s work alone&#8221;. If a spiritual leader&#8217;s message and style is your foundation then you are trading on a very dangerous foundation.

Paul writing to the Romans he starts in chapter 12 by saying &#8220;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, ACCEPTABLE to God, &#8230;&#8221;. Could it be that the Romans thought their lives in were in line with God? Like the floor that was not sifted, everything looked ok on the outside until the sieve revealed, the same we see Paul doing here. He tells them to present their bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, the next thing is &#8220;do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and ACCEPTABLE and perfect will of God&#8221;. I keep emphasizing the word ACCEPTABLE because I see over and over in my life God exercising His will based on what is ACCEPTABLE. Paul takes the next three and half chapters teaching the Romans what is acceptable Romans 12, 13, 14, 15:1-8. This would mean, all these would pass through the sieve because they are acceptable to God.<\/p>\n<p>People tend to have their own definition of what is acceptable, the Word of God should be our source of knowing. Here is where whatever we are now asking, we are asking within the boundaries of what is acceptable. In re reading Romans 12:2, towards the end of the verse it says, &#8220;..that you may prove what is that good and acceptable&#8230;&#8221;, we have done that based on His word, here comes what I think is hard to grasp &#8220;&#8230; and PERFECT WILL of God&#8221;. Not sure who else has gone through this where you thought you were in God&#8217;s perfect will on a given thing only to discover later you were not. It appeared spiritual yet it was carnal, you may have thought you heard from the Lord. It troubles me sometimes then I get comfort knowing that God is working in me based on what is acceptable while directing my paths and yours. He is working in you, Philippians 2:13, &#8220;for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure&#8221;, He is directing you Proverbs 3:6, &#8220;In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths&#8221;, He is ordering your steps, &#8220;Psalm 37:23, &#8220;The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD, And He delights in his way.<\/p>\n<p>The more we walk with the Lord, the more we learn, the more we grow, the more we are transformed, the more we operate in His will. At times it may not be clear right away what His will is for our lives but as we go through the sieve, we are sifted to know what is acceptable and we pray for God&#8217;s will and direction within the boundaries of His word. We are no longer just praying for anything because it&#8217;s our desire, we pray thy will be done. As we pray and get in the word, the more we are changed, the more the sieve reveals stumbling blocks, impurities and our character. I believe that we can know God&#8217;s perfect will for our lives because we know what it takes. David says, Psalm 139, &#8220;23 Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me, and know my anxieties; 24 And see if there is any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting&#8221;.

I have no problem knowing the will of God for His children but when it boils down to one narrowed down to my life then it becomes a struggle. Often times you hear the messages &#8220;claim it and receive it&#8221; then you go to the scriptures and find there is more to it than claim it and receive it. I see more preparation because God would not want to give us something that is good but destroys our lives. I have seen people who were blessed of God, you could tell 100% that it was God who made it possible but then you see how that blessings becomes a stumbling block in their lives. I ask myself why? then I&#8217;m reminded that God is in the business of forming before He can fill. Many want to be filled and insist on being filled without being formed.<\/p>\n<p>The word of God sets us up to know God&#8217;s will yet for us to know God&#8217;s will it starts Mathew 6:33,\u00a0 which says to us to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and ALL these things will be given to you as well&#8221;. Does that mean that upon seeking the kingdom of God everything that I desire will automatically be given? Not quiet, there is something about seeking the kingdom of God that changes YOU to know who He is and who you are in relation to Him. I remember when I was young we would not be quick to take the corn flour and make corn bread with it. We had a sieve we used to sift the flour before we could use it. The interesting thing about the sieve, it let the good flour pass through as we shook it and retained little chunks, husks, little sand we missed seeing left in the sieve. The sieve separated what was acceptable and rejected.<\/p>\n<p>This is true with the word of God, as you are seeking His kingdom first and His righteousness, what you are doing is setting your life in prayer and His word to be shaken to sift through what is acceptable. Proverbs 10:32, tells us &#8220;The lips of the righteous know what is ACCEPTABLE&#8221;. How will you know what is acceptable if you are not sifted through prayer and His word?<\/p>\n<p>Had you not been sifted, you would have not known that things like pride, stinginess, unforgiveness, fear, doubt, anger to mention a few were lingering in your life and what you desired would be a stumbling<br \/>\nblock if given unless God first dealt with what was left in the sieve. Now I understand why some things I prayed for did not come to pass or were delayed, God did not want the blessing to be a stumbling block. I<br \/>\ndid not have a stronger character to support what He wanted to do. I did not let my life be sifted first. Had I been to the sieve first, I would have known what I needed God to work on in my life before asking<br \/>\nwhat I desired of Him in line with His will for my life. I want to be formed first before I can be filled, I hope that is your prayer but first we will not know until we have been in the sieve.<\/p>\n<p>To continue&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 12:1&amp;2, &#8220;&#8230;do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God&#8221; I struggle sometimes to know what the will of God is for my life.

To me this can be assign that I did not hear you the first time or you don&#8217;t trust that I can or will do it. What happens when the Lord tells you something more than once, what would your attitude be?<\/p>\n<p>If you remember when Jesus was arrested, before then Peter said he would never deny Christ and Jesus said to him in Matthew 26:34, &#8220;Assuredly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&#8221; (NIV). He did not realize what he had done until the third time that it clicked to him of what Jesus had said to him. Now Jesus has come back to life, ready to go to heaven and He is giving His final charge to Peter. In other words, Jesus was reinstating (restoring) the one time weak Peter, getting him ready for greater things he had not thought about or imagined. He was establishing the word He had told the disciples earlier in John 14:12 when He said, &#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.<\/p>\n<p>The question to ask ourselves and the same question Peter may have asked himself, why did Jesus ask him three times if he loved Him? Was Jesus doubting Peter&#8217;s love? He says &#8220;Simon son of John, do you love me?&#8221; Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, &#8220;Do you love me?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Remember Peter kept on responding saying &#8220;you know I love you. Peter was ok when He asked him the first time, second time he might have wondered, the third time he was hurt that the Lord would ask him three times. Here is my thinking looking at the scripture, what the Lord was doing was provoking Peter to let him know that his love for Christ was bigger than the lip service of word &#8220;I Love you&#8221;. This was to be demonstrated in his life and not so much in his words. Jesus had spoken of His love for the world then demonstrated it, Paul comes later to teach us what the love of Christ was, Romans 5:8, &#8220;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us&#8221;. Jesus knew what he had invested in Peter and He was awakening the greater calling compelled by love, reinstating him and though Peter felt he might have been rubbed the wrong way, I believe it changed his way of defining what love was.<\/p>\n<p>Starting from the book of Acts you see a restored bold wonder working Peter, 1 John 4:18, There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment&#8221;. No longer was Peter afraid to stand for Jesus. As Jesus had promised, you see Peter doing greater things even his shadow raising the dead. He still was still learning because again three times God tried to speak to him through a vision about a mission field, he could not understand what the vision meant until much later. Peter might have been slow to learn but quick retain. He grew stronger and stronger, he was faithful till death being crucified upside down. May the Lord provoke us as long as it takes to learn and understand that our love for Him is bigger than the lip service I love you. Our love for God will drive out fear to respond to His call. We may be slow to learn but I pray we will retain. Lord provoke us to zeal.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 21:15-19, 17&#8243;The third time he said to him, &#8220;Simon son of John, do you love me?&#8221; Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, &#8220;Do you love me?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.&#8221; (NIV) If you are anything like me, being told [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-615","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-9V","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/615","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=615"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/615\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=615"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=615"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=615"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":614,"date":"2007-01-03T14:01:33","date_gmt":"2007-01-03T14:01:33","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/01\/03\/provoked-to-zeal-part-2\/"},"modified":"2007-01-03T14:01:33","modified_gmt":"2007-01-03T14:01:33","slug":"provoked-to-zeal-part-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/01\/03\/provoked-to-zeal-part-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Provoked To Zeal, Part&nbsp;2"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>1Samuel 1:1-28, vs. 6 &#8220;And her rival (Peninnah) also provoked her (Hannah) severely, to make her miserable, because the LORD had closed her womb. 7 So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, that she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It is fascinating to note that whenever God is getting ready to do something, He will use the unexpected. Unless you know God&#8217;s ways like Moses did rather than His acts, you will see things in away that will not make sense and if you are not careful, what is suppose to grow may\u00a0 break you simply because you have not taken time to understand the reason for its existence at a particular time. If you don&#8217;t understand Romans 8:28, which says\u00a0 &#8220;And we know that all things WORK TOGETHER for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose&#8221; you will not understand the reason why. Two striking words out of the vs. &#8220;work together&#8221; which I take it to mean God taking the pieces of what is present, combining them (even from the enemy) and making something extraordinary out of it. Think of it this way, the ingredients of a cake not all taste good individually but when mixed and worked together, they have the capability of making the cake taste good.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the introduction to my message, let&#8217;s now look at the book of 1st Samuel which introduces us to Elkanah and his two wives, Penninah and Hannah. continuing to read, Elkanah loved Hannah more than Penninah. This can be seen how Elkanah distributed gifts. From the story, you will also learn that Penninah had sons and daughters while Hannah was barren because the Lord had closed her womb. As you can it&#8217;s the Lord who closed her womb and not out of the natural causes. Could it be possible that God closed her womb because He was controlling the timing in which He would allow her to have a child? I believe so. Maybe God wanted Hannah not just to have a child for the sake of having a child but a child with destiny and the timing had to be perfect. Maybe she longed for a child and since she already discovered that she was barren, she did not see any reason to believe that anything else could happen. Maybe she got to that place of contentment with what she had, a husband who loved her and cared for her. Maybe she concluded that she had attained all she could ever attain in life then here comes Penninah her rival.<\/p>\n<p>The bible says Penninah began to provoke her. If you read the passage, you may feel like despising Penninah because of her cruelty to Hannah but when you understand God&#8217;s ways according to Romans 8:28, you will go on your knees and thank God for Penninah. Who is Penninah? Penninah is the instrument God would use to awaken the dream and desire God had placed at a certain time and the timing is right for it to provoked to zeal. The timing was right, the desire to have a child may have not been in Hannah and here comes Penninah rubbing Hannah the wrong way which awakened something in Hannah.<\/p>\n<p>Because of Penninah, Hannah began to pray more, spend time in the presence of God, pour out her heart to the Lord, longed again for a child, prayed to God for a child. Year after year she prayed. Even though her prayers were not being answered at the time she wanted them answered, all things were working together for her good. The more she sought, the more she learnt how to pray and pray effectively. I believe her character was being enlarged. Her attitude changed from Lord give me a child so that I&#8217;m not left out to give me and I will give him back to you for service.<\/p>\n<p>Your rival is not an enemy as the world would make you believe, your<br \/>\nrival is an awakening tool God will use to raise you up. When a<br \/>\nPenninah shows us, let it be a clear sign that you are being provoked<br \/>\nto zeal. Maybe nothing else could make you pray like you need to,<br \/>\nread, witness, go extra mile until a Penninah is introduced. Yes<br \/>\nPenninah may rub you the wrong way but as I already mentioned, ALL<br \/>\nTHINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD.

Just before then, let&#8217;s look at the man who will take over from him, Elisha, &#8220;he was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen&#8221;, was involved in the family business. He is in charge, in control, he is the boss but when Elijah meets him, Elijah provokes him not by what he said but by what he did, &#8220;threw his mantle on him&#8221;. I never get any where without being provoked to zeal. I have friends, preachers who have provoked me through the area of intercessions, witnessing, doing memory verses, teaching, preaching and I can do all these things because someone provoked me. Just like Elisha, I wasn&#8217;t provoked necessarily by what they said, I was provoked by what I saw and that laid a mantle upon me. Without being provoked to zeal, you loose your edge. The reason for provoking is to awaken you to the fact that there is more and it&#8217;s not impossible to achieve or get there when you know who you are in Christ and understand His will for your life. What touched Elisha&#8217;s body awakened him to a greater calling and he desired to walk with Elijah. What provoked you to get to where you are?<\/p>\n<p>1Kings 19:21, &#8220;So Elisha turned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and boiled their flesh, using the oxen&#8217;s equipment, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then rose and followed Elijah, and became his servant&#8221;. What a touch to cause him to kiss everything he had held dear goodbye for the sake of the call. He had a good business and was content until it was clear through Elijah that there was more. I have seen people called and provoked of God to sell all their belongings, move to a land where no one wanted to go because of the call. This is not of man, this is of God. Elisha could kiss everything good bye because God had already hand picked him. When the calling comes, no going back!!!. It&#8217;s interesting to note that he might have not known what he was getting himself into but what he saw and felt couldn&#8217;t be rubbed off, he is following as a servant, watching what the Lord is doing through Elijah. His observation builds a hunger and thirst for what Elijah had.<\/p>\n<p>In 2Kings chapter 2, Elisha knows that Elijah will be taken away, this is the man he had been following, the man by which he kissed everything goodbye. The sons of the prophets had reminded him that Elijah will be history soon, then after crossing river Jordan, Elijah asked him 2Kings 2:9, &#8220;&#8230;Ask! what may I do for you, before I am taken away from you? and Elisha said, &#8220;Please let a double portion of your spirit (anointing) be upon me&#8221;. Provoked to desire double portion of the anointing. This is calling for double portion of Elijah&#8217;s responsibilities while he was on earth. SEE THE ANOINTING IS NOT TO MAKE YOU POWERFUL, THE ANOINTING IS TO EMPOWER YOU TO GET YOU TO WORK FOR HIM. You and I are provoked to get more so as to put that more to work. When God used these people to provoke me to desire more, that meant I was calling for more responsibilities. vs. 10, &#8220;So he said, &#8220;You have asked for a hard thing, Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken away from you, it will be so for you &#8230; vs. 14, &#8220;then the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water, &#8230; and when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed&#8221;. Now he could understand that when Elijah threw his mantle on him, that anointing that woke him up is what he needed, when Elijah said when you see me go up it&#8217;s yours, someone would think that he would bow and pray for him to receive it but what happened is that his mantle was left behind. Where Elijah was going, he did not need the mantle that represented the anointing. Elisha did more miracles than Elijah, Jesus said, &#8220;Greater works than this shall ye do, for I am going to the Father&#8221;. The disciples were provoked to zeal and when they were anointed, they put that anointing to work. Do you have people who provoke you to zeal in prayers, witnessing, teaching, preaching, etc? Don&#8217;t loose your edge!!!!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy New Year, 1Kings 19:19-21, &#8220;Then Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him&#8221; Will take a couple of days to share messages to prep us for the new year starting with this one.

Perhaps there are certain situations or people that seem to cause anger to rise up in you. According to the Scriptures anger alone is not a sin. The Scriptures says, be angry and sin not or in your anger do not sin. One thing that seems to make most people excited however is the birth of a child. When a child is born many come to see the newborn and rejoice with the family to whom the child has been born. However, can you picture any reason why one would become angry because of a newborn? This was the response of King Herod to the news of the birth of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p>Matthew tells us, \u201cNow after ?Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, ??wise men ?from the East came to Jerusalem, ?2 saying, ??\u201cWhere is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.\u201d Why would these Magi which had had traveled from the East, most likely from Persia, first go to King Herod the Roman King to inquire of the newborn Jewish King? Where else would one go to find a King but in a palace? However, God in His Divine Providence moved Christ to safety because God knew of the mutiny that Herod plotted against Jesus. Matthew describes the response of Herod about the news of Jesus\u2019 birth, \u201cWhen Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. What was it that caused King Herod to become angry and troubled and ALL JERUSALEM WITH HIM?!?! At this time Herod was the King, although he himself was not Jewish he was the King of the Jews as the Jewish people were under Roman authority.<\/p>\n<p>The Expositor\u2019s Bible Commentary explains that, \u201cIn contrast with the Magi&#8217;s desire to worship the King of the Jews, Herod is deeply troubled. In this &#8220;all Jerusalem&#8221; joins him, not because most of the people would have been sorry to see Herod replaced or because they were reluctant to see the coming of King Messiah, but because they well knew that any question like the Magi&#8217;s would result in more cruelty from the ailing Herod, whose paranoia had led him to murder his favorite wife and two sons.\u201d WOW, a King that murdered his own wife and sons, no wonder he had no problem desiring to murder the new born King, the Son of God! Hatred is murder of the heart according to God as John wrote, \u201cWhoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.\u201d Herod did not want to be replaced, and the people did not wish to experience Herod\u2019s killing tirade as he plays no favorites when it comes to murder. If Christ were to take the throne and be crowned King, what would that mean for Herod?<\/p>\n<p>1. Herod would no longer be King<\/p>\n<p>2. The Jews would now look to their own King<\/p>\n<p>3. The authority Herod had over the Jews would now be passed to Jesus<\/p>\n<p>4.

registered. ?2? ??This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. ?3? So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city. (Luke 2:1).<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever had the \u201cjoy\u201d of moving? There was a season in my life where I had to move four times in four years. This was certainly not fun. I recall the day getting home from our honeymoon, that my wife and I were blessed to be introduced, through my in-laws, to see our current apartment. The only slight dilemma was that I had just moved all of my things, prior to our honeymoon, into another apartment. This would mean more moving, but it was certainly worth it. Although it was only temporary, Mary and Joseph had to move from Nazareth to Bethlehem. However in doing so one can see how God moves one or a group of people from one place to another to accomplish His will and Divine Plan.<\/p>\n<p>The prophecy was foretold by the Prophet Micah, \u201cBut you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting (5:2).\u201d Obviously according to the prophecy, Christ had to be born in Bethlehem, but the only problem was that Mary and Joseph were living in Nazareth at the time. How was this prophecy to be fulfilled if Christ was in the wrong place? God would orchestrate the circumstances to assure that His Son would be born precisely in the place where the Prophet had prophesied.<\/p>\n<p>Luke wrote, \u201cAnd it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. ?2? ??This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. ?3? So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city. (Luke 2:1).\u201d Perhaps you\u2019ve read this around many times, especially recently with the Christmas season being upon us. However here are some awesome facts. In Matthew 1, the genealogy is paternal, going through Jesus\u2019 earthly father, Joseph; and Joseph\u2019s father, Jacob; back to David. In Luke 3, the genealogy is maternal, going through Jesus\u2019 mother, Mary; and Mary\u2019s father, Heli; back to David. Hence the census called by the ungodly and polytheistic Romans, caused Mary and Joseph to be forced to go to Bethlehem together, because both were from the line of King David, were Christ was to be born. The Roman IRS did not care that Mary was pregnant, and there was no other reason for Joseph to take his espoused Mary on a long journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem. God has an awesome way of orchestrating things to carry out His Divine Plan. If events at the dawn of the first century had progressed just ordinarily, Jesus would not have been born in Bethlehem. But God orchestrated the events of that time, and thus worked in amazing and powerful ways to make the Lord\u2019s birth occur precisely at the right time and place, thus verifying His own prophetic Word. There are many times when perhaps like Joseph the movement that is taking place in our lives seems senseless, untimely, unpopular, and very emotional in our estimation. However Joseph and Mary followed the Lord, and walked His plan out even unknowingly. It must have been a difficult journey, but following God is not a road without bumps and unexpected turns.<\/p>\n<p>Today, examine how God is moving you to accomplish his will in your life at this time. Perhaps He is moving you in such a way that is unpopular, senseless, and \u201cuntimely\u201d in your eyes, but it is His Will.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p>(MacArthur, John: God in the Manger : The Miraculous Birth of Christ.

We implore you on Christ&#8217;s behalf: Be reconciled to God.&#8221; 2 Corinthians 5:20<\/p>\n<p>Merry CHRISTmas! I love saying that. We live in an age where the world wants us to be culturally tolerant, and politically correct. All other religious &#8220;holidays&#8221; are not really holidays if we agree that the word holiday is really the word HOLY DAY. How is Kwanza, or Ramadan holy? Kwanza does not focus on Christ, because the focus is on culture and man not on Christ the Lord. Then of course there are those that are professing Christians that go to a church, maybe place a manger scene somewhere in our homes, perhaps even have &#8220;Jesus the reason for the season&#8221; somewhere around. What is this whole thing really about? There is a well known Christmas song that says Hark the herald angels sing, &#8220;Glory to the newborn King! Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled&#8221; What does that mean for God and sinners to be reconciled? Consider the lyrics by Go Fish called &#8220;It&#8217;s about the Cross.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just about the manger, Where the baby lay, It&#8217;s not all about the angels Who sang for him that day, It&#8217;s not just about the shepherds , Or the bright and shining star It&#8217;s not all about the wise men, Who traveled from afar<\/p>\n<p>Chorus: It&#8217;s about the cross, It&#8217;s about my sin, It&#8217;s about how Jesus came to be born once So that we could be born again, It&#8217;s about the stone, That was rolled away, So that you and I could have real life someday, It&#8217;s about the cross, It&#8217;s about the cross<\/p>\n<p>Verse 2: It&#8217;s not just about the presents, underneath the tree, It&#8217;s not all about the feeling That the season brings to me, It&#8217;s not just about coming home, To be with those you love It&#8217;s not all about the beauty, In the snow I&#8217;m dreaming of<\/p>\n<p>The beginning of the story is wonderful and great, But it&#8217;s the ending that can save you and that&#8217;s why we celebrate, It&#8217;s about the cross, It&#8217;s about my sin, It&#8217;s about how Jesus came to be born once, So that we could be born again<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s about God&#8217;s love, Nailed to a tree, It&#8217;s about every drop of blood that flowed from Him when it should have been me, It&#8217;s about the stone, That was rolled away, So that you and I could have real life someday, So that you and I could have real life someday, It&#8217;s about the cross, It&#8217;s about the cross.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus was born to die for the Law that you and I have broken (God&#8217;s 10 Commandments). Jesus Christ was born of a women, born of a virgin, lived a life of perfection and went to the cross for you and I. When one looks at how far one is, how one has violated God&#8217;s perfect standard of righteousness, it makes God&#8217;s love amazing. Have you been reconciled or made right with God? Have you confessed and forsaken (turned away from) your sins and put your trust in Christ like you would trust in a parachute. If you have be sure to thank God and Go, as Christ has commanded, and begin to tell your friends, family members and even strangers about the cross. Acts 4:12 reads, &#8220;Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.&#8221; Only Christ provided a payment for sin. If you&#8217;ve never repented and trust Christ, humble yourself and do that today, because eternity is a long time, actually its eternal. May those who are reading this be reconciled to God, and be used to share the truth for others to be reconciled to God.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;We are therefore Christ&#8217;s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us.

Nothing can be added to it, And nothing taken from it. God does it, that men should fear before Him. What God is working on nothing can be added to it and nothing can be taken away from it, it is complete. Moses has been raised in palace and yet when the time comes, he realizes that palace is not hi place. In as much as everything looks good and okay, he is convinced that is not his rightful place. I believe that anytime God is getting ready to raise someone, everything that once mattered in their lives begins to fade away and like Paul you will call them dung. He says that everything that he ever counted as gain became like dung before him that he may win Christ. I remember when I came to Christ, there were things I really valued and when I received Him, I did not see their worth anymore for I received something better. He is suppose to be comfortable in the so called PALACE but He is not and that is what the world thinks of Christians, when they should be having fun in the world they have chosen not to but serve God. The bible says sin is a pleasure for a season. Did someone say that sin is not fun? of course sin is fun that is why people sin but the problem is it&#8217;s fun for a season then the end is destruction and death.<\/p>\n<p>If you read chapter 2:11-25, we find that Moses goes out to help his brothers but in a wrong way for he kills an Egyptian and with his life in danger, he flees to find himself in Jethro&#8217;s home who becomes his father in law. He is tending to sheep, he is married, he has a child, he is making money and he has nothing to worry about. Sounds like this might have been God&#8217;s plan to bring him to a nice place, a place to forget his miseries, pain, heartache and the like. Well that sounds good but presents a problem for where he was brought was a place to get a little rest, meet God and be sent. We are not called to be in a comfort zone for the work is still out there, there are many Israelites that still need to be saved from the bondage from where we came from, there are friends, relatives, colleagues that we left in Egypt who need to be set free. Yes we are out and we are free and we are prospering in every way and that is okay but we need to remember that God raised us from among them that He may use us to reach and bring them out of land of destruction.<\/p>\n<p>One day when Moses is attending to the sheep, he sees an ordinary bush burning but not getting consumed, coming closer all of a sudden he hears a voice and for some time the Lord speaks to him about who He is, about His people, His promise and His instructions to Moses. Exodus 3:1-22, &#8220;Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt&#8221;. Bigger task no army to back him up but because His presence was going with him, all he needed was the stave of a shepherd and the Lord&#8217;s presence to get the job done. He is ordained to go as the bible says we have also been ordained to go for it says &#8220;Go into all the world and preach the gospel&#8221;. Some individuals are the first ones to be saved in the family, guess what, you have been raised from among them that you maybe used to reach your family. How about in a job, you maybe the only one saved, thank God for you have been raised from among them. You may never get a chance to share the word of God but you can pray for them. Some folks came from prisons and God has raised them from among many and He is sending them back to the same places to be a beacon of light.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be discouraged because you are the only Christian in your department, that home or in that neighborhood, you are the first one to be raised from among them, you know what it means to be unsaved and deal with stuff but because God raised you from the same spot, you have a better chance of ministering to someone for you have been there.

We always see God start with one person.<\/p>\n<p>We looked at the birth of Moses a child who happens to be the one God will use to deliver the children of Israel living in bondage for over 400 years. If you continue to read Exodus chapter 2, you see how a decree was made that all male born children were to be killed. Moses mother decides to take her son she had been hiding for three months puts him in a basket and lays him by the river. For some of us who were raised in Christian homes, we were well protected in a way spiritually as we were always taken to church, prayed, did bible reading and memory verses. All these were good but never made us receive Christ. It reached to appoint where our parents could not protect us anymore for we were of age and a lot of pressure of the world was calling us so they let us go but kept on praying and hoping that we will come back home (to Christ). While out there, we landed\u00a0 the enemies camp as Moses did. We still had our loved ones watching over us, just like Moses had a big sister following his basket wherever it went, we had Christ following us every where we went. I had no idea Christ was protecting me from every harm I could ever encounter, I did not know Him but He knew me and protected me, I should have drowned while in that basket but for some way He kept reaching out to me.<\/p>\n<p>Many don&#8217;t realize that God had been protecting them even before they came to know Him. Many great wrong things could have happened but He was there to watch everyone of us ultimately that He may bring us to a place where we could know Him. Finally the daughter of Pharaoh comes a long and finds the baby and immediately shows him kindness and compassion. Moses sister comes from her hiding place offers to find a nurse to take care of the infant and guess who becomes the nurse, the mother of the child. I&#8217;m glad that He loved me enough to raise me even though I did not know Him. I&#8217;m not sure that Moses knew that he was raised by his own mother.<\/p>\n<p>Remember the nurse (Moses&#8217; mom) had to raise him until he became of age and was to be brought back to the palace to be pharaohs daughter&#8217;s son? Oh great!!!! you have raised your son, at one point you almost lost him then you raise him until he is of age but you have to let him go again because of circumstances and situations, at times it sounds like a bad thing but God is in control. Some people were trained in the enemies camp, through what they had to deal with, they learnt in the field how to survive, how to take a licking and keep on ticking, how to stand even in great opposition etc. People who went through hell and high water have a greater testimony and passion to serve the Lord. God has away of getting us ready through many afflictions. Jobs tells us that, He knows the way that I take, after He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold. If you did not know why you had to go through all that, hang in there He had a plan from the beginning. Remember He tells Jeremiah, I formed thee, then sanctified thee, then ordained thee. Today we dealt with sanctify get ready for another step.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 119:71, &#8220;It&#8217;s good that I have been afflicted that I may learn your statutes&#8221;, the afflictions know how to get you ready for it knows how to get the best in you. Moses does not know that he is not an Egyptian though raised to act and think like one. God is raising him that he may bring him back to the same place to deliver His people. He was one man raised from among them.

If you look towards the end of Genesis, you will see How God brought Joseph to Egypt and during the famine times, Joseph brought his entire family to Egypt to dwell with him there as he was the number two man in that land. If you remember his father&#8217;s name changed from Jacob to Israel, that is how the Israelites came about. When the Pharaoh in Joseph&#8217;s time and so was\u00a0 Joseph, the new Pharaoh did not know how Joseph saved Egypt from famine and instead of treating the Israelites well, he enslaved them.<\/p>\n<p>Now watch this, for 400 years the slaves were praying to God to deliver them, God heard their cry and there was coming a time when He would deliver them and then Moses comes into the picture in Exodus 2:1, &#8220;And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took a wife a daughter of Levi, and the woman conceived and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a beautiful child, she hid him three months&#8221;. For us to understand where we are going with this, we need to look at Chapter 1 for the bible says that the more the Israelites grew in number, the more the Egyptians got afraid cause they felt that if there was war at one point between Egypt and another nation, Israel would join Egypt&#8217;s enemy to fight against them. The Egyptians were therefore forced to put more pressure, demands and afflictions on them. They tried to use the Israelite&#8217;s midwives to kill all the male children at birth, but they defied the orders for they feared the Lord more than men. To be honest with you, the Egyptians were stupid for desiring to kill all the male born children, if they wanted people who could work for them, killing males was not a bright idea. You cane see that they looked more on the negative results than the positive results.<\/p>\n<p>We do understand now why Moses&#8217; mom had to hide him for three months for he was going to be a victim of the killing. The parents had perceived that this was no ordinary child and they might have not know what would become of him but God had already set up a deliverer no one knew about. Jeremiah 1:4&amp;5, &#8220;Then the word of the Lord came unto me saying, before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou comest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto nations&#8221;. Amen to this verse, three things God did when He had Jeremiah in mind. Number one He says, &#8220;I formed thee&#8221; no man helped in making Jeremiah, God already had plans to form him even before the parents thought of having a child. Then number two He says, &#8220;I sanctified thee&#8221; to which the word sanctify in the dictionary means &#8220;To be set a part for sacred use or consecrated&#8221;, &#8220;To make holy and purified&#8221;. unborn child and yet he has to be made holy already. When we are born, we are born sinners, how can therefore can one be holy before they are born? Simple, God has salvation plan for the unborn. A preacher said that the moment Adam sinned, anyone who came after him and tried to do the test of holiness had already failed. Even if you did not take the test, you failed already. Jeremiah before being born had to be made holy and purified. Then number three He says, &#8220;I ordained thee&#8221; meaning I had a call for your life, who you will be was already defined and determined so regardless of what you will face in life or what you will go through, after it has been said and done, you will be who I planned for you to be from the beginning says the Lord<\/p>\n<p>My first point as we start these series is that you may have not known or might not know what God had planned for you to be but He already knew you even before you were formed for He is the one who actually formed you in the womb. We were all born in a corrupt world, a world full of chaos and turmoil, murder, rape, abortion, war, accidents and incidents yet still He formed us ultimately that He may use us.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Exodus 2:1-11, &#8220;And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water&#8221; As God is doing something great, He many times involve men to accomplish what He wants to do.

I have heard men mightily used of God confess that struggle too. Let&#8217;s see what God has for us.<\/p>\n<p>Prayer is not reserved for church only in the sense that I don&#8217;t have to wait to go to church to pray and when I am out of the church, prayer ceases. Prayer is essential in our walk with God. Mark this word, &#8220;God does not need prayers to make Him God, we need prayers to be like God&#8221; for we are His children.<\/p>\n<p>Prayers is not easy the reason I believe it&#8217;s not a want but a need. When Jesus knew that His time for crucifixion was getting near, He went to the mountain\u00a0 as usual to pray and He brought with Him Peter, James and John as usual, left them somewhere to pray while He went further to another division of the mountain to pray. He prayed faithfully there but when He came back, He found the three sleeping and He asked, &#8220;could you wait (pray) with me for even an hour?&#8221;. If it was tough for the disciples to pray, we are not exempt from it. We should pray for it&#8217;s a commandment from God and there are other things that go with prayer. Look at what Jesus tells the disciples Matt 26:39, &#8220;Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak&#8221;. He understood that for these guys to stand during the trying times they were about to face, they needed to pray at the same time He also knew that their spirit was willing but their flesh was too weak. Thank God that the spirit is willing and now the flesh has to be crucified that the willing spirit may concur the unwilling flesh. The flesh does not like the idea of prayers but it needs it to escape temptations, needs it for provision, guidance, protection to mention a few.<\/p>\n<p>1Timothy 2:8, &#8220;I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting&#8221;. This scripture eliminates any mentality that prayer is reserved for a particular place. I pray sometimes when I am driving for I am less distracted, I pray effectively when I go to church, in rare cases do I pray at home because of distractions. Do you pray? how often do you pray? where do you pray?. I don&#8217;t pray because I want to but because I need to and there are so many times my spirit is willing but my flesh is weak and tries by all means to stop the spirit. If we can starve the flesh, we can feed the spirit. When I say starve the flesh, I don&#8217;t mean don&#8217;t eat but don&#8217;t give it the other things that it&#8217;s craving for. Many years ago while working at a food store as a cashier, I would do a lot of prayers while serving my customers especially when I saw one depressed, no joy, looking sickly. One day a woman came to the store and after she had come to my line, I looked up and there she was looking depressed and sick, as I looked at her face, I saw a big wound on her nose it was like her nose was rotting so I began to pray for her mumbling words while ringing her stuff. After she had given me her money and I had given her stuff, I continued to pray for her as I was serving the next customer. After a couple of weeks, she came to the store to shop then came to my line again but this time with a smile and looking up, I saw that the wound on her nose was gone and only a scar was left to see. I smiled back at her and served her while she asked me, &#8220;how come you are smiling&#8221; and I said, &#8220;because your wound is gone&#8221;. She had no idea that I prayed for her when she was sick and depressed. Prayer is powerful and it&#8217;s effective anywhere if it is offered. Like I always say, Prayer paves a way for God to move.<\/p>\n<p>Acts 6:4, &#8220;But we will give ourselves to prayer, and to the ministry of the word&#8221;, when you talk about prayers, the book of acts has a lot of the word prayer in it and it&#8217;s simply because the people of the early church devoted themselves to prayer, fasting, breaking of bread and fellowshipping and I can tell that is the reason the church in those days were very powerful and effective. People of today want to see God move and yet do not want to pray and I am guilty of this too, but if we want to see God move, see sinners saved, see the sick get healed, marriages restored, children protected, teenagers live right, we got to pray. Look at what Acts 6:4 puts it, &#8220;But we will give ourselves to prayers, and to the ministry of the word&#8221;. Let&#8217;s give ourselves to prayers, praying everywhere, seeking the kingdom of God, praying thy Kingdom come, thy will be done and praying for other people. 2Chronicles 7:14, &#8220;If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and forgive their sins and heal their land&#8221;.

While they are usually tougher to spot by others, they are easily identified if you are willing to look at yourself with sober judgment and a tender conscience. Here are a few things to ask yourself to see if you suffer from the subtle signs of pride. When writing a story, completing a project or doing something for someone else, do you inwardly crave the positive comments or praise from people? Do you normally concern yourself with what other people will think or say about something you&#8217;ve said or done instead of focusing on doing what you do unto the Lord? When someone shares something good that&#8217;s happened in their life are you genuinely happy for them or do you feel as if it should&#8217;ve happened to you or that it&#8217;s nothing compared to the great things you&#8217;ve seen God do in your life? Do you really listen and take a sincere interest to what others say or do you just wait until it&#8217;s your turn to talk? Do you find yourself inwardly being critical of other Christians or your pastor when they don&#8217;t embrace your views of evangelism? Do you esteem yourself more highly than you ought to or feel like you&#8217;re better than most other Christians because you share your faith and they don&#8217;t? Are you reluctant to ask someone for help or advice because you think you can do it yourself or you&#8217;ll figure it out on your own? Do you find yourself reluctant to be a part of a group because you may not get your way? Maybe you think you don&#8217;t need to be part of the group (GNN, the Church, etc.) to share your faith because you can do just as well on your own? Or occasionally do you find yourself feeling vindicated when someone else is proven wrong? When you open-air preach do you find yourself wishing the crowd was bigger or constantly focusing on finding new ways to build a bigger crowd? I&#8217;m sure if you think and pray about it for a while, God will reveal to you the elements of pride (if any) in your life.<\/p>\n<p>Satan relentlessly uses pride as a powerful weapon to weaken, incapacitate and ultimately destroy the Evangelist (When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom. &#8211; Proverbs 11:2). Almost always and without exception, when an Evangelist stumbles or falls it can be traced back to their pride. Whether it&#8217;s obvious or subtle, pride has a way of creeping into our lives and inhibiting us from being led by the spirit of God and ultimately leads to our demise (Before his downfall a man&#8217;s heart is proud, but humility comes before honor &#8211; Proverbs 18:12). The single biggest thing any Evangelist must be on constant guard against is their pride.<\/p>\n<p>How do you fend off the arrows of arrogance and pride that the enemy will surely shoot at you? How do you remain free from your pride and sidestep the sin of self righteousness? The antidote to your pride is to always give God all of the glory, trust not in yourself but acknowledge Him in all things and love others as much or more than you love yourself (Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods &#8211; Psalm 40:4). One thing that love is not is proud! If you want to remain humble in your walk, focus on the grace and mercy that God showed you when He saved your soul from Hell (see James 4 &amp; Philippians 2). Count all your blessings and then recall all the sins that you&#8217;ve been forgiven of. Remember, he who has been forgiven much, loves much (Luke 7:47).<\/p>\n<p>I think a great biblical illustration of the attitude an Evangelist should try to maintain and how to do it is when the seventy-two returned from witnessing. They were all proud, pumped up and boasting about how they had power over the demons. Jesus&#8217; response to them was &#8220;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven&#8221; &#8211; Luke 10:20. This is a perfect example of how to be bold in your witness while remaining humble in your walk. Don&#8217;t think or boast about the power God&#8217;s given you over the circumstances of life, others or even the enemy. Just be grateful that by God&#8217;s grace you&#8217;re headed for Heaven! Another great thing any Evangelist can do to fend off their pride is to surround yourself with others who will help to keep you accountable to humility and those who understand how to recognize the tell-tale signs of pride (see &#8211; 1 Peter 5).<\/p>\n<p>So, the next time you&#8217;re feeling like Superman and start thinking you&#8217;re invincible and nothing can stop you, examine yourself to see if there&#8217;s any Kryptonite (pride) hiding in the lead box of your heart.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, The much more dangerous trappings of our pride are the ones that are usually less obvious.

This is the only weakness of the Man of Steel. He may be faster than a speeding bullet, stronger than a mighty locomotive and able to leap tall buildings with a single bound; but when faced with Kryptonite, he becomes incapacitated and weak.<\/p>\n<p>Every Evangelist I know also has such a weakness. Pride is to the Evangelist what Kryptonite is to Superman. While pride is destructive to anyone and everyone, it&#8217;s particularly a problem for most Evangelists. You see, if Satan can&#8217;t stop you from sharing your faith and teaching others to do the same, he&#8217;ll try to make you proud that you&#8217;re doing it! Yes, the all-powerful mighty Evangelist may be able to dodge the arrows from the enemy, quote scriptures faster than a TV preacher, jump over the traps that Satan sets and even have the ability to face their fears and boldly proclaim the gospel of Christ in a flash, but when confronted with the issues of pride, just like Superman, they become incapacitated and weak. Make no mistake about it, the fast track to fruitlessness as an Evangelist is to follow the path of pride (A man&#8217;s pride brings him low, but a man of lowly spirit gains honor &#8211; Proverbs 29:23).<\/p>\n<p>I find it interesting that if they truly want to be fruitful for the Lord, the Evangelist must be bold in their witness, but remain humble in their walk. What&#8217;s interesting about that, you ask? The two characteristics (boldness &amp; humility) are polar opposites. To be brave enough to face the wicked ways of the enemy and approach people with the message that has the power to save their soul from hell while walking the righteous road of humility is not an easy thing to do. Pride is a strange thing in that sometimes, the signs are obvious while all too often, the signs of pride in our life are not so easy to see. Ironically, when we are blinded by our pride, the pride itself causes us to refuse to even admit that we have a problem with pride in our lives. The fact that some who will read this will say, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t apply to me, I&#8217;m not prideful!&#8221; is proof positive that they most likely struggle with some elements of pride in their life (If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else, for each one should carry his own load &#8211; Galatians 6:3-5).<\/p>\n<p>What are some of the indicators that you may struggle with pride? As I already mentioned, some of the signs are obvious while others are not. Refusing to listen to others who offer Godly or biblical advice, insisting you are right on a regular basis, not being quick to forgive others or to ask for forgiveness, outwardly being critical of others, being argumentative and boasting or bragging about what a great Evangelist you are or how many souls you&#8217;ve won to the Lord are a few obvious signs of pride. As an open- air preacher, I used to find myself boasting about how big the crowd was or when I heard about someone else preaching and asking, &#8220;How big was the crowd?&#8221; All these as well as many others are things that should make it easy to see that your pride has become a stumbling block to you, your walk with the Lord and your efforts as an Evangelist.<\/p>\n<p>To be continued<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Most everyone knows that if you want to defeat the all-powerful DC comic book character Superman; somewhere, sometime, somehow Kryptonite will come into play.

There are days you feel like you are winning and there are days when you feel like a failure. Often times I have used the word &#8220;season modes&#8221; for every season presents it&#8217;s weather and everyone has to learn to adapt in every season otherwise you become a victim. At times even the preachers go dry, and they are left with no power and no strength to fight the good fight of a soldier. If the preachers, pastors, deacons, board members, evangelists are not exempt from the dry and burn outs it is a bad thing, though some may not agree with me, but I don&#8217;t want to be perfect!!!!. perfect people don&#8217;t need help. God may take you through a process and when you think you now have everything in place to make you perfect, He will relocate you again for His purpose is not to make you confident in yourself but confident in Him.<\/p>\n<p>We are all instrument of a kind designed and made by God. Each instrument has been made for a specific purpose cannot accomplish what it was never designed to do. Let&#8217;s look at some other words for &#8220;instruments&#8221;, a tool, device, gadget, utensil, apparatus, appliance. Let me take the word tool and make use of it. Any tool that need sharpening needs it before it can effectively be used. A sharpened tool will give you a better result compared to a blunt tool. Not only will a sharp tool give you a better result, it will make the work faster and easier and less energy will be required to have the job done. You can not force a lawn mower to trim the fence, it was never designed for that. Each and every tool was designed for a specific task and so is with every believer, we are designed for specific tasks, callings and ministries and we cannot go around trying to do everything that we were never called to do. I was never called to sing, therefore I don&#8217;t need to appear at a choir practice for I will mess up everything. When you know what you have been called to do, you will not just have a passion for it but you will also be good at it. God has invested in each of us diversified gifts to be utilized for we are His instrument but&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>Every instrument used at times get out of place, and has to be tuned, sharpened, oiled, repaired and the like and the Lord is saying to us in Isaiah 41:15, &#8220;Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth&#8221;. &#8220;Behold&#8221;, not only is He telling you and I to observe, watch, see, take a look at, view but He is also telling those around us to watch. You can be effective, but there comes a time when your effectiveness reduces and you have to come back to the one who is using you as the tool for sharpening. Watch the way He puts it, &#8220;I will make thee&#8221;, If He does not do it, it cannot be done; if He does not fix it, it cannot be fixed, therefore we call on Him to sharpen our lives when we go blunt. I just checked and another word for blunt is dull. Blunt tools don&#8217;t look attractive and most of the time, they have dents on the blade and are rusty. When you begin to sharpen it, expect it to sparkle. All the dents will diminish, it will shine and the owner of the tool is happy about using a sharpened tool. He is sharpening it because He wants to use it and not put in display.<\/p>\n<p>Our prayer lives, witnessing skills, reading of the word, faith, hope, working skills, wisdom, passions, dreams, desires, relationships need to be sharpened. I know in this group there are tools designed by God that have become dull, dormant, rusty and blunt. Someone looks like an old, beaten tool that has been abused in the hands of the wrong person. You&#8217;ve lost your effectiveness, you&#8217;ve tried hard to be used but because you are blunt, more energy is used to make something out of it. The sign of the anointing is when you can take less and do much with it, Holy Ghost knows how to sharpen us and put us back to work. Regardless of what size the tool is, when it&#8217;s sharpened and used in the right field in which it was designed for, watch and you will see marvelous results. He says again in Isaiah 41:15, &#8220;&#8230; thou shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make thee hills of chaff&#8221;. What a description of what will happen when you and I are sharpened, for we will thresh the mountains and beat them small. Remember when David was sharpened, his mountain was Goliath and because he was sharp in the word of the Lord, he threshed his mountains when Saul who was blunt at this time and could not even lift up his head to say a word. We thank Him for His word is our sharpener. Where in your life have you gone blunt, mark that it&#8217;s not beginning but you already had it before and it was effective at one point but in the process of time, you, the tool fell in wrong hands that abused you as a tool or you were in the right hand but you lost your effectiveness and now you are blunt and dull, you have dent&#8217;s all over and anything you try to do is yielding less strength or no strength. Jump into the Lord&#8217;s workshop and let Him sharpen you again. He wants to use you, but with you blunt, you will not be effective.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Isaiah 41:15, &#8220;Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make thee hills of chaff.

While still looking at the sheep, all of a sudden it started snowing. Before long, the sheep that looked white and clean did not appear clean anymore because the white crystal snow overshadowed the whiteness of the sheep and the girl thought how dirty that sheep looked in the light of the snow. Looking at it closely, you can see that she sheep did not change, the girl saw it under different background, that is what made the difference.<\/p>\n<p>In line with the story above, Jesus entered Capernaum and we are told\u00a0 that a certain centurion had a servant who was sick. As you read more into the story, you discover that the centurion was a man in authority and under authority. He had servants and he commanded them and they listened and responded. He loved his nation and had built a synagogue so he had a good resume. When he sent the elders of the Jews to speak to Jesus about his sick servant, the elders did not hesitate. They went to Jesus and even gave Jesus a good word about him. They talked highly of him and felt that he was WORTHY to receive healing for his servant. What strikes me is that they felt that he DESERVED Jesus attention because of who he was and what he had done. People were elevating him. In the background of his nation, he was a worthy man.<\/p>\n<p>6 Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, &#8220;Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not WORTHY that You should enter under my roof. How is it that a man who every one thought was worthy considers himself un worthy? Simple,\u00a0 the background of the presence of the Son of God overshadowed his worthiness and he saw him as that dirty sheep that looked clean before the snow came about. Of all the people, only Jesus was worthy. Revelation 5:2 Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &#8220;Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose its seals?&#8221; 3 And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it. 4 So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. 5 But one of the elders said to me, &#8220;Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed (WORTHY) to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals.&#8221; When no one was found worthy, He was found worthy. The centurion knew that he did not deserve to have Jesus, the worthy one come to him or his house. The centurion continues to speak of his unworthiness, in verse 7 Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. His unworthiness humbled him to develop such a great faith on the one who was worthy. And we know his servant was healed because of the faith he had.<\/p>\n<p>When I think about my life and how so unworthy I was, reduced to worthless in His sight, I&#8217;m humbled. People buy things that are worth something, He bought me with the highest price when I was worthless. Now I am worth something, not because of me but because of Him (WORTHY) who lives in me. I will enter into heaven not on the basis of my worthiness but on His. I thank Him for the chance to see myself in His background and not the background of men that I might repent and put my trust in Him alone for my eternal salvation.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 7:1-9, And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: (KJV) A story is told of a little girl who looked outside the window of her house and saw a sheep and wondered how that sheep looked so white and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-598","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-9E","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/598","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=598"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/598\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=598"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=598"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=598"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":597,"date":"2006-12-08T05:03:58","date_gmt":"2006-12-08T05:03:58","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/12\/08\/at-your-word-part-2\/"},"modified":"2006-12-08T05:03:58","modified_gmt":"2006-12-08T05:03:58","slug":"at-your-word-part-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/12\/08\/at-your-word-part-2\/","title":{"rendered":"At Your Word, Part&nbsp;2"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>2Kings 5:1-19, &#8220;&#8230;Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We established a statement yesterday about the strength of the cure is not in the messenger but in the seed of the cure in other words the MESSAGE. Let&#8217;s see some neat things we could learn from the story.<\/p>\n<p>Already the man has been told that there is a prophet in Samaria who by God&#8217;s power can heal leprosy, the first mistake he makes, he goes to his king who writes a letter to the king of Israel asking him to heal his servant in vs. 6. Wait a minute, wasn&#8217;t he told that there was a prophet in Samaria? Here is my thinking, since he was a leader with power, he would rather deal with another leader, a king for it was the typical thing to do why?, because everyone operated in different classes and ranks and so people could only do business with the people of their class. We at times do the same, at times we think that God had no understanding when He was using someone who is beneath us to accomplish His work. The bible says that God uses the foolish things to confound the mighty and despised to confound the wise that no flesh should glory in His presence.\u00a0 God does things FOR US but it&#8217;s NOT ABOUT US. The whole reason He moves is for Him to be GLORIFIED.<\/p>\n<p>The king of Israel is upset for he has no power to heal, he rents his clothes and feels like someone is on his case and wants to start a fight with him. Elisha hears about what had happened and he sends for Naaman, time for God to be glorified. I bet he had despised the prophets before but now he desperately needed help and the people he despised are the people God was going to use to reach out to him.<\/p>\n<p>Here he comes with all the gold, clothing, and servants. He is ready to give gifts to anyone who will cure him of his disease, he has rehearsed exactly how he is going to be healed vs. 11 &#8220;Indeed, I said to myself, &#8216;He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name if the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy&#8221;. If God was to do everything the same way, I would think that we would want to dictate Him on how to do things and if it goes against the recipe we already know about God, we will be frustrated the same attitude Naaman had. Something interesting, Elisha did not even come out to see him, he sent his SERVANT to tell this big respected fellow go down to the river Jordan, wash himself seven times and he would be healed.\u00a0 Naaman wanted to be healed in his way and being told something contrary what an insult according to him!.<\/p>\n<p>Why Jordan a dirty river? Why not a touch, or a clean river or anything but that river.\u00a0 It may appear that the healing was waiting for him in the river but that was not the case, &#8220;His healing was in his obedience to do what he had been asked to do&#8221;. He had servants and the kind of position he was holding, pride was really overwhelming him. But just like him unless we are ready to strip ourselves of the pride and arrogance, this will hinder what God wants to accomplish in us. Naaman was very upset that Elisha had the nerve to send a servant, mark the word (servant) to talk to him and the servant does not come with the cure but gives him instructions\u00a0 to go and wash 7 times which is a number of perfection or completion. Believe me, whenever you need something from God, God might ask you to do a dumb thing and it will be upon you to decide to do it or not. You might be asked to forgive that person you don&#8217;t like or pray for the people who despitefully use you or give up something that was so dear to you. How you react and deal with it will determine the outcome. Abraham was tested and his blessings was in his obedience.<\/p>\n<p>Try talking your way into changing the process and you will find that process surely stands still, Naaman had a choice either to swallow his pride and do it or let his ego take over and miss his healing. After persuasion from his servants he decides to do it anyway. Jumps six times and nothing happens, can you imagine him being frustrated for he has been doing the same thing over and over again yet nothing is happening? He had to jump the seventh time to complete the instructions given. When he jumped the seventh time, not only was his skin restored but he was given a better skin compared to what he had before he received leprosy. Eph 3:20, &#8220;Now unto Him who is able to do exceeding, abundantly above all we ask or imagine according to the power (power of obedience) that works within us&#8221;. From Naa-man (meaning no) to New-man, my own theory.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s my point this morning, two keys OBEDIENCE and PERSISTENT. Many want a blessing but they want it their way and when given away to receive it, they get frustrated at the first attempt or second.

Most if not all\u00a0 lived on the mountains and in the caves far from where everyone else lived until miraculously someone got healed then they would be allowed back in the home. In the story set before us today, we are told of a man by the name Naaman. This was no ordinary man for vs. 1 begins to describe him as a commander of the army of the king of Syria, great honorable man in the eyes of his master, he had received many victories as a warrior and he was a mighty man of valor. He was successful in every area of his life but one, he was a leper. How terrible, you have everything that causes you to be respected and admired but just one thing makes it difficult if not impossible to be complete. It&#8217;s not surprising that in the world we see people who have success in everything in life but down deep within their hearts they are leprous and their leprosy could be lack of peace, joy, a detected sickness, depression and you name it. This becomes a void in ones life, regardless of what they have, something to fill that void still misses. Some Christians also find themselves in this kind of dilemma because of a leprosy they have, it&#8217;s no surprise that some still suffer from depression, confusion, doubt, fear, anxiety, a memory, an incident and an accident and yet they are saved going to heaven. Regardless of how you have succeeded spiritually, materially or even socially, there is still one thing that you&#8217;ve got to deal with. I have been fighting the leprosy of fear for many years and still get to fight it even today, what are you fighting?<\/p>\n<p>He who is sick needs a physician and when someone knows that there is cure, no matter who can offer it, they will receive the cure. Vs 3, talks about a little girl who had been brought back to Syria as slave from Israel. She was Namaan&#8217;s wife&#8217;s maid and being humble even in her afflictions she desired the best for her master. The little girl mentioned to Naaman&#8217;s wife about a prophet in Samaria who by God&#8217;s power could perform healing miracles to which she later mentioned to her husband. I would expect him to say, &#8220;what would a stupid slave girl know?&#8221;, but that was not the case for he listened to what the little girl had to say. This is a clear indication that when God is going to do something, He may use the least likely, the stones that the builders rejected for a simple reason, &#8220;THAT HE MAY RECEIVE ALL GLORY.<\/p>\n<p>Mark this, The weight of the seed is not in the messenger but in the cure seed itself, receive it regardless of who brings it. If a word comes to you that it&#8217;s time to get out of a situation you have been in for long, believe it, receive it and act on it for the word is living and powerful, sharper than any double edged sword, piercing even division of heart and soul and of joints and marrows. The word is a discerner of thoughts and the intents of the heart, Hebrews 4:12<\/p>\n<p>When you know there is a cure somewhere, you will not sit and do nothing, you will act on it. If I know what it will take to get it, I will go for it. I may cry for a while, get broken and be beaten by opinions but I will still fight the good fight of a soldier enduring shame as the elect of Christ.\u00a0 Once it has been said and done I will come out. Broke, busted and disgusted but I am still coming out for I did not come this far to be the devil&#8217;s spare tire to be used when he has nothing better to do.\u00a0 If it means praying and fasting, going an extra mile to get encouragements from friends and having someone stand with me, I will go for it for the strength of the cure is not in the messenger but in the cure seed.<\/p>\n<p>To be continued<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0Good morning, 2Kings 5:1-19, &#8220;&#8230;Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel&#8221; In the old and new testament days leprosy was considered as one of the most deadliest sickness known, infact the people who had leprosy were not allowed to live with the rest in the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-596","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-9C","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/596","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=596"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/596\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=596"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=596"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=596"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":595,"date":"2006-12-05T04:08:16","date_gmt":"2006-12-05T04:08:16","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/12\/05\/i-can-because-he-did\/"},"modified":"2006-12-05T04:08:16","modified_gmt":"2006-12-05T04:08:16","slug":"i-can-because-he-did","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/12\/05\/i-can-because-he-did\/","title":{"rendered":"I Can Because He&nbsp;Did"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning friends,<\/p>\n<p>Matthew 16:24 : &#8220;Then Jesus said to his disciples, &#8220;If<br \/>\nanyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s never easy to serve the Lord for there is a price to be paid and that is daily picking up the cross and following Him. The cross is never too easy to carry because of the magnitude of it&#8217;s weight, many times I stumble and fall while carrying the cross, even tempted to put it down then I&#8217;m reminded, soldiers don&#8217;t stop, don&#8217;t quit, don&#8217;t retreat or surrender. It&#8217;s daily dying to self for the sake of the call.<\/p>\n<p>If a guy tells you, &#8220;if you are going to be my disciple, pick up your cross and follow me&#8221;, check what happened to Him when He picked up His cross and you will understand what will happen to you when you pick up yours. He was mocked, beaten, spat on, stressed out, exhausted but refused to put the cross down. If this happened to Him, don&#8217;t be surprised if the same happens to you for no one can expect to be treated\u00a0 any better than Jesus. While carrying the cross, He wasn&#8217;t going down the hill, that would have been a little easy, He was climbing a hill that was high. I can imagine Him saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to hang on to it a little while that I might reach the top&#8221;. He is not doing it for Himself but for the sake of the people He loved. Someone wrote a song and said, &#8220;go a head and drive the nails in my hand, go a head and put it inside of me for after this I will rise again for no power on earth can hold me down&#8221;, Did He not say, &#8220;no man takes His life, he lays it down for the sake His my friends&#8221;. With this I keep fighting and if I fall (sin), I rise up again, ask for forgiveness, pick up the cross and follow Him saying, I will make it, I will survive, I will stand for if He did it, I can do it. This journey is not easy and it will never be easy no wander Paul tells us to run the race with patience looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith. &#8220;When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock (cross) that is higher than I&#8221;. It&#8217;s darker at dawn a sign that morning is around the corner. The bible says, &#8220;Joy comes in the morning&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t give up fighting for it&#8217;s worth fighting in Christ, don&#8217;t stop living in Christ, don&#8217;t stop trusting and believing in Christ, don&#8217;t stop calling on Him for He is all you&#8217;ve got. Right now there are some struggling with different issues and at times you have felt like giving up. I want you to know that the Lord is on your side and if you will give Him a chance to guide and lead you, He will bring you to the place He wants you to be. Is it going to be easy, of course not but you have to be willing to take the stand. Discouraged, confused, broken, feel like giving up, stressed out, burdened by something, weak, fallen? you name it, check out how Christ made it and know that if He made it, you can make it too for the bible says we are more than conquerors which in other words means we conquer what has already been conquered. Joshua 1:5, &#8220;&#8230; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you&#8221;, as &#8220;I was with Jesus as He was going through the cross experience, so I will be with you in all that you go through&#8221;, says the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning friends, Matthew 16:24 : &#8220;Then Jesus said to his disciples, &#8220;If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.&#8221; It&#8217;s never easy to serve the Lord for there is a price to be paid and that is daily picking up the cross and following [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-595","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-9B","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/595","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=595"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/595\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=595"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=595"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=595"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":594,"date":"2006-12-04T04:06:00","date_gmt":"2006-12-04T04:06:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/12\/04\/once-was-blind-but-now-i-see-part-4\/"},"modified":"2006-12-04T04:06:00","modified_gmt":"2006-12-04T04:06:00","slug":"once-was-blind-but-now-i-see-part-4","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/12\/04\/once-was-blind-but-now-i-see-part-4\/","title":{"rendered":"Once Was Blind, But Now I see, Part&nbsp;4"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Mark 10:46-52, &#8220;&#8230;Rabboni, that I may receive my sight&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Of the five keys in this passage hearing, initiating, obstacles, encouragement, and being specific, we covered the first three and today we will conclude by looking at the two remaining. So here we go.<\/p>\n<p>Mark 10:50, &#8220;And throwing aside his garment, he rose and came to Jesus&#8221;, I would say this is a symbol of putting aside everything that made you comfortable at some place one time. He would have come with the garments to Jesus but here is my thinking, he knew he wasn&#8217;t going to be needing the garment for sitting around the road side begging. What a manner of faith to believe that as I go to Him, I am not coming back to where I&#8217;ve always been. Carrying the garment could have meant that I am coming to You but incase it doesn&#8217;t happen at least I still have my garment to cover me when I go back. I pray that we will cast a side any garments of fear, self pity and doubt and come to Him because He has called us.<\/p>\n<p>Here comes the core of the message Mark 10:51, &#8220;So Jesus answered and said to him, &#8220;What do you want Me to do for you?&#8221; The blind man said to Him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight&#8221;. What a powerful portion of scripture here. If you take a look at the story, you will see a progression on the five keys I had mentioned earlier. We are dealing with the last key which is as important as the other keys. One man staggered to the presence of Jesus blind, Jesus asks him a question. Can&#8217;t Jesus see that he is blind? I know that Jesus knows what this man desires and yet He still asking him &#8221; what he would desire?&#8221; This is why I&#8217;m not into the prayer of God do whatever you want to do, do it Lord. Proverbs 16:1, &#8220;The preparation of the heart belong to man, But the answer of the tongue is from the Lord&#8221;, We prepare, God approves; We ask of Him, He approves of the answer. Mark 11:24, &#8220;Whatever things you ask (desire) when you pray&#8230;.&#8221; The blind man could have said, &#8220;Lord whatever you see fit just do it or do whatever you want to do&#8221; but this was his response &#8220;Rabboni (Lord) that I may receive my sight&#8221;. This is what I call being specific, straight forward to the point. Be specific in your prayers, tell the Lord what you desire and let Him act on it according to His will. Being specific will help you tell whether God did it or not. If He did it praise the Lord, if He did not do it, He might have provided another way or something better, praise the Lord, if He did not do it at all, praise the Lord for the preparation of the heart belong to man but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord. He has the final say in your situation. So until God says no, keep asking.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, let&#8217;s see what happened to this man Mark 10:52, &#8220;Then Jesus said to him, &#8220;Go your way; your faith has made you well&#8221;, And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the road&#8221;. Jesus did not have faith for this man, this man had faith in Jesus and that is what made him well. His faith had pleased the Lord to finish what was already started by faith. Hebrews 11:6, &#8220;For without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he that comes to God must first believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him&#8221;. Looking at this verse, the blind man put this into practice. Now watch this, his eyes are opened, all of a sudden he sees a man who had made him well, he sees the people who tried to stop him, he cannot not be taken advantage of any more, he has now the ability to make the right choices, right people to hang out with in this case he followed the Lord. For the first time he is not depending on any man for he was once blind, but now he can see.<\/p>\n<p>I need my eyes to be opened for I feel handicapped in some areas of my life, I purpose to take the other parts of me functioning to help me overcome my dysfunctional part, I will develop faith to know that my eyes can be opened, I will make the move to call Him, I will be prepared for obstacles, I will encourage myself and allow people to encourage me too and I will be specific about what I desire of the Lord. Then once it&#8217;s been said and done, I will say, &#8220;once I was blind, but now I see&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Mark 10:46-52, &#8220;&#8230;Rabboni, that I may receive my sight&#8221;.

Watch this Mark 10:48, &#8220;Then many warned him to be quite; but he cried out all the more&#8230;&#8221; Small voices will tell you there is no way you can be helped so will some say too. He had been stepped on, ridiculed all his life because of his condition, he has a chance to get healed yet multitude wanted him to be quiet. Doesn&#8217;t anyone care for him to be healed? In other words, they are showing him that he does not deserve the Lord&#8217;s attention. And while we are at it, how many times has the devil whispered in your ear that you don&#8217;t deserve a chance to reach out to Him? that you&#8217;ve failed, you have issues and He will never be interested in what you have to say because He has better things to do?. You can easily get discouraged because of the obstacles on the way but just like Bartimaeus, you need to cry out even louder to drown the obstacles. You and I should not let an opportunity pass us just because we feel unworthy. It&#8217;s our unworthiness that causes us to call upon Him who is able. Hebrews 4:16, strengthens this &#8220;Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need&#8221;. This man needed mercy the reason he called boldly on Him who was able to give him mercy.<\/p>\n<p>Mark 10:49, &#8220;So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called&#8221;, Can a person be known in heaven and be feared in hell? True, as we see over and over we see in the scriptures with men and women who walked with God. The people who sought after Him were feared by their enemies for the enemy knew that God was with them and was fighting for them. One man stopped a journey out of Jericho by his cry. He knew that missing this opportunity could result into another season of waiting again. And who in their right mind would want to miss what they know for sure is of God? nobody even knew whether Jesus would pass by the same road Bartimaeus was on He is not looking to Jesus to perform a miracle so that he can have more money begging, all he desires is his eyes restored. With his cry, Jesus heard him, stopped and commanded him to be called, what an awesome time that as you are seeking God, all of a sudden He stops to attend to you. Remember that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.<\/p>\n<p>Mark 10:49, &#8220;&#8230;Then they called the blind man, saying to him, &#8220;be of good cheer. Rise, He is calling you&#8221;. I think the people wanted quiet because he was stopping the Master from continuing with His program. Bartimaeus cry reached out to the Master&#8217;s ear and Jesus stopped doing everything He was doing to attend to him. I will boldly say this, it is possible to hang around Jesus and be in His presence and not feel a thing. It&#8217;s the people who are desperate for Him that get His attention. Desperate people do desperate things, they go an extra mile. Hasn&#8217;t the bible said in 1Thessalonians 5:17, that, &#8220;Pray without ceasing&#8230;&#8221;. which does not mean pray without stopping but it means pray without giving up. One man not even in the crowd got his attention so was the woman with the issue of blood . To make it interesting, the people who tried to silence him were the same people the Lord used to convey the message.<\/p>\n<p>Cease from this mentality that He knows what you desire of him and so you just sit and wait and do nothing, the blind man did not. Maximize the moment, seize the opportunity, take advantage of the time, initiate and let Him take over. Don&#8217;t let your limitation stop you from activating the other part of you that can bring life to your limitations. You might not have what it takes but when you activate your strengths, it will help you gain favor with God to help you over come your limitations.

I will develop more on this as we look at today&#8217;s message. Keep these keys in mind for I will be touching on them, hearing, initiating, obstacles, encouragement, and being specific.<\/p>\n<p>Mark 10:47, &#8220;And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, &#8220;Jesus, son of David, have mercy upon me&#8221;. We&#8217;ve been blessed with the ability to hear. Remember this man was blind, he was handicapped in one area of his life but he also knew he had other senses that had the ability help bring back to life that part of him that was dead. This is where his ears and mouth played the big role. I know for me at times I can concentrate on what I don&#8217;t have and think that what I don&#8217;t have will actually just fall from heaven. I failed to remember that what I have can help me achieve what I don&#8217;t have, all I got do so is take what I have and put it into use. &#8220;And when he heard&#8230;&#8221;, he was blind but he could hear, he had never seen Jesus heal, but he heard what He could do (heal), he had healed before, so the blind man&#8217;s faith was not based on what he saw but on what he heard, this brings Romans 10:17, so clearly when it says &#8220;So then, faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God&#8221;. &#8220;He began to cry out&#8221;, he took upon himself to initiate the move by crying out to Jesus whom we had not seen and yet heard and believed in Him. Then he called according to Romans 10:13, &#8220;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&#8221;. I can see this man seizing the moment and taking advantage of the limited time that he has. There was a great multitude, what a chance to make more money by begging but he realized that what he desired or what he needed was more than what he had been receiving. Jesus passing by awakened the desire in his heart to be healed. His faith was built at the moment to believe that all things are possible to those who believe. Remember that he&#8217;s cry was not out of a want but for a need, Philippians 4:9, &#8220;But my God shall supply all your need, according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus&#8221;. If there was something in you that went dormant because you waited too long, got comfortable where are, when Jesus is passing by, His presence will awaken dreams and desires in you that went to a dormant stage because there was no way in the while world that you could see them working out without the Lord of the impossible showing up.<\/p>\n<p>I would put aside the limitations I have and engage the other senses God has blessed me with, those will create avenues to heal the limitations in me. God will start with what we have.

We have dedicated our time on this to speak the truth that first affects us before it reaches to anyone else. If God is going to use us, we want what comes from Him to change us inside out first, then use the same word to change someone else. Like I said before, this is more than inspiration, the messages are for life changing, transforming that we all grow, live under blessings and be a people who walk in victory. If you at times delete the messages without reading, you are missing a whole lot. There are times when I am discouraged, I go back to the one&#8217;s done before and they pump life in me again.<\/p>\n<p>The message today is very simple and precise. If I could just talk about the conclusion before getting into it, the two things I would call the common denominator are seize the moment, take advantage of time!!!. I love to touch on different stories in the bible for they relate to us in some way. People relate more to stories told especially about something that happened and you can actually see how God came through for a person and was able to deliver, set them free, provide for them and many more.<\/p>\n<p>In my text, Jesus came to Jericho with His disciples and on His way, a great multitude began to followed Him. The bible takes a few verses to pin point a man out of the crowd by the name of Bartimaeus, son of Timaeus. In this world people pin point mostly heroes, celebrities, athletes, sports figures and the like. When you hear of certain names, you just know who they are and what has caused them to be known. When you hear Michael Jackson, one thing that runs through your mind is that he is a celebrity, king of pop; and if you talk about Bruce Willis, you know him as a celebrity, a movie star. But who was Bartimaeus that the bible zeroed him out? was he a hero too? If you read verse 46 you will find that Bartimaeus was a blind beggar on the streets. What does the life of a blind beggar have to offer that is so fascinating and exciting for someone to want to know? There must be something extra ordinary that happened that caused this man to be noticed. He wasn&#8217;t even looking for attention but something happened.<\/p>\n<p>The life of a blind person is not easy for instance, it&#8217;s easy to take advantage of them being by giving the wrong things just because they can&#8217;t see and determine. They can easily get hurt as they move around because it&#8217;s very easy to hit things, they become dependant and have to have someone do most of the things for them for example lead them, guide them, help them cross the road. They have a lot of limitations as to what they can and can&#8217;t do. They cannot be used as eye witnesses and many more. If I look at this in the spiritual sense, I see the same happening in the life of a believer or someone who has never received Christ in their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Because of this man&#8217;s blindness, he stationed himself by the roadside begging. I believe that there were some folks who dropped him by the roadside in the morning and picked him up in the evening and out of what he made, he paid them for their service. In a condition like that, there is a possibility of ruling out any possibility of coming out of it and therefore you find yourself in the same situation over and over again. There is a chance that you can be settled and have a permanent residing place, trying to block out all the questions as to why I&#8217;m in this condition? and why me and not someone else? and no one even cares about where I am anymore. At first they did, but they got tired of dealing with the same me over and over again. I want us to put ourselves in this man&#8217;s situation and feel what he felt, look at your life and see where you have been blind and with that you went to wrong places, got involved with the wrong person, got into the wrong business, got into a cult, just got into things because you were blind to see what was right.<\/p>\n<p>I got to stop for there is much I want to talk about that I don&#8217;t want to leave anything out. This what I leave you with this morning, until you see who you are and where you are stationed, you will not seize the moment and take the advantage of the little time you have to make a decision. To continue in the morning.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n<p><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Mark 10:46-52, &#8220;&#8230;Rabboni, that I may receive my sight&#8221;.

Man was told to reproduce and fill the earth, this ought to be an indication that whenever God is going to do something, He will always use whatever is already there without creating something new.<\/p>\n<p>To tie to what I&#8217;m sharing on, let&#8217;s look at 2Kings 4:1-6 which talks about a widow who had two sons. Her late husband feared the Lord but when he died, he left his wife with debts to which she was too poor to pay them. Because of her family&#8217;s condition, her two sons were to be taken to be slaves. Listen to what she does, she cries out to Elisha the prophet, 2Kings 4:2, &#8220;So Elisha said to her, &#8220;What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil&#8221;. What you think is nothing or small and cannot be used is what God will use. She only had a little jar of oil, in her eyes that was it but in the eyes of Elisha, God could do much more with that little jar of oil. 2Kings 4:3, &#8220;Then he said, &#8220;Go borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors-empty vessels; do not gather just few. vs. 4, &#8220;And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones&#8221;. The instruction was for her to borrow empty vessels, more vessels, from the neighborhood, as many as she could get and from everywhere. I was hoping that the prophet would ask her to use the vessels she had. Now watch this, for you to really come out of your situation, at times God will allow you to be in a position where as you call on Him, He will remind you that someone else in the same condition is empty or has little just like you. God will prompt you to borrow those vessels meaning borrow people, friends, the sick, the prisoners, your neighbors, your colleagues and put a little oil of prayer in their lives. You know where to get help from, but as for them, they may not know what to do. We have established that God will not create something else when He has a means to get the job done &#8220;YOU&#8221;. As long as the woman put little oil in the vessels she had borrowed, the oil wasn&#8217;t running out, God was filling those vessels. At times you and I need to take that little prayer we have and instead of calling on God for what we want, we can start borrowing vessels and praying for them.<\/p>\n<p>Job 42:10, &#8220;And the Lord restored Job&#8217;s looses when he prayed for his friends. Indeed the Lord have Job twice as much as he had before&#8221;. Job was brought to a level where some of his friends were at, as long as he had good health, good wife, children, wealthy, he could not know and understand what someone somewhere was going through, he was righteous and knew how to pray if he lacked. So God also allowed him to be in a tough situation so that God would use his situation to elevate someone else. 42 chapters gone, he has talked about the holiness of God, complained, talked about many things but nothing happens in his life until he prays for his friends in other words borrow his friends to put little oil in them. Now I understand why God would not deliver or answer some of the prayers I made to Him for I would easily forget that someone else is in that situation and may not know what to do. This has helped me forget about what I wanted from God and started lifting up someone&#8217;s needs and God was faithful to increase my oil. It&#8217;s through Job&#8217;s prayer for his friends that opened doors for restoration and God blessed him far beyond what he had from the beginning. You are in it for a reason, what are you going to do about it?<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<\/p>\n<p>Evans<\/p>\n<p><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Job 42:10, &#8220;And the Lord restored Job&#8217;s looses when he prayed for his friends.

You will agree with me that how you perceive yourself has a way of affecting your life. I would say that what we think of about ourselves matters a lot. If you continue to see yourself as defeated, sooner or later you will develop the symptoms because as the bible says, &#8220;As he (man) thinks in his heart so is he&#8221;. What comes out your mouth is a reflection of what you have inside. If you are constantly speaking defeat, already we can tell that you are harboring defeat inside, Proverbs 18:22, &#8220;death and life is the power of the tongue&#8221;. What comes out of your mouth can be building or tearing, can be sweet waters or poisoning water. What you think of yourself will cause you to speak what you have inside. The Shunamite woman saw a situation where her child was dead but inside of her she had faith to believe God. Because of what she believed, she pushed it out to her mouth and began to make a confession, &#8220;ALL IS WELL WITH MY SOUL&#8221;. If that is not enough, the woman with the issue of blood also knew her condition but still as she thought of herself propelled her to push out the faith in her by saying, &#8220;IF I MAY BUT TOUCH THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT, I KNOW WILL BE MADE WHOLE&#8221;. Two common things with these women were that they both had evident problems but they did not allow them to define how they felt about themselves in the situation. They understood the concept of as &#8220;you think in your heart so are you&#8221; and therefore they refused to give in to defeat. I&#8217;m not saying try and ignore the reality, what I&#8217;m saying is see the reality as a means by which God will do something and make a confession. Job took advantage of the situation though it was unbearable.<\/p>\n<p>A part from what we think of ourselves, we have to be very careful about what we speak into others especially the kids. For those who are parents, the bible says in Proverbs 22:6, &#8220;Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it&#8221;. You call your child dumb, stupid, worthless, he will grow seeing himself that way. Parents ought to invest in their children that regardless of what other people see in them, you have a better way of looking at things in their lives. You have the passion, the zeal to bring them up in the way God desires of you. Kids learn from what they hear mostly from their parents and what they see in them. If the father abuses the mother, the child exposed to that most likely to do the same to his wife. If he comes from abusive home physically and verbally, he will likely do the same. Parents have to set an example to the kids by their life style and what comes out of their mouths. I fail to understand why many parents are very frustrated with their kids when they sowed wrong seeds in them, Galatians 6:7, &#8220;Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap&#8221;. You are the role model for your kids. Parents instead of worrying about what your kids will turn out to be when you turn them loose, go into prayer closet, intercede for them. Lay your hands on them and cover them by the blood, speak life into them and let them know that you are there for them, encourage them, build self confidence, trust in them and the things people might say about them will not change how they feel about themselves through the affirmation provided by mom and dad. Provide discipline a sign of love, lead them to church, a place of growth and be the one who they look up to. Most of children feels that their dads are the most valuable people, strong and one they would want to be like when they grow up, don&#8217;t take that away from them by the wrong things you do and speak over them. How do you think of yourself, what are the confessions to show what is inside? how does what you do or say affect the younger generation?

Evans and I are grateful to the Lord because of you. Over the years there have been many of you that have written back to us words of encouragement concerning the devotions that we have written. We try our best to bring you the Word of God and not the word of man. The Apostle Paul wrote, &#8220;And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.&#8221; There are so many that want to hear the word of man. Paul said to Timothy, &#8220;For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.&#8221; This is such a deadly thing for God&#8217;s people, because the word of man does not bring about the glory of God. We try to glorify our Father in every message that is sent.<\/p>\n<p>Evans and I thank the Lord that we have been able to share the Word of God which encouraged, equipped, challenged, and even rebuked all to help train God&#8217;s people in righteousness through applying the truth of His Word. We thank each of you for taking the time to read the messages that we feel the Lord is sharing through us.<\/p>\n<p>1. For creating us in His image &#8211; Psalm 100:3: &#8220;Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.&#8221; We have not evolved from some ancient muddy glob, but rather have been created by the hand of the Mighty God.<\/p>\n<p>2. For redeeming us by His blood &#8211; Revelation 5:9: &#8220;And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>3. For sending His Son and His Spirit &#8211; II Corinthians 9:15: &#8220;Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>4. For other Christians &#8211; That&#8217;s right. We are instructed not only to pray for other believers, but to actually thank God for them. Time and again, the apostle Paul did this. Philippians 1:3 is a great example: &#8220;I thank my God upon every remembrance of you &#8230;.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>5. For His Word &#8211; Psalm 119:105 &#8220;Psalm 119:105 Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path&#8230; (Heb 4:12) For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<\/p>\n<p>May you look to His Word today as we thank you for receiving his word with gladness. Please meditate on Psalm 105 and Hebrews 4:12 throughout your day. Hey why not share the reason you are thankful with a non-believer today. Happy Turkey Day to everyone.

Thanksgiving to me is a time of reflection on what the Lord has done in the past year and giving Him thanks.\u00a0 Been disappointed many times during thanksgiving dinners seeing people give thanks but not direct it to the One. My question is, did things just happen that no one could trace their origin of those blessings that calls for thanks?<\/p>\n<p>In the book of Luke the 17th chapter, 11th division starts by saying, &#8220;Now it happened as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee&#8221;. &#8220;It happened&#8221;, though to some it may sound like it was a coincident that He passed through these cities but we know what God does He already planned it. The bible continues to tell us in verse 12, &#8220;Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood a far off&#8221;. Jesus appears in this village, I&#8217;m not sure whether anyone knew of His passing by but we are told that there met Him ten lepers. If you look at people who had leprosy in the bible, they were considered cursed people, unclean, outcast, they were not to live in the city with everyone, they lived in the caves. They walked around chanting &#8220;unclean, unclean&#8221;. How they happened to be in the city at the time Jesus was passing by is no coincident. vs. 13. &#8220;And they lifted up their voices and said, &#8220;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us&#8221;. Again we see ten men who understands that nothing just happens. If there is going to be any change in their lives, someone has to speak something that will cleanse them. This was the type of a disease that was not easy to get rid of but I can imagine them having the faith to believe in Jesus. They all lifted their voices because they all believed in what He could do.<\/p>\n<p>vs. 14, &#8220;So when He saw them, He said to them, &#8220;Go show yourselves to the priests&#8221;. Pause here for a sec, how many times have you prayed for something to come in a way you expected it only to be told to do something different? Imagine coming to Jesus, crying for healing. Instead of Him telling you that you are healed or even touching you, all He tells you is go and show yourself, in other words go and testify. He is telling them to go and testify but doesn&#8217;t tell them that as they go, they would be healed. I would not know how these men reacted but they have faith to believe without questioning and they leave. vs. 14, &#8220;&#8230;And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed&#8221;, nothing just happens!!!. Jesus did not speak healing, did not touch them but sent them away and in the process, they got healed. Your surviving this year did not just happen, trace the root of it and you will see that God was behind it, your promotion did not just happen so was your good health, your joy, peace, confidence, strength, provisions, protection, guidance, your raise, you name it. James 1:17, &#8220;Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is not variation or shadow of turning&#8221;. Nothing just happens, both good and evil can be traced from their authors.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 15, &#8220;And one of them, when he saw he that he was healed returned&#8230;&#8221; Can we say that it was just one of them who realized that this did not just happen &#8217;cause Jesus had something to do with it. He is healed, he has been restored, no more is he an outcast, now he can have relationships again, he can be close to his family. Too good to show the priests first but come back and give glory to God, falling on Jesus feet and giving Him thanks. He could have given thanks to the mother nature since Jesus did not touch him or speak healing in him, he could have thought of being lucky but this man understood that what happened was no coincident, Jesus Christ of Nazareth was the reason for His healing and because of that he came back. Jesus asked about the other 9 who were also healed. He did not question whether they were healed, He knew they were healed because when He said go, it was done. His question was, vs. 17, &#8220;Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? vs. 18, &#8220;Were there not there any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?. We can be spoiled brats just snatching what has been offered to us and going away without giving thanks. When kids are growing, the parents tend to teach them to give thanks when something is given to them or anybody else they approve of, how come when we get older we think that things just happen therefore we see no need to give thanks? And this is not only left for thanksgiving day but always being thankful. David speaks in Psalm 92:1, &#8220;It is good to give thanks to the Lord&#8221;, Psalm 26:7, &#8220;offer to God thanksgiving&#8221;, Psalm 95:2, &#8220;Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving&#8221;, Psalm 100:4, &#8220;Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As you celebrate thanksgiving, know who is the author of every good thing in your life and direct all the praise and thanksgiving back to Him. Let this be a reminder to us all that nothing just happens therefore we constantly need to give Him thanks whether it be for<br \/>\nsomething small or big. One man out of the ten returned, please return and give thanks to Him. Have a blessed, glorious, joyous thanksgiving.<br \/>\nEv<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 17:11-19, &#8220;And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks&#8221; As we are getting ready for thanksgiving, let me share this devo with you.

The unclean will not journey on it; it will be for those who walk in that Way; wicked fools will not go about on it. 9 No lion will be there, nor will any ferocious beast get up on it; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there, 10 and the ransomed of the LORD will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.&#8221; (Isaiah 35:8-10)<\/p>\n<p>Robert Frost wrote, &#8220;Two roads diverged in a wood, I took the one less traveled by, and I- And that has made all the difference.&#8221; If we choose the right road it will make all the difference in life for us as well. Life has often been described as the way one lives on a way, a path, a road, or other such words that depict travel, journeying or direction. Isaiah says &#8220;&#8230;a highway will be there,&#8221; which is to say that there is a certain highway that is ever present. However although the highway can be seen clearly, not all see it. Even all those who do see it do not travel on it. Why not? It is because it is &#8220;called the way of holiness&#8221;, as all highways have a name.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What kind of terrain does this highway have? Is it smooth, void of bumps, potholes, and sharp turns? No, it has its fair share of all of these and more. God Himself is the architect of this road. It is not an easy road to take, because this is not a highway that one can travel on in their own strength. This is a road that one must &#8220;&#8230;be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus (2 Tim 2:1).&#8221; Since this is a road of holiness, only the redeemed of the Lord may journey on it. To redeem (exagorazo) means &#8220;to buy out of slavery&#8221; by paying a price. Christ paid this our sin debt by dying on the cross. The redeemed is an elect family, the body of Christ, which helps one another to walk on. It is hard to know what to do at times on this road because one must &#8220;walk by faith and not by sight.&#8221; The road is not a wide road, but a rather narrow one because few find it (Matt 7:14), and there is none other like it. Although many walk on this road, The Apostle Paul described his travels on this road as a race in which he ran for the prize promised. He said, &#8220;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day&#8211;and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing (2 Tim 4:7-8).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Oh yes Christian if you are on this Highway of Holiness it is because you have the power of Christ in you, because, it is &#8220;Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,&#8217; says the LORD Almighty.&#8221; Oh He knows your every trial and uses them to strengthen and refine your faith in Him, because He has called you to walk by faith and not by sight. There is a crown of righteousness awaiting your victorious arrival and &#8220;to all who have longed for His appearing,&#8221; because &#8220;He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him&#8221; (Heb 11:6). So don&#8217;t give up and never give in. Get up after every bump you hit, climb out of each pothole that temporally may take you down, &#8220;for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again&#8221; (Pro 24:16), and live diligently with a reckless abandonment to &#8220;&#8230;press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me (you) heavenward in Christ Jesus&#8221; (Phil 3:14). Keep your eyes on the finish line though you can not see it with the natural eye, your eyes of faith has the vision to see &#8220;Him who is invisible&#8221; (Heb 11:27). And for those that are in ministry or desire to be, then keep your run in the race steady and don&#8217;t give up when your legs of faith grow weary. Keep running a good race, and &#8220;Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up&#8221; Galatians 6:9).<\/p>\n<p>Application: Be encouraged; stay on the Highway of Holiness, even if it is The Road Less Traveled it is the road Jesus instructed on us to take (Matt 7:14).

We talk about fast food restaurants where you drop in and get what you want, how you want it and fast, any signs of delay reveals frustrations. We cannot work with God in the same manner for His times are not our times. God sees far beyond what we see with our natural eyes and knows what is best. You have to keep on knocking, seeking, asking. It&#8217;s either God&#8217;s way or no way as simple as that.<\/p>\n<p>God&#8217;s seasons are not at your beck. If the first stroke of the flint does not bring forth the fire, you must strike again. God will hear prayer, but He may not answer it at the time which we in our minds have appointed; He will reveal Himself to our seeking hearts, but not just when and where we have settled in our own expectations. Hence the need of perseverance and importunity in supplication.<\/p>\n<p>Daniel set himself to pray and fast for three weeks when he saw a vision that needed interpretation. This is a man who knew what he needed to do and what it would cost him to get the result. Pray without ceasing add fasting to strength your prayers and watch what happens. Daniel&#8217;s prayer reached the first day and it was answered but there was the prince of air blocking the messenger from bringing the answer to him. There was a delay but Daniel kept on seeking, knocking, asking while the heaven was in motion breaking through the barriers. When the bible says in 1Thessalonians 5:17, &#8220;Pray without ceasing&#8221; does not indicate, &#8220;pray without stopping&#8221; it indicates, &#8220;pray without giving up&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the days of flint and steel and brimstone matches we had to strike and strike again, dozens of times, before we could get a spark to live in the tinder; and we were thankful enough if we succeeded at last. At times we stopped but did not give up. Shall we not be as persevering and hopeful as to heavenly things? We have more certainty of success in this business than we had with our flint and steel, for we have God&#8217;s promises at our back. Never let us despair. God&#8217;s time for mercy will come; yea, it has come, if our time for believing has arrived. Ask in faith nothing wavering; but never cease from petitioning because the King delays to reply. Strike the steel again. Make the sparks fly and have your tinder ready; you will get a light before long. &#8211;C. H. Spurgeon. Daniel the man of God did, we too need to.

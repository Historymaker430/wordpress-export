Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Failing makes man miserable and it&#8217;s because no one wants to fail. If you have a standard you&#8217;ve set, or one set for you, the last thing you want to do is fail. Hearing the words, &#8220;You&#8217;ve failed!!!&#8221; makes your heart faint because failure hinders you from moving from one point to another. Failing either leaves you stagnant or moves you a step backwards. Failing is lack to perform, ineffective or deficient. It&#8217;s to be unsuccessful, it is to decline. Fail (failure, failing) don&#8217;t paint a pretty good picture does it? Yet in our lives there is a great chance to fail. How often do we hear about failed marriage, grades, heart failure, failed to perform etc. It&#8217;s an indication that something did not live to it&#8217;s expectation.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine Peter standing and telling Jesus just before he is taken away that he will not fail Him, Mark 14:27, &#8220;Then Jesus said to them, \u201cAll of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, \u2026 \u201d 29 Peter said to Him, \u201cEven if all are made to stumble, yet I will not be.\u201d A standard Peter had set and he wanted to stand by it. Looking at where he had come from with Jesus, there was nothing else that could cause him to fail as he might have thought. Jesus knew Peter very well and knew that his spirit was willing to stand but his flesh was weak to stand the test because of the enemy of the flesh. What if someone told you that you will fail on what you plan to succeed in?, what would your reaction be? get angry with them or quit? What if someone told you that before you get to where you want to get to, be ready to have some setbacks, will that change your direction and zeal for success? Jesus said to Peter, &#8220;Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as a wheat&#8221; Jesus is telling Peter that though he has a desire and wants to stick by it, he should be ready for a setback cause Satan was going to sift him as wheat. I would say Satan was going to reveal to him some things in him that needed to be worked on and Jesus said, &#8221; 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.\u201d . Taking a closer look at what Jesus said, it would reveal to me that even though Satan had desired to sift him as wheat, Jesus prayer was that only chaff would pass through the sift and the wheat, the good seed will remain in the sift. If you are like me, you would sit down and wonder why Jesus who had power over Satan did not stop him from allowing him to cause Peter to have setbacks. I believe that this experience was going to help him in the life that was a head of him since Jesus was going back to heaven.<\/p>\n<p>The setback was not to kill or destroy him, the setback was to prepare him for even greater things. Judas Iscariot had a setback, to him it was a failure and you know what happened to him, to Peter it was a setback yes but a channel to greater things. We can&#8217;t quit living because we have setbacks, God has given opportunities and avenues for a come back, The bible says Proverbs 24:16, &#8220;For a righteous man may fall seven times And rise again&#8230;&#8221; Thank God that what we call failures he considers as temporary setbacks. His word is an open book exam, if we fail, we can take the test again. So if you failure in your exam, performance in the job, whatever it is, remember failures are temporary setbacks, you still have a great great chance for a come back. You only fail when you quit.

Hosanna in the highest!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings, blessings, blessings, who does not need blessings? To get us started, how would we define blessings and how does it apply to our lives? Blessed according to the dictionary definition is INVOKE A DEVINE FAVOR UPON, Is that wonderful or what? Let&#8217;s get some more definitions on it, to make holy by religious rite; sanctify is another definition. To continue with the def\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 inition, blessed it is to confer wellbeing or prosperity on. Blessing is a divine favor from above, it comes down from a blessed Father extending His blessings to a people who do not deserve it never will. The difference between blessed and blessings is that blessed is already favored and blessings is bestowed.<\/p>\n<p>Over and over again through out the bible, you will come across the word blessed and blessings, it&#8217;s a reminder to us that the same Father of blessings is still favoring His people even today, all we got to do is be in our rightful position to receive it. Mark the way I put it, not having everything in place but being in the right place doing the right thing and awaiting Our Heavenly Father to rain blessings on us.\u00a0 Psalm 1:1 starts in a very interesting way, &#8220;Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful&#8221;. One is blessed when he or she is not in the counsel of the ungodly, this kind of sounds confusing but I would like us to know that we as believers can and need to mix with unbelievers with a desire to win them to Christ, but we can not go by their wisdom, standards on how to live, move and the like. Believers should set up a standard for the unbelievers to look up to and not allow world to set up a standard for believers. Blessed are we when we set up standards not according to the ways of man, but according to the ways of God.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 32:1, &#8220;Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered&#8221;. I had not know sin but by the law and when the law revealed to me that I had failed, when I confessed my sins, He blessed me by forgive me and covering my sin that as far as the east is from the west, so has He forgiven my sins and placed them in the sea of forgetfulness. I might remind Him of the sins, He will not bring it up for it is history to Him. I am blessed because He took away my sins. Are you blessed in this area of forgiveness? Psalm 41:1, &#8220;Blessed is he that considers the poor: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble&#8221;, everything that you are giving out to the poor with time will come back to you a hundred fold. Giving to the poor may not necessary mean giving someone material things but giving our spiritual things. People can be poor spiritually and with one depositing encouragement, joy, smile to their account, they will be gaining back what they lacked and what a blessing to be in a position to bless someone else. Giving is like planting a seed for one plants, another waters and God gives the increase. Prov 18:22, &#8220;The blessings of the Lord makes rich, and adds no sorrows with it&#8221;, We give not because we want to gain back though we know we will, but we give because we have been blessed. Daniel 12:12, &#8220;Blessed is he that waits&#8221;, we get blessed as we patiently serve the Lord and serve others.\u00a0 Math 11:16, &#8220;And blessed is he, whosever is not offended by me&#8221;, offenses, unforgiveness and resentments have been used of the enemy to rob people of blessings and the reason being that it disconnects you from the one who offers blessings and so you miss what you should have. Offences assassinates every blessing bestowed upon you and so instead of you walking in victories, you become a victim of circumstance. Rev 1:3, &#8220;Blessed is he that reads, and hear the word of the prophesy, and keep those things which are written thereon: for the time is at hand&#8221;. Ever thought whether hearing and keeping the words of the Lord was a blessing? when we are not reading and keeping His word, we are missing the blessing of being nourished and refreshed through the word that is life to us. I think that this is one of the biggest blessings one could receive for it sets us to a place where we can know the author of blessings (favor). Rev 16:15, &#8220;Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watches, and keeps his garment, lest he walked naked, and they see his shame&#8221;. Glory to God for He is coming back soon, sooner than we expected and blessed are those who are ready, watching for His coming and are not getting weary and tired of waiting. Blessed is he that has his garments ready, he is dressed for the coming of Christ, he is ready to leave at any given time. I am blessed, what about you?

In eastern\/Greek-influenced cultures, foreign subjects were required to symbolically and ceremonially pay tribute to their sovereigns. \u201cWise men from the east\u201d suggests that the men traveled a great distance from some wild, exotic place to Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem was understood to be the home or source of godly things.\u00a0 The title of \u201cwise men\u201d suggests that the group were educated and skilled. Historians agree that the \u201cwise men\u201d were trained in Babylonian astrology or the Zoroastrian priesthood. Although the men were foreign, pagan gentiles by virtue of their birth and skill, the men somehow were aware of the prophecies concerning<br \/>\nJesus.<\/p>\n<p>The wise men called Jesus the King of the Jews. The \u201cJew\u201d is the person who faithfully lives according to God\u2019s plan, and Jesus is said to be the Sovereign of the faithful group.<\/p>\n<p>Another side note. Matthew records the occurrence of an extraordinary astronomical phenomenon; a bright star, whose light overshadowed the other lunar bodies, appeared to signal the location of Jesus, the King of the Jews. The narrative calls the bright star- \u201cHis star.\u201d Genesis 1:17 established that God set the stars in the heavens \u201cto give light upon the earth.\u201d Here, the light from \u201cHis star\u201d overshadowed the darkness of night to guide seekers to Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>The wise men, then, are not wise because of their Babylonian astrology. They are \u201cwise\u201d because they decided to leave the darkness of where they were and follow the light of His star wherever it took them.\u00a0 They followed until it leads them to Jesus where they worshipped Him and offered to Him substantial gifts which symbolized their surrender, faith, worship, and commitment (2:11).<\/p>\n<p>Both the &#8220;just&#8221; Jew and the &#8220;wise&#8221; gentile had to come to the same revelation about Jesus. Both had to recognize Jesus&#8217; unique Identity. Neither was just or wise in ands of themselves, but became just and wise by looking to Jesus. The narrative teaches us that Jesus is both Savior and Sovereign. Whether we seek God&#8217;s pardon or His guidance and leadership, we MUST look to Jesus. Looking to Jesus would require us to acknowledge our sinfulness as Joseph did without regard for how that confession would reflect on us before others. Looking to Jesus would also require us to acknowledge how lost and in the dark we are as the wise men did and leave our darkness and follow the light to Jesus- where we would offer Him our commitment and worship.<\/p>\n<p>Do you want to be just and wise?

Whatever Joseph said concerning Mary\u2019s pregnancy would have a life or death effect on Jesus\u2019 Life.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, Matthew calls Joseph- just. Being \u201cjust\u201d connotes right-standing, maturity, honesty, integrity, being moral, and being honorable.\u00a0 Justification is the status of being blameless-\u201chaving nothing on the account\u201d. No known historian records anything bad about Joseph. He was known for his character. Thus, Joseph was \u201cjust\u201d because he kept short accounts with God and people. He was a man of integrity. He practiced forgiveness and mercy and experienced God\u2019s grace as a result of his lifestyle. Because of his character, Joseph was the right man at the time to be father to the Lord, and thus, was selected to participate in God\u2019s plan with relation to Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>You see, all of Joseph\u2019s life lead him to and prepared him for this very moment. Joseph HAD TO recognize how God worked to achieve His purposes by acknowledging that Mary\u2019s pregnancy resulted from God\u2019s action. A lot was riding on this and Joseph could not afford to miss the point! Like everybody else, Joseph HAD TO acknowledge and accept Jesus\u2019 Identity. If Joseph denied Jesus\u2019 Conception, and declared His Life to be illegitimate, the community of faith would not have accepted Jesus. Therefore, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream to guide Joseph\u2019s understanding and declared the Conception to be by God the Holy Ghost, Who is the Agent of divine activity on earth. Joseph heard the angel declare Jesus to be the Savior (vs. 21).<\/p>\n<p>One side note. Because a person\u2019s name carried great significance in the western\/Greek-influenced cultures, the \u201cmystery\u201d Child\u2019s Name had to be correct. Greeks believed that God personally superintended the naming of children. This carried over into Hebrew customs.\u00a0 They believed that after a Jewish child was born, God caused the father to publicly declare the child\u2019s significance to the instant family and community when he announced the child\u2019s name. In Jesus\u2019 case, the angel told Joseph to call the Child- Jesus, (in order to fulfill prophecy) because Jesus would save His people from their sins. Now, Joseph immediately understood that IF he publicly called on a savior, then he would, in effect, be publicly calling himself a sinner. Joseph would publicly acknowledge personal sin by calling out the Name of Jesus, the Savior. But, being \u201cjust\u201d required Joseph to act justly in order to become \u201cjust\u201d. So Joseph acquiesced and publicly called the Child- Jesus, and thereby, acknowledged his own personal sinfulness and need for the Savior in the face of what his declaration meant to his own integrity, dignity, status, position, prestige, and popularity in the community. Can you imagine what the other people in the community thought of Joseph when he comes out and publicly calls the name of Jesus? I&#8217;m certain many speculated as to what was going on in Joseph&#8217;s life; perhaps, he was fudging on his tithe, or maybe he had another mistress over in Bethany.<\/p>\n<p>Look at the text. Consider what Jesus&#8217; names meant.\u00a0 Jesus = saves people from their sins (Isaiah) Immanuel = God with us \/ (Matthew) Emmanuel = God in us Matthew\u2019s understanding of Isaiah\u2019s prophecy takes an interesting twist in regards to Jesus&#8217; name. To Matthew, the Messianic reference meant more than God walking with humanity. In Jesus, God took up residence INSIDE of humanity.

I believe you have something about you that you don&#8217;t like. If God was to give you a chance to design who you would like to be, most likely you would have a complete different picture as to who you would like to be. If you are short, your design could have the tall features in it. If you are skinny like me, you might have muscles in mind when designing the new you. Every time you look in the mirror there is part of you wishing that you could change some things about you. Human beings tend to concentrate more on what they don&#8217;t have or what something someone else has that they forget to look at what they have. We at times feel that we have nothing to offer and there is nothing in our lives that other people can admire and therefore we belittle ourselves because of what we think. Psalm 139:14, &#8220;I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are thy works; and my soul knoweth right well&#8221;. You and I are skillfully, wonderfully and uniquely designed to fit in this world. You are not in this world by accident and you did not just come about. The Porter took the time to make you in an image that no one else in the while world is like you. There may be people who look and sound like you but there is absolutely no one like you. In other words, you have no competition cause no one can beat you being you. Look at the design on your thumb, there is no one in the world who has the same design as yours. You are unique, with unique qualities, unique design and there are certain things that no one can offer but you .<\/p>\n<p>My text this morning introduces us to two women who happens to be blood related sisters. We are told about Rachel and Leah. Two women married to one man. Both women are from the same source but are very different. They are unique in their looks, personality, age wise and many more things. The husband likes each of them and appreciates each of them differently based on their capabilities. I want us to understand that we can belong to God but be very different. The difference is what brings in the individuality and uniqueness that we ourselves can appreciate God for. As we are talking about these two women we see that Leah is the hated one, she is not as pretty as Rachel, she does not get all the attention she desires but on the other hand, she has been blessed with the fruit of the womb, she is the oldest and that entitles her to get the first service, she has children who can attend to her and she is respected because of the fruits of her womb. When you talk about Rachel, she is the young one therefore she is served last, remember Jacob worked seven years for Rachel but ended up with Leah and therefore Rachel had to wait for 14 years before her dream was fulfilled. She has not been favored to have children and with that she is not getting the same respect as Leah. She doesn&#8217;t have children to send, to call her own and something to be proud of. Looking at what she doesn&#8217;t have, I see on the other hand she is beautiful, she is loved more than Leah, she is given the best gifts, she gets the best attention from her husband and yet with all these she is not happy. I saw this with Hannah and Penninah. And because of what Rachel saw in Leah, she envied her, jealousy cropped in and began to cripple her. I don&#8217;t know what to say but I think the same must have happened to Leah therefore she tried to have more children to try and cover up the pain inside of her rejection.<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to agree with me on this but I would say that it is very hard to be happy for someone when you think that what they have should have been with you instead of them. I also believe that it is very hard to fully appreciate the good things in someone&#8217;s life when you don&#8217;t see what has been invested in you. Concentrating so much on what someone else has and neglecting to see what you have will always have attendancy of crippling you down for contentment in your life will be missing. Rachel could have looked at the different areas that she had been favored and say, &#8220;Well even if I don&#8217;t have this and that, God has given me this and that &#8220;. My point is very simple, look at how God designed you to know that you are unique and have no competition. As you might admire what someone else has, remember that they could be admiring what you. Understanding what you have will make you appreciate the gifting and the uniqueness in you that in turn someone else gifting and uniqueness will not be a threat to you but rather you will rejoice with them over the blessings from the Lord. Instead of envying them and being jealous, pray that God will bless them even more and let your prayer be, &#8220;Lord as you bless them, remember me&#8221;. The Lord said, I will bless them that bless you and I will curse them that curse you. You curse someone because of what they have, you are bringing a curse upon yourself but when you bless them, you too bring a blessing to yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 30:1, &#8220;&#8230;Give me a child, or else I die&#8221;. What a tragedy to look to someone to perfect you instead of going back to the manufacturer for something you don&#8217;t have. Rachel made a big mistake by thinking that it might have been Jacob&#8217;s fault that she wasn&#8217;t having children and this was his response, &#8220;Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?&#8221;. Suppose she blessed Leah and looked to God for her help, I believe God would have opened the fruits of her womb.

Whatever Joseph said concerning Mary\u2019s pregnancy would have a life or death effect on Jesus\u2019 Life.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, Matthew calls Joseph- just. Being \u201cjust\u201d connotes right-standing, maturity, honesty, integrity, being moral, and being honorable.\u00a0 Justification is the status of being blameless-\u201chaving nothing on the account\u201d. No known historian records anything bad about Joseph. He was known for his character. Thus, Joseph was \u201cjust\u201d because he kept short accounts with God and people. He was a man of integrity. He practiced forgiveness and mercy and experienced God\u2019s grace as a result of his lifestyle. Because of his character, Joseph was the right man at the time to be father to the Lord, and thus, was selected to participate in God\u2019s plan with relation to Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>You see, all of Joseph\u2019s life lead him to and prepared him for this very moment. Joseph HAD TO recognize how God worked to achieve His purposes by acknowledging that Mary\u2019s pregnancy resulted from God\u2019s action. A lot was riding on this and Joseph could not afford to miss the point! Like everybody else, Joseph HAD TO acknowledge and accept Jesus\u2019 Identity. If Joseph denied Jesus\u2019 Conception, and declared His Life to be illegitimate, the community of faith would not have accepted Jesus. Therefore, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream to guide Joseph\u2019s understanding and declared the Conception to be by God the Holy Ghost, Who is the Agent of divine activity on earth. Joseph heard the angel declare Jesus to be the Savior (vs. 21).<\/p>\n<p>One side note. Because a person\u2019s name carried great significance in the western\/Greek-influenced cultures, the \u201cmystery\u201d Child\u2019s Name had to be correct. Greeks believed that God personally superintended the naming of children. This carried over into Hebrew customs.\u00a0 They believed that after a Jewish child was born, God caused the father to publicly declare the child\u2019s significance to the instant family and community when he announced the child\u2019s name. In Jesus\u2019 case, the angel told Joseph to call the Child- Jesus, (in order to fulfill prophecy) because Jesus would save His people from their sins. Now, Joseph immediately understood that IF he publicly called on a savior, then he would, in effect, be publicly calling himself a sinner. Joseph would publicly acknowledge personal sin by calling out the Name of Jesus, the Savior. But, being \u201cjust\u201d required Joseph to act justly in order to become \u201cjust\u201d. So Joseph acquiesced and publicly called the Child- Jesus, and thereby, acknowledged his own personal sinfulness and need for the Savior in the face of what his declaration meant to his own integrity, dignity, status, position, prestige, and popularity in the community. Can you imagine what the other people in the community thought of Joseph when he comes out and publicly calls the name of Jesus? I&#8217;m certain many speculated as to what was going on in Joseph&#8217;s life; perhaps, he was fudging on his tithe, or maybe he had another mistress over in Bethany.<\/p>\n<p>Look at the text. Consider what Jesus&#8217; names meant.\u00a0 Jesus = saves people from their sins (Isaiah) Immanuel = God with us \/ (Matthew) Emmanuel = God in us Matthew\u2019s understanding of Isaiah\u2019s prophecy takes an interesting twist in regards to Jesus&#8217; name. To Matthew, the Messianic reference meant more than God walking with humanity. In Jesus, God took up residence INSIDE of humanity. Joseph uniquely understood that salvation from sin would come from God taking up residence on the inside of humanity- the KEY to the Christian salvation experience.<\/p>\n<p>The narrative of chapter 1 reveals an important lesson: Joseph\u2019s radical obedience resulted from God&#8217;s visitation. I believe that divine visitations are the source of proper human decorum. If this is true-Joseph, then, is no hero- BUT an ordinary person who simply responds to God\u2019s initiative in Jesus\u2019 birth.<\/p>\n<p>Right?\u00a0\u00a0 Joseph showed the reaction of a loyal, \u201cjust\u201d Jew to the birth of Jesus.\u00a0 Continuing\u00a0 in chapter 2, the story shows the response of the \u201cwise\u201d gentiles.\u00a0 To be continued\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Updates<br \/>\n1.

Whatever Joseph said concerning Mary\u2019s pregnancy would have a life or death effect on Jesus\u2019 Life.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, Matthew calls Joseph- just. Being \u201cjust\u201d connotes right-standing, maturity, honesty, integrity, being moral, and being honorable.\u00a0 Justification is the status of being blameless-\u201chaving nothing on the account\u201d. No known historian records anything bad about Joseph. He was known for his character. Thus, Joseph was \u201cjust\u201d because he kept short accounts with God and people. He was a man of integrity. He practiced forgiveness and mercy and experienced God\u2019s grace as a result of his lifestyle. Because of his character, Joseph was the right man at the time to be father to the Lord, and thus, was selected to participate in God\u2019s plan with relation to Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>You see, all of Joseph\u2019s life lead him to and prepared him for this very moment. Joseph HAD TO recognize how God worked to achieve His purposes by acknowledging that Mary\u2019s pregnancy resulted from God\u2019s action. A lot was riding on this and Joseph could not afford to miss the point! Like everybody else, Joseph HAD TO acknowledge and accept Jesus\u2019 Identity. If Joseph denied Jesus\u2019 Conception, and declared His Life to be illegitimate, the community of faith would not have accepted Jesus. Therefore, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream to guide Joseph\u2019s understanding and declared the Conception to be by God the Holy Ghost, Who is the Agent of divine activity on earth. Joseph heard the angel declare Jesus to be the Savior (vs. 21).<\/p>\n<p>One side note. Because a person\u2019s name carried great significance in the western\/Greek-influenced cultures, the \u201cmystery\u201d Child\u2019s Name had to be correct. Greeks believed that God personally superintended the naming of children. This carried over into Hebrew customs.\u00a0 They believed that after a Jewish child was born, God caused the father to publicly declare the child\u2019s significance to the instant family and community when he announced the child\u2019s name. In Jesus\u2019 case, the angel told Joseph to call the Child- Jesus, (in order to fulfill prophecy) because Jesus would save His people from their sins. Now, Joseph immediately understood that IF he publicly called on a savior, then he would, in effect, be publicly calling himself a sinner. Joseph would publicly acknowledge personal sin by calling out the Name of Jesus, the Savior. But, being \u201cjust\u201d required Joseph to act justly in order to become \u201cjust\u201d. So Joseph acquiesced and publicly called the Child- Jesus, and thereby, acknowledged his own personal sinfulness and need for the Savior in the face of what his declaration meant to his own integrity, dignity, status, position, prestige, and popularity in the community. Can you imagine what the other people in the community thought of Joseph when he comes out and publicly calls the name of Jesus? I&#8217;m certain many speculated as to what was going on in Joseph&#8217;s life; perhaps, he was fudging on his tithe, or maybe he had another mistress over in Bethany.<\/p>\n<p>Look at the text. Consider what Jesus&#8217; names meant.\u00a0 Jesus = saves people from their sins (Isaiah) Immanuel = God with us \/ (Matthew) Emmanuel = God in us Matthew\u2019s understanding of Isaiah\u2019s prophecy takes an interesting twist in regards to Jesus&#8217; name. To Matthew, the Messianic reference meant more than God walking with humanity. In Jesus, God took up residence INSIDE of humanity. Joseph uniquely understood that salvation from sin would come from God taking up residence on the inside of humanity- the KEY to the Christian salvation experience.<\/p>\n<p>The narrative of chapter 1 reveals an important lesson: Joseph\u2019s radical obedience resulted from God&#8217;s visitation. I believe that divine visitations are the source of proper human decorum.

God is in the business of forming and filling, Hebrews 10:9, &#8220;Then He said lo I have come to do thy will oh, God, He takes a way the first that He may establish the second&#8221; We are the second God is establishing in these last days and therefore we have to be in our rightful positions for Him to establish us. Hebrews 10:23, &#8220;Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for He is faithful that has promised&#8221;. I am being reminded that as I am being formed and established, many afflictions and trials are going to come my way but I am not expected to quit as many times I have felt like, I am encouraged to hold fast, cling to what I profess and that is my faith in Christ, I have made a declaration, a firm stand to hang on to my salvation for that is what will save me after it has been said and done.<\/p>\n<p>When you come down to verse 35 of Hebrews 10, when one calls you for a greater task, hell wont rejoice for you, hell can&#8217;t even applaud and if that is not enough, many people are not going to support you either. I have seen people give up their faith because friends criticized them and made fun of them and spoke behind their backs. When you reach heaven you will not give God an excuse that you gave up on Him because of what you perceived and what people said about you. Cast not therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward, we are not talking about your confidence in people or even in yourself but your confidence in Christ. Phil 1:6,&#8221;Being confident of this very thing, that He who has began a good work in you will perform it until the day of the Lord&#8221;. Your confidence in Christ will choke your confidence in men. With this kind of confidence, I choose to believe what God says over what people and circumstances say about me. Your confidence in Christ does have a reward as you position yourself to believe God in all that you face. After it has been said and done, your confidence in God will open channels for rewards. Watch this in Hebrews 10:36, &#8220;For you are in need of patience&#8230;&#8221;, we are all in need of patience to build our confidence and patiently waiting for the manifestation of the Lord , James 1:4, &#8220;But let patience have it&#8217;s perfect work that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing&#8221;. You can see that the bible does talk about letting patience do it&#8217;s thing without dictating it, rushing it and even trying to fix it but letting it do it&#8217;s work for it has a way of perfecting us. The more you have patience with God and in God, the more you can trust Him that regardless of the time He brings the promises, we will have patience to await for it. Hebrews 10:36&#8243;&#8230; so that after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise&#8221;, We all want to receive the promise but the question is, are we willing to do the will of God? When God promised Abraham that He would bless him with a son, the promise was there, patience was needed for the promise to be fulfilled and confidence in God was also needed for these ingredients work together but I believe after some time he lost the confidence in God, patience and therefore they created their own promise Ishmael while the true blessing Isaac was to be fulfilled at God&#8217;s given time. The funny thing is that the false blessings really looks like the true one but the problem is, it has a way of fighting the true one, it will try and make you satisfied with it that you stop looking to God for the true one. I have made up my mind that I don&#8217;t want no Ishmael for he is not from God, I would rather wait for Isaac who is the true blessing. Ishmael is the fake blessing, he is a copy and not the original. Are you going for an Ishmael blessing created by man (you) or are you going for Isaac blessing made by God.? Are you interested in the original version or the copy? Doing the will of God is sticking to the plan till the end no matter what it takes and that is our struggle everyday. It&#8217;s only when your confident in Christ stands, your patience supersedes what you define as patience and stay in His will that&#8217;s when the promise is received and fulfilled.<\/p>\n<p>I pray that we will not loose our confidence in Christ by any means, that we will be patient to await God&#8217;s timing, that we will stay in the will, that in the long run we might receive the promise. Patience is awaiting God&#8217;s timing without doubting His love and capabilities. God is able to fulfill His promise if we do our part. Now don&#8217;t blame God when you choose to go your way, He is not a man that He should lie neither is He the son of man that He should repent, If He said it, sure enough, He will do it.<\/p>\n<p>Have a blessed day full of promises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Hebrews 10:35&amp;36, \u201cCast not therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward, for you are in need of patience so that after you have had done the will of God you might receive the promise.

I&#8217;m beginning to see a different Gideon for the first time since we started talking about him. Remember how he would hide when he knew that their enemies were coming. We hear about the Spirit of God coming upon him, he begins to exercise the calling for what He was not, now He is because of the Spirit of God. When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon you, He empowers you to become what He had called you which is a sign that you will take less and do much with it. He is a leader gathering all 5tribes to listen to him. I ask myself, don&#8217;t the tribes know who he was and how he came from the smallest family in Israel? well let&#8217;s be reminded that the Favor of the Lord would cause you to be favored by many. I saw it when Jesus was getting into Jerusalem riding on a donkey, people were casting their garments, leaves, robes and cloaks on the ground that the donkey (favored donkey) would ride on it, now let&#8217;s not get over heel thinking that when we see them do the same before us that they are doing it for us, they are actually doing it for the Man who sits on the donkey and to us the Man who sits inside. 1John 4:4, &#8220;Ye are of God, ye little children for you have overcome them, for greater is He that lives inside of you than He that lives in the world&#8221;. I know we have used this line &#8220;than he that lives in the world&#8221; in reference to the devil but let&#8217;s look at it again, greater is He who lives inside of me than me (I, myself) who lives in the world. He who lives me is greater than I.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s jump to Chapter 7:2, &#8220;And the Lord said to Gideon, &#8220;The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Medianites into their hands, lest Israel claim glory for itself against me, saying, &#8216;My own hand saved me&#8221;. Oh great!!!! our friend has gathered 5 tribes adding up to about 33000 people ready to fight. He believes that the greater the number, the greater the victory. I have been in positions where I knew God was doing and He did not use what I thought He would. Please don&#8217;t start loosing heart because what you thought the Lord was going to use in your life is actually contrary to what He had in mind. Many who had dreams and visions for their lives and Spirit of the Lord was upon them but when the Lord chose to go a different direction, they got offended and terminated their dreams and visions before time, marriage is one of them. So if the Lord did it your way, you might think that it was by your own efforts and ability and God would not allow it for He is a jealous God.<\/p>\n<p>Judges 7:3, &#8220;Now therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, &#8220;whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn and depart&#8230;&#8221; And 22 thousand of the people returned and ten thousand remained&#8221; mmmmm sounds like the time the buddies you thought would stand with you forever when the going got tough and a little test came their way, they were the first ones to leave. Psalm 118:8, &#8220;It&#8217;s better to trust in the Lord than to put you confidence in man&#8221;,. Then the Lord says well you still have a big number and I can&#8217;t give you victory with this multitude, now let me choose your friends vs. 4, &#8220;But the Lord said to Gideon, &#8220;The people are still too many; bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there&#8230;&#8221; Vs 5, &#8220;So he brought the people down to the water. And the Lord said to Gideon, &#8220;Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set a part by himself; likewise everyone who gets down on his knees to drink, vs. 6, &#8220;And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth was 300 men&#8221; and the rest were sent back home. This always come back to me, Mathew 22:14, &#8220;For many are called but few are chosen&#8221; 33000 men were called but only 300 men were chosen. There is a great reason for the test, the rejected ones were the ones who went down on their knees and drank from the river, these were selfish people who cared about themselves, they were also careless for they were not keep their heads up to see when the enemy would strike. Those who lapped like a dog, they were the right people for the job, they were not ashamed to make a fool out of themselves before the Lord, they are cautious because as they scoop the water and lap out of the hands, their eyes are set to see if the enemy is coming, they are the type of people God knows that whatever He tells them to do, they will obey, they had the same spirit Gideon had. These are FAT people. I want to be FAT and I believe that would be your desire. Now let me tell you what a FAT person is before something happens to me. FAT stands for Faithful, Available, Teachable, Gideon was faithful, Available and Teachable and so was the three hundred men, you miss the quality of being FAT, you are missing a lot for I believe down deep within my heart that God can not use THIN people but FAT people. Do you want to be used of God? if so be FAT, you have to be faithful in serving the Lord, you have to be available to be used and you got to be willing to be taught.

I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you (Matt. 6:16 &#8211; 18).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fasting is one of those spiritual disciplines that seem to be a stumbling block especially for American Christians.\u00a0 Does Jesus expect Christians to fast or not?\u00a0 Keeping the Word of God in context during this series Jesus spoke previously of \u201cwhen you give\u201d and when you pray.\u201d\u00a0 Is giving optional?\u00a0 How about prayer, is it optional?\u00a0 If neither of these two disciplines is optional, then in context to the Scriptures, fasting is really not optional either.\u00a0 Jesus was assuming people would give, pray, and fast but once again, He was examining the heart of these disciplines as they are appropriated in the Believers life.\u00a0 Like giving and prayer in secret, there is a blessing attached to fasting in secret as well.\u00a0 All three of these disciplines really shouldn\u2019t be separated but are to all be practiced within one\u2019s life.\u00a0 Men fasted but did not share their food with the hungry (Isa 58:1-7). During a time of fasting Jesus pointed out the manner in which He desires that one carries out ones time of fasting and they are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>Fast with Joy.\u00a0 Perhaps this sounds like a bizarre point.\u00a0 Jesus instructed that one\u2019s face shouldn\u2019t appear as one that just sucked on a lemon.\u00a0 Rather Jesus says that one must conceal one\u2019s hunger out of one\u2019s love for the Lord.\u00a0 Fasting should be a time of feasting on God\u2019s Word, and in God\u2019s presence.\u00a0 This should not appear as a grueling task commanded by Jesus as a lording task master.\u00a0 This is a period that God is calling you to deny your flesh in order to have a spiritual buffet of His Word.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fast with giving.\u00a0 Giving, prayer, and fasting should be three fingers of the same glove.\u00a0 In Isaiah 58, God said about fasting, \u201cIs it not to share your food with the hungry?\u201d\u00a0 Who do you know that can use food?\u00a0 Why not share a short meal with someone.\u00a0 Even buying a stranger a few items on the McDonald\u2019s dollar menu will be a blessing to him or her.\u00a0 Who are you giving to as you fast, and pray?<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fast with secrecy.\u00a0 One does not need announce one\u2019s fasting time.\u00a0 Making others such as your spouse or children so that they may understand why you are not at the dinner table is helpful.\u00a0 But when one is asks by another person, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong,\u201d and the reply is \u201cI\u2019m fasting\u201d the response just manifested the insincere heart of the Believer claiming his or her fast.\u00a0 Go to the prayer closet, and commune with the Lord, and see what great things He speaks into your life.<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fast with Hunger.\u00a0 Jesus has given us a weapon in fasting God\u2019s way (see Isaiah 58).\u00a0 Many Believers don\u2019t use this weapon and therefore it remains ineffective in their lives.\u00a0 God has taught me many things during times of denying my flesh, for a period of fasting, and I have needed each lesson He gave.\u00a0 God said that if we would give, pray, and fast, then He would reward us openly.\u00a0 Learn how you can get the benefits God has for you as you fast in secret but are rewarded openly.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201cWhen you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting.

God promises Gideon to be with him and then He promises to help him defeat the Midianites. Let me make a point here, the promises of God can only be fulfilled if you stick with the plan. Jesus stuck with the plan by going to cross though painful. At one point He desired that the cup of suffering would pass Him, nevertheless He said, \u201cnot my will but Your will be done\u201d. By the time Jesus was done, He came out as one man and the same is promised to Gideon if he stuck to the plan. Can we as believers reach to that place where we speak the same words?<\/p>\n<p>Willingness and promise requires a change, for in verse 18 of Judges 6, &#8220;The he said to Him, &#8220;Do not depart from here, I pray, until I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You.&#8221; And He said, &#8220;I will wait until you come back&#8221;. Gideon has encountered with the truth, for the first time someone has told him something about himself he never knew about, he has been promised God&#8217;s presence and victory, he is so blessed by what he hears that he cannot afford to loose the opportunity to always be in the presence of the Lord. When you encounter with the truth like Gideon you can&#8217;t miss the opportunity of always wanting to be with the one who has revealed to you who you are, has promised to always be with you and has also promised victory. For Gideon his time of receiving ended now it was his time go give, he goes to the house to bring the best sacrifice to offer before the Angel of the Lord to the Lord. Human beings in general are selfish people it\u2019s about us, about our gratification, about what I can gain out of it. We always love to be in the receiving end but to effectively walk with God, there is receiving and giving, Luke 6:38, &#8220;Give and it shall be given to you&#8230;&#8221;. Jesus was the Master yet He gave, God so loved the world that He gave and so can we. Sacrifice is foregoing something for the sake of someone else Hebrews 13:15, &#8220;By Him therefore let us offer sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name&#8221;, where you want to go will cost you time, availability, faithfulness, teaching, money, sleep, reaching out to the unlovely, washing all manner of feet, it will cost you to pray even fast. If it doesn&#8217;t cost you anything, I wouldn&#8217;t call it a sacrifice. Gideon goes and prepares a sacrifice brings it over and it&#8217;s presented to the Lord. I thought that is all that he needed to do and all would be fine but there is more.<\/p>\n<p>Judges 6:25, &#8220;Now it came to pass the same night that the Lord said to him, &#8220;Takes your father&#8217;s young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal&#8230;&#8221;. Basically this means that now you got to bring down everything that is a hindrance to your move, things that are more important to you than God has to come down, if you&#8217;ve been worshipping a person, position, your money, your favorite game, they&#8217;ve got to come down. Gideon was not forced to bring them down, he was told and now the decision had to be his, Judges 6:26, &#8220;and build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this rock in the proper arrangement&#8221;. It&#8217;s tough to bring down what you consider valuable to you but who will you choose?\u00a0 it&#8217;s scary even for Gideon but he knows that either now or never, he is scared of bringing that which they love but for the sake of his people, family, community, himself he is compelled to do it. What sacrifices have you made to walk effectively with God? what altars have you brought down and built that you know were not of God? Are you willing to change? nand if so, what are you doing about to change?

Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?&#8221; 19 Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived. (NIV).<\/p>\n<p>The desire to be victorious in every area is a thirst every one craves for.\u00a0 A desire to let everything run smoothly in one&#8217;s life yet we find that there are times you are victorious in one area and a failure in other areas. We are like trees that go through different seasons, the winter, spring, summer and autumn. If you took time to look at trees in these different seasons, you will discover that there is change on how they look. During winter time, their leaves are gone. For someone who may not know might conclude the trees are dead but the truth of the matter is, they are alive and well adjusting to the season in which they find themselves in. their existence is not dependant on the season, their existence is dependant on the roots that have gone deep underground in search of water and nutrients. So the days they may not look attractive, they still have a way of surviving one season while they wait for the next season.<\/p>\n<p>Is this different from a life of a believer? I don&#8217;t think so, we too go through different seasons. There are seasons of great victories, the seasons where everything you touch is blessed, every move you make prospers then there are those times that everything you touch is a disaster. The seasons of defeat, every believer have different seasons. The key is to learn to adapt in every season, causing your roots to go down deep into the ground in search of water provided by the Almighty God. Meanwhile you await and prepare for the next season.<\/p>\n<p>In Judges 15, Samson had such a season of great victory. By just a jaw bone of a donkey, he had killed a thousand men. What a huge success, great victory not by his own hands but by the help of God. Then out of the victory, right in the sun, tired and existed, he thirsts for water. He turns to God and cries out to God, &#8220;&#8221;You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised. This is to say, &#8220;God if you gave me victory over one area, will you let me be defeated in another area? He desires water that may give him strength to survive the heat of the sun. He desires water to revive him to face another season. It&#8217;s sad to know that there are people who abandon God when they find themselves in a season that is not comfortable being in, like Samson, right in that hot season, we can cry out to God for water, His words to give us strength and revive us. Just as the disciples said, &#8220;John 6:68, &#8220;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life&#8221;, seasons had changed for them too from being fed with bread to being fed with the word, many stopped following Jesus and the disciples too had a chance to leave. They knew that instead of turning away in a new season, they desired to cling to the water giver and that is what they did.

Ev<\/p>\n<p>Judges 6:11-40&amp;7:1-25, &#8220;&#8230;The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the book of Judges 6:11 begins by saying, &#8220;Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress in order to hide it from the Midianites&#8221;. We all love to encounter with God Himself, His Son, The Holy Ghost and the Angels, any time when we feel like we are alone and no one cares, there is always a way God will reach out to His people. In the story if you begin from the previous chapters, we find how Israel had disobeyed God and how God brought Midianites, Amalekites and the people of the East to come against them. The reason why this came to them was because of the idols they worshiped and because of that some were taken captive and some were hiding in the caves, mountains and under some sacred tree where Gideon was found. Gideon is hiding so as not to deal with the present situation, he feels like there is nothing more to live for, he has lost hope and confidence, he comes from one of the poorest and youngest family, he is hiding in shame, despair, weak, broken, rejected, abused, feeling like a failure, confused wondering where is God when I need Him the most. Have you ever been in a situation where all you felt was a victim of circumstance and you wondered what is wrong with me that I have to deal with all these?, where is God when I need Him?, He seams to be blessing everyone else but me?, My neighbors are happy, my friends seam to get it all together, their families are not broken like mine. Ever felt like some people were getting promotions but you?, you seam to be trying very hard but they keep raising up someone instead of you?, have you ever been somewhere where everything wasn&#8217;t working right?, you try to say the right thing but it comes out the wrong way?, you try to succeed but you keep failing? I know some have felt this way and that is what our friend Gideon also felt and because of that, all he would do was thresh wheat under winepress. He has stopped trying, he doesn&#8217;t see any future out of it and so what is left to do is sit there and call it a quit. In his dilemma, the Angel of the Lord shows up, sits down under the tree and watches what Gideon is doing in his lost thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>6:12-13, &#8220;And the Angel of the Lord appeared to Him, and said to him, The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor. Gideon said to Him, &#8220;O my Lord, &#8220;if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about,&#8230;.now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites&#8221;. Here is a man who has suffered for a period of time, the Angel of the Lord shows up and tells him, &#8220;the Lord is with you&#8221;. Lord if you are with me, how come I am suffering?, if you are with me, how come I had to go through this and that?. You know what, we don&#8217;t have to feel the Lord to know that He is present, the bible calls Him Jehovah Shammah which means that He is present, when you think He wasn&#8217;t there He was actually there. You may have not felt like He was doing anything but be assured He was there and in the case of Gideon, He was always there and yet Gideon did not know why I&#8217;m I saying so? If God wasn&#8217;t with him, he could have been captured, he could have been killed, terrible things would have happened but because God was with him, none of these happened to him. You might have been wondering where the Lord was when you broke up with your girlfriend or boyfriend, where was He when you lost your job, when you were sick, when they lied on you, when they prevented you from receiving what you know was meant for you, where was He when your parents went through a divorce, where was He???????. You did not feel Him when you needed Him and now He shows up and calls you what, &#8220;mighty man (woman) of Valor&#8221;?.<\/p>\n<p>I got to stop but I have to say that whenever God is going to lift someone up, the rooted issues have to be dealt with and squared out for where you are going doubts, fear, un answered question cannot come with you for they will be an hindrance to what He wants to do. Gideon is launching His complain but all he needed to understand that regardless of what he went through and had to deal with and though the presence of God was always there, he needed to appreciate the fact that He manifested himself in other words revealed Himself and that would mark a beggining of something greater and tell you what, whenever the Lord reveals Himself, know that there is something in store.

Blessings Ev<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBe merciful to those who doubt; snatch others from the fire and save them; to others show mercy, mixed with fear-hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.\u201d (Jude 22-23)<\/p>\n<p>Recently I was watching the movie Volcano starring Tommy Lee Jones about a volcano that erupts in downtown L.A.\u00a0 I began to meditate on one scene in particular whereby a group of firemen are down in the subway rescuing unconscious people that are aboard a train.\u00a0 While the men are carrying people to safety, the fire chief goes to the next car on the train and picks up an unconscious man, but sees the lava headed his way melting all in its path.\u00a0 The fire chief selflessly carries the man through the train, and his shoes are starting to melt.\u00a0 When he gets to where the lava is flowing he has a choice to either drop the guy on the floor, leaving him for dead, thus saving his own life or he can jump into the lava and throw the victim to safety.\u00a0 The chief chooses to jump into the lava flow and throw the man to safety causing the chief to be consumed by lava.\u00a0 This scene reminded me of the verse from Jude which speaks of \u201csnatching others from the fire and saving them\u201d.\u00a0 To have the actions like the fire chief Christians must be willing to do the following:<\/p>\n<p>Be where lost people are.\u00a0 The people aboard the train were lost and unconscious until the firefighters searched the train.\u00a0 Most Christians disconnect with all their unsaved friends with the first two years of their conversion to Christ.\u00a0 I understand that relationships need to change when one is converted to Christ, but most are unbalanced in the manner in which they do so.\u00a0 As a result many forsake those Christ died for by severing relationships with the ungodly, rather then to be \u201ca friend of sinners\u201d like our Savior.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pick up lost people (not in the dating sense).\u00a0 The fire fighters did their jobs to pick up the lost that were in danger of burning in the lava flames.\u00a0 As Christians it is our job to pick up relationships with the lost purposefully to try and lead them to the only safe haven from the flames of Hell and that is Christ, the Living Water.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some need you to deal with them very directly and vigorously. The chief just grabbed the victim in urgency, because it was a life and death situation.\u00a0 Salvation is God&#8217;s work, but Christians are God&#8217;s instruments for snatching brands out of the fire (Zech 3:3). The picture is of a person slipping into the eternal fire but rescued from error by the grace and truth of God carried to them by a Christian.\u00a0 Darrell Robinson said \u201cThe world says you can\u2019t confront people with Jesus; you\u2019ll run them off.

It keeps my hope of having Chicken biriyani in  heaven, alive!! ;-]<\/font><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">Lets now talk about  something else! Something, that has been a favourite topic of dispute for ages!  <strong><u>Food offered to idols<\/u><\/strong>! <\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">Alright, before we  jump around and get nowhere, let us understand Gods stand on this  topic!<\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">-God Loves us! He  knows RIGHT from wrong! He knows what is good for us and what is  not!<\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">-God created us,  knowing very well that we were bound to sin! Its the very nature of flesh you  see! He just couldn&#8217;t help knowing it!<\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">-God is JUST! He  doesn&#8217;t tolerate SIN! SIN needs to be paid for!\u00a0<\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">-Now, what\u00a0is SIN ?  Taking away the glory from God is SIN!\u00a0Be it\u00a0in any form! <strong><u>The truth  is, If there is anyone at all who deserves all the GLORY in the heavens and the  earth, it is the Lord our God, and no one else!<\/u><\/strong> Any attempt to take  away the due glory from him would be SIN! <\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">-Now, to better  understand this, lets take a very common example. <\/font><font face=\"GE Inspira\">e.g. Our government is placed  above us. We abide by the laws made by our government! You may have bought  the\u00a0&#8220;the Passion of the Christ&#8221; on cd, but if the CD is pirated, you  are\u00a0violating the law, and thereby qualify for\u00a0punishment. Because the law says,  piracy is illegal! <\/font><font face=\"GE Inspira\">No justification will suffice!<\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">-Having said that,  if you make yourself your own God, out of wood or metal or anything for that  matter, you are giving GLORY to a false god.<\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">-Again the TRUTH is,  there are no other\u00a0gods! The fallen angels try and pose to be God with different  names, but who can match\u00a0the LIVING ONE! <\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">-As a young  believer, I used to wonder, &#8220;why does God claim to be jealous!&#8221;.. [this is in  the context of other gods!] Isn&#8217;t it like someone who  has\u00a0wealth\/wisdom\/power\/grace a\u00a0trillion multiplied by trillion\u00a0and more times,  bigger than a\u00a0Bill Gates\/king Solomon\/mother Theresa.<\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"GE Inspira\">There is no  comparison, at all! And then a<\/font><font face=\"Arial\"><\/font><font face=\"GE Inspira\">s God opened my eyes, I realized, it was  God&#8217;s way of reaching out to His children to make them better understand the  truth, lest they fall prey to the devil and his associates!  <\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\">-Today, after Calvary, we  have salvation grace through Jesus Christ! Nothing can harm us!\u00a0Not even food  offered to idols. Just because you ate food offered to\u00a0an idol that is  worshipped, will God strip you off your salvation joy? No,\u00a0He won&#8217;t!!  <\/font><\/div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\">-But there is more to it!  Just imagine, practising your freedom, if you\u00a0eat the food offered to idols &#8211;  knowing very well that it is harmless- you may be better off, but think  about\u00a0the weak Christian who watches you doing it! You will be causing  tremendous harm\u00a0to his FAITH!

If God be for us, who can be against us?<\/p>\n<p>One of the greatest struggles in our days is to have someone whom you can trust. Experiences has caused some people to be skeptic about who they can trust. Trust is very fragile. Someone said it&#8217;s easy to mend broken love than broken trust.<\/p>\n<p>Joshua 5:13, &#8220;And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, &#8220;Are You for us or for our adversaries?&#8221;. It&#8217;s is very important to know who is on your side and who is not. The reason is simple, he who is on your side believes in you and the ability you have and knows who you are to be able to help you do the right thing. In my text, Joshua is about to go to the battle field, he sees a Man ready for battle. Just looking at the scripture and how the words have been placed, I am utterly convinced that he saw the Lord. Read the verse yourself and you will see these word\u2019s first letter in caps Man, You, His, Him. Whenever I see such word\u2019s first letter in caps, I know the bible is referring to the Almighty God. What a comfort to know that the person whom you thought was against you is not but for you. It&#8217;s like I have come because You need me.<\/p>\n<p>Two things to bring to our attention GOD BE FOR US AND GOD BEFORE US. Romans 8:31, &#8220;What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?. I know of many people who are living today with the understanding that God is against them. It&#8217;s disturbing to me because I understand that whoever is against you has an aim to destroy you by all means. I believe that the reason why some people think this way is because they called on God for something but He never came through for them or God allowed them to go through something and to them that was a sign of God being against them. Suppose we asked our earthly father to do something and he did not, does that mean he is against us? he is for us, meaning he is on our side looking for our well being. The bible says, &#8220;If God be for us&#8221; which is interesting because I was hoping that it would say &#8220;When God is for us&#8221;. Had the bible used\u00a0 &#8220;WHEN&#8221; that would imply that God is not ready yet to be for us for He is in the process of being ready. For sure we know God is always ready. The word &#8220;IF&#8221; drops the ball in our court because we are the ones who allow God to be for us. Joshua understood this concept because there was a Man (God) who showed up ready but through the question he asked Him showed that the Man was ready to be on someone&#8217;s side and that was Joshua\u2019s. So it&#8217;s Joshua who needed to allow Him to be for them. We have God on our side friends always but we have to allow Him to be for us&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>GOD BEFORE US, this becomes the tricky one. \u201cGod be for us\u201d just means He is on our side but God before us means that not only is He on our side, He is also leading. Joshua 5:14, &#8220;So He said, &#8220;No, but as a Commander of the army of the Lord I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshipped, and said to Him, &#8220;What does my Lord say to His servant?&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to have \u201cGod for us\u201d but the most important thing is to have \u201cGod before us\u201d. The Man who appeared came in as Commander and we know commanders lead and give orders. With this understanding, not only did Joshua allow him to be for them, he also allowed him to go before them. He knew that the man was for them and not against them for He says I have come. Can you trust Him enough to be for you and go before you? Proverbs 3:5, &#8220;Trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not on thy own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths&#8221; blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning Romans 8:31, &#8220;What shall we then say to these things?

In today&#8217;s message at Youth alive, the speaker said one thing that applies here. For God&#8217;s kingdom to come, he uses the man&#8217;s kingdom. John&#8217;s witness was essential for our belief for Jesus to start His ministry. Its quite an irony, that the words of the man who was sent by God was more accepted than God&#8217;s own. But the importance of man testifying is also tackled quite early by John the disciple. Through a human being&#8217;s witness only many believe. I guess that&#8217;s why Jesus says what he says about wonders and signs. I guess miracles and wonders can keep you in awe, but a witness of a person only can make people truly believe in God. The 8th verse might have been for people at that time who believed John the Baptist with an inclination to make him more important than Jesus Christ&#8230;That&#8217;s just my view.<br \/>\nAnd what was John&#8217;s witness &#8230;Jesus , the true light that gives light to EVERY man was coming into the world&#8230;that word &#8216;every&#8217; is quite often overlooked. So Jesus came to give everyone His light..He came for everyone .<\/p>\n<p>These verses emphasize the importance of being a witness. I really enjoy the witness time in church. Message is a whole other thing when compared to witnesses. When someone stand as a witness to God it touches us. What is a witness? Witness is nothing but testifying what we see or have seen. John was to stand as a witness to testify the greatness to that light. The light that is going to bring eternal life to many. But you know what I keep thinking, why did people believe John and not Jesus as he was right in front of them doing all the miracles? To continue.

God said &#8221; let there be light and there was light&#8221; &#8230;. God had to say &#8216;The word&#8217; Without &#8216;The word&#8217; nothing could be made&#8230;meaning He was and is the root of all creation. Without Him there would be no creation. I am wondering if we extend that to the inventions man makes, coz that also involves creation.. to the new things man created , does God play a role&#8230;if yes then is he also involved in the bad inventions man made, like nuclear bombs and other harmful things. I think if we observe the creation, everything that brought life or was useful for life only was a result of the creation in those 6 days. So for any life giving \/ life helping or life complimenting creation the root is in God. I think all useful creativity comes from Him, our talents, skills , wisdom all can become useful if they come from the right source. HIM. What do! you think?<br \/>\nComing to the fourth verse..cant help but go back to Genesis for this. Both light and life were the main basis of things created then ..the other basis is water and land too. So putting these both together&#8230;Light and life both were in Jesus, out of him came the creation&#8230;again supporting the third verse. Its like the story of creation is told in that one verse and the first 2 and the 4th and 5th verses support and amplify it.<br \/>\nThe fifth verse describes God throughout history , present and all time. In all ages, during the prophets, during Jesus, and after Jesus. His Godliness has always been in front of men but they hardly understood it. I cannot say Jesus was always known to people but no one understood Him, bcoz if that was true then Jesus wouldn&#8217;t have said to his disciples to Go and tell the gospel in the world. I think everyone knows who God is, what His nature is like, but the darkness in their lives doesn&#8217;t let them understand it. If Jesus is called the Light then the opposite..the darkness is obviously Satan&#8230;cud be sin also. Like its pointed out in NIV &#8216;darkness has not understood it&#8217;\u00a0 is also written as &#8216; darkness has not overcome it&#8217;\u00a0 in some scripture&#8230;What do you think the connection is? That&#8217;s kind of unclear. These are just 5 verse but they say so much. ..almost everything for a believer.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Through Him all things were made; Without Him nothing was made that has been made.&#8221; Continuing with this verse John is still saying that our very being begins with God and only to give him glory. It is said in the bible that we are made for His pleasure. God made us so that we can glorify and magnify His name. There is no human existence without him. We are made from nothing into something. The life application bible beautifully describes this verse by saying &#8220;because we are created beings we have no basis for pride.&#8221; We are after all dust yet so proud of our form. God has created everything so beautifully and wonderfully, but are we fulfilling His purpose or running behind our own. In Revelation 4:11 it says &#8220;You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things and by your! will they were created and their being.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In Him was life and that life was the light of men.&#8221; The word light holds a lot of importance in describing God. Like you said God is light whereas darkness represents Satan. And that light is in man to show that we are God&#8217;s children. Made after his own image. Once again going back to life application bible it says &#8220;Why is eternal life in Christ a light to all mankind? Because death brings eternal darkness, and only Christ&#8217;s eternal life planted in us will keep us alive in His kingdom for eternity.&#8221; Amen.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. &#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;The light shines in the darkness&#8221; Wo! truly when the sun comes up there is no way we can see darkness like wise when we make the light of the world Jesus our personal savior there is no place for Satan. The light can take away darkness but can darkness take away the light? I think not. In this light we dare to see ourselves for who we really are, sinners, yet the promise of forgiveness stands out. The promise of eternal life in Christ.

She had been so much blessed by the messages and decided to email and encourage me. I got so blessed that I asked her to share some more, here is part of the message. Be blessed. Ev<br \/>\nJohn 1: 1-2; 1.In  the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2.He was with God in the beginning.<br \/>\nThe first thing that strikes when anyone reads this is the similarity it has with Genesis 1:1&#8230;In the beginning God created heaven and earth. So &#8216;The Word&#8217; existed before we did, before the heaven and earth. And He was with God and He was God&#8230;It sounds kind of like the trinity don&#8217;t you think? The pastor at AG&#8217;s anniversary celebration talked about this, He said &#8216;In the beginning &#8216; in Genesis stands for the timetable God had for humanity, His plan for us. since God has no beginning and end, it cannot mean that first there was God&#8230;coz God has no beginning or end. So I guess &#8216;The Word was God&#8217; supports what he said. When I thought more about the word and how we use it in daily life, I realized that after the word &#8216;God&#8217; and &#8216;Love&#8217; , &#8216;Word&#8217; is the right way to describe God. Through God was everything created&#8230;when He said through His word it was created. Everywhere we see there are words, every work is done by words, everything has words associated wit! h it. Relationships that are formed are based on words said, even for people who cannot hear, words still exist..they do not have sound but they exist. Words are more effective when understood, they have the power to make or break lives. When people are deprived of words..when they cannot express what they want to that&#8217;s when comes pain. I can go on and on, but the most important thing is that they are the most taken for granted thing in life..sometimes the most underestimated power&#8230;just like God don&#8217;t you think. So what am I saying? That &#8216;The word&#8217; probably wasn&#8217;t used as an experiment, it does hold meaning , probably not a coincidence that &#8216;The word&#8217; is what every Christian uses to refer to the bible. Another thing, generally when we say I give you my word, it means our promise&#8230;so I don&#8217;t think it would be wrong to say that &#8216;The word&#8217; means God&#8217;s promise to humanity&#8230;who is none other than Christ. And while doing my daily devotion, I accidentally came to this verse Ps:119:74 &#8220;May those who fear you rejoice when they see me, for I have put my hope in your word&#8221; So from what John 1:1 says, that would mean that all who hope in Jesus will be blessed in such a way that everyone who knows God will rejoice seeing them. Quite amazing.<br \/>\nI chose the Gospel of John because I have heard so much about this book but never really took the time to read it in depth. This is the book we are meditating in church also. There is no beginning or end to God. He was is and always will be. I really like the notes in NIV on the term &#8220;WORD.&#8221; It talks about how John wasn&#8217;t just talking about the spoken words but also unspoken. These verses talk about God being eternal. I think John is a very talented writer. Unlike Matthew, Mark, or Luke who start with the genealogy of Jesus John starts the gospel with an introduction. An introduction that gets you thinking from the very first line. Sometimes we forget Jesus is God but John starts with saying Jesus is not someone who was just born but he has been there since the beginning. Way before the heavens and the earth were made. He starts with the most important concept of Christianity which is TRINITY. Most of the time it is forgotten that Jesus is GOD. But John in a very subtle yet powerful way reminds us that He is the beginning and the end. Its starts and ends with Him.

I think of Harrison Ford in the Indiana Jones movies because his character always seemed to find himself in such a position.  He would be in a situation where on one side men with swords were attacking him, and on the other side the spiked walls would be caving in on him.  Somehow he always came out alive and with his hat as well.  That is Hollywood, but life plays some similar situations toward us at time. When one is between a rock and a hard place, going forward is trouble, going back is dangerous, and remaining in place is disastrous.  This is where Israel found herself when Moses led them out of Egypt, out of bondage only to stand before the great Red Sea in Exodus 14:13 &#8211; 16.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMoses answered the people, \u201cDo not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. Ex 14:14 The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.\u201d Ex 14:15 Then the LORD said to Moses, \u201cWhy are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on. Ex 14:16 Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.\u201d  There are some great promises and challenges in this passage of Scripture and they are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>God sees the situation behind you and instructs you not to fear.<br \/>\nIf Israel were to go back they saw themselves being slaughtered by the Egyptian Army.  As humans fear can be thought of as a natural human trait, but there are so many verses in which the Lord instructs us not to fear, and \u201cIf God is for us, who can be against us? (Rom. 8:31)\u201d<\/p>\n<p>2.    The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still (remain)<br \/>\nIf Israel were to stay in place they would be protected as long as God was there to protect them.  \u201cDo not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you (Duet. 31:6).\u201d  The Israelites had just seen the Lord previously bring down ten distinct plagues on the Egyptians and the Israelites had no part to play in causing any of the plagues to hit their enemies.<\/p>\n<p>3.    Don\u2019t sit there are cry about it, Move on!<br \/>\nGod called to move on, but to where into the Sea?  This initially presented a major problem until the Lord gave further instructions.  God gave Moses the command to raise his staff and stretch it over the sea to divide the waters so that a dry new road could be made without the use of construction machinery, builders, contracts or blueprints.  Despite resources God can use the ordinary things of ours to do extraordinary things when we obey Him as we use the common object which in this case was a shepherd\u2019s staff.  I can picture in the natural Moses stretching out his staff over the Sea, and in the Supernatural God using His hands to part the waters.  God had a plan of how to move on, but Moses needed the faith to extend his staff, and walk between the two walls of water.  The Lord will you encourage neither to go back nor to fear the past and that He will fight for you in the present as you remain still.  However, when God tells you to move you had better get going because that is where the miracle is.  Where are you currently?  Recognize God\u2019s will at each stage.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning I think we\u2019ve all faced times in our lives when we felt like we were in a situation and all the options seemed to be trouble.

God; Then I understood their end. 18 Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to destruction.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFinally the light bulb went on.\u201d\u00a0 Perhaps you\u2019ve used this expression when someone finally understood the truth, concept, idea, message, and feeling, ect that you were trying to convey.\u00a0 The In Psalm 73, the Psalmist\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it seems had a similar experience when he wrote, \u201cUntil I went into he sanctuary [house] of God then I understood their end.\u201d\u00a0 The heavenly light bulb came on in the mind of the writer.<\/p>\n<p>The author had previously been feeling greatly inferior to the wealthy wicked.\u00a0 He was trying to live a morally clean life before God, and all he saw was the ungodly acquire more and more wealth and worriless living.\u00a0 Have you ever felt this way?\u00a0 Perhaps have been trying to live right before the Lord, but it seems that the ungodly are getting all the breaks, acquiring more wealth, and much \u201csuccess.\u201d\u00a0 And if one were to freeze-frame at this point, one can be greatly discouraged in the flesh.\u00a0 However this is not the whole of the story.\u00a0 The Psalmist goes into the sanctuary of God to a revelation of the full picture of things.\u00a0 He wrote UNTIL\u2026THEN.\u00a0 It was not UNTIL he went into \u201cHeaven\u2019s IMAX theater and was shown by God the whole picture, that is all the way to the credits, that everything was seen in its proper perspective.\u00a0 The sanctuary of God is where God\u2019s presence was and when he viewed things from God\u2019s perspective, one guided in truth, he saw the wicked having all that they acquired, as if one ice, slipping away from them one way and their lives slipping into destruction the other way!\u00a0 Suddenly, the feeling of grief toward the ungodly rose up in the heart of the psalmist, because he saw their latter end.<\/p>\n<p>The catalyst however of this change of heart, of \u201cthe light bulb going on,\u201d was because UNTIL he went into God\u2019s presence, THEN HE UNDERSTOOD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are things that one cannot understand UNTIL one has been in the presence of the Lord.\u00a0 The sanctuary was always there, but the writer had to enter into it.\u00a0 We too, need to enter into the presence of God and gain the revelation of things from His perspective, which will affect our attitude and our very lives.\u00a0 From the psalmists was initially standing his eyes only saw the prosperity of the wicked, but not the end of their lives, and himself being in material lack as compared to them.\u00a0 Heavens IMAX Theater certainly showed him different, and then, I imagine that the feeling of jealousy turned to grief because they were sliding away from all they acquired and their lives sliding into destruction.\u00a0 We need not jealous of the wicked if we spend time in the presence of God were God will remind us that we need to feel grief toward the ungodly and to reach them with God\u2019s truth, because they are in need of righteousness.\u00a0 Proverbs 11:4 reads, \u201cRiches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness delivers from death.\u201d\u00a0 When we realize that the ungodly will slip into Hell, and are heading their without Christ, we will have the reigns of our hearts pricked and will share the truth of their eternal destination with them, if they die without righteousness, with the Savior.\u00a0 Jesus instructed us to store up our treasures in heaven, because he knows we cannot take anything with us, and all our worldly possession will not mean a thing to the Judge on Judgment Day, and that only righteousness with God will appease the Flawless Judge, God.<\/p>\n<p>If you are not right with God, don\u2019t wait, make the change and repent ASAP.\u00a0 If you are right with God, then make the end of this Psalm your prayer and duty.\u00a0 28 But it is good for me to draw near to God [in His presence]; I have put my trust in the Lord God [not in riches], That I may declare all Your works [to those who desperately need it].\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Blessings Pastor Phil

The Leader&nbsp;Within"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 39:33, 38,41, &#8220;Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a discerning wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt&#8221;&#8230;And Pharaoh said to his servants, &#8220;Can we find such a one as this, a man in who is the Spirit of God?&#8221;&#8230;And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One man was asked how he makes elephant sculptures off a tree trunk and his response was this, &#8220;I take the tree trunk, chop off out of it what does not look like an elephant and what I will be left with will be an elephant. Thereafter I refine that elephant to bring to a completion what I had in mind when I thought of making it&#8221;. I have read somewhere that\u00a0 &#8220;leaders are not born but are made&#8221;. One of our mission statement at church is to raise leaders. Leaders are few cause we have so many followers. In as much as so many people don&#8217;t feel they are leaders or have the qualities of leadership in them, what they need is to have everything chopped off them that does not make them look like a leader and what they will be left with is what they need to be.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that all of us have qualities of leadership. It may not be for a big corporation or group but a leader just over a person. What will take for that to happen is first determining who you are, where you are, where you want to go. Getting into conditions that will boost you to your destination. To bring a mental picture, look at an egg, if a chicken is expected out of that egg, then number one: it has to be put under a certain temperature which would lead to incubation and when it&#8217;s time is due, a chick will fight it&#8217;s way out of the shell. Remember that it had to be given the right conditions to develop from being an egg to being a chick. As long as it&#8217;s just a yolk, nothing will happen but when it matures into a chick, the shell is no longer it&#8217;s dwelling place. This mental picture shows me that we have the qualities of being leaders whether we know it or not, all that is needed is to be in a right\u00a0 incubator. It&#8217;s okay to be an egg but when you know that you have the ability to be more than an egg, you will not be comfortable being one. You will desire to fight your way through. Often times a word that lingers within our hearts and mind is &#8220;I CAN&#8217;T&#8221;, that&#8217;s good cause you just passed the test and now you can be made one. Just because you can&#8217;t do it doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t be done. You have to believe in yourself, the people who believe in you and the Almighty God who will make it happen.<\/p>\n<p>Joseph was a leader developed, for a while he was in an incubator of life being developed to be a leader. When he was but a young man, he was to me like an egg, comfortable being one but when he dreamt twice, the dreams triggered and awakened something inside of him reminding him he wasn&#8217;t all the Father wanted him to be. From making the mistake of bragging about how his household will bow before him, to being sold into Egypt, to being in Potiphar&#8217;s house, to being in jail to finally rising to power, I can see every part of his leadership being developed. Joseph being developed to be a leader recognized the leadership of someone else above him and he yielded to that leadership, he was first under the leadership of Potiphar and then Pharaoh. He was a man in authority and under authority, through his struggle in life, God developed the humility in him, a quality of a leader.<\/p>\n<p>A servant&#8217;s heart is a required quality, this does not just come, it&#8217;s developed through a pattern of life. Mark 9:35, &#8220;And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, &#8220;If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all&#8221;. Being a leader is not about bossing people around but leading by example, this has to be developed. Jesus was not a bossy leader but one that leads by example. Doing what many leaders of today would not do, being a servant of all. Joseph learnt servant hood through serving his brothers, Portiphar, the people in prison, the people of Egypt and his own. Wisdom was one of his leadership qualities, again we can see how foolish he was in the beginning but in due time, what was inside of him was developed to mature up. His interpretation of the dream to giving the advise on what was to be done was a God given developed quality the Egyptians needed. I wish I had time I would have talked more on Joseph&#8217;s leadership qualities.<\/p>\n<p>You can see that it took time to develop his leadership skills but he was ready for it, he knew of his limitations but did not limit God. He may have not understood the leadership class he was taking but I believe he appreciated it in life because God put him in an incubator. That egg, the thing that was delicate, that which could not move, that which could not function beyond, and that which was small had to be awakened to push it&#8217;s way out to become more than just an egg. Do you see yourself as more than an egg? it&#8217;s okay to be an egg but not bound to stay an egg forever. There are so many things in you that have not materialized yet, you need to be in an incubator. Ask God to show you what you could be as a leader and let that trigger something inside of you to desire to be one.

The reason we have counsel is because someone else sees what we are blind to see, is experienced, we have blocked out some things or just ignorant of it. I would say it&#8217;s hard for some people to take advice from their juniors or from the ones they feel they are superior to. Advice and counsel gives you a chance to add what you are learning new to what you already know to see far beyond what you could see with your limited knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>Husbands are going to have to humble themselves to some wise advice from their wives and not feel like it&#8217;s robbing them of their position as a man and the priest of his home. A husband who is insecure within himself may not be willing to throw in the towel and seek advise maybe because he might feel his HUMILITY will be a SIGN of WEAKNESS. Humility is not a weakness, it&#8217;s strength under control.<\/p>\n<p>32, &#8220;And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, Who sent you this day to meet me.&#8221; David could have dismissed Abigail because she was a woman, and what advice would a woman give a warrior leading over 600 other warriors, a successful soldier promised to be king? What possible reason would make David heed to the advice of a woman who is not even his wife? Simple, HUMILITY. His humility to heed to the voice of Abigail did not rob him of his manhood and position if anything it channeled him to greater levels. He would have tried to impress his soldiers by not listening to her but the choice he made once again was out of humility. Abigail may have not realized that God sent her to meet David, David knew pretty well that it was God. Wives, do you realize God has put you in your marriage for a reason? And some of the wise advice He has deposited in you to give is to draw you closer to him as he sees how well favored he is to have such a wonderful wife who cares about his life, destiny and relationship? Proverbs 31:10, &#8221; A wife of noble character who can find?\u00a0 She is worth far more than rubies. 11 Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. 12 She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life&#8221; (NIV). What a blessing to know that you are more than just a wife but a voice also that God can use to get your husband&#8217;s attention. What if marriage was created by God not to make us happy as number one reason but to teach us things about God we would not learn in any other way? That through it we are shaped in the image of God. I believe there are some accomplishments be it in ministry, work, society that will never be complete without being in a marriage. Abigail that day became a voice God could use to speak to David preventing him from bloodshed and messing the victories God had in line for him. We are blessed when we take advice and we are a blessing when we do.<\/p>\n<p>Humility may appear to be a set back for some husbands but I believe it tailors him to greater things why, &#8220;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble&#8221;. A humble husband is a husband respected Proverbs 31:23, &#8220;Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land&#8221; if only husbands would know that humility is not a sign of weakness, they would heed to those good advices they receive for they are not of men but of God.

Who wants to be around a discouraged person who always talks about nothing but failures and problems? I come across such people, always discouraged. You encourage them today, they will be discouraged tomorrow. When they call you, they wear you down with their discouragements. At times I&#8217;m not sure if their calling is to get encouragement or to find someone to join their pity party.<\/p>\n<p>I for one do well with encouragements and husbands need encouragements from their wives. Behind that macho presentation there is a vulnerability shelled with macho appearance looking for an encouragement to touch it. I think that some wives feel like their encouragements will not be significant, or he doesn&#8217;t need one or he appears strong enough to make it without encouragements. A wife who is the number one supporter of her husband has something inside of her that can touch her husband in a way that no one else can. Wives give their husbands a reason to move forward by believing in them and verbalizing it. Men have feelings too that need a touch from a loving wife. You&#8217;ve heard some wives tell their husbands how useless they are and how they will never amount to anything, this has killed them even more. They did not look forward to going home and even the need to try was shattered by a judgment already passed with no room for improvement and development. An encouragement will make him try harder and will make him a better husband.<\/p>\n<p>What was Abigail&#8217;s encouragement to David, 28 &#8230; &#8230; the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, &#8230;, and evil is not found in you throughout your days. 29 Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; &#8230;. 30 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD has done for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you ruler over Israel. Was David not a mighty warrior? Yes he was and just like any other man, his feelings and vulnerability was shelled by macho appearance needing an encouragement to pierce through the macho appearance to touch the inner being. An encouragement to melt. Maybe he was considered a warrior with no feelings just putting a show and doing the work. Even pastors, evangelists, elders, deacons, teachers, preachers, bosses, ceo&#8217;s who have excelled in their offices need encouragements. What Abigail was telling David was, &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to do any shady business to make it to the top, follow God&#8217;s ways and he will make ways for you for it&#8217;s not by might nor by power but by His spirit says the Lord&#8221;, &#8220;even if you&#8217;ve been offended and should seek revenge, calm yourself down and see how much damage you will do to your reputation, your destiny, don&#8217;t do anything you will regret. It may be hard for a husband to admit he needs encouragement, I pray the wives will learn the signals that calls for encouragements. If only wives knew how much their husbands crave for encouragements, they would seek ways to less criticize them and encourage them more. An encouragement will keep him alive and hopeful.

Abigail has regards for God, Nabal has no regards for God. Maybe in his heart he said there was no God the reason the bible says, &#8220;A fool has said in his heart there is no God&#8221; (paraphrased). In all this we still see a woman committed to protecting even the one who doesn&#8217;t deserve to be protected letting God have His way in her life. She had opportunities to destroy her husband yet not lifting a finger. There is no indication she was in abusive relationship, all I can see is a greedy husband who has no regard for other people and he was about to be spared because of her believing wife. 1Corinthians 7:13&#8230; if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. 14 For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife,&#8230; (NIV)<\/p>\n<p>23 Now when Abigail saw David, she dismounted quickly from the donkey, fell on her face before David, and bowed down to the ground. 24 So she fell at his feet and said: \u201cOn me, my lord, on me let this iniquity be! And please let your maidservant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your maidservant. Why would Abigail take the fault for what her husband did? Perhaps she saw that in marriage you are a unit in good and in bad times. If one is failing, that means the other partner is also affected. Couples can withdraw when the going gets tough, some have only stuck together in good times. Bad times really separated them hence turning around looking for faults and blaming them on each other.\u00a0 The enemy fights unity in marriages, if he can set the couple to fight each other, there will be no room to fight him. He is looking for ways to display dirty laundry couples will use against each other. Lack of unity has destroyed many marriages, everything is about me and mine where is ours?. They say another killer in marriage is finances, my money and your money there is no our money, no unity even in finances. Remember Nabal saying my bread and my water and my meat , my shearers. Abigail takes fault to save their (our) family. If we only knew the enemy was after our unity, we would fight him who tries to build a wedge between couples.<\/p>\n<p>Abigail brings food to David and his men and the first thing she does, repents seeking that all the evil to be performed would be on her. Can you see this woman putting her life on the line for her husband? I&#8217;m not sure of how many husbands would do the same for their wives and vice versa. Christ was willing to put His life on the line for the ones he loved. He said I love you, then demonstrated it by drying on the cross. If only the sinner knew and understood the sacrifice Christ had to make because of His love, a sinner would repent of his sins and trust in Christ alone with his life. His desire would be to live a life pleasing to the one who first loved him. Christ became the role model for husbands, Ephesians 5:25, &#8220;Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;&#8221;. To me this would mean, husbands demonstrate your love by putting your lives on the line for your wives. She should not loose her number 2 place in his life after God (He is FIRST).

Someone made a joke saying, &#8220;he saw a man standing there like he came out of a bad dream because he said the woman he cared for wanted something he couldn&#8217;t give her, COMMITMENT. I know for sure that there are men who have chosen loneliness and called it freedom just because commitment wasn&#8217;t part of their vocabulary. As a man, I know we pruned to making hasty decisions, something that gratifies quickly. Something more of now then comes the woman who sees far beyond now. She evaluates, equates, weighs things to make better judgment on anything be it on spending, building a home, raising children, on the job. She is not just looking at today, she is looking at down the road. How will a descion made today affect her and her family in the near future. She is looking for stability and security.<\/p>\n<p>Husbands would agree with me about this because they know for sure that had it not been for their wives who encouraged them and advised them when they were just about to make hasty decisions, they would have messed up things. God made men help meet (women) because men couldn&#8217;t handle it themselves as one preacher puts it. Men loose things, women find them. Women want commitment then they step in committed to make it better by helping their partners make better judgments. When men get angry, at times it becomes easier for them to make poor judgments and that is the case with David. David was in the wilderness and he encountered with Nabal a very wicked man married to a beautiful woman, a woman of understanding Abigail. David had protected Nabal&#8217;s servants and even protected Nabal&#8217;s wealth without him loosing anything. In time of need, David sent some of his men to Nabal for a favor. Nabal spoke harshly to David&#8217;s men, 10 Then Nabal answered &#8230;, \u201cWho is David, and who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master. 11 Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men when I do not know where they are from?\u201d. Upon getting this message, David became angry and told his men to gird themselves with swords. Not only was David coming it to destroy Nabal, he was coming to destroy the whole family, plus the servants and the wealth. Imagine Abigail suffering all these because of one man&#8217;s hasty decision.<\/p>\n<p>Nabal&#8217;s servants knew of what would befall them and instead of going to plead with Nabal, they turned to Nabal&#8217;s wife Abigail, narrated how David had been kind to them and how Nabal treated David&#8217;s servants. Nabal&#8217;s servants knew what their fate would be if nothing happened and this is what they told Abigail, 17 Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that one cannot speak to him.\u201d The servants knew Abigail pretty well to know that she will make a better judgment in a situation that seemed impossible. She had a way of turning curses into blessings. If Nabal only knew the kind of wife he had, if David only knew the woman about to come his way, if we only knew the women God has put in our lives, we would thank God for them even more. They were our first supporters and committed to making our relationships better by helping us men make better decisions. God brought them for a reason and we are yet to learn more.

It&#8217;s not out of obligation or guilt but out of the abundance of love flowing from within expressed. I call it the outworking of the internal. These are the times you find yourself doing things you would not normally going extra mile, constantly thinking about the one you love and wondering, how did you make it all these years without him or her? It&#8217;s a good feeling but I have come to learn that love is more than just a feeling, it&#8217;s a choice. The other thing that makes it to blossom even more is when you learn the language of love your partner responds to. What you respond to might not be what your partner responds to.<\/p>\n<p>Out of the abundance of this love one man asked, where does it go after one gets married? I have spoken to some people and it was clear, what they once had was no longer present or if it was, less attention was given to it. Jacob was in love with Rachel, so he served her father seven years so as to get her and what happened, he found himself with Leah, Rachel&#8217;s older sister exactly the opposite of what he desired. This is where my scripture comes in, someone in a relationship or marriage is feeling like they labored for Rachel but ended up with Leah. What happened to the Rachel you labored for? How did she (he) turn out to be Leah after marriage (this is for both man and woman).? Are you feeling like you were tricked into to marrying Leah thinking it was Rachel? do you now get rid of Leah to find Rachel?. Jacob was disappointed to have married Leah but he did not get rid of her, since he still desired to marry Rachel, he still had a chance and therefore labored another 7 years for her. This is what I call patience laboring in good times and in bad times to bring out what is missing. So Jacob had two wives, Leah and Rachel sisters but different. Both have different qualities and are all significant and vital.<\/p>\n<p>Where does this leave us? Should we be in more than one relationship because what we desired did not come forth in the other? What we labored for was not birthed and so we throw in the towel? For me I see an opportunity to labor for a Rachel within the presence of a Leah. I have heard stories about people who labored for Rachel but felt like they ended up with Leah therefore labored in their marriage for some time without giving up to be married to Rachel without giving up on Leah. Same woman, double qualities. They confessed they almost threw away the best gift from God. They just realized there was a Rachel trapped inside their Leah&#8217;s they needed to labor for. They learnt to speak the love language their mates could understand and not their own love language they hoped their mates would understand. The more they did, the more the beauty both inside and outside was revealed. They came in as separate pieces together and began to assemble their love together, fitting each piece in it&#8217;s rightful place without trying to force around peg on a square hole. They learnt that it&#8217;s more than being together, it&#8217;s about assembly because you can be together but feel separate. Assembly requires work and skills building together. They didn&#8217;t want to try to separate a Rachel and a Leah, they discovered they could assemble both together after all they came from the same womb. Don&#8217;t dismiss Leah when she is a Rachel to be discovered. We can have extra ordinary relationships out of the ordinary because we have learnt to maximize opportunities within what we already have to bring out what we never had.

That is why he had to do something about our debt of sin, the reason we pray Matthew 6:12, &#8220;Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors&#8221;(NIV). Who in their right mind would want to owe someone else? And yet we find that we are debtors to other people. The most common debt of our day is financial debt. We owe the credit card companies, car payments, appliances, accumulated electrical, gas bills to mention a few. I believe with all my heart that debt can be a disease that needs to be cured before it destroys a Christian. Some bring this disease upon themselves being careless and misusing the resources God has provided for them or\u00a0 to some life circumstances has brought them there.<\/p>\n<p>In Matthew 17, it happened that Peter and Jesus owed the temple taxes.

Didn&#8217;t the bible says, &#8220;the earth is the Lord&#8217;s and the fullness of it?&#8221;, This to me is more to our learning. Yes we are the children of God and God provides for us and God wants us to live a abundant life but He will not let us ignore our responsibility to others (government, companies, those we owe).<\/p>\n<p>Jesus turns to Peter and says, &#8220;&#8221;\u2026.go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money;] take that and give it to them for Me and you.\u201d Here is what got me, instead of Jesus calling money into existence so that Peter could use to pay taxes, He gives him an instruction that is mind beating. Backing up to Mathew 15, Jesus fed 4,000 with seven loaves of bread and few little fish. Why couldn&#8217;t He perform a miracle right there to clear up this debt? Why is it that we have Christians in debt who do not want to do anything about it? They are sitting hoping that God will perform a miracle right before their eyes and their debts will disappear. I know God can and we know of some people who have experienced it but we cannot limit God to one method of helping us deal with our problems.\u00a0 Isn&#8217;t it clear that if we owe, we should find a way to pay it back? And our prayer is Lord provide away, we want to owe man nothing? Jesus provides and Peter had a job to do and here is what he had to do, GO, CAST, TAKE, OPEN, FIND, GIVE. God could provide away for you to minize or clear up your debt, not by calling money into existence but by leading you places to fish. He could provide by creating more work that would require overtime if they pay overtime. You may be required to take a part time job because that is what he has set a side as a way to provide for you. You got to go an extra mile with His help. Peter had to do the same, yes Jesus provided yet in a way Peter&#8217;s other abilities were required. Now Jesus did not ask Peter to do an impossible task because He already took care of that, He asked him to do what He knew He could give him strength to perform. What are you doing to pay your debts? Are you praying, Lord provide away then going extra mile to fulfill what He has provided or are you doing nothing, less or just enough hoping it will go a way. If you pray Lord provide away, don&#8217;t be surprised to hear GO, CAST, TAKE, OPEN, FIND, GIVE.

Ev<\/p>\n<p>Life has many obstacles. We all face them everyday. The obstacles hinder us from being where we are supposed to be or want to be. Overcoming obstacles of any kind is not easy, especially when you are trying on your own. Naturally, as human beings, we have limited power, strength, knowledge, abilities, and many other resources that can and should be used to overcome obstacles.<\/p>\n<p>There are many ways and approaches that have been advanced by professionals, philosophers, or even lay people throughout all generations for dealing with obstacles in life. To some extent, some people have overcome great obstacles in their personal life using their own ways, methods, or even tactics and strategies. Many have also failed and some have even died without experiencing any breakthroughs with their life\u2019s obstacles. And even today, there are countless peoples who are trapped and have been stopped from moving any further because they face insurmountable obstacles that they cannot go through or past. Such people need help! I HAPPEN TO BE AMONG THOSE THAT NEED HELP. Do you?<\/p>\n<p>WELL, I do not know what your answer to that question is; I also do not know what your situation is either. But I do know that if you are like all of us, living here on earth, where there are countless problems and challenges that people face everyday, then you need help. And help is available!<\/p>\n<p>There is an enemy- a common enemy of mankind who is busy building obstacles: gates, walls etc to stop you and I from experiencing the victorious and abundant life God meant for all of us. We are all Gods creation. We were created, formed and made by God for a purpose greater than ourselves, and with unlimited potential to become anything He wanted us to be. But mankind lost it through wrong choice. Choosing to be independent, and live a life of self without God. This deviation from God\u2019s plan is one reason we have problems, difficulties and obstacles we cannot overcome on our own. It is also the reason why we are cached and limited and powerless, so that we cannot live victorious lives.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to share with you some insights and strategies that you can use as a Christian to help you overcome any obstacle you may be facing right now or in the future. Here are some Seven Strategies for Overcoming Obstacles.<\/p>\n<p>Plow Through the obstacle:<br \/>\nGo round it:<br \/>\nClimb over it:<br \/>\nChange the route:<br \/>\nRe-position yourself:<br \/>\nReview the situation:<br \/>\nBreak the obstacle in pieces and deal with the pieces one by one.<\/p>\n<p>God bless you and have a great day.

Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. 5For the LORD is good; His mercy is everlasting, And His truth endures to all generations.<br \/>\nYou&#8217;ve heard me say this before, it&#8217;s very important to start your day on a good note, it has a way of affecting your entire day if started well. To be honest with you, I tend to be very busy and spent many times but it matters a lot to me how I start my day.<br \/>\nWe all have a way of affecting how we start the day, it&#8217;s a choice that we&#8217;ve got to make and declare otherwise we become victims of stress, frustrations and lack happiness trying to do what is right. The bible tells us that the joy of the Lord is my strength. If we take a close look at the word joy, it&#8217;s more than happiness for happiness tend to go with how you feel at a given time especially when everything is going the right way, while joy comes when you know that regardless of what you have to deal with whether going forward of backward, you will make it in other words rejoicing in the end result rather than the process. The joy of the Lord should make us comfortable in the situation we are in. You can be in a storm and still sleep comfortably.<br \/>\nPsalm 100 is a psalm of joy and singing, it starts with make a joyful shout to the Lord. I don&#8217;t have to shout joyfully to be heard by people, I can shout inside and when my inside is affected, definitely my outside appearance will be the result of what is going on inside. Serving the Lord with gladness is awesome for I know that whenever I sit to work at my station, I&#8217;m working and serving the Lord. This is a blessed time where I come in the morning to work and say Lord, I thank you for another opportunity to serve you in my department and serve others that I may shine for you at my work place. You see His word says that whatsoever thy hand finds to do, do it with all of you might without murmuring or complaining and the Lord of reward shall reward thee.<br \/>\nCome before His presence with singing. I believe that music is the greatest tool used to uplift or to depress. There is nothing that people respond to like music and that is why we listen to music over and over again, we can have hundreds of music collections. The bible says that the Lord inhabits the praises of His people and we do a lot of praises through singing and listening to music. I love music and I can&#8217;t work like I need to without it because the more I praise my Lord through music, the more He energizes me to do my work. You got to give something to get something. A song with you will help you go through the day. When King Saul was being tormented by evil spirits, guess what they did, they had David playing music in his presence and the more he played, the more the evil spirit left could be near him. Replace your worries and anxieties with a song in your ear.<br \/>\nEnter into His gates with thanksgiving and into His courts with praise. I love this line for this reminds me to go beyond where I am. Entering into His gates and into His courts allows me to leave outside everything that will interfere with my praise while I&#8217;m serving Him everyday. There is power in thanksgiving and when I enter into His gates, I begin to see that He has done more and with that I need to thank Him. This is a choice everyone has to make, yes we will have so much on our plates to accomplish and yes we will be dealing with tough customers on the phone but we have been given the power to change the course of the day by allowing the joy of the Lord to be our strength. Keep a song with you, enter His gates and into His courts, refuse anything that will steal your praise, thanksgiving heart and joy and be a beacon of light. I&#8217;ve made up my mind to start and finish the day well: I&#8217;ve said it, I mean it and I&#8217;m here to represent it!!!!!

As long as hope is there, regardless of what one has to go through, deal with and suffer, there will be something inside called hope propelling him or her to keep fighting till the end. The people who have lost hope throw in the towel and call it a quit but the people who have hope, keep standing regardless of the time and season. Let&#8217;s look at the definition of hope, hope is being in the mode of expectation, it&#8217;s anticipating, wishing, looking forward to. It&#8217;s knowing that something is going to happen or something is going to come but you don&#8217;t know when and how it will show up or happen, all you are doing is keeping the hope alive with your eyes opened.<\/p>\n<p>Hebrews 11:1, &#8220;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&#8221;. Faith is believing what is not there but knowing that it will happen. The verse begins by saying that &#8220;Now faith is the substance of things&#8221;, substance in a smaller word is the core thing, the main thing to help one hope for something. With this I would say that Faith is the main thing that keeps hope alive. We are told that hope is the evidence of things not seen. There is no need to have faith for something that you can visibly see and touch for it&#8217;s already there. How can one hope for something that is present?, you hope for something that has not materialized yet and you can&#8217;t just stop thinking about it, talking about it, watching for it and waiting for it to show up. In Luke 15, Jesus talks about a father who had two sons, we know the story is about the prodigal son. The younger son took away his in heritance and went to a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living. When he came to his senses after spending everything and had nothing left, he decided to go back home. Meanwhile his father had been hoping, praying, waiting, watching to see his son coming home one day. Luke 15:20, &#8220;And he rose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him&#8221;. This father was not just passing by then saw his son, no, he had been hoping and because of that hope, he could not go into depression and fear could not keep him down for hope was keeping him alive and when what he hoped for arrived, he ran to receive his son. Hope will make you embrace promises, desires at a distance and when they appear, you will run to receive it.<\/p>\n<p>A person who is hoping has themselves at rest, Psalm 16:9, &#8220;Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh shall rest in hope&#8221;. There is nothing as bad as being in a restless position and there is nothing that you can do about it. The bible says that we cannot even add a minute to our lives therefore we rejoice and hope that the one who made us will be faithful to fulfill what He has promised and all we got to do is be in the hope mode. Hebrews 11:6, &#8220;For without faith (hope) it is impossible to please Him, for He that comes to God must first believe that He is\u00a0 and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him&#8221;. Without faith, you and I cannot please Him.<\/p>\n<p>People on hoping mode also do other things to keep that hope alive, Psalm 71:14, &#8220;But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more&#8221;. One can be on the hoping mode but can also be complaining and checking the time when it will happen. As for the Psalmist he says that he will hope continually, daily, consistently and to keep his hope alive, he will yet praise him more and more. The reason why praising him while on the hoping mode is vital, it keeps fueling faith in you to trust Him even more and not give up.<\/p>\n<p>Colossians 1:28, &#8220;&#8230; Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221;. What a way to hope when the greatest one is inside you. Christ in us gives us assurance that as we hope, He is there with us and will never leave. When we are getting discouraged and feel like giving up, His words of comfort and hope will keep us alive and kicking to trust Him. Him ordering the steps and guiding us teaches us to hope in Him even more for if He brought us this far, He can take us that far. If He provided for us then, He will do it again. If He fought for us then, we hope that He will do it again. If He provided a job then, He will do it again. We Hope in Him all day long. Have you lost hope that you could get married, be in ministry, be used of Him, achieve that career or goal, become somebody or whatever it is? Don&#8217;t let hope die for He is in you, keep pumping it and living to the fullest, exercise things that will keep your hope alive and remember that Christ in you, the hope of glory, the hope of beauty, the hope of splendor, hope of magnificence, hope of wonder, hope of brilliance and many more. Keep Hope Alive!!!!!

What do I mean, well let me explain.<\/p>\n<p>Daniel and his three friends were brought into captivity into the land of Babylon.\u00a0 This was an ungodly land, with ungodly leaders where pagan gods were worshipped.\u00a0 Even though he was in captivity Daniel gained favor with the ungodly leaders in Babylon, all whom had the \u201cpower\u201d to take Daniel\u2019s life from him at any given time.\u00a0 Even though Daniel was in such an ungodly environment the Scripture points out Da 1:8 \u201cBut Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.\u201d\u00a0 His mind was made up to be pure before God and not to follow the old saying, \u201cwhen in Rome do as the Romans do.\u201d\u00a0 No, he would do as God desired, period.\u00a0 Because of this Daniel gained favor with the most unlikely people of that ungodly land, and that is the leaders, specifically the princes and kings that ruled the nation.\u00a0 Look at Daniel\u2019s testimony.<\/p>\n<p>Da 1:9 Now God had caused the official (prince of the eunuchs) to show favor and sympathy to Daniel,<\/p>\n<p>Da 2:46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. Da 2:47 The king said to Daniel, \u201cSurely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Da 2:48 Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Da 5:29 Then at [King] Belshazzar\u2019s command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>Da 6:1 It pleased [King] Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom, Da 6:2 with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss. Da 6:3 Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>How Did Daniel gain favor with the ungodly princes and kings?\u00a0 He simply maintained a commitment to God.\u00a0 He told the kings things that were true that was bad news about them, he broke the laws of the land in order to obey the Law of God, and he of course operated and so flourished in the spiritual gifts God had given him.\u00a0 He would not compromise his relationship with God, and always took care of his three friends.<\/p>\n<p>Application:\u00a0 In an ungodly world, keep your commitment to God no matter what.\u00a0 God can bring favor with the ungodly toward you. Ps 46:10 \u201cBe still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations (heathen-KJV), I will be exalted in the earth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Col 3:22 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.

You will definitely agree with me that there are days you feel like you are winning and there are days when you feel like a failure. Often times I have used the word &#8220;season modes&#8221; for every season presents it&#8217;s weather and everyone has to learn to adapt in every season otherwise you become a victim. This day I want to talk about tools. I am yet to meet someone who is the same year in year out in their spiritual walk. I have come to discover that at times even the preachers go dry, and they are left with no power and no strength to fight the good fight of a soldier. If the preachers, pastors, deacons, board members, evangelists are not exempt from the dry and burn outs seasons, then we also need to understand that it is possible to be in the same positions. I wouldn&#8217;t say that this is a bad thing, though some may not agree with me, but I don&#8217;t want to be perfect!!!!. perfect people don&#8217;t need help. I have also come to discover that God may take you through a process and when you think you now have everything in place to make you perfect, He will relocate you again for His purpose is not to make you confident in yourself but confident in Him.<\/p>\n<p>We are all tools of a kind designed and made by God. Each tool has been made for a specific purpose and that tool cannot accomplish what it was never designed to do. Let&#8217;s look at some other words for tools, it&#8217;s instrument, device, gadget, utensil, apparatus, appliance. Let me take the word tool and make use of it. Any tool that need sharpening has to go through that process before it can effectively be used. A sharpened tool will give you a better result compared to a blunt tool. Not only will a sharp tool give you a better result, it will make the work faster and easier and you will use less energy to have the job done. You cannot force a lawn mower to trim the fence, it was never designed for that. Each and every tool was designed for a specific task and so is with every believer, we are designed for specific tasks, callings and ministries and we cannot go around trying to do everything that we were never called to do. I was never called to sing, therefore I don&#8217;t need to appear at a choir practice for I will mess up everything. When you know what you have been called to do, you will not just have a passion for it but you will also be good at it. God has invested in each of us diversified gifts that can be utilized for we are His instrument but&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>Every tool used at times get out of place, and has to be tuned, sharpened, oiled, repaired and the like and the Lord is saying to us in Isaiah 41:15, &#8220;Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth&#8221;. &#8220;Behold&#8221;, not only is He telling you and I to observe, watch, see, take a look at, view but He is also telling those around us to watch. You can be effective, but there comes a time when your effectiveness reduces and you have to come back to the one who is using you as a tool for sharpening. Watch the way He puts it, &#8220;I will make thee&#8221;, If He does not do it, it cannot be done, if He does not fix it, it cannot be fixed, therefore we call on Him to sharpen that part of our lives that has gone blunt. I just checked and another word for blunt is dull. Blunt tools don&#8217;t look attractive and most of the time, they have dents on the blade and are rusty. When you begin to sharpen it, expect it to sparkle. All the dents will diminish, it will shine and the owner of the tool is happy about using a sharpened tool. He is sharpening it because He wants to use it and not put in display.<\/p>\n<p>Our prayer lives, witnessing skills, reading of the word, faith, hope, working skills, wisdom, passions, dreams, desires, relationships need to be sharpened. I know in this group there are tools designed by God that have become dull, dormant, rusty and blunt. Someone looks like an old, beaten tool that has been abused in the hands of the wrong person. You&#8217;ve lost your effectiveness, you&#8217;ve tried hard to be used but because you are blunt, more energy is used to make something out of it. The sign of the anointing is when you can take less and do much with it, Holy Ghost knows how to sharpen us and put us back to work. Regardless of what size the tool is, when it&#8217;s sharpened and used in the right field in which it was designed for, watch and you will see marvelous results. He says again in Isaiah 41:15, &#8220;&#8230; thou shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make thee hills of chaff&#8221;. What a description of what will happen when you and I are sharpened, for we will thresh the mountains and beat them small. Hebrews 4:12, &#8220;The word of the Lord is living and powerful, and sharper than any double edged sword&#8230;&#8221;. We thank Him for His word is our sharpener. Where in your life have you gone blunt, mark that it&#8217;s not beginning but you already had it before and it was effective at one point but in the process of time, you, the tool fell in wrong hands that abused you as a tool or you were in the right hand but you lost your effectiveness and now you are blunt and dull, you have dents all over and anything you try to do is yielding less strength or no strength. Jump into the Lord&#8217;s workshop and let Him sharpen you again. He wants to use you, but with you blunt, you will not be effective.

Level 2, By Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Rom 1:21-23 \u201cFor although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Recently we looked at Romans 1:19 and how Paul spoke about those who \u201cknew\u201d God by Creation, and how this alone leaves the relationship with Him at the level of what we may refer to as an acquaintance.\u00a0\u00a0 This level of knowing God is sufficient to make man responsible, but is not by itself sufficient to accomplish his salvation.<\/p>\n<p>Paul continues in Romans 1, about knowing God where he spoke about those that \u201cknew God.\u201d\u00a0 If these people knew God, why do they display a lack of thanks to Him, and why foolish, darkened hearts that worshipped idols? The Greek word used here for know is \u201cGinosko\u201d which means to allow, be aware of, feel, or perceive, etc\u2026\u00a0 If these people knew God they certainly had a \u201cfunny\u201d way of showing it.\u00a0 When looking into the history of humanity a willful rejection of God\u2019s revelation of Himself can be traced.\u00a0 Even though these knew God via Creation, humanity failed to act upon it, and thus God was not worshipped by those whom Paul is addressing here.\u00a0 Humanity was created to worship, and if humanity fails to worship the One True God, they will worship someone or something else certainly, and in this case their choice idol was images made to look like man, as well an the animal species.<\/p>\n<p>Recall in Exodus when Moses was on Mt. Sinai receiving God\u2019s Law.\u00a0 While Moses was on the mountain where were the rest of the Israelites? These were at the bottom of the mountain creating an idol, the Golden Calf.\u00a0 Now this strikes me with great humor on the part of the High Priest Aaron.\u00a0 Aaron tries to explain away the Golden Calf, even though he clearly submitted to the will of the people in their darkened imagination and desire to create a god for them to worship.\u00a0 After collecting the gold earrings and trinkets, he melted them down and out of the pliable gold, fashioned a Golden calf.\u00a0 When Moses comes back form Sinai, Aaron tells him \u201cThey said to me, \u2018Make us gods who will go before us.\u00a0 So I told them, \u2018Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.\u2019 Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!\u201d\u00a0 This excuse makes me laugh that Aaron threw some gold in the fire and like a \u201cgenie\u201d a calf popped out!<\/p>\n<p>Many people gather the darkened imaginations of others and fashion those ideas together and create a god to suit their sins, one they are comfortable with.\u00a0 Then they worship the god by their foolish darkened hearts.\u00a0 For this reason god commands us to love not the world, and if anyone loves the world the love of God is not in him.\u00a0 The world is a system of thinking that is opposed to the God of truth, justice, love, and holiness.\u00a0 Adam tried to hide on God in the trees when he sinned because his heart became darkened.\u00a0 It would be easier to try and cover the brilliance of sun with a blanket then to try hiding from God.\u00a0 David wrote, \u201cWhere can I flee from Your presence\u2026.\u201d\u00a0 Filled with \u201cintellectual pride\u201d many \u201cclaim to be wise,\u201d and try and justify their idol worship, just to reveal \u201ctheir foolish hearts are truly darkened.\u201d\u00a0 We need to be in God\u2019s Word daily so that the light of His truth can flood our hearts daily, and leave no room for the darkness to enter in and thus worship Him!

for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When you have prayed, you have developed faith and you have patiently waited there comes at time you keep on looking to see the manifestation of the Lord but as human beings there are times we loose heart and not because we have stopped trusting but because we are not sure whether what we prayed and believed was of God. Something was shown to you, you believed it, confessed it and prayed it but now you are not sure whether you heard the Lord well simply because the prayer has not been answered. It&#8217;s a little bit tough when you don\u2019t want to waste time praying for something that may not work and you don&#8217;t want to give up praying for something that is just about to happen, &#8217;cause at the point of just giving up could have been the point of getting a breakthrough.<\/p>\n<p>Romans 13:11, &#8220;And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep&#8221;. I have seen this with the marathon guys, when they start the marathon, they start with a lot of strength, courage, anticipation, and enthusiasm, they can&#8217;t wait to go through the finish line, the more they run the more some runners try to keep up with the speed and that is also the time some drop out of the race for they can not keep up. At times it gets tougher, one part tells them to keep running for there is a prize the other tells them to give up for you have tried. The bible says,\u00a0 &#8220;And do this&#8221; to which I could say keep running the marathon, &#8220;Knowing the time&#8221;, which I could say knowing so much time you have invested, you have come from far, the faith you have built towards it, you have stuck with it up to this moment. &#8220;That now it is high time to awake out of sleep&#8221;, wake up from your dormant stage, wake up from your pity party, how about wake up from your fantasy land and the wish land and keep running. Don&#8217;t you realize that you have gone too far to go back? You have invested too much to give up running? Don&#8217;t you know that you are not where you started ? Wake up from the fear and the lies from the enemy that tells you you have waited too long for the breakthrough, blessings, and victories to come through for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.\u00a0 Friends, our salvation (blessings, victories, breakthrough) is nearer than when we first believed (had faith). I haven&#8217;t arrived yet but I&#8217;m getting closer and closer to what the Lord promised, I can smell it at a distance, I can feel it, it looks far but it&#8217;s near than I think. For those who drive or even those who do not drive, look for a car and check the side mirrors on the co drivers side, what does it say &#8220;Objects on the mirror are much closer than they appear&#8221;. What more can I say, the objects look far away from your side (co driver&#8217;s side) but the truth of the matter is, they are very nearer than you think. See the Lord is on the wheel, driver\u2019s side. He sees things using His driver\u2019s mirror. The objects appear as they are. On the co driver\u2019s side where we are sitting, our mirrors show the objects (blessings) far off, may we not feel discouraged when our mirrors tells us it\u2019s far away and begin to visualize it using the Lord\u2019s mirror. Do you the things you have been believing God for are very much closer than they appear? I choose to look at things from His mirror and by doing so, looking at my mirror would give me the hope and confidence to trust Him for though my mirror shows my blessing is far, I know for a fact that they are very close and all I need to do is keep trusting and running the race. Hebrews 12:1&amp;2, &#8220;run this race with patience, looking unto Jesus the author (start) and the finisher (perfector) of our faith.<\/p>\n<p>Have you given up on something because it was just to far off? You stopped praying, believing and went to a dormant sleeping stage? wake up from your sleep, and keep running towards your destination for your salvation is much nearer than when you first believed. It looks so far yet it&#8217;s so near. Don&#8217;t abort it when you are just about to arrive, don&#8217;t faint when you are almost crossing the finish line.

Often times as we walk with the Lord we get distracted on the way and we loose focus and it takes us time to get back to where we need to be. Also few people get beaten by their own opinion about themselves especially affected and infected by their past and so they cannot progress. We know for sure that there is nothing good in man except Christ and in as much as we have failed miserably and we ought to be thrown into the lake of fire, Christ in us cannot deny Himself but casting us away. The fact is we don&#8217;t deserve to live but the truth is He has called us His own. We are adopted to be sons and daughters of God.<\/p>\n<p>In Romans 7, Paul talks so much about struggling with sin, how he learnt what sin is, he then tells us of what sin does and then he concludes the chapter in Romans 7:24, &#8220;O wretched man that I am, who shall rescue me from this body of death? 25, &#8220;Thanks be to God-through Jesus Christ our Lord!. So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God&#8217;s law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin&#8221;. He has discovered how he is vulnerable to sin but he does not leave it there for he is transitioning from what he knows about himself and puts everything aside and begins a new chapter on a positive thought because of who God is to him. Romans 8:1, &#8220;There is therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&#8221;. It&#8217;s very easy to dwell on who you used to be and this message has been bothering me for days for at times I concentrate on who I used to be instead of looking at what the Lord is doing in me right now. We can&#8217;t deny the fact that we all have histories, we are all from the past, good and bad things happened but mostly we concentrate on the bad things that happened. We keep on bringing to remembrance what the Lord forgave us for and forgot about and instead of us progressing to the healing part of our growth, we keep on falling to the same things we thought we dealt with.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever assassinated victories in your life because you still dwelt on what you used to be? cried yourself to sleep, couldn&#8217;t reach to that level of trusting someone again with your life because of what they did to you, you are haunted by a memory, an incident, an accident and you can&#8217;t see clearly where you are going. I am terrified of becoming who I used to be, just the thought of it make me sick but I cannot undo what&#8217;s been done, I cannot change where I have come from and I cannot waste my time trying to fix what has been broken. I am too wise for that, every time I bring to remembrance my past failures, I want them to remind me that they were the bridge the Lord would use to tailor me to become who I am today. As usual I would call them points of reference and now when I meet someone and tell them, &#8220;I know what you are going through, I&#8217;ve been there&#8221;, that is to give them hope to know that if God was gracious enough to bring me up, God will be gracious enough to bring them up. But if I don&#8217;t see my past as bridge that was used to get me this far, it&#8217;s time to bury the past and leave it in the sea of forgetfulness. As long as the past haunts you, it&#8217;s time to put that ghost to rest for good otherwise you will not move far in Christ. Paul tells us how wretched he is but then he moves to the next verse and thanks the Lord for he is reminded that what he is not, he can be if Christ is in his life.<\/p>\n<p>Philippians 3:13&amp;14, &#8220;Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended; but this is one thing I do, I forget those things which are behind reaching unto those things which are before, I press towards the mark of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ Jesus&#8221;. In NIV it says, &#8220;Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it&#8221;. What an indication that the struggle continues, he knows where he has come from, what he used to do by persecuting Christians and then he got saved and the struggle continues. But this is one thing I do, I forget those things which are behind reaching unto those things which are before. He knows that for him to progress, he has to put all the past failures behind otherwise his next move will be hindered by that. I press towards the mark of the high call calling of God in Christ Jesus, meaning, I have a destiny and so I press. The word press does not mean walk into it, but fight your way through, pressing also means applying some force and that is resisting the past that tries to assassinate your move. Now mark how he puts it, pressing TOWARD (FORWARD) toward the mark, the goal Christ set for me from the beginning. I am looking at the end result while I am still moving towards it. Talk to God about who you used to be and who you are and He will talk to you about the mark of His high calling in your life. We as believers have received a calling and not just a calling but a HIGH CALLING and with that in mind, YOU CAN&#8217;T CHANGE WHERE YOU HAVE COME FROM, BUT SURE YOU CAN CHANGE WHERE YOU ARE GOING BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CALLING. YOU CANNOT UN DO WHAT&#8217;S BEEN DONE BUT YOU CAN UN DO WHAT&#8217;S NOT BEEN DONE. Break out of what is putting you down and forget those things which are behind and begin to press on towards the mark.

Should not shepherds take care of the flock?\u00a03 You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the  wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the  flock.\u00a04 You have not strengthened the  weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the  strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally.\u00a05 So they were scattered because there was no  shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild  animals.\u00a06 My sheep wandered over all the  mountains and on every high hill.

I  will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed  themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be  food for them.\u00a0<\/font><\/div>\n<div><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a011 &#8221; &#8216;For  this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will search for my sheep and look  after them.\u00a012 As a shepherd looks after  his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will  rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and  darkness.\u00a013 I will bring them out from  the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their  own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in  all the settlements in the land.\u00a014 I will  tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their  grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will  feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.\u00a015 I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie  down, declares the Sovereign LORD.\u00a016 I  will search for the lost and bring back the strays.

I don&#8217;t know how many times I have talked about trusting in God to lead and then\u00a0 felt like I was by myself or I did not see how things were going to come out in the long run. If you&#8217;ve noticed, the Lord tells us things but He never explains Himself.<\/p>\n<p>When God called the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, the plan was to bring them to the promise land. When the Lord begins to do something, He already has an end result for it and so when He begins to do it, it&#8217;s not for\u00a0 Him to try and see if it would work but for Him to finish what He has began. We could start with Him and then give up but He will not. Now we see Him bring His people through the dessert ultimately that He may bring them to the land He promised then all of a sudden there are obstacles, barriers, partitions, walls, valleys just to mention a few. God did not tell them what it will take to bring them there meaning the process. Thank God that He does not always tell us the process but the purpose for if some of us knew the process, we would give up before we even go far. David was promised that He would be the next king, God did not tell him that He would have to wait 17years, be wanted dead by Saul and face many challenges. Joseph receives a dream and he is not told that for his dream to be accomplished, he will have to be thrown into the pit, sold to Egypt, be thrown in jail and then receive it. If these two guys ever knew the process, I bet they would have thought twice about what they desired.<\/p>\n<p>While in the dessert, the children of Israel are brought by the mount Sinai and they camped there many days. The Lord may bring you through the desert but He will not leave you in the dessert. That&#8217;s why we always need to be reminded that we are nomadic people. If we stop somewhere, it will be just for a season and not forever. One preacher said that, &#8220;never build permanent decisions on temporary circumstances&#8221; As nomadic people, we are always packed up so that we can pass over. If my friends are looking for me where I was yesterday, they will not find me for I am moving on. I may cry for a while, be broken, fall but I am not going to be down forever so don&#8217;t look for me down there. It&#8217;s easy to settle at a place where you don&#8217;t fight anymore, the same case with the Israelites, peacefully sitting by the mountain. God then says, &#8220;You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward&#8221; meaning it&#8217;s time to make a stand and move forward. Yes I brought you to this mountain but this was part of the process to get you ready for the promise land. I know how I struggle with this at times because I tend to be too territorial when I know for sure that God was just using something as a bridge. He will bring me to certain places just to rest and then move me to the next level. He wants me to go Northward as there is something about Northwards, it&#8217;s in His plan. Going forward would mean fighting our way through, as you read down in the same chapter, you see how they begun to fight many enemies that they may posses. They were not told that they would fight but that was part of the process. Lord I don&#8217;t know where I am at this point but I know that I need to move forward, some of the things I ever trusted you with Lord you want to accomplish them in me. Lord speak a word that will cause me to take a stand and move Northwards and may you accomplish what you have started in me. I know how territorial I can be causing my faith to be dormant but when I know that I am still on the move, I will trust you to take me to the next place (level) for you have started a good work in me. It will be tough when you know that what you have accomplished is not the end but the middle as that was part of His process to accomplish His purpose. Maybe His process is to build you up in ministry, singing, intercession, strong in the word, walking with Him, granting you the desires and the dreams of your life or whatever it is. If He promised, sure enough He will accomplish it but the question is, CAN YOU STAND THE PROCESS?

I know that God gives calling to His people and I also believe God reveals what you are made of as you step out. Stepping out allows you to unlock hidden mysteries inside of you. I am a witness to this because I never knew what I was made of until I began to exercise faith and step out and do it. This ministry was birthed in stepping out. I never knew God could use me with all my limitations but when I stepped out, I unlocked a tank of writing and putting messages together He had reserved for the right time. In stepping out by faith to do them I applied pressure to a container of treasures stored and pushed out what was stored in there. Shake a bottle of soda and try and open it and see work of pressure.

Thousands of others have gone through the same experience. Yet, every time I watch someone go through this important moment of life, goose bumps cover my arms. The meaning of this great event is the glue that holds society together. No nation can forget the deep meaning of this experience and survive for long. It&#8217;s foundational to any culture.<br \/>\nSo, what is this great moment? It&#8217;s that moment when a man and woman make vows to love and cherish each other for the rest of their lives. They enter into a covenant relationship in which they are committed to one another until death parts them. We call it the wedding ceremony. It&#8217;s the public commitment of the deepest of human relationships. It&#8217;s when a man and a woman &#8220;cut a covenant&#8221; with one another. This relationship is so deep that Paul compared it to the relationship of Christ to the church.<br \/>\nOften in ancient times, people are groups of people entered into covenant relationships. Sometimes these relationships were between two warring factions. Other times, the lives of two people just seemed to be knitted together. The latter was the experience of David and Jonathan. God seemed to knit their hearts together after David killed the giant, Goliath.<br \/>\nThe Bible describes clearly what happened with David and Jonathan. It says, &#8220;After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself. And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt&#8221; (1 Sam. 18:1, 3, 4 NIV).<br \/>\nYoung David found someone who was more than just a friend in Jonathan. This relationship was one of the most profound friendships described in the Bible. There were several characteristics of this covenant relationship which can be a model for strong healthy friendships today. First, the became one in spirit. It&#8217;s not often that God just knits two hearts together. If a person has one relationship in life like that, then he is fortunate. David and Jonathan were knit together and &#8220;one in spirit.&#8221; God gave me a friend like that many years ago. He was killed in an automobile accident 12 years ago, but I&#8217;ve never gotten over the impact he had on my life.<br \/>\nWhen the ancients entered into a covenant, they often exchanged a piece of clothing and a piece of armor. This happened in David and Jonathan&#8217;s covenant. The clothing represented the material possessions that they had. Jonathan was saying to David, &#8220;All of my possessions are now available to you.&#8221; The sword represented the exchange of power. Jonathan was saying that all of the power available to him as Saul&#8217;s son was now available to David.<br \/>\nThis covenant relationship between David and Jonathan is the clearest Old Testament picture of the covenant relationship that we have with Christ. He has said to us, &#8220;All that I possess is now yours. All of my power belongs to you.&#8221; We have an incredible inheritance because of the covenant that Christ made with us. The Lord&#8217;s Supper is a reminder of that covenant. Every time we participate in that great symbolic event, we need to remember the covenant that we have with Him. We have entered into the deepest of relationships known to man. He has given us an incredible inheritance.<br \/>\nBut there&#8217;s one last aspect of the covenant between David and Jonathan that is very important to us. When two ancient people cut a covenant, it was until death. The only way that they could get out of the covenant was through death. Jesus cut a covenant with us. He was faithful until death. We, too, must be faithful until death. Once we&#8217;ve entered the covenant, there&#8217;s no turning back. We have all of His riches in the heavenly places, but we also have the responsibility to follow Him all the way until death.<br \/>\nApplication: David and Jonathan&#8217;s covenant relationship teaches us a lot about life &#8211; and a lot about death.\u00a0 Are you learning from them today?

Am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221;\u00a0 And He said, &#8220;What have you done? The voice of your brother&#8217;s blood cries out to Me from the ground.<\/p>\n<p>The first sin committed horizontally (human to human) is the sin of murder.\u00a0 Cain and Able both brought an offering to the Lord and the Lord respected Abel and his offering, but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.\u00a0 Cain instantly became upset because God did not respect what Cain had brought him.\u00a0 God knowing this didn&#8217;t try and boost his self-esteem, but rather asked him three questions. First God asked, &#8220;Why are you angry?&#8221;\u00a0 Secondly, &#8220;why has your countenance fallen?&#8221;\u00a0 Thirdly God asked, &#8220;If you do well, will you not be accepted?&#8221;\u00a0 Now whenever God asks a question it is never because He doesn&#8217;t know the answer, because God is omniscient (all knowing).<\/p>\n<p>God is giving Cain an opportunity to come to his senses and realize that he needs to point the blame to himself and not to God who rejected his offering, and not to his brother which he would become jealous of.\u00a0 Just like his father Adam who blamed his wife and the serpent (the devil) for Adam&#8217;s disobedience, so now does his son Cain proves the old saying true, &#8220;the apple doesn&#8217;t fall far from the tree.&#8221;\u00a0 God wants Cain to get a grip on things, and to overcome the sin that is knocking at the door of his heart which desires to control him, but God commands Cain that Cain must master it.\u00a0 Only one was going to be the leader, either Cain or the sin.\u00a0 So what happened? &#8220;Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.&#8221;\u00a0 Cain didn&#8217;t master his sin, his sin mastered him, and Able became the victim.<\/p>\n<p>God comes to Cain and asks another question, &#8220;Where is Abel your brother?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know. Am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221;\u00a0 Cain wasn&#8217;t his brother&#8217;s keeper although he should have been, but instead he was his brother&#8217;s killer.\u00a0 We are to be keepers of one another and not killers of one another.\u00a0 1 John 3:15 reads, &#8220;Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.&#8221;\u00a0 It\u2019s not just the act of murder, by the spirit of murder that finds its way in our lives if we\u2019re not discerning.\u00a0 The law magnified shows that God sees murder even in the hating stage of our minds.\u00a0 A man can be sent to prison for drawing out plans to assassinate the President, even before the plans are carried out!\u00a0 One must also be wise in how one treats others, especially in what comes out of ones mouth.\u00a0 Proverbs 18:21 tells us, \u201cThe tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.\u00a0 James says, \u201cAll kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man, but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.\u00a0 With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God\u2019s likeness.\u201d We kill with our words, and our actions.<\/p>\n<p>God said to Cain, &#8220;What have you done? The voice of your brother&#8217;s blood cries out to Me from the ground.\u00a0 Instead of being his brother\u2019s keeper and being responsible for him, he became his brother\u2019s killer.\u00a0 May each of us ask ourselves today \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper or my brother\u2019s killer?\u201d\u00a0 For further reading read the story of Jonathan and David and see how Jonathan was his brother (David\u2019s) keeper, when he could have been his killer.

He was also a mighty man of valor, but a leper&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I am amazed by how God works, His ways are not our ways and His plans are not our plans. He is the God of the impossibilities. See we know He will do it because He has said it in His words, yet often times we do not know how He will do it. We tend to work well with recipes because if we stick to a recipe, we can tell what the result will be. Often times we bring this also in our Christian life as we feel God has a recipe of doing things. It&#8217;s like He has set a method A,B,C oh how to get it done. God is not a respecter of methods and that is why with God there is no recipe. All you need to know is that it will be done, let the way it&#8217;s done left for Him to execute. Another thing, God is no respecter of persons, He can bless anyone including sinners why Matthew 5:45, &#8220;&#8230; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Those who validates God&#8217;s ability by a recipe are those who lack understanding that He is unlimited God. How often did you know God was going to come, you thought He will come through the door only to see Him come through the roof?, that is God who does not use recipes. Naaman was a commander, there is no indication that he was a just man because in the later verses of the same chapter, he gets to know the true God. Reading the first line, he was honorable in the eyes of his master because the Lord had given him victory in the battle field. You can tell the rain rained also on the unjust. He was a respected man, had servants, honored, successful but had leprosy. Being told that there was a prophet in Israel who could cure him of this disease, he comes with his own recipe of what he believes God will or should do to heal him. After all he wanted to maintain his status, wanted just to deal with certain ranks of people. Well the king of Israel could not heal him and the prophet did not even meet him though he had what people would consider success. At least we know the prophet was not also a respecter of persons but principles. He is asked to go and deep himself in the river Jordan seven times and he would be cured. Why didn&#8217;t God heal him instantly or while he was still in his land or Lord respecting his status? Simple God did not have a recipe for this man. And so are we, God can use someone who we don&#8217;t even get a long with to bless us, a job that has turned out to be a frustration, something that did not seam like a good thing God could use. He can use the least expected, the least likely, the stones that the builders rejected. If we have a recipe, then the recipe becomes God for we will be out to dictate to God what He should and shouldn&#8217;t do, we might be tempted to tell Him of a step on the recipe He might have missed. So don&#8217;t keep your eye on one thing He used thinking that is what He will always use. Namaan had an end result of what he desired but not by the method he had in mind.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus healed two blind men in differently, one he spat on the ground, anointed his eyes and told him to go and wash, the other he spoke to. Same results, different methods. When are you going to stop creating recipes from what the Lord did last time and trust Him to do a new thing? Hasn&#8217;t His word said, &#8220;Behold I am doing a new thing?&#8221;.\u00a0 If we can know the end result, let the method be left in His hands. Throw away your recipe book, watch, pray, have faith because He is doing something new that is not on the recipe book.

Be blessed.<\/p>\n<p>Churches have different teachings on drinking alcohol and wine. Some churches approve maybe to a certain point, some do not based on their scripture backups. If I was to ask each of you of what you believed and what your convictions are, I know some will say it&#8217;s okay and some will say it&#8217;s not. I&#8217;m not going to get into a debate as to whether it&#8217;s right or wrong but according to some of the scriptures that I have come across have given me a hint that it&#8217;s wrong and that is my conviction. In the olden times when they talked about wine, they were actually talking about grapes crushed, fermented to make the wine. Sounds to me like fermented grape juice with no additions. Anyway I&#8217;m not imposing my convictions on you I thought I would air my views.<\/p>\n<p>Well that is not the word to us this morning. Jesus, His mother and the disciples have been invited to a wedding. This was the time when Jesus was just getting ready for His ministry and therefore He had not performed any miracles for His time was not yet. Jesus is one of the guests at the wedding and as a guest, we expect Him to sit down just like the rest and enjoy the wedding yet before long, all the wine that was served to the guests ran out and I assume that every one was still in need of wine. I don&#8217;t know whether they could get wine from anywhere. One thing I know of is that Jesus&#8217; mother knew that her son was a miracle worker. This makes me believe that she went a head and calmed down the bride, the groom and the guests invited by letting them know that everything would be fine.<\/p>\n<p>vs. 5, &#8220;His mother said to the servants, &#8220;Whatever He says to you, do it&#8221;, vs. 6, &#8220;Now there were set there six water ports of stone, &#8230;. vs. 7, &#8220;Jesus said to them, &#8220;Fill the water ports with water&#8221;. And they filled them up to the brim&#8221;. The servants were told to obey everything that they were told though they looked and sounded foolish to do, Imagine taking water and filling vessels with it and not just one vessel but six. As you pour the water, nothing happens and then to make it even more foolish, you are asked to draw some of that water and give it to the MC. We need not to know the process but become obedient to what He says and that is why when we got saved, we did not look like we were going to be anything for we still looked like the water poured into the vessels, but when we were brought to the MC, we the common was made un common, the colorless was made colorful, the tasteless was made tasteful, that which had no smell was made to smell, the unwanted was made wanted, that which had no purpose was made purposeful, the unusable was made useful for that is what Christ did to us as one of the greatest miracles. Do you realize that this was Jesus first miracle and being saved is the first greatest miracle?\u00a0 We are the water which was turned into wine ladies and gentlemen, and what a great miracle. Not only was the water turned into wine, it became the best wine the guests could have why? Math 19:30, &#8220;But many that are first, shall be last; and the last shall be first&#8221;, Hebrews 10:9, &#8220;Behold I have come to do thy will oh God, He takes a way the first, that He may establish the second&#8221;. The water everyone despised\u00a0 and put a side is the same water turned into wine, yes it may look the same as it was being drawn out but check again, taste it, smell it. The reason why many still see it as water is because they are used to seeing it that way so the eye performs a trick but stick a little longer, taste it, look at it again, smell it, you will find that it&#8217;s not what you thought. I have met people whom I thought nothing was happening in their lives for I did not understand that they were water turned into wine and the more I spent time with them, the more I saw their true colors of how God had blessed them, the more they had many things to offer (inner beauty, encouragements) why because a life that was once tasteless was made tasteful. I&#8217;m glad to be water turned into wine that when I could not be used to serve the guests now I can. I thank God that I can be used to influence, touch many regardless of who they are, their ranks, positions because Christ made a difference in me, I know you are also water turned into wine not to stay in the vessel but to be used to serve many. With that said, I don&#8217;t need wine now for I am one.

My friend Paul was sharing with me a message he had preached to the youths on &#8220;God is in control&#8221; looking at the life of Jonah. I was touched by it, then I got home later and being that I have been reading the gospel of John, the above scripture tied to what he had shared with me, when I got to do devotions with my girl friend, the devotions talked about the &#8220;God of the impossibilities&#8221;. Those three messages tied together left me with a message from God about what He can and will do.<\/p>\n<p>TL Osborne one of the greatest evangelists in the 70&#8217;s said something that struck me, &#8220;Healing of the unbeliever is based on the mercy of God, Healing of the believer is based on the covenant&#8221;. Believers have a covenant with God and that is what I see on the above scriptures. If you are saved, then Christ has allowed you to be attached to Him. When we lived outside Christ, we were disconnected, out of touch, everything was impossible because of our own limited abilities. Therefore abiding in Christ gave us a whole new identity, a whole new perspective of what was impossible. It wasn&#8217;t I who was facing them alone anymore, but I was facing them with Christ in me who makes me do all things through Him. I could only bring forth what He allowed me to bring forth, something that was once impossible in my sight.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t the abiding that spoke to me on this scripture, it\u2019s the portion that says, &#8220;and My words abide in you&#8221;, This is where if I know the word of God and let it sink down deep within my heart, saturating me and chocking out every doubt I ever had, any confusion the enemy might have planted, then the same will begin revive the faith in me\u00a0 that negates the facts. The word is what reminds me of the covenant He made. His covenant is, &#8220;if you abide in Me and my words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. A believer should have a whole new way of looking at the covenant to which the bible says is, &#8220;God&#8217;s promises to human race&#8221;. Why refuse to abide and much so allow His words? I have come to realize even in my own life, believers have no problem abiding, it&#8217;s His words abiding that becomes the problem. Simply because of lack of faith. We don&#8217;t see what God can do because of who we are. Do you know that God does not bless us based on who we are, He blesses us on the basis of His covenant. To the children of Israel, you will hear God say, &#8220;I blessed them because of my covenant with David or Moses or Abraham&#8221; (paraphrased). Israel did not deserve it but because of God&#8217;s covenant (promises), He did it anyway. It&#8217;s not this also with us, God can bless us because of His covenant to His Son Jesus Christ. If we abide (get saved) and His words (that build faith) then the fulfillment of the covenant will come. Until we understand that &#8220;God is in control, He is the God of the impossibilities and that His blessing is based on His covenant&#8221;, our faith will still be dead. I still fail and have nothing to qualify me for the blessing except abiding and having faith to see His covenant fulfilled. It&#8217;s not complicated, we make it complicated. God can bless you with a companion, a ministry, a calling, children, a position, healing, restoration, deliverance, peace, joy, love because of His covenant. Start today by abiding, then let His words abide till you have faith that negates the facts then remind Him of His covenant through His Son.

If it&#8217;s stolen, it&#8217;s easy to see it missing but when it&#8217;s planted, it takes time to grow and by the time you get to see the symptoms, by then a damage would have already been done.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at the first weeds the enemy planted in the lives of God&#8217;s children Genesis 3:8, &#8220;Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, &#8220;Has God indeed said, &#8220;You shall not eat of every tree of the garden&#8217;?&#8221; While man did not know what to plant in his life, God planted good seeds and everything was ok until Adam was not present (a sleep) that the enemy sneaked in to plant weeds. I wonder why the serpent waited till Eve was alone. I see an indication of the husband being the protector, defender, fighter of the home. Standing for the truth and leading the family in the truth. And the first weeds I see in this verse, the enemy planted lies, confusion and doubt and immediately those weeds began to chock out the truth they always lived by. Look at how Joshua protected his family from allowing the enemy to plant weeds &#8220;as for me (Joshua) and my house, we will serve the Lord, (Joshua 24:15). There were evil weeds the enemy was planting in the lives of the Israelites and Joshua gave the people a choice as to who to serve (gain good seeds) then he mentioned to them about his stand, to stay awake and watch in order to protect his family from allowing the enemy to plant weeds. The enemy is cunning and if he can&#8217;t take away from you, be ready because he will try to find ways to plant.<\/p>\n<p>In our world today even Christians have too many weeds growing in their lives, this has stunted their growth. One of the greatest weed is deception, being deceived by strange doctrines that appear like the truth. It&#8217;s not that enemy has taken the truth away from you, he has distorted the truth by planting something else that competed with the right seed and now you are wondering which this of this is the good seed and the weeds. Adam and Eve were deceived and they could not tell what the truth was and what was a lie. That is the work of the enemy, if he can&#8217;t steal it, he will plant something else.<\/p>\n<p>What do I do when I can see the weeds in my garden?, I tried pulling them but they came back, couldn&#8217;t distinguish between a good seed and a weed. While working on the front yard of my parents house, there were too many unwanted weeds growing on their yard, we had tried uprooting them before, but they came back. The reason they came back was because when you uproot, the seeds still remain and that is what begins to germinate again. So I went to the store and found a spray that could ONLY KILL THE WEEDS WITHOUT DESTROYING the flowers that were planted. Not only would it kill the present growing weeds, it would kill even their unborn seeds. I didn&#8217;t have to be out there the whole day trying to pull them because I could destroy the flowers too, all I needed to do was spray and let the spray do it&#8217;s work. We have the BLOOD OF THE LAMB to spray on our gardens. Yes we have good seeds and weeds, and if we can&#8217;t identify the weeds, the blood will. If we are scared of damaging the good seeds while uprooting the weeds, the blood will preserve the good seeds and destroy the weeds. If we fall a sleep and the enemy plants weeds, don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s over, take the blood and spay it over your garden (family, job, position, ministry, while you drive) , the weeds will die with their seeds too, and you will have another chance to grow stronger and blossom, you will have fruit and your garden will be beautiful to look at. In dealing with weeds in our lives, spraying the blood everyday will cause our gardens to be weed free.<br \/>\nBlessings Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Matthew 13:24-30, 24 Jesus told them another parable: &#8220;The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.

Romans 14 involve vegetarians and respect of certain days. Believers with Jewish roots were expelled from Rome and were later permitted to return. The opposite of Acts 15 was at work here. The international church now had to deal with folks from headquarters. Paul takes a different approach from James. Cultural considerations would not enjoin HQ to the international church. The law of love must rule and superintend all contemplations and considerations of believers at home and abroad. Believers live their lives before God, who sovereignty keeps, guides, and judges them independently.\u00a0 No adherent should take up an adversarial posture that permits them to declare another adherent to be unfaithful to Christ based on personal preferences. Whether someone chooses not to follow \u201cthe body is the temple\u201d tradition and takes a high calorie, high carbohydrate, high fat, high salt\/sugar diet, or chooses to observe Halloween and Kwanzaa over Christmas, is not of real significance; however, such issues may create issues for dispute in the fellowship. Therefore, according to Paul, each believer must work so \u201cthat no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother\u2019s way\u201d. Some people have a thing about Cinco de Mayo, worshipping on Tuesdays. Some support \u201csave the dolphins\u201d and are offended at tuna eaters, and give their lives to prevent the mistreatment of animals and have hang-ups with meat-eaters. Guess what? Paul says that we must seek peace and let people be themselves.<\/p>\n<p>(What- at my expense? Surely, Paul is not suggesting that I must give up MY individualism for the sake of somebody who wants to hold to his or her own dumb hang-ups! Why can\u2019t THEY just grow up and let it go?) If this is your sentiment- then you are the very one that Paul is targeting. Practice deference. You don\u2019t walk in love if you live your life in the fellowship without regard for others. Yet, Paul says, \u201cit is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.\u201d I find this saying to be equally challenging to all. What, then, is the appropriate Christian response to believers who smoke blunts and knock a few back at the local bar?<\/p>\n<p>Notice, Corinthians follows Romans.\u00a0 1 Corinthians 8 involves how food offered to idols put the knowledgeable against the weak in conscience. Paul clearly states that idols are imposters and not gods at all. Further, it is silly to suggest that a bonafide believer could stand in jeopardy by the foods that s\/he eats- whether donated to an idol or accepted as blessed by Yahweh. Yet, Paul cautioned, \u201ctake heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak\u201d. Paul had been so influenced by the mystical union between Christ and his body that he reasoned, \u201cwhen ye sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ\u201d. Based on this fact, Paul said that he would not eat meat again as long as he lived if his eating it caused him to offend this principle.\u00a0 The church in Acts constituted an exclusively religious group represented by adherents who grew up Jewish. The Roman church constituted a mix between religious adherents and unchurched adherents. The Corinthian church constituted unchurched adherents. In each example, the high call of integrity and deference brought out God\u2019s best for each church and established a harmony and unity that was trans-cultural and international in scope. Being part of the church is difficult especially when we encounter others in the church whose beliefs and practices scare us and strike us as more liberal than God will allow. God cares for each believer and can speak to each in a way that cannot be undermined or counterfeited. Let him guide, keep and judge the \u201cliberals\u201d. Let us stick to letting them be themselves and loving them in such a way so that Christian virtue can also superintend their minds and hearts.

Weeds are plants considered undesirable, unattractive, or troublesome. They grow where they are not wanted and they become a pest to what you have growing. It&#8217;s interesting to note that in as much as you plant good seeds on the ground, don&#8217;t be surprised to see weeds begin to spring forth also on that ground. The weeds grow fast as they also want to shine in the presence of what you are growing.<\/p>\n<p>In Matthew 13 beginning in verse 24, Jesus takes the time to tell of a parable. As usual He used the natural to elaborate the spiritual. He says the, &#8220;The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field&#8221;. Whenever we are praying, reading the word, fellowshipping, loving your neighbors, you are sowing good seeds in your field. Mark that Jesus did not say sowing good seeds in someone&#8217;s field, He said sowing good seeds in his (your) field. That which was designed and assigned to him (you). However big or small, it still remains his (your) field with a desire to plant good seed. Also note that He does not say just seeds, He says good seeds to distinguish. This is why we need to be careful about what we sow in our fields, Galatians 6:7, &#8220;Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap&#8221;. As mentioned earlier, anytime you plant good seeds on the ground, expect weeds to spring forth. The bible says wherever there is good, evil (weeds)\u00a0 tends to be present too (paraphrased).<\/p>\n<p>In the field, though good seeds were planted, while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. Looking at our lives closely, you can spot some weeds of jealousy, fear, anxiety, lust, pride, bitterness. These are not good seeds, these are weeds planted while people went to sleep. The enemy found a ground un protected and that is why he sowed the weeds. Now weeds stunt the growth of the planted seeds, it reduces their yield and hence when we look at our lives we can see how some of these weeds have prevented us from growing stronger in the Lord and bearing fruit. It&#8217;s frustrating when you want to grow stronger and stronger and bear fruit and while you are at it, you see weeds present too. You have tried uprooting them and you did but not long after that, they came again. In the process of uprooting them, you also you interfered with the growing good plants. This is a dilemma to me that I cannot have a weed free ground, I try to do everything only to see new weeds, ever been there? Today just think of yourself as a garden that needs good seeds planted in. Also remember that as you plant good seeds in your garden, either the enemy will also plant weeds or they will spring forth. We need a strategy to deal with the weeds in our gardens.

God has decided that unbelievers who choose to obey Jesus should become a part of the larger fellowship and through this incorporation; the adherent will experience the mediation of grace. The NT picture of fellowship and nurture is awesome, yet to accomplish the goal, all involved must deal with personal and religious hang-ups. The Bible speaks to three instances- worthy of further analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Acts 15 involves the traditions of Moses, keeping the law, and the observance of circumcision. The Pharisees represents those who grew up in good homes; those who are rich and influential; those who are religious or have conservative\/traditional values. These Pharisees took issue with the new adherents who did not share or seem to appreciate the Pharisees\u2019 customs, history, culture, teachings, or way of doing things. This was problematic because these Pharisees were the backbone of the assembly that served as world headquarters for all churches. In the mind of the Pharisees, they owed their very lives to the teachings of old. That\u2019s how they got wealthy. To them, following conservative values actually gave them their stability and clout, and the same would surely bestow the equivalent to the new, rowdy, and undisciplined bunch outside of headquarters. The Pharisees did not see anything wrong with their way of living and believed that God wanted everybody to live like them so they issued a controlling policy to impose their \u201cforeign\u201d way of life on people without regard to their own culture, teachings, history, or way of doing things.<\/p>\n<p>Peter asks \u201cwhy tempt God by putting yokes upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear\u201d? Hear Peter tell it, the Pharisees were trying to impose things that no one whom Peter knew did or could obey- including the Pharisees themselves! Commanding obedience to something from someone who does not have the capacity to obey is illusory. For example, try warning a 3-year-old boy that if he does not act like a man with some sense then he would be punished. This is illusory. And, such were the pharisaic impositions.\u00a0 However, James holds that \u201cwe trouble not them\u201d. People outside of headquarters cannot appreciate the Jewish cult and unchurched believers may not care about overtly religious themes. Churches outside of headquarters were experiencing God\u2019s blessings apart from the traditions of Moses, keeping the law, and the observance of circumcision, which lends credence to the idea that God is not requiring duty or allegiance to the older order. James takes a (moderate) contemporary and progressive posture. He limited his foreign policy to the few practices of the international churches that had trans-cultural relevance. The HQ delegation told the internationalists that HQ would impose \u201cno greater burden than these necessary things\u201d. Some historians have held that James simply outlawed the four things that were most cited by pagan cynics who criticized and argued that there was no difference between them and the Christian adherents whom also participated in pagan cult worship and rituals.

He does not need anything to make Him complete and therefore if He did it then, He can do it again. He is the God of now for He refers to Himself as the I AM, the bible calls Him Jehovah Shammah to which in other words is Jehovah present. Psalm 46:1, &#8220;God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&#8221;. He is present in your situation this morning and He is more than able. Nothing in realty intimidates my God, though situations and circumstances may be getting worse and I may feel like He is delaying, I know that the moment He shows up everything will be fine. 2Tim 1:12, &#8220;For the which cause I also suffer this things, but I am not a shamed for I know whom I have believed and I&#8217;m persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day&#8221;. Whether we choose to believe it or not He is able and the least time we expect Him to be there and help, that is the time He will show up.<\/p>\n<p>Jude 1:24, &#8220;Now unto Him who is able to keep you from falling, and present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy&#8221;. The opposite of the word able is disable and we know that anyone who is disabled cannot function fully depending on their disability. We also know that when we use the word disable can also mean disconnect, our God is not in a dysfunctional mode so stop putting Him in that mode. He has not disconnected Himself from His children so stop putting Him in a box. God is able by Himself to keep each of us from falling and then present us faultless before His presence.<\/p>\n<p>My word this morning is very simple and that is God is able and more than able. Everything that concerns you and I today can be brought to Him for He is able to take care of it. You have heard me say this before, I don&#8217;t pray because God will, I pray because God can (able) my ability to believe that He can produces my faith to believe He will. Change the way you pray and believe God regardless of whether it comes or not. Daniel prayed and answer did not come immediately but he kept praying for he knew God was able.

We exercise faith every day. We trust our car&#8217;s brakes. We trust our history books, our medical books, and we trust elevators. Yet elevators can let us down. History books can be wrong. Planes can crash.\u00a0 We trust these things, but do we, do you trust God?\u00a0 How can you tell?\u00a0 Many Christians will say that they trust God; however there must be some type of testing ground to see the validity of this.<\/p>\n<p>Early in the twentieth century, a man regularly walked a tight rope across Niagra Falls. Once during a rope walking exhibition, the man walked across the Falls on the tightrope while pushing a wheelbarrow. When he reached the other side with the wheelbarrow, he asked the crowd, &#8220;Do you folks think I can walk across the Falls with a man in this wheelbarrow?&#8221; The crowd gasped in amazement at the question and cheered wildly at the prospect of seeing this. Turning to one of the cheerers in the crowd, the rope walker asked, &#8220;Sir, do you believe I can walk across the Falls with a man in this wheelbarrow?&#8221; After thinking for a moment, the man in the crowd responded, &#8220;Yes, I believe you can walk across the Falls with a man in that wheelbarrow!&#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;OK, Sir,&#8221; responded the rope walker, &#8220;Get in.&#8221; If the man in the crowd really &#8220;believed&#8221; in the ability of the rope walker to push a man in a wheelbarrow across the Falls-that is, if he really had &#8220;faith&#8221;-he would get in the wheelbarrow.<\/p>\n<p>Job lost everything he held dear.\u00a0 Early on during the loss\u2019 in Job\u2019s life his wife \u201cencouraged him\u201d by saying, \u201cAre you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!\u201d\u00a0 Just when Job needed his best friend\u2019s support and encourage him to stand up one more round in the ring of hardship, his wife threw in the towel and told him to do likewise.\u00a0 Did Job\u2019s three friends Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar\u00a0 help?\u00a0 Let\u2019s just say with friends like Job\u2019s who needs enemies.\u00a0 In the midst of all Job\u2019s loss, his wife giving up, his friends heavy yoke upon him, and his feeling of death knocking at his door, he takes every last bit of strength and stands up he blurts out this nine word proclamation of his personal resolve, faith, trust in His Lord God.\u00a0 Job said, \u201cthough he slay me, yet will I trust him.\u201d\u00a0 If one were to place Job on the stand as put his faith on trial, his faith in God surely would be able to stand under the scrutiny of everyone from the accuser Satan, to his hopeless wife, to his \u201cfriends\u201d and their opinions.\u00a0 True faith must be tested and tried to see if it is true.<\/p>\n<p>In Job\u2019s condition even would have been so much easier to take everyone\u2019s misguided advice, but yet Job was willing to jump into the wheel barrel with his life on the \u201cline.\u201d\u00a0 If you lost everything, would you still hold onto God?

Be blessed this morning as my dad shares.<\/p>\n<p>Most men would rather die, than think. Many do. -Bertrand Russell<\/p>\n<p>What is the difference between those who excel and those who regress or stagnate? Why do some people succeeded more than others in whatever endeavors they pursue? Why do some people take certain steps that most of us would consider very risky and dangerous? Why do some people inspire us more than others do?<br \/>\nThe answer to all these questions and many other questions\u00a0 related to success is that those who make a difference or excel and achieve extraordinary success or impact their generations in positive and profitable ways, have all given the potential that once lie dormant in them a chance to blossom. Passion, desire, determination, hard work, self-discipline, having faith in God and, self and others are the driving force that propels those who succeed. People who have learnt to turn their potential to power can soar up with wings like the eagles (Isaiah 40:30). For them, the sky is not the limit. Heaven is.<br \/>\nWhat does the word potential mean?<br \/>\nThe Oxford Dictionary definition of the word potential is as follows:<br \/>\n-having the capacity to develop into something in the future<br \/>\n-qualities or abilities that may be developed and lead to future success or usefulness<br \/>\n-the possibility of something or of someone doing something in the future.<br \/>\nThe key thing to note from the definition is that potential has nothing to do with the present but everything to do with the future. In other words, potential is future oriented. What is today or who you are today is not the total sum of what can be or who you can be. It is impossible for anyone to determine accurately the total value or worth or possibilities that lies within a person until that person has fully and completely exhausted the potential in him. For example, when Billy Graham, the great evangelist, was born, no one, including his parents would have thought that he would be a great man.\u00a0 However, inside him lie the potential for becoming a great preacher, leader, father, etc. You may not be like Billy Graham or Mother Teresa or Pope John Paul or Bill Gates or Gandhi or famous sports or movie star, or any great woman or man you admire. But you can be somebody in your own rights and way. God does not want you to be somebody else. He has put in you the potential to be the best and the greatest right where you. All you need to do is turn the power on. Let everything within you scream, \u201cI can\u201d.<br \/>\nWhen you say, for example, I can&#8217;t do it or I can&#8217;t be that; you are not affirming your potential. You are affirming your self-imposed disability. You are suppressing your potential and possibilities. Turn disability into ability and possibility. For all things are possible to them that believe. Believe in God and in yourself. Release your potential. Reach for the impossible. Go for the extraordinary. Take off self-imposed limitation, which have hindered you for many years from realizing your dreams. Dare and do what others like you have done. Attempt. Persevere. Stay focused. Do it! A great future awaits you. Rise up.<br \/>\nPray today that God will help you recognize that you have great potential. Ask for his help so you can start today where you are with what you have to be all you can be. God is able! Confess with the Apostle Paul,<\/p>\n<p>I can do all things through Jesus Christ, which strengthens me.

I was out of the office sick since Monday.<br \/>\nEnjoy!! ~France<\/p>\n<p>Good Afternoon,<br \/>\nLuke 4:14 (KJV) 14And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.<br \/>\nJesus had fought with the devil, and Jesus won!\u00a0 The desert proved to be a substancial proving ground as the devil would seek to deter, and stop Him from fulfilling the mission God gave Him, to seek and save the lost.\u00a0 Jesus Having the true substance of His resolve tested, Jesus continued His allegiance and faithfulness and went back to Galilee. Jordan represents isolation and seclusion, while Galilee represents progressiveness. Jesus left home being full of the Spirit but returned home in the power of the Spirit. Jesus returned home a totally different man than when He had left. Why? What happened? THE WILDERNESS happened.<br \/>\nThough He had influence with God and men, out there in the wilderness, Jesus went through a season where no other person could help Him. In the wilderness, His wisdom could not be understood and was of no use. Nothing and no one out there appreciated the beauty and light of His purity.\u00a0 His character or His credentials refreshed nothing out there. Having pleased His parents and His community- that is, his upbringing and pedigree did not matter. Among the many tests, three of them demonstrate how critical and base the situation had become by the end of 40 days of irritation.\u00a0 While He was stripped of the things that helped prop Him up, Jesus at His core-confronted passions that could have reduced Him to the status of living by the instinctual and self-serving means common to animals. Jesus instead demonstrated the beauty and glory of a man committed to God. The Word of God alone was suitable to sustain Jesus during the time of His temptation. He allowed the Word of God that He had been storing up in His heart to sustain and empower Him to exercise discretion and discernment- and to dismiss the temptations as a nuisance. By inwardly surrendering to God\u2019s Word during His temptations, Jesus put away self-serving motivations and solidified His commitment to God\u2019s will. Jesus allowed God to use Him as a conduit and to allow the overwhelming virtue of God\u2019s power to be released through His humanity to work God\u2019s wonders. Jesus was able to go down for God in the end because He went down for God day after day.<br \/>\nThe bottom-line: the source of spiritual power is God and is released in an atmosphere of transparency and radical dependency. The fullness of God results in the release of God\u2019s power only after a wilderness experience where we have learned to be transparent before God and depend on His care. Wilderness exposes the substance of our commitments to God and strips us of the stuff that helps prop us up. There, in the exposure and under the pressure, we see that God\u2019s Word alone is sufficient and as we embrace it, God sustains us. Many adherents never have the occasion to witness or experience true spiritual power at work. This may be indicative of the fact that we don\u2019t obey the Word, follow God into the wilderness, stand strong in the face temptation, and put away our own self-serving motivations. Until the opportunity comes when we can unveil ourselves before God and call on Him to help, we will not experience the release of God\u2019s power like Christ.<br \/>\nApplication: From Moses (Exodus 3) to Jesus Matthew 4, God has been taking that those He would use powerfully into the boot camp of desert first.\u00a0 Both Moses and Jesus came out different men, prepared to accomplish the task of delivering people from bondage.\u00a0 Have you had your desert experience yet?\u00a0 How did you come out in power or indifferent?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good Afternoon, First I must apologize for the devotions not going out on time.

Continue to keep my brother in your prayers.<\/p>\n<p>Isaiah 37:1-14, &#8220;And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We live in a time where if anything is going to happen, it will not happen by chance but because there are people praying. When you look at the marriages on the rocks, families in chaos, schools in trouble, the government having challenges, kidnappings left and right, murders, suicides, and accidents you name it, is on the rise, how will we stand? There is a constant fear of what might happen even before it happens. Fear of tomorrow cripples so many.<\/p>\n<p>King Hezekiah was faced by a situation where he was threatened too but by Sennacherib king of Assyria. Now Assyria was known to be a powerful kingdom and they had subdued many nations and even breaking their gods. Coming to King Hezekiah, they knew that Judah was protected by God but they tried to bring fear by saying God will not save them when Assyria attacks, they said Isaiah 37:10, &#8220;Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, &#8220;Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria&#8221;. This is no different from what the devil whispers in our ears every day. The devil will accuse you of making mistakes with no avenues of second chances or victory. He could be right that you blew it, but who told the devil our victory is based on what we did? \u00a0It&#8217;s based on the one who laid aside His majesty, giving up everything, suffering at the hands of those He had created, taking all the guilt and shame when He died and rose again. Today He has called us His own and He is seated on the right hand of God the Father making intercession for us. He says, &#8220;When you pray, pray in my name&#8221; because He knows how it feels to be lied about. You cannot cry over what could have been and how it could have been, you cannot also continue to plead with the enemy to leave you alone, you need to stand and tell him of whom you are in Christ. If he reminds you of your past, remind him of his future. Hezekiah has been told that there is no way God will come to his rescue but instead of calling his servants to help him weep, he takes the time to go to the house of God to pray. You understand what you are going through better than anyone else; you have a better way of presenting your case to the Lord in prayer as you pray earnestly, constantly, effectively.<\/p>\n<p>He received bad news but did not take it as the final word. Whatever the enemy whispers in our ears is not final, God has a final say in a situation. As long as He has not spoken against it, we should continue to bring it to Him. He received the letter, read it and thought, &#8220;I have to take this to the Lord in prayer&#8221;, Isaiah 37:14, &#8220;and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD&#8221;. Stop covering up what you are going through or trying to fix it in your own strength, like Hezekiah, take it to the Lord in prayer and spread it out as it is. Remember this hymn &#8220;What a friend we have in Jesus? take a look at the lyrics<\/p>\n<p>What a friend we have in Jesus, All our sins and griefs to bear! What a privilege to carry Ev&#8217;rything to God in prayer! Oh, what peace we often forfeit, Oh what needless pain we bear, All because we do not carry, Ev&#8217;rything to God in prayer!<\/p>\n<p>Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged, Take it to the Lord in prayer: Can we find a friend so faithful Who will all our sorrows share? Jesus Knows our every weakness, Take it to the Lord in prayer.<\/p>\n<p>Are we weak and heavy laden, Cumbered with a load of care? Precious Savior, still our refuge; Take it to the Lord in prayer: Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? Take it to the Lord in prayer; In His arms He&#8217;ll take and shield thee; Thou wilt find a solace there.<\/p>\n<p>Just as Hezekiah refused to take the enemy&#8217;s word as final, we too can do the same today. You know what your needs are, take it to the Lord in prayer and spread it like it is. Be blessed Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Felt prompt to re share this devotion I emailed in 2008 in preparation for part 2 I was meditating upon this morning.

Some holy men sit on poles for twenty years (Pillar Saints). Others stay off poles but they stay away from any contact with a sinful world, in a holier-than-thou legalism. Others live in monasteries, and have a vow of silence. Much of the Church doesn&#8217;t live on poles or have a holier than thou attitude. They do however live in a monastery &#8211; one without walls. They, too, have a vow of silence. Few have physical contact with the world. Their association with humanity is strictly confined to the Church. Fellowship is what they have on Wednesday nights, Sunday mornings and Sunday nights. The are salt among salt, light among light.<\/p>\n<p>True holiness is the opposite of the above. It does mean that we cut ourselves off from the sin, but not from the sinners. True holiness is to be like Jesus &#8211; &#8220;separate from sin&#8221; and yet He was accused of being a &#8220;friend of sinners.&#8221; The Scriptures admonish us with these thought-provoking words: &#8220;I wrote to you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world. But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat&#8221; (1Corinthians 5:9-10). Can you see what the Bible is saying? If we separate ourselves from sinners, we won&#8217;t be able to reach them with the gospel of salvation. The only ones we are told to separate ourselves from are hypocrites. Look at these wonderful words from George MacLeod of Scotland: &#8220;I simply argue that the cross should be raised at the center of the marketplace as well as on the steeple of the church. I am recovering the claim that Jesus was not crucified in a cathedral between two candles, but on a cross between two thieves; on the town&#8217;s garbage heap; at a crossroad, so cosmopolitan they had to write His title in Hebrew and Latin and Greek . . . at the kind of a place where cynics talk smut, and thieves curse, and soldiers gamble. Because that is where He died. And that is what He died for. And that is what He died about. That is where church-men ought to be and what church-men ought to be about.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There is nothing &#8220;spiritual&#8221; about being holy. It just means a separation from sin. God is holy &#8211; He is sinless, and we too are called to be holy: &#8220;But as He who has called you is holy, so you be holy in all manner of conversation&#8221; (1 Peter 1:15) See Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 15:4. See also Romans 6:19, 22; Ephesians 1:4; Titus 1:8; 1 Peter 1:15.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s as simple as this &#8211; God has given us an umbrella in the Savior to shelter us from the reign of His wrath. God has given the covering, and we are told to stay under that covering of holiness. How may we best do that? We do this by reading God&#8217;s Word daily and by the cultivation of a tender conscience. By having an obedient heart, and by living in the fear of God.<\/p>\n<p>The next time you try to witness to someone you know isn&#8217;t right with God, and he suddenly says, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been born again. I know the Lord,&#8221; ask him if he is &#8220;living in holiness.&#8221; More than likely he will say that he is. Then call his bluff. Ask him to define &#8220;holiness.&#8221; As he is straining his brain to come up with a definition, say, The Bible says, &#8220;Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord&#8221; This means that we should be separated from sin and the world and then ask him if he thinks he&#8217;s a good person. More than likely he will, so take the time to take him through the Moral Law.

James speaks extensively about the tongue, how deadly it is left unattended. Have we not been given one mouth to speak and two ears to listen instead of the other way round? Yet we find that a lot of people are \u00a0quick to speak and slow to listen; They jump to conclusions without facts.<\/p>\n<p>Joseph here finds himself in Potiphar&#8217;s house, he is serving well even his master can sense something different about him. Of all the servants he had, Joseph was unique; he sensed the Lord was with him. And whatever Joseph did in Potipha&#8217;rs house, God blessed it. Then here comes Potiphar&#8217;s wife who eyes this young man, wanting something from him, his innocence, and his purity before the Lord. And when she could not get what she wanted, Joseph vowed to be pure before God, she takes something from him to accuse him of something bigger, attempted rape. Now that is a serious accusation.<\/p>\n<p>When you don&#8217;t get what you want, how do you deal with it? When I was a teenager, I liked this girl and wanted to go out with her. She seemed to hang out with this other guy more. Instead of accepting the reality of things, I began to slander their names, making other people believe what I said about them that I knew not be true. What damage that was I regret till today. That is something that happens even today, it&#8217;s easy to slander, lie about someone, tarnish their names because they have something you want but can&#8217;t have. Instead of accepting things the way they are, you turn to frustrate them, lie about them, find people to convince to side with you against such a person. That is what Potiphar&#8217;s wife did, because she could not accept the fact that she could not have what she wanted, she purposed in her heart to destroy Joseph by lying about his intentions. She knew that if she could not destroy him in any other way, her tongue would be sufficient. After all, who were they going to believe?<\/p>\n<p>There are certain people if someone told you that they did this and that, you would probably not believe them because you already know the character of that person. \u00a0That may not mean they could never do what they are accused of, their nature, their lifestyle would suggest otherwise. Then there are those whom if they are told you of what they did, you would be prompt to say something like this, &#8220;I would not be surprised if they did such and such a thing&#8221;. Well in Joseph&#8217;s case, he is accused of attempted rape, his master is not even stopping to say or even think , &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t sound like Joseph&#8221; so as to find facts and truths to turn upon, the other servants seem to be quiet and it doesn&#8217;t seem he&#8217;s been given a chance to defend himself. The wife was the bigger influence on the verdict. God who had blessed him and been with him seemed silent when he needed him the most yet knows the whole truth. Who will stand with Joseph? His name is tarnished, he has lost his job, he is going to jail, he is further away from his dream because of false accusation and it&#8217;s all because of the tongue that would not accept that she could not have what she wanted and therefore turned to destroy another life. The bible says in Proverbs 12:22, &#8220;Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, But those who deal truthfully are His delight&#8221;. Are you being driven right now to destroy another person&#8217;s life through lies because you are unable to get what you want and if you can&#8217;t get, then you feel it&#8217;s not fair for the other person to have it, be blessed, or prosper while you are miserable? Are you getting people to rally behind you to accept what you say about someone without sharing the true facts or having them do the same? James 1:26 &#8220;If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one&#8217;s religion is useless.&#8221; Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 39:16 So she kept his garment with her until his master came home. 17 Then she spoke to him with words like these, saying, &#8220;The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to mock me; 18 so it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1826","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-ts","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1826","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1826"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1826\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1827,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1826\/revisions\/1827"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1826"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1826"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1826"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1805,"date":"2010-06-17T19:15:15","date_gmt":"2010-06-17T13:45:15","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1805"},"modified":"2010-06-18T10:37:18","modified_gmt":"2010-06-18T05:07:18","slug":"when-you-cant-get-what-you-want","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/06\/17\/when-you-cant-get-what-you-want\/","title":{"rendered":"When You Can&#8217;t Get What You&nbsp;want"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 39:16 So she kept his garment with her until his master came home. 17 Then she spoke to him with words like these, saying, &#8220;The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to mock me; 18 so it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.&#8221; \u00a019 So it was, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, &#8220;Your servant did to me after this manner,&#8221; that his anger was aroused. 20 Then Joseph&#8217;s master took him and put him into the prison<\/p>\n<p>One of the most frightening things in my opinion is the damage a tongue can do.

Then there are those whom if they are told you of what they did, you would be prompt to say something like this, &#8220;I would not be surprised if they did such and such a thing&#8221;. Well in Joseph&#8217;s case, he is accused of attempted rape, his master is not even stopping to say or even think , &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t sound like Joseph&#8221; so as to find facts and truths to turn upon, the other servants seem to be quiet and it doesn&#8217;t seem he&#8217;s been given a chance to defend himself. The wife was the bigger influence on the verdict. God who had blessed him and been with him seemed silent when he needed him the most yet knows the whole truth. Who will stand with Joseph? His name is tarnished, he has lost his job, he is going to jail, he is further away from his dream because of false accusation and it&#8217;s all because of the tongue that would not accept that she could not have what she wanted and therefore turned to destroy another life. The bible says in Proverbs 12:22, &#8220;Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, But those who deal truthfully are His delight&#8221;. Are you being driven right now to destroy another person&#8217;s life through lies because you are unable to get what you want and if you can&#8217;t get, then you feel it&#8217;s not fair for the other person to have it, be blessed, or prosper while you are miserable? Are you getting people to rally behind you to accept what you say about someone without sharing the true facts or having them do the same? James 1:26 &#8220;If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one&#8217;s religion is useless.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 39:16 So she kept his garment with her until his master came home. 17 Then she spoke to him with words like these, saying, &#8220;The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to mock me; 18 so it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":":","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1805","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-t7","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1805","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1805"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1805\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1812,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1805\/revisions\/1812"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1805"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1805"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1805"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1824,"date":"2010-06-16T18:42:47","date_gmt":"2010-06-16T13:12:47","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1824"},"modified":"2010-07-03T11:50:59","modified_gmt":"2010-07-03T06:20:59","slug":"examine-yourselves-as-to-whether-you-are-in-the-faith-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/06\/16\/examine-yourselves-as-to-whether-you-are-in-the-faith-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the&nbsp;faith"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>I would like to share a gospel presentation.

Most people say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve broken one or two, but nothing too serious, like murder, etc.&#8221;, With tender conscious review these commandments and see if you&#8217;ve kept any of them 1. &#8220;You shall have no other gods before Me.&#8221; Have you always put God first in your life? Jesus said to love God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength&#8211; so much, that your love for your parents, brothers and sisters, friends, and even your own life is like hatred compared to your love and devotion for God. Have you ever failed to put Him first in your life? 2. &#8220;You shall not make for yourself any idol.&#8221; Who is God to you? Is he only a god of love and mercy who would never judge anyone and never cast anyone into Hell? If that&#8217;s your god, then you&#8217;re right. Your god couldn&#8217;t cast anyone into Hell because he doesn&#8217;t exist. He&#8217;s a figment of your imagination. You&#8217;ve created a god in your own mind that you&#8217;re more comfortable with. You may call it your &#8220;personal belief,&#8221; but God calls it idolatry. It&#8217;s the oldest sin in the Book, and the Bible warns that idolaters will not inherit the kingdom of heaven. 3. &#8220;You shall not take the name of God in vain.&#8221; Have you ever used God&#8217;s name as a curse word? If you have, you&#8217;ve taken the holy name of God&#8211; who gave you your life, your family, and everything precious to you&#8211; and used it as a filthy, four-letter word. Hitler&#8217;s name wasn&#8217;t even despised enough to be used as a curse word! If you have used God&#8217;s holy name in that manner, you are a blasphemer and the Bible says &#8220;God will not hold him guiltless who takes the name of the Lord in vain.&#8221; 4. &#8220;Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.&#8221; God commands that we set aside one day in seven. Have you ever been guilty of breaking this Commandment?<\/p>\n<p>5. &#8220;Honor your father and your mother.&#8221; Have you always honored your parents in a way that&#8217;s pleasing in the sight of God? Ask Him to remind you of the sins of your youth. You may have forgotten them, but God hasn&#8217;t. 6. &#8220;You shall not murder.&#8221; Jesus warned &#8220;Whoever is angry with his brother without cause, is in danger of judgment,&#8221; (Matthew 5:22) and the Bible says, &#8220;He who hates his brother is a murderer,&#8221; (1 John 3:15). God sees hatred in the heart to be as wicked as murder. We can violate His Law by attitude and intent. 7. &#8220;You shall not commit adultery.&#8221; Jesus warned,&#8221; You have heard&#8230;&#8217;You shall not commit adultery.&#8217; But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Have you ever looked at another person with lust? The Bible says that adulterers and fornicators (those who have had sex before marriage) will not enter the kingdom of heaven. 8. &#8220;You shall not steal.&#8221; Have you ever stolen anything (even if it was something small)? The value of the thing stolen doesn&#8217;t matter; petty theft is still theft. Have you ever taken anything that belonged to someone else (from the office, school, parents, etc.)? If you have, that makes you a thief. 9. &#8220;You shall not lie.&#8221; Have you ever told a lie? Then you are a liar. How many murders do you have to commit to be a murderer? Just one. If you have told even one lie, that makes you a liar. The Bible warns that all liars will have their part in the Lake of Fire (Revelation 21:8). You may not think deceitfulness is a serious sin, but God does. 10. &#8220;You shall not covet.&#8221; This means we should never desire anything that belongs to another person. Not their house, nor their car, nor their money, nor their wife, nor their lifestyle, nor anything that belongs to our neighbor Who of us can say we are not guilty of breaking these Commandments? This is what the Bible means when it says, &#8220;All have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God.&#8221; Can you see your predicament? You are guilty of sinning against God Himself, and, because you have a conscience, (con-with, science-knowledge) you have sinned &#8220;with knowledge.&#8221; Isn&#8217;t it true that every time you lied, stole, or lusted, etc., you knew it was wrong? Does the fact that you have sinned against God scare you? It should. \u00a0You have actually angered Him by your sin. The Bible says His wrath abides on you, that you are an &#8220;enemy of God in your mind through wicked works.&#8221; Perhaps you think God is good and because of his goodness He will overlook your sins? But if you knew of a human judge who turned a blind eye to the crimes of a guilty rapist&#8230; would you describe him as &#8220;good&#8221; judge? God could never be a corrupt judge. He will punish all the rapists, murderers, and thieves&#8230; But he won&#8217;t stop there. He will also punish all liars, the lustful, adulterers, idolaters, and blasphemers. God does not want you to perish. He is rich in mercy and compassion, and has provided a way for you to be forgiven. He has invited you to come to Him for a full pardon and receive the free gift of Eternal Life. You cannot earn it, and you do not deserve it, but God is offering it to you as proof of His love for you. Imagine you are standing in front of a judge, guilty of multiple serious crimes. All the evidence has been presented and there is no doubt about your guilt. Your apologies and good works cannot erase your crimes; therefore you must be punished. The fine for your crime is $250,000 or imprisonment, but you don&#8217;t have two pennies to rub together. The judge is about to pass sentence when someone you don&#8217;t even know steps in and pays your fine for you! The court accepts the money and declares that you are free to go. The law has been satisfied, your debt has been paid in full, and the stranger&#8217;s sacrifice was a demonstration of his love for you. That&#8217;s what God did for you 2000 years ago. The Bible says that the God of the Universe became a man (Jesus Christ), and suffered and died on the cross for your sins and mine so that we could be set free. It&#8217;s as simple as this-we broke the Law, and Jesus paid our fine. &#8220;God demonstrated His own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&#8221; (Romans 5:8) &#8220;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us.&#8221; (Galatians 3:13) Do you see God&#8217;s great love for you? Do you see your need for His forgiveness? Do what He commands and &#8220;Repent&#8230;that your sins may be wiped out and times of refreshing may come from the Lord.&#8221; (Acts 3:19) You must turn away from sin and turn to God. Desire to have NOTHING to do with sin, and surrender your life to the One who can save you. Jesus died to set you free, and then he rose from death to be your Lord. Jesus said, &#8220;I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&#8221; If you will confess and forsake your sins (repent) and trust in Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, God will forgive you and you&#8217;ll pass from death to life. If you are not sure how to pray, read Psalm 51 and make it your prayer. What does it mean to &#8220;put your faith in Jesus Christ?&#8221; It means to personally trust in Jesus the same way you&#8217;d trust in a parachute if you had to jump 25,000 feet out of an airplane. You wouldn&#8217;t just &#8220;believe&#8221; in the parachute; you would put it on! In the same way, the Bible says, &#8220;Put on the Lord Jesus Christ&#8230;&#8221; and you will be saved. There are millions of people who &#8220;believe&#8221; Jesus exists . . . but they have not put on the Savior-there&#8217;s a BIG difference. And the difference will be obvious when you &#8220;jump&#8221; though the door of death. Today, with all your heart-turn away from sin, and surrender your life to Jesus Christ. Please don&#8217;t put it off till later. You may die today and then it will be too late. You may not yet have all the answers to your questions, but better to put on the parachute first and then ask questions, than to pass through the door unprepared, grasping for the parachute when it&#8217;s too late. God will transform you from the inside out. You will think and feel differently as you learn to trust and obey Him. God will give you new strength to live right and love Him above all else. Read your Bible daily and obey His Word. You can trust God-He loves you and will always be faithful. If you&#8217;ve decided to reject the gift of forgiveness and you die in your sins, there is no hope for you. There is no purgatory. The wrath of God abides on you and you will spend eternity in Hell. Please take the time to read what the Bible says Hell is like.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, I would like to share a gospel presentation.

It&#8217;s as simple as this-we broke the Law, and Jesus paid our fine. &#8220;God demonstrated His own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&#8221; (Romans 5:8) &#8220;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us.&#8221; (Galatians 3:13) Do you see God&#8217;s great love for you? Do you see your need for His forgiveness? Do what He commands and &#8220;Repent&#8230;that your sins may be wiped out and times of refreshing may come from the Lord.&#8221; (Acts 3:19) You must turn away from sin and turn to God. Desire to have NOTHING to do with sin, and surrender your life to the One who can save you. Jesus died to set you free, and then he rose from death to be your Lord. Jesus said, &#8220;I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&#8221; If you will confess and forsake your sins (repent) and trust in Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, God will forgive you and you&#8217;ll pass from death to life. If you are not sure how to pray, read Psalm 51 and make it your prayer. What does it mean to &#8220;put your faith in Jesus Christ?&#8221; It means to personally trust in Jesus the same way you&#8217;d trust in a parachute if you had to jump 25,000 feet out of an airplane. You wouldn&#8217;t just &#8220;believe&#8221; in the parachute; you would put it on! In the same way, the Bible says, &#8220;Put on the Lord Jesus Christ&#8230;&#8221; and you will be saved. There are millions of people who &#8220;believe&#8221; Jesus exists . . . but they have not put on the Savior-there&#8217;s a BIG difference. And the difference will be obvious when you &#8220;jump&#8221; though the door of death. Today, with all your heart-turn away from sin, and surrender your life to Jesus Christ. Please don&#8217;t put it off till later. You may die today and then it will be too late. You may not yet have all the answers to your questions, but better to put on the parachute first and then ask questions, than to pass through the door unprepared, grasping for the parachute when it&#8217;s too late. God will transform you from the inside out. You will think and feel differently as you learn to trust and obey Him. God will give you new strength to live right and love Him above all else. Read your Bible daily and obey His Word. You can trust God-He loves you and will always be faithful. If you&#8217;ve decided to reject the gift of forgiveness and you die in your sins, there is no hope for you. There is no purgatory. The wrath of God abides on you and you will spend eternity in Hell. Please take the time to read what the Bible says Hell is like.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, I would like to share a gospel presentation.

People we look up to, people who set up standards that serves as a challenge to get us to the next level. We see it in the bible days, Joshua had a mentor Moses whom he looked up to until the torch was passed over to him. We see also with Elijah and Elisha, the bible describes Elisha as the prophet who washed Elijah&#8217;s hand. When Elijah called him to follow him, he kissed everything goodbye including the family business he was running to follow Elijah across the country washing his hands and cooking his meals. If that is not enough, we see it again with Naomi and Ruth, we see how Naomi&#8217;s life influences Ruth&#8217;s that she is inspired to follow her wherever she went. &#8220;Your people shall be my people, your God shall be my God, wherever you will die, I will die there too&#8221;, she says. Last but not least we also see it with Paul and Timothy.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you but if I did not have some kind of mentor in my life, I would not be where I am spiritually and even ministry wise. Some did not know that they inspired me until much later when I mentioned to them. Why mentor? If you do not have someone around that challenges you spiritually, or in any other areas, it&#8217;s easy to loose your edge the reason being that when you don&#8217;t see anything more than what you already have you might feel you have attained it all. I remember when I got saved and then five years later lead into the ministry of intercession, my dad was a huge inspiration without him even knowing in the line of prayers, he has always prayed effectively, earnestly and powerfully. When it came to beginning to preach, I was inspired by one youth pastor back then who has since moved to other positions. I told God that if my youth pastor could preach, I could preach too if He anointed me to do so. I have been preaching since then. God used Pastor Phil to challenge me to reach the lost on the streets, been doing it since then (about 8-9years now). I always struggled to do memory verses until I got inspired and rebuked by someone&#8217;s life. He did not tell me or encourage me to do it, the way he memorized verses inspired me to ask God for grace and strength to do it. I believe that there are people who come our way we may not be close to but their life style will cause us to want more. I&#8217;m not talking about competition or jealousy, I believe God put such people around us to awaken us by reminding us there is more. If God never allowed me \u00a0to come across these people may be I would still be stagnant never knowing there is more I can ask God to do in my life for His glory.<\/p>\n<p>My point today is that it&#8217;s good to have certain people come our way, we may not know them or even be close to them but something in their lives will give us an appetite to call on God for more. When Moses died, Joshua took over for he had learnt a lot from Moses and so did Elisha from Elijah, Ruth from Naomi and Timothy from Paul. To close, there are people who God will also bring in our lives who are inspired and challenged by us. Let me share with you about one of my best friends. He was once upon a time, a drug addict, sold drugs, was involved in drive by shootings, arrested about 15 times to mention a few. When he got saved, a few weeks later I was introduced to him and we began to hang out, teaching him the things of God, building his faith. \u00a0One time he shared with me how he desired to know how to pray effectively and so I invited him to my prayer nights to come listen and be part of it. Being that he was a new believer, I thought my prayer nights would drive him away. But, he came faithfully, listened to me pray every week and not long after, he started praying little by little. Today he is a prayer warrior, the youth pastor at my church, he preaches in jails and soon he will be opening a troubled teen center. I was his best man, my friend is Pastor Paul. Be an example of believers in every place God sets you, you never know who is taking notes and praying that they will be raised like you are. I believe only you can limit what God can do in your life. God will&#8217;s by bringing people your way, then waits for you to respond.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Tim 4:12, &#8220;Let no man despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity&#8221; I find that mentors are vital people in our lives for growth.

(Matt. 26: 31-35).<\/p>\n<p>As defined by <a href=\"http:\/\/freedictionary.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">freedictionary.com<\/a>, the word, impulsive means &#8220;to act on rather than think&#8221;, &#8220;motivated or resulting from impulse&#8221;. Babylon.com defines impulsive as &#8220;rash, hasty; acting on impulse; spontaneous&#8221;. I believe that there are three reasons to Peter&#8217;s impulsiveness. We first see it in Matthew 16:23, when Jesus was walking with His disciples and told them that He&#8217;d have to suffer many things at the hands of the elders of the law. Then, it is written Peter rebuked Jesus. Imagine that? You&#8217;re walking with the Lord and you rebuke Him! It may sound crazy, but think about it, because I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s done it before. Peter loved the Lord very much. Have you ever loved someone so much that you put yourself in between them and their future? Peter was very passionate in serving Christ, and guess what? The enemy knew that. The enemy knows you through and through, and even if you were to unconsciously come against the will of God &#8220;in love&#8221;, it&#8217;s still coming against the will of God.<\/p>\n<p>So, the first reason for Peter&#8217;s impulsiveness was that, because of his love for the Lord, he acted without thinking, and was used by the enemy to come against what had to be done in order to save souls. The second reason for Peter&#8217;s impulsiveness was because he lacked humility and servant leadership. This is evident in Matthew 26:31-35, because without humbling himself and listening to the Lord, he instead spoke selfishly and out of order. Think about it. The last supper just ended, and during its end, Christ&#8217;s disciples had a dispute as to who was the greatest among them. Christ had to instruct the twelve that He came to this world as a servant, and so should they live. Imagine, you just come off of a conversation like that, Christ is with you, and warns that the Scriptures fulfillment will be that you&#8217;d have to disown Him as Lord. Listen to how Peter speaks in these verses. Don&#8217;t forget that the rest of the disciples are with him, and agreed (And all the other disciples said the same; Matt 26:31-35) that they wouldn&#8217;t leave Jesus&#8217; side. Peter, through his human nature and passion for Christ, spoke brashly and seemed to win favor amongst the rest of the twelve. If it were me, my flesh would cling on to that saying, &#8220;looks like I am the greatest among them&#8221;. What are your motives for serving the Lord today?<\/p>\n<p>The final reason for Peter&#8217;s impulsiveness was because he lacked experience. How many know that we can walk with the Lord, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that He&#8217;s equipped us with the trials, and tribulations yet needed to do His will for our lives? Peter denying Jesus three times was the beginning of his burdensome trials that would prepare him to eventually to become the rock that the Lord could use to plant His church upon. Let me tell you. If the Lord intends to use you similarly to the way he used Peter, you&#8217;ll be brought down to the pit where the only thing able to stand is your faith. After Peter denied Christ three times, the rooster crowed. And after the rooster crowed, Jesus Christ sifted through the crowd with His eyes, and looked directly at Peter. &#8220;The eyes are the windows to the soul&#8221;, and Christ saw directly into Peter&#8217;s. Imagine the devastation done to Peter&#8217;s soul? How that one look from Christ shattered his inner man into tiny pieces, and left him with nothing but faith. It was through this that Peter&#8217;s humility was built, his love for Christ was tested and sharpened and his passion to do the Lord&#8217;s will was put into realistic terms.<\/p>\n<p>Ask the Lord where you are today.

\u00a0After dialoging with him and having him quote tradition verses my quoting of Scripture, things began to heat up. \u00a0It became like a ping-pong match literally back and forth, a statement of tradition hit toward me, and a Scripture truth hit toward him. \u00a0Holy anger (there is such a thing), for the first time rose up in me, and for a moment in time I felt toward this priest what I can imagine Jesus felt toward the Pharisees. \u00a0I asked him to stop referring to me as &#8220;son&#8221; because he was not my earthly, heavenly, nor a spiritual father to me of any sort. \u00a0A father wants to hear their son&#8217;s story about God changing their life, not shut it down and shove tradition down their throat. \u00a0I asked him a final question in our heated discussion because of my constant quoting of Scripture saying but the Bible doesn&#8217;t agree with what you said; because the Bible says this, and I would quote a verse to him. \u00a0He said, &#8220;you think the Holy Sacred Scriptures contain all the truth, but they don&#8217;t, they only contain half the light truth. \u00a0The other half is contained by &#8220;Holy Sacred Tradition.&#8221; \u00a0My follow-up question was, &#8220;So what happens when your tradition and the Scriptures contradict each other what do you rely on in the end? \u00a0His answer was, you always go with sacred tradition. That is when holy anger jumped into my heart, but the Lord gave me this verse from 2 Tim 2:24-26 &#8220;And the Lord&#8217;s servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.25Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,26 and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will. &#8221; Needless to say I left there heated, yet experiencing what again I believe to be a similar encounter to what Jesus faced with the Pharisees.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus contrasts the &#8220;commands of God&#8221; with the &#8220;traditions of men&#8221; It is clear that this great body of Jewish tradition had failed to get to the heart of God&#8217;s commands. Instead of staying within God&#8217;s Law, their tradition become a means of getting around God&#8217;s law by speaking to them about the seriousness of failure to keep the fifth commandment. \u00a0Death is the penalty for anyone who curses his father or mother. \u00a0But by means of the tradition, the responsibility of children to their parents could be easily circumvented. A son need only declare that what he had intended to give his father and mother be considered &#8220;Corban,&#8221; i.e., a gift devoted to God, and it could no longer be designated for his parents. By devoting the gift to God, a son did not necessarily promise it to the temple nor did he prevent its use for himself. What he did do was to exclude legally his parents from benefiting from it. So the very purpose for which the commandment was given was set aside by the tradition. This is what is meant by &#8220;nullifying&#8221; the word of God or making God&#8217;s Word Unproductive, Unsuccessful, Useless, Vain, Fruitless, Futile, Hopeless, and Wasted. \u00a0The Word of God is a powerful thing. James 1:22-23 says, &#8220;Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.23 Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror 24 and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.&#8221; The mirror becomes useless in a persons life who looks into it for it&#8217;s intended purpose to give a look at our true selves. \u00a0If someone doesn&#8217;t comb their hair, change their perhaps un-matching clothes, etc&#8230;, then why use the mirror. \u00a0It wasn&#8217;t the mirrors fault, even if a picture is worth a thousand words. \u00a0The same holds true with God&#8217;s Law. \u00a0It shows who we are in the mirror of truth. \u00a0But if we hold onto tradition and forsake God&#8217;s word, it&#8217;s power working through our lives becomes null and void, which is an offense to a holy God.<\/p>\n<p>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Do you regularly read God&#8217;s word, if not why not \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Understand you show what you believe about God&#8217;s word by what you do, not what you say \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Is your tradition more important than God&#8217;s Word?, be painfully honest \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Is God&#8217;s Word being effective or ineffective in your life, if so how. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you need to repent do so quickly, don&#8217;t put it off.

Sharper than any double-edged sword&#8230;.&#8221; \u00a0Or perhaps 2 Tim 3:16, &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>PROBLEM. Is the word of God Quick, Alive, Powerful, Sharper than any Two-Edged Sword, God breathed and able to be used for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness? \u00a0Or is it Ineffective? \u00a0It can&#8217;t be both, or can it? \u00a0Let&#8217;s examine our passage in Mark 7. The Pharisees came to Jesus and they discovered that Jesus&#8217; disciples did not wash their hands before eating (v. 2Tohoroth Jewish custom of ceremonial hand washing, a custom based on the &#8220;tradition of the elders&#8221; (v. 35-756hypokrites7). Their complaint was not, of course, that the disciples by this failure were being unhygienic. The Pharisees had no concern with that. The question was one of ceremonial purity versus ceremonial defilement. We know that the Jews placed great importance on this as is shown by the fact that an entire division of the Mishnah (&#8220;cleanness&#8217;s&#8221;) is devoted to this subject. \u00a0This consisted in a great mass of oral tradition that had arisen about the law. About A.D. 200 it was written down in the Mishnah, but in Jesus day it was still in oral form. It&#8217;s purpose was to regulate a man&#8217;s life completely. If the law was silent or vague about a particular subject, one could be sure that the tradition would be vocal and explicit. The tradition, created and promulgated by the great rabbis, was passed on from one generation to the next and was considered binding. To the question asked Jesus as to why His disciples acted as they did, He answered by quoting a passage from Isaiah, preceded by his own comment: &#8220;Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites&#8221; meaning &#8220;play actor&#8221; and refers here to people whose worship is merely outward and not from the heart. Rather they carried out all their traditions and regulations and were heartless hypocrites. Their outward appearance of piety was a lie, because it was not accompanied by a &#8220;total life commitment to the one who is the true object of religious devotion&#8221; (Anderson, p. 185). Jesus goes on (v. ) to equate neglect of true holiness to submission to man-made rabbinic tradition.<\/p>\n<p>To continue,<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, MK 7:5-13, &#8220;These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men&#8221; I would like to bring you the devotion this morning titled the Ineffective Word of God. \u00a0According to a thesaurus the word Ineffective can [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1788","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-sQ","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1788","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1788"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1788\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1797,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1788\/revisions\/1797"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1788"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1788"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1788"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1791,"date":"2010-06-06T10:55:53","date_gmt":"2010-06-06T05:25:53","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1791"},"modified":"2010-07-03T10:56:58","modified_gmt":"2010-07-03T05:26:58","slug":"watch-and-pray","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/06\/06\/watch-and-pray\/","title":{"rendered":"Watch and pray"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Matthew 26:36-46, vs. 41, &#8220;Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation.

I know not of anyone who finds it easy to pray, being in the presence of God, lingering longer speaking to our heavenly Father. While it&#8217;s vital, I also think it&#8217;s one of the most neglected, or casually treated. Some may not even see a great need for it. David Wilkerson called our generation &#8220;A praising people but not a praying people&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In our text we see the struggle with prayer with Jesus&#8217; very close inner circle friends. The time when they needed to pray the most; the most crucial time, they fell a sleep. Jesus in the earlier verses had spoken of His betrayal and even mentioned to His disciples of the challenges before them. He provided information they needed, hopefully that would drive them to pray. And here we find Jesus calling for a prayer meeting, bringing in His closest friends to pray with Him and what happened? they fell asleep at an hour of prayer.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus being Man (flesh and blood) depended on the Father through prayer. He prayed for His disciples, He even told Peter at one point that He had prayed for him when the devil desired to sift him as wheat. Prayer was crucial in Jesus&#8217; life in good times and in hard times. How much more do we need to do it ourselves?<\/p>\n<p>41, &#8220;Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&#8221;, while we struggle, by what other means is there to gain victory but by prayer. Only devotion to prayer can carry us through the hardest times. Our best intentions cannot protect us in the time of severest testing unless we have learned how to seek God in prayer. The disciples had good intentions &#8220;The spirit indeed was willing&#8221;, the flesh was weak and of course the flesh does not want the idea of prayer. I find that when we struggle the most, that is when we need to pray the most. And that is the time to crucify the flesh and bring it under the obedience of Christ. If the devil can succeed to make us fall asleep, he would have succeeded in disarming us of the means we have to reach the Father.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus had already warned His disciples to pray lest they succumb to the test, a warning applicable to all disciples; his admonitions to watch likewise apply to all disciples in all eras. I find it interesting that Jesus did not say I will pray for you, He said &#8220;you watch (be awake) and you pray which is a clear indication that it&#8217;s not left for certain people. If you are a true follower of Christ, then prayer ought to be vital part of your life.<\/p>\n<p>What is prayer to you, is it a duty or a privilege? Is it a must do or is it a delight? Is it an occasional or a daily communion?

Saul thought that since Goliath was equipped and ready, trying to dress David would do the same. All David needed was his point of reference (what God had done in his life) and what God was going to do if he remained himself in the Lord. David could not fight with what he had not proven neither can we.<\/p>\n<p>1Samuel 17:40, &#8220;Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook&#8230;&#8221;. This is the core message. David took his staff not anybody&#8217;s and went to the brook and picked out five smooth stones. This to me has a great significance, the stones represent good skills to win a battle. He picked them from a brook. The bible says, &#8220;you shall be like a tree planted by the waters, Elijah was brought to a brook, The bible says, &#8220;Jesus is the living water&#8221;, &#8220;out of your belly shall flow rivers of life&#8221;. This shows that David was picking what he needed from God. Mark this, the stones were smooth and polished not just any stone. Have you and I picked the smooth stones from the brook of God to overcome? Talents, abilities, strengths to mention a few. On your job resume, you talk about your abilities and strength,. the employers tend to look at some of these because they become an advantage to what they are looking for. If you have smooth stones of meeting deadlines, honest, dependable, and adaptable and the like, this would add to your qualifications. You have to pick out your smooth stones to get you anywhere. What are your smooth stones? David picked his from the brook. Where do you get yours from?<\/p>\n<p>1Samuel 17:45, &#8220;&#8230;You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, &#8230;&#8221;, many believe that the stone brought Goliath down, I doubt it, I believe what David spoke to the giant melted his heart when he showed God strong on his behalf. All Goliath now saw was not David but God in David, the stone merely finished the job. Your smooth stone will only finish the job started by involving God in your affairs. Your confession that you are able through God&#8217;s help will help you begin the work of overcoming, your abilities and strengths accomplishes what was began. We pray give us a chance as long as we know we can truly depend on God to see us through. David might not have had what was required for the battle in the natural sense but in the spiritual sense he did. Give us a chance and we will show Him So strong before men.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Samuel 17:1-58, &#8220;Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook&#8230;&#8221; 1Samuel 17:32, &#8220;Then David said to Saul, &#8220;Let no man&#8217;s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with the Philistine&#8221;, Here is a mind made up to please the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1785","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-sN","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1785","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1785"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1785\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1786,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1785\/revisions\/1786"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1785"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1785"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1785"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1783,"date":"2010-06-02T19:18:30","date_gmt":"2010-06-02T13:48:30","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1783"},"modified":"2010-06-06T15:31:56","modified_gmt":"2010-06-06T10:01:56","slug":"give-me-a-chance-part-2-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/06\/02\/give-me-a-chance-part-2-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Give Me A Chance, Part&nbsp;2"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>1Samuel 17:1-58, &#8220;Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The bible is interesting in the sense that it could take time and dwell on something, fully describing it e.g. 1Samuel 17:4, &#8220;And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath from Gath, whose height was six cubits and spans&#8221; Read it until vs. 7, the 4 verses talks about nothing but how the giant was dressed for battle. The bible wants us to see something about this man. Just reading how equipped he was, I could see why the Israelites were afraid of him. This was no ordinary sizable man. I wondered why the bible wouldn&#8217;t just say he was a giant and a champion. I believe the Lord wants us to know that our enemy is not a wimp as many may think. He is prepared for you and me. Goliath was more qualified, trained, prepared, ready, equipped, eloquent, developed, sophisticated, protected, confident, threatening and a fighter, what chance did David have? All the trained men, who have all that it takes to battle, could not face the giant. Ever wondered why the bible does not even take time to describe how Saul was dressed for the battle? The Lord would have us know that no matter how big, strong and well prepared the enemy might be, our stand is in 1John 4:4, &#8220;ye are of God, little children for you have overcome them: because for greater is He that is in you, that he that is in the world&#8221;. You might be looking at the position God allowed you to have and looking at its requirements you get scared silly as whether you can handle the job. If you know who you are in Christ and Christ brings you to see what you did not even ask for, that is a sign that He will qualify you to overcome it. I have seen this work in my life, God brought me to something that I wasn&#8217;t even qualified for as the description showed me how Goliath was dressed but &#8220;God is not a respecter of persons, He is a respecter of principles&#8221;. If God brought you to this point, believe that He will take you to that point, Philippians 1:6, &#8220;Being confident of this very thing, that He which has began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is the concept David learnt when the rest could not and with that in mind he set himself to fight the giant and the first obstacle was his brothers. 1Samuel 17:28, &#8220;Now Eliab his older brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab&#8217;s anger was aroused against David..&#8221; Sounds familiar?, not everyone is ready for your progress, some say, &#8220;there is no way you can make it&#8221;, &#8220;there is no way you can have that position&#8221;, &#8220;there is no way you can change that department&#8221;, &#8220;you have nothing it takes to make a change, look at us who are more qualified and should do it but we are not because we are unable&#8221;. To make the matters worse, the brother accused him of coming to watch the war, accused him of pride, and was reminded of where he belonged in the wilderness with the sheep. What would you do if you \u00a0believed God to make it then you have someone in the church, in the home, or a friend discourage you? They speak death over your situation, &#8220;There is no way you can make it?&#8221;. David would have said, &#8220;Well you are right, I will pack up my stuff and go home&#8221;. This was not his attitude, if he went back home, that would mean he couldn&#8217;t trust God enough. Already he knows that he did not come to the battle ground to watch yet he has been accused of it, he begins to see that God set him up because he wasn&#8217;t looking for this job. He just knows that he has a chance to show how God is so strong among His people.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself this question, maybe you were not looking to be somewhere but God graciously brought you to that place, you know of your limitations, you have things and people trying to discourage you from doing what is right, something that will bring honor to His name.

In the entertainment world people are being discovered because of their talents. I&#8217;ve heard of people sharing about their humble beginning and often times you hear about a struggles involving rejections, written off words spoken that they were not good enough but later they broke through.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone desires a chance to show what they have within, their talents, abilities, skills, performance, or products. A chance to be a boss, husband, wife, teacher, worker etc. People will always cry, &#8220;give me a chance to show what I can do&#8221;. We also see this in the work force, people who see new positions that they may not have all the qualifications needed but they believe in themselves that given a chance, they can do it. A belief that you can offer something and make a difference can push you to desire a chance. Our chance as believers is not to show off, but make God look big in the eyes of men. He is already big let&#8217;s not forget that, but for the people in the world, we need to show them how Big Our God is. 2Chronicles 16:9, &#8220;For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself so strong on behalf of those whose hearts are loyal to Him&#8221;. He has given us a chance to show Him so strong.<\/p>\n<p>There is a big difference between knowing what to do&#8230;and doing what you know. Most people know what to do but they cannot propel and believe in God in them to do what they could not do themselves. They have potentials hidden. \u00a0David and Goliath is a story that reveals some things that are vital in our lives. We know David&#8217;s position, he is a shepherd boy, taking care of sheep and smells like one. Though young, he is good at what he does, he is faithful in his job. An opportunity rises when his father sends him to the battleground to bring food to his brothers. Again we see that he is also obedient he does what he&#8217;s been asked to do. I&#8217;m not sure whether he loved to take care of the sheep when his brothers were soldiers in the army but I do know that he knew his job pretty well. He was faithful and obedient in doing so. You may not like what you do, but can you still be good at it, faithful and obedient while trusting God to elevate you in due time? I believe God sees our attitude in what we do and if we cannot be content first with where we are, we will not be content when we move because before long&#8230;you know the rest. Anyway, David has a chance to be all he can be while still attending to the sheep.<\/p>\n<p>1Samuel 17:20, &#8220;So David rose in early in the morning&#8230; and took the things and went as Jesse (his father) had commanded him&#8221;, I say boldly that God was setting this young man up. He does not know what awaits him, maybe he never saw himself beyond being a shepherd boy but his obedience leads him to serve his superiors (his brothers) without murmuring and complaining. Now David coming to the grounds finds that the enemies are not fighting each other, he has just left what he brought with the supply keeper, runs to the battle ground to greet his brothers and in the process of time, he hears about Goliath sending threats to the Israelites. David has just learnt that no one including the king has the capability of facing this giant. They rehearse to him what will happen to any man who can kill Goliath. It&#8217;s like hearing, a job description and the benefits. The job is to kill Goliath, benefits are great riches, a hand of king&#8217;s daughter in marriage and exemption from taxes. What an opportunity but who is he? what chance does he have?.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll tackle more on it tomorrow.

\u00a0Did she set out to kill her husband or the other wife, because she couldn&#8217;t conceive a child? \u00a0Did she verbally try to abuse the other wife or try and defend her situation? \u00a0Did she verbally attack Eli the priest for not being able at first to understand her condition, for even he thought her to be drunk as she prayed her prayer? \u00a0No, she did none of these things that were possible reactions by any other in her situation. \u00a0What would you have done?<\/p>\n<p>How did Hannah finally respond to her sorrowful situation, of no one understanding her, and being labeled as cursed by God Himself? \u00a0She prayed a prayer. \u00a0She didn&#8217;t take up arms and go postal, run away, or even take her own life? \u00a0No, she prayed a powerful, real, heartfelt, from the guts of her desperation, prayer.<\/p>\n<p>Just then, the Lord remembered (not that He ever forgot) her, answering her prayer. \u00a0And granted her a son, the prophet Samuel. \u00a0God answered her prayer, bigger and greater than she could have ever imagined. \u00a0But isn&#8217;t God like that, we ask for something in His will, and He goes above and beyond what we had seen through our many times lack of faith.<\/p>\n<p>She responded to God in a way that we need to when God blesses us, in worship and thanksgiving, lest we worship the blessing, and not the Blesser! \u00a0&#8220;For this child I have prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of Him: \u00a0Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord.

We also find ourselves in situations where we were not looking for trouble but trouble found us. Joseph did not plan to be tempted or put himself in a situation that would allow him to. But when the situation presented itself, he flee. What about us?, flee youthful lust, turn the TV off if it causes you to stumble, get rid of your computer if it makes you fall; go home, it&#8217;s one of the best ways to stay out of trouble. Don&#8217;t allow yourself to be left alone in certain hours of day or \u00a0night with the opposite sex who is not your spouse, it&#8217;s not safe or wise. 1Cor 7:1&amp;2, &#8220;Now concerning the things that you wrote unto me: it&#8217;s good for a man not to touch a woman, nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Also 1Cor 10:23, says &#8220;All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify&#8221; and this goes for even dressing for most of them are lawful but they are not profitable, they don&#8217;t add anything to ones life but causes another to stumble, they don&#8217;t edify. How many times have we heard men come to church with pure hearts to pray and be ministered to and then a lady walks through the door dressed in away causing the person who came in to have communion with God to lust after her. Why cause many men to sin because of what you perceive to be okay for you? We have to be wise for one day we will be judged for our actions. How I pray that we will check how we dress, to work, to church, around people and the like for what is okay for us could be a stumbling block for someone else.<\/p>\n<p>Romans 12:2, &#8220;And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God&#8221;, we can&#8217;t live and do things the world&#8217;s way for they are lost but we have to do it God&#8217;s way for we are found. It begins with our minds transformed to think, discern, act and be wise. Everyday our minds ought to be renewed for the thoughts that come in them many times are not clean thoughts. We also need to prove what is good, not what we think is good but what we know to be good and acceptable not by me but by God, my authorities, the people around me and let it be according to the will of God. I did not come this far to fall. I have given up so much, stayed away from many things to protect the anointing in me, the calling, the zeal and the fire of God. If any of these leaves me, there will be nothing left in me and that is why David in Psalm 51 says, &#8220;Take not thy Holy Sprit from me, but restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right Spirit within me&#8221;. What you have worked hard for many years can go in days. When you know that you have come to far to go back, you will continue act like Joseph, RUN, FLEE.

The bible says that Jesus was tempted in all manner but without sin. Someone said, &#8220;Lead me not into temptation because I can find it myself&#8221; and so it&#8217;s easy to sin and very hard to stay pure.<\/p>\n<p>Gen 39:6&amp;7 &#8220;&#8230; Now Joseph was handsome and good looking and after time his master&#8217;s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said lie with me&#8221;. The eyes act like a video camera, the mind becomes the tape that records everything the eyes see, the body is the audience ready to practice what it has watched in the mind. Everything starts from somewhere and it progresses, therefore as children of God we have to be very careful about what we watch, where we go, the people we hang out with especially of the opposite sex and not be in compromising positions and situations. One preacher said that when it comes to sexual temptations, the mind goes to sleep first without you knowing just like you can&#8217;t catch yourself falling a sleep, you will only see the results. The bible says that Portiphar&#8217;s wife day after day pressed and persuaded Joseph to go to bed with her but he refused and stayed strong. I can&#8217;t say that just because He stayed strong he wasn&#8217;t tempted to act on it. Staying strong is not enough, hang around the same stuff for a while it will begin to pull you down. Going down does not happen instantly; it begins little by little and progresses from one stage to another until it gets out of control. It has a way of trying to persuade you and entices you slowly by slowly until you give in. On this particular day after several attempts, she tries to force herself on Joseph and he tries to explain why he shouldn&#8217;t do it and the best thing he could do was run away. 2Tim 2:22, &#8220;Flee youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of pure heart&#8221;, Paul when writing, he does not say sit there and cast out the demons or explain yourself as to why it is wrong, or even try to be strong, he is telling us to run. If you can&#8217;t beat the devil in his game, you need to be wise and change location, what you are dealing with is more powerful than you think. Those who have fallen at one point believed that they could handle it but you later hear that things got out of control. Though running away and being lied about caused Joseph his job, he maintained his integrity for God was on the verge of lifting him up. One little thing almost caused him his dream for he nearly stumbled, he chose to be a vessel of honor Psalm 73:2, &#8220;But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped&#8221; to finish.

It builds my faith to see God far beyond what I am dealing with at any given time. I see God bigger than my problem. When I see Him as my Father, it reveals\u00a0 to me that I am not just one of the children of God but I recognize my relationship with Him as personalized and therefore I am encouraged to know that He has called me His son. The bible says that He has curved us in the palm of His hands. The same bible also says that He knows us in and out and to prove it, the very hairs on our heads are numbered and not counted. What a way to show that He is concerned about our affairs as His sons and daughters. People will fail us, but our Father in heaven will never leave us nor forsake us. He is the friend who sticks closer than a brother. As I talk about Him, I am reminded that He is everything good I could ever think about.<\/p>\n<p>Mathew 6:9, &#8220;&#8230;Hallowed be Your name&#8221; His name is sacred, holy, consecrated, blessed, and sanctified. What a name!!!! no one has and no one will ever have such an introduction like God because no one disserves it like He does. Know God as He is for He is the One and only, let your faith increase as you see God as God.

How about if the word of God is true, then why are there so many versions? I would submit to us that God works among men through men. There are certain things He has chosen not to accomplish without involving man. This is not an indication that He is unable to make it happen but His choice is to involve men in what He does. To think about it, God could have saved the entire world without allowing Jesus to be a man on the face of the earth to go through the suffering before saving the world. This makes me believe that you cannot redeem what you are not related to. Had the bible been dropped from heaven, we would find it hard to relate to it, thank God for writing it through men.<\/p>\n<p>Why use man anyway? For us to understand that God speaks to men and through men. That there is such a connection between the Creator and His creation. This is part of the relationship that He has with mankind. Look at Genesis 2:19, &#8220;Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name&#8221;. God created then used a man to name His creation. Part of being able to use man to accomplish His plans also gives us a testimony of what He is capable of doing for they become our point of reference. Moses was there when the red sea parted, him giving us that account of what happened helps us understand what God can do.<\/p>\n<p>2Timothy 3:16, &#8220;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, &#8220;In as much as we know that the Scriptures were written by men, we understand that God breathed or inspired man to do the writing through His guidance. One of the reasons for this I believe was to show men that they were created for a purpose. Men have significance, value and a purpose, that is how God intended men to be. All these are fulfilled through God breathed word. The bible is &#8220;profitable for doctrine&#8221;, don&#8217;t we all learn by either teaching or observing, how will you know your significance, value and purpose without being taught?. You know what you know because you were taught directly or indirectly. I know who I am in Christ because the word of God has taught me. The word of God is for reproof and correction, what away to allow the word to keep us in check and in line. Why do we have a lot of problems in our societies? People have forgotten the book that keeps them in line. Not too long ago on TV, several young people were asked to name the Ten Commandments, 90% would not even name one. A different question followed and they all got them right and that was, &#8220;name all the beer brands you know&#8221;. They did not even struggle with that one; they spilled them like they were rapping. It seams no one ever taught them, they lived as they saw fit and what the society presented to them. The Bible is also for instruction, a map to the treasure Joshua 1:8, &#8220;This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 17that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work&#8221;, If we can be taught, reproved, corrected and instructed through His word, then vs. 17 comes in , &#8220;a man of God may be complete&#8221; not perfect, equipped for every good work. Luke 6:45, &#8220;A good man out of the good treasure (God&#8217;s word) of his heart brings forth good&#8230;for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks. The bible is no ordinary book, it&#8217;s a living book written by God through men, the best selling book, by the greatest author, translated in hundreds of languages. Value His word, Desire it, Live according to His word.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Timothy 3:16, &#8220;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 17, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work&#8221; Several objections to the word of God have been raised and the common one is, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1766","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-su","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1766","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1766"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1766\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1769,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1766\/revisions\/1769"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1766"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1766"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1766"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1763,"date":"2010-05-21T06:29:43","date_gmt":"2010-05-21T00:59:43","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1763"},"modified":"2010-05-26T00:03:12","modified_gmt":"2010-05-25T18:33:12","slug":"count-the-cost-bro-ben","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/05\/21\/count-the-cost-bro-ben\/","title":{"rendered":"Count the Cost, Bro.&nbsp;Ben"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Luke 14:28- &#8220;Which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it.&#8221; In verses 25-33 of Luke 14, our Lord says a few very challenging things to us, but verse 28 seems to be a good starting point for each as they continue on their Christian journey. We each must be sure to count the cost, lest we be unwilling in the end to pay what is due.<\/p>\n<p>To often today, Christianity is portrayed as something it is not, and folks never count the cost, they set out on this path and quite soon they take another one that is easier and more pleasant, but one full of compromise and lies, which leads not to holiness and life eternal, but to worldliness and death. Faith is ongoing, it never ends, it does not consist of saying a prayer once, but it is lived out everyday in obedience to His word. Saying a prayer once does not save you, but continued obedience and faith in Christ will see you through to the end. Jesus says unless we forsake ALL, we cannot be His disciple. Whoever does not bear his cross cannot be His disciple. Whoever does not go on to perfection(Hebrews 6:1), walking by faith and obedience will not enter into His rest.<\/p>\n<p>The grace of God is what enables us to live this life in holiness unto the Lord. His grace is continually working in us, forming within each the newness of life found in Christ, it is not a covering for sin, nor is it a free ticket to Heaven, for only He who endures to the end shall be saved. True holiness and righteousness is imparted within us, causing an inner transformation, the change of our very nature.<\/p>\n<p>The cost of discipleship is simple, it is everything. This is true Christianity. It is not a self help course, nor a get rich quick scheme. God would rather you be dirt poor than go to hell, the eternal soul is His concern. Christianity requires self denial, and the forsaking of all. Only when we truly abandon ourselves will we begin to bear the likeness of Christ, as He transforms us inwardly. So many today, &#8220;grew up in the church,&#8221; but they never truly made a decision for Christ, they never counted the cost, they never forsook all to be His disciple, they simply tried to inherit what must be birthed within each one by faith. Beloved, our Lord has made abundant provision for each one, He died to consecrate for us a &#8220;new and living way&#8221;(Heb. 10:20), that we might enter into a life with Him that grows deeper each day, a life of fulfillment that surpasses all this world has to offer, is it worth the cost to you?

Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\u00a0 (Mt. 10:28).<br \/>\nThough man may have power, the worst thing man can do can never match the worst thing God can do.\u00a0 God has the power to send the disobedient, unregenerate, unsaved to Hell.\u00a0\u00a0 And although Satan too may be powerful, only God can destroy both body and soul in Hell.\u00a0 That is why &#8220;The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom&#8230;&#8221;<br \/>\nAsk yourself (Reflect honestly)<br \/>\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is there anyone:\u00a0 boss, spouse, brother\/sister, co-worker, friend, authority figure, that I fear more than God?<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do I abide in the fear of the Lord daily and consistently in what I choose to watch, listen to, read, say, think about, and how I work.\u00a0 Do I share the Gospel with the lost so they won&#8217;t end up in hell like the (2%) or am I like the 98% of Christians who walk past the sinner like the Levite priest verses the Good Samaritan?<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Sanctify the Lord of Host Himself: and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.\u00a0 (Isa. 8:13) Sanctify the Lord of Hosts of Hosts Himself: To sanctify is to set apart.\u00a0 How can someone set God apart?\u00a0 Is He not already set apart, doesn&#8217;t He set Himself apart?\u00a0 But here [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1761","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-sp","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1761","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1761"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1761\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1762,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1761\/revisions\/1762"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1761"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1761"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1761"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1754,"date":"2010-05-18T05:53:23","date_gmt":"2010-05-18T00:23:23","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1754"},"modified":"2010-05-25T23:50:38","modified_gmt":"2010-05-25T18:20:38","slug":"true-holiness-by-pastor-phil-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/05\/18\/true-holiness-by-pastor-phil-2\/","title":{"rendered":"True Holiness, by Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>The word &#8220;holiness&#8221; carries with it some unwanted baggage, thanks to &#8220;religion.&#8221; In the East, to be a holy man means to sit naked with your legs crossed, and having folks give you money in return for your blessing.

However David was the sheep, and he wasn&#8217;t being hunted by a foreign army, or even any such enemy of Israel, he was being hunted by an enemy lion, with the attributes of Satan who seeks to steal kill and destroy, that was supposed to be on his side.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. The men said, &#8220;This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said to you, &#8216;I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.&#8217; &#8221; Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul&#8217;s robe (1 Sam. 24:3-4).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the worst enemies of all are those that you think are on your side, but that pursue your demise. \u00a0There may be any number of reasons such as jealousy or bitterness, which in the case with David and Saul seemed to be the prevalent reasons. \u00a0David learned how to dodge Saul&#8217;s spears time and time again, and now David is hiding out far back in a cave. \u00a0Interestingly enough though while David and his men were at the back of the cave, guess who laid down to rest near the front of cave? Saul! \u00a0God had prepared a table for David in the presence of his enemy Saul. \u00a0David had Saul in the palm of his hand as David was standing over a sleeping Saul he raised his blade over Saul. WOW, God had given David&#8217;s enemy into his hands for him to deal with as he wished. \u00a0David being more honorable man than Saul chooses to spare Saul&#8217;s life by bringing the blade down and cutting off a piece of Saul&#8217;s robe to show that he could have taken Saul&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their cry;&#8221; God&#8217;s favor rested with a righteous David as he brought his enemy to him and placed David&#8217;s enemy in a vulnerable state. \u00a0God has a way of bringing down our enemies, and preparing a table of blessing before us in their presence. \u00a0David could have killed Saul, but he didn&#8217;t. \u00a0David implored what we now read as Christ&#8217;s words, &#8220;Bless your enemies.&#8221; \u00a0Are their perhaps those that are seeking your demise because God is looking with favor upon you? \u00a0Do not fear because God has a way of bringing your enemies to your feet and preparing a table before you in the very presence of your enemies.<\/p>\n<p>Application: \u00a0Have you been following the world&#8217;s advice of &#8220;don&#8217;t get mad, get even?&#8221; \u00a0&#8220;Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God&#8217;s wrath, for it is written: &#8220;It is mine to avenge; I will repay,&#8221; says the Lord.

But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD. \u00a0 &#8220;Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?&#8221; And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.<\/p>\n<p>David was the King that had a desire, water. \u00a0He didn&#8217;t give a command, he didn&#8217;t make his request part of his men&#8217;s job description, and he didn&#8217;t have an expectation that these three men should take up the task of his &#8220;craving&#8221; for water from Bethlehem. \u00a0This King was in the line of Jesus Christ as reads in Matt 1:1 &#8220;A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham:&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Three mighty men: Utmost loyalty, sheer courage and bravery, along with evident sacrifice were the characteristics that these three men displayed in their venture. \u00a0They were loyal to David in that whom else would they have done this for going way beyond &#8220;the call of duty.&#8221; \u00a0They were brave and courageous with only three of them breaking through the host of the Philistine army after their twelve mile journey to get there. \u00a0These men could not just walk up to the well because of the Philistine garrison (outpost) in Bethlehem. \u00a0They broke through enemy lines, retrieved the water, and brought it back to David. \u00a0These men sacrificed their very lives not to gain clout or merit for themselves, not to be in the Israeli hall of fame, and not even to advance the victory for their army. \u00a0No, these men had on thing on their minds, to bring some water to their king! \u00a0Why, because this is what would please the King. \u00a0With loyalty and honor they risked their lives, &#8220;counting their lives worth nothing,&#8221; just to please the King to which they longed to do. \u00a0This King gave them identity and purpose and they put themselves in &#8220;death&#8217;s way,&#8221; to bring him pleasure. \u00a0 Haggai 1:8 reads, &#8220;Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,&#8221; says the LORD&#8221;. \u00a0God is our King and desires me to please Him!<\/p>\n<p>David&#8217;s Honor Response: It almost looks like a TV sitcom in this next scene. \u00a0David takes this water that the men risked their lives for and what does he do, POURS IT OUT on the ground. \u00a0It almost makes no sense. However, he pours it out onto the ground as it represented these three men&#8217;s blood sacrificed for the King. \u00a0Drinking the water to him was like drinking their blood in the risk of their lives. \u00a0David in a sense also made a sacrifice in putting the love of his men, before his own pleasure by spilling out the water he could have had as king.<\/p>\n<p>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Would I (You) risk my (your) life and go above and beyond the call of duty just to please my King Jesus? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0How appreciative am I (are you) that Christ spilled His blood out for my (your) salvation amidst the circumstances in my life right now? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Am I (you) breaking through enemy lines, winning souls for Christ just to please the heart of my King?<\/p>\n<p>Search me O my Savior, Redeemer and Friend and let me hear your voice to please you with my life above and beyond the call of duty. \u00a0I hear your will Lord and as Isaiah said, &#8220;hear am I Lord, send me!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2 Sam 23:15, David longed for water and said, &#8220;Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!&#8221; So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David.

This is one of those topics I have no direct answer \u00a0to. Looking at it from the way I have walked with the Lord has led me to know what His will for my life is. I still don&#8217;t know what His will is in certain areas of my life but I can see the direction I am being led to. I have shared from this topic before but for the sake of the new people and those who are struggling, may this word ignite something in your spirit.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that for someone to know the will of God they must first know God, I don&#8217;t mean know &#8220;about God&#8221; but actually &#8220;know God&#8221;. When you see things that He responds to, things that bring glory to His name, things that He does not approve of etc then you know what to do. All these are revealed in His word. His word becomes the manual book. Romans 10:17, &#8220;Faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word of God&#8221;. This is the beginning to understanding the will of God (Seek ye first) before knowing the will of God for your life (And all these other things shall be added unto you&#8221;. His word teaches us what God is like so us to respond according to His word. When you know God, you begin to learn your position in His kingdom; you begin to look for opportunities to operate in your position. Knowing God brings a massive change as in all about yourself is sifted and He fills you with more of Him.<\/p>\n<p>Proverbs 10:32, &#8220;The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable&#8221;. This scripture, talks about the &#8220;righteous&#8221;, those who Christ lives in their lives, those who have been made new creatures know what pleases Christ because they have learnt from Him. These are the ones with new appetites stirred up by Christ living inside. Anything that comes at this time is no longer for selfish desires but seeking opportunities to make Him shine.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 37:4 &#8220;Delight yourself also in the LORD&#8221;. The word &#8220;DELIGHT&#8221; means to take great pleasure. This as an opportunity to please the Lord with my life style because of what I have learnt from Him. In the book of Genesis, Cain and Abel brought sacrifices before God. Cain brought what he had done by himself and God did not receive it, Abel on the other hand brought that which the Lord required, a blood sacrifice. He was bringing to God what would please Him and he was offering it to God by faith. Remember again, &#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God&#8221;. Abel was delighting himself in the Lord. How did I know what God required? I learnt it from His word and I began to seek opportunities to glorify Him in all that I was doing. How did I know His will? Through promptings also confirmed by people, through a gift I never had, by thought He dropped in my mind, by leading and by me seeking opportunities according to His written will. What do all these have in common? They were to bring GLORY TO HIS NAME. This has been my way of delighting myself in the Lord. God is faithful because when you recognize that it&#8217;s not about you, He raises you to greater levels, gives you a blessing you were never qualified for simply because you delight in Him.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And He shall give you the desires of your heart&#8221;, this scripture can be misapplied and you know why? Because anyone can have ugly, selfish or wrong desires but here is the key, when you delight yourself in the Lord, He will show you things He has stored for you in His vault. You begin to have an appetite for it, it becomes the desires of your heart and God who showed you steps out and gives it to you as His will for your life. There are many who will never progress because they are waiting to hear God speak audibly, at times God will just open a door and you will need to walk through it. At times He will give you a thought and expect you to begin to develop on that thought as He works with you but it all begins with delighting in the Lord. I have learnt more that the more I sought opportunities to glorify Him in what I do, the more He blessed what I was doing and the more He blessed me. That is how I have progressed to be a prayer warrior, a teacher of the word, a minister through devotions, a preacher, witnessing on the streets, encouraging others and even counseling etc, I know because I know Him, it&#8217;s all about glorifying Him<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 37:4, &#8220;Delight yourself also in the LORD, And He shall give you the desires of your heart&#8221; I received an email yesterday with the question, &#8220;How to find God&#8217;s will for your life&#8221;.

Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. 5For the LORD is good; His mercy is everlasting, And His truth endures to all generations. You&#8217;ve heard me say this before, it&#8217;s very important to start your day on a good note, it has a way of affecting your entire day if started well. To be honest with you, I tend to be very busy and spent many times but it matters a lot to me how I start my day.<\/p>\n<p>We all have a way of affecting how we start the day, it&#8217;s a choice we have to make and declare otherwise we become victims of stress, frustrations and lack joy trying to do what is right. The bible tells us that the joy of the Lord is our strength. If we take a close look at the word joy, it&#8217;s more than happiness for happiness tend to go with how you feel at a given time especially when everything is going right, on the other hand, joy comes when you know that regardless of what you have to deal with whether going forward or backward, you will make it in other words rejoicing in the end result rather than the process. The joy of the Lord should make us comfortable in the situation we are in. You can be in a storm and still sleep comfortably.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 100 is a psalm of joy and singing, it starts with make a joyful shout to the Lord. I don&#8217;t have to shout joyfully to be heard by people, I can shout inside and when my inside is affected, definitely my outside appearance will be the result of what is going on inside. Serving the Lord with gladness is awesome for I know that whenever I sit to work at my station, I&#8217;m working and serving the Lord. This is a blessed time where I come in the morning to work and say Lord, &#8220;I thank you for another opportunity to serve you in my department and serve others that I may shine for You at my work place&#8221;. You see His word says in 1 Corinthians 10:31, &#8220;Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God&#8221;. Come before His presence with singing. I believe that music is the greatest tool used to uplift or to depress. There is nothing that people respond to like music and that is why we listen to music over and over again, we can have hundreds of music collections. The bible says that the Lord inhabits the praises of His people and we do a lot of praises through singing and listening to music. I love listening to music, it soothes and encourages but more so, it gives glory to God, it makes Him look good. A song in you will help you go through the day. When King Saul was being tormented by evil spirits, guess what they did, they had David playing music in his presence and the more he played, the more the evil spirit \u00a0could not be near him. Replace your worries and anxieties with a song in your ear, a song on your lips.<\/p>\n<p>Enter into His gates with thanksgiving and into His courts with praise. I love this line for this reminds me to go beyond where I am. Entering into His gates and into His courts allows me to leave outside everything that will interfere with my praise while I&#8217;m serving Him everyday. There is power in thanksgiving and when I enter into His gates, I begin to see what He has done more and thank Him for His faithfulness. This is a choice everyone has to make, yes we will have so much on our plates to accomplish and yes we will be dealing with tough customers on the phone, but we have been given the power to change the course of the day by allowing the joy of the Lord to be our strength. Keep a song with you, enter His gates and into His courts with a thanksgiving in your heart, refuse anything that will steal your praise, thanksgiving heart, and joy and be a beacon of light right where God has placed you.

\u00a0Jesus seemed to run into that situation often, even though He was a Master communicator. \u00a0Jesus had just finished having a conversation with a woman at the well, when His disciples were approaching with lunch. \u00a0 His disciples &#8220;were surprised to find him talking with a woman.&#8221; \u00a0It was considered improper for a Rabbi to speak with women in public, let alone one that was sexually immoral. \u00a0The disciples then see the woman leave, and see her water bucket that she left as evidence of her presence, and not &#8220;just their imaginations.&#8221; \u00a0But no one asked, &#8216;What do you want?&#8217; or &#8216;Why are you talking with her?&#8217; \u00a0I believe, that although no one asked those questions, those were the questions that they had on their minds.<\/p>\n<p>His disciples had these questions, but didn&#8217;t dare ask them. \u00a0Therefore, what do men do when they don&#8217;t want to speak about what is really on their minds? \u00a0They eat! \u00a0Eating doesn&#8217;t take much brain power, similar to watching TV. \u00a0They urged Jesus, &#8220;Rabbi, eat something.&#8221; \u00a0Jesus however knowing their thoughts replies, &#8220;I have food to eat that you know nothing about.&#8221; \u00a0Now they are thinking that someone came and gave Him food. \u00a0 Jesus continues by saying, &#8220;My food,&#8221; said Jesus, &#8220;is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish His work.&#8221; \u00a0Now they were really thrown off. \u00a0What was Jesus getting at, because they were talking about food, but Jesus wasn&#8217;t talking about food, He was talking about FOOD! \u00a0What was this food?<\/p>\n<p>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fulfillment Jesus received having ministered to this lost woman.<\/p>\n<p>2. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The overall life mission of reconciling the world to the Father through Himself as the bridge.<\/p>\n<p>3. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sustenance of pleasing His Father by obeying the mission that He gave Jesus to live out.<\/p>\n<p>4. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The very hunger He possessed, they did not yet crave, and that is being salt to make sinners thirsty for the water that the woman received.<\/p>\n<p>What was the work Jesus was to finish? \u00a0Just as drinking from the well would cause the woman to thirst again, so too will the disciples hunger again if their food source was from town supermarket. \u00a0The woman needed the living water, and the disciples needed the bread of life, and the desire to seek and save the lost just as Jesus had. \u00a0When the woman was filled with the water of life she began to bring others to Jesus, and that is what Jesus was looking for in His Twelve. \u00a0 \u00a0&#8220;Do you not say, &#8216;Four months more and then the harvest&#8217;? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. 36 Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. 37 Thus the saying &#8216;One sows and another reaps&#8217; is true. 38 I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.&#8221; \u00a0Jesus wanted the eyes of the disciples opened to the fields, NOT to their &#8220;food!&#8221; Job said, &#8220;I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.&#8221; \u00a0Jesus told you and me to seek and save the lost. \u00a0When we obey God in this, we too will eat the food that many do not know of. \u00a0Are you hungry? \u00a0Go to the harvest fields of your schools and jobs, and finish the work by the power of the Holy Spirit, and be fed by obeying His will!<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;But he said to them, &#8220;I have food to eat that you know nothing about.&#8221; &#8220;My food,&#8221; said Jesus, &#8220;is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.&#8221; (John 4:32,34) Have you ever tried to share something with someone and they just didn&#8217;t comprehend what you were [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1742","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-s6","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1742","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1742"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1742\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1744,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1742\/revisions\/1744"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1742"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1742"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1742"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1740,"date":"2010-05-07T18:17:02","date_gmt":"2010-05-07T12:47:02","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1740"},"modified":"2010-05-08T12:36:07","modified_gmt":"2010-05-08T07:06:07","slug":"dedicated-to-god-by-brother-ben","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/05\/07\/dedicated-to-god-by-brother-ben\/","title":{"rendered":"Dedicated to God, by brother&nbsp;Ben"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>John 17:17- Sanctify them by thy truth, thy word is truth To sanctify is to consecrate, to dedicate entirely to God, to purify internally by renewing of the soul.

In this sacred text is found the keys to unlock all the abundance of Heaven, the fullness of the work of Christ in each life. I pray that we would each grasp today the depth of work our Lord died to do in us. Hebrews \u00a013:12 says,&#8221; Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate.&#8221; Here again, Christ suffered and died to sanctify us, to make for Himself a holy nation, a people dedicated to Him entirely, a people that love Him with ALL of their heart, not just the part not consumed by worldly affections and desires.<\/p>\n<p>Brother and sisters, let us be in the world, but not of the world. Let us be this day a separate people, sanctified unto our God, for this is the high calling of God in Christ, to be solely devoted to Him, and this work is done as we fill our souls with Him, in prayer and study, allowing Him to wash us of not just the stains of sin, but of everything within us that would offend the eyes of His majesty. Is there jealousy in you today? Are wrath, drunkenness, unholy ambition, and the like residing in your bosom? Did you immediately say no to those questions? If so, look closer, look to the word of God, the great purifier, the refiner of men&#8217;s souls, does your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees(Matt 5:20)? Jesus died that He might sanctify us, that He might cleanse us, but His work is limited by our willingness. Let us resolve this day to dedicate ourselves entirely to Him and His will for our lives, for a baptism of holiness and a true demonstration of Godly living is the crying need of our day, and Christ has made all available to us by His willing sacrifice. I pray we would each willingly lay our lives down as well, living out our days for His glory, setting our eyes and our hearts upon the eternal, knowing this place is only temporary, and that he that does the will of God (I John 2:17, I Thess. 4:3) shall abide forever.<\/p>\n<p>In the sincere love of Christ, and all for His glory,<\/p>\n<p>Brother Ben<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 17:17- Sanctify them by thy truth, thy word is truth To sanctify is to consecrate, to dedicate entirely to God, to purify internally by renewing of the soul.

Only one place at a time could He be in. He was stretched in the life span of three years of His ministry on earth and I would say \u00a0He worked overtime. Matthew 8:20, &#8220;And Jesus said to him, &#8220;Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.&#8221; While the disciples slept, He labored at night in prayers and did ministry during day time. He did not have an organized structure, He wasn&#8217;t a pastor of an organized church meeting in a place but indeed He was a Shepherd. Being that He was limited to time and space, He did the much He could do and left the rest for the disciples and us who came along to continue with the great work.<\/p>\n<p>Matthew 9:37, &#8220;Then He said to His disciples, &#8220;The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few&#8221;, Looking around, I am witness of the harvest truly being plentiful. We can act like it&#8217;s not but the truth of the matter is, it is indeed. As the harvest is plentiful guess what, the devil is working overtime when believers are seating on their pews singing &#8220;Amazing grace&#8221;. Wars have increased, kidnappings, rapes, murders, abortion, disobedience, hatred, rebellion, lawlessness, all these have increased because the devil is working overtime. Think about it, temptations are working overtime, fear is doing the same and the devil is putting off fires in believers who are careless to discern the time they are living in. Many are naming the name of Christ thinking they are safe but here is something to think about, &#8220;in our societies it&#8217;s always INNOCENT till proven GUILTY; in Christ, GUILTY till proven INNOCENT. Can you see how the harvest is plenteous? yes we have people who have never repented and received Christ and they know it and then there are those who are deceiving themselves to thinking they have Him simply because they mention His name. The harvest is plenteous and we as believers have to wake up from doing regular hours to doing overtime to win that which is lost.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 38, &#8220;Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.&#8221; I used to think that by being called to be a prayer warrior, I was suppose to pray that God would raise up other people to do the work only to discover that the more I prayed to God to raise up laborers, the more I realized that I was the answered prayer. You pray for laborers and you become the laborer you&#8217;ve been praying for. Imagine a blind man walking towards the cliff, you can see that this is what will kill him. You stand there and pray that God will raise someone to run and tell him to turn around. You and I have a moral obligation to tell the blind men walking towards the cliff to turn around. Check this, James 5:19, &#8220;Brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back, 20, let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins&#8221;. It&#8217;s a blessing to know that God could use you to save a soul. There is so much to be done and very few people to do it. The ones who could do the work have been consumed by structures, programs and traditions. There is nothing wrong with that but at the expense of the lost? If we continue to sit and do nothing, the enemy will continue to work overtime. We better rise up and begin to do overtime, you might not see the payoff immediately but the One who holds the universe has your records of faithfulness in the back of His mind. God help me to be faithful in harvesting, help me work overtime, go out of my way. Correct me if I am wrong, overtime is time and a half or double time right?

He knows how to give good things to His children.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Matthew 7:11, &#8220;If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">He gives good things, not corrupt, broken, despised, or rejected.

The more we walk with the Lord, the more we see how faithful He is even when we are faithless. The blessing is not reserved for those who are perfect; He desires to bless those who are His. You agree with me that there are many of the unsaved that God has blessed. More blessings does not mean more love and also does not mean He prefers more blessed than less blessed. The bible says,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;He shows mercy to whoever He wants to show mercy, and grace to whoever He wants to show grace\u201d. <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">We are all looking to God to supply our needs, some have financial needs, healing needs, guidance, strength, hope, you name it. When you know that no one else can come to your rescue but the one who created you, you will run to Him knowing that He is faithful. The Philippians had been a blessing to Paul. Paul&#8217;s needs were met by God through the Philippians and he in turn encouraged them saying<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;my God shall supply all your need&#8221;,<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> not some of their needs but all their needs.

That He has a lot of ways to bless you, He could use a means you were not even expecting or a person who you were not thinking about. Paul was not expecting the Philippians to bless him but God used them anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">3 John 1:2, &#8220;Beloved, I pray that you<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;, God is not only concerned about your spiritual life, He is concerned about your physical needs too.

style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">The following is a message that I was deeply inspired by from Charles Swindoll\u2019s book<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Elijah<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">, about the time in Elijah\u2019s life when he went from victory to depression.\u00a0 Here are some great truths for us to learn:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Firstly, Elijah was not thinking realistically or clearly.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> Who made the threat?\u00a0 It was Jezebel not God that came against Elijah.\u00a0 How was Elijah able to so boldly challenge 450 prophets of Baal, but yet this one woman caused him to feel so threatened and vulnerable to his core?\u00a0 Often it\u2019s the little things that we make bigger than God in our eyes that seem to threaten all that we hold dear, and all that we identify with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Secondly, Elijah separated himself from strengthening relationships.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> Why did he get alone?\u00a0 Often when one is depressed one tends to retreat to be by oneself, instead of connecting as one should, often one will disconnect at the time he or she so desperately needs others.\u00a0 However when this happens others are pushed away and whatever encouragement others try to give, it is appreciated but not received or heard as much as it is needed.\u00a0 One looks inward and refuses for a time to look outward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Thirdly, Elijah was caught in the backwash of a great victory<\/span><\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.\u00a0 Often after a victory, often comes temptation and vulnerability.\u00a0 Elijah previously battled against and proved that God NOT Baal is the true God that manifested Himself by answering by fire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Fourthly, Elijah was physically exhausted and emotionally spent<\/span><\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.\u00a0 When we are in this state, our spirit is affected.\u00a0 We tend to drag, become sluggish, tired, weary in well doing, etc\u2026. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Fifthly, Elijah got lost in self-pity<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. <\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Have you ever had the \u201cvictim mentality,\u201d whereby you blamed the world, \u201cthe system,\u201d and everyone and everything else for your unhappiness?\u00a0 The blame game has been played since Adam blamed Eve when he was questioned by God.\u00a0 When we are in self pity, as far as we are concerned we are the only one with problems, and they are larger than life, even greater than the Lord.\u00a0 God will not allow us to stay in self \u2013 pity if we are following Him, because He has too much for us to do, and to come to glorify His name in victory, and not in defeat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">God\u2019s ministered to Elijah<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> God allowed Elijah a time of rest and refreshment.\u00a0 God communicated wisely with Elijah (v.9), and gave Elijah a close personal friend (v.19-21)<\/span><em> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">ELISHA.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span

Most of the comments were hard to read, God is hated out here. I remember back in the day where even if people did not serve God, at least they had a little reverence for Him. Today we have God haters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">We have a generation that has lost the fear of God, and we can see by what people are embracing and making it seem like the Almighty God is fine with their sin, after all God\u2019s main job is to make man happy. Jesus came on the face of the earth to die to make man happy, so why not embrace the sin, we love the most as long as we are happy and God will indeed bless us. God is a means to an end. No fear of God because most have not had a glimpse of the glory of God. I would categorize this group as God accommodators.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">When God was leading the Israelites to the Promised Land, in the previous chapter, they made idols for themselves to worship and even concluded that that their golden calf was their deliver from Egypt. In Exodus 33:3, God tells Moses to go and tell the Israelites that they were stiff necked people because of their rebellion, stubbornness, complaints (sin); today Moses would be labeled judgmental, cruel, unloving, unkind, and insensitive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">God even said, \u201cI will let you go to the promise land but without my presence going with you\u201d some would have been ok with that, and so are people who want to go to heaven today, they want to be partakers of God\u2019s blessings but don\u2019t want God. As Paul Washer always says, \u201c<em>These are people who want to go to heaven; they just hope God is not there when they get there.\u201d<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">God called Israelites stiff necked people. Moses may have wondered, \u201chow are they stiff-necked people, yes they complained, but they were not that bad\u201d and if anything, God shouldn\u2019t get worked up because these are His people He brought out of Egypt by Moses but God knew them better. Are we not in\u00a0 the same state today that even some Christians find it hard or don\u2019t believe that man is wretched, stiff necked? Again it boils down to, loss of fear of God for people have not had a glimpse of God\u2019s glory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">God would have brought them under the yoke of His law, and into the bond of His covenant, but their necks were too stiff to bow to them.

It mounts the judgment seat, puts on the black cap, and pronounces the sentence of death. With a harsh unpitying voice, it solemnly thunders forth the words, &#8220;Condemned already.&#8221; It bids the soul prepare its defense, knowing well that all apologies have been taken away by its former work of conviction. The sinner is therefore, speechless, and the law, with frowning looks, lifts up the veil of hell, and gives the man a glimpse of torment. The soul feels that the sentence is just, that the punishment is not too severe, and that mercy it has no right to expect; it stands quivering, trembling, fainting, and intoxicated with dismay, until it falls to prostrate in utter despair. The sinner puts the rope around his own neck, arrays himself in the attire of the condemned, and throws himself at the foot of the King&#8217;s throne, with but one thought, &#8220;I am vile&#8221;; and with one prayer, &#8220;God be merciful to me a sinner<\/span><\/em><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">.\u201d Charles Spurgeon.<\/span><strong> <\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Man must have knowledge about self as stiff necked people; otherwise he will never bow before the just and holy God.

Have you ever wondered why the end of that verse does not say,<strong> \u201c&#8230;fall short of God\u2019s moral standard?\u201d.<\/strong> Think about<strong> Isaiah 6:3, \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; The whole earth is full of<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> His glory<\/span>!\u201d,<\/strong> it does not finish with what it started. If it started with \u201choly\u201d repeated three times, you would expect Isaiah to conclude by saying, \u201c<strong>the whole earth is full of His holiness<\/strong>\u201d instead he says, \u201c<strong>The whole earth is full of His glory<\/strong>\u201d. There is something about \u201cHIS GLORY\u201d that everything ties into; I hope we can get a little glimpse of this word \u201cglory\u201d, the revelation of God.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cThe Glory of God\u201d<\/strong> is an important theme in the book of exodus, and it is the first time I see it introduced in the books of the bible. It appears in relation to the deliverance and wandering in the wilderness, the ratification of the covenant and the tabernacle. It could be concluded that a discussion on this theme should be related to a discussion on the being and attributes of God. In the OT, however<strong>, \u201cglory\u201d is the visible and supernatural manifestation of the supreme and incomparable majesty of God<\/strong>. According to the commentary I read, the Hebrew word for \u201cglory\u201d is<em> (kabod),<\/em> which means \u201cweight\u201d or \u201csubstance\u201d and comes to mean<strong> the honor stemming from the manifestation of the sum total of God\u2019s attributes, and also from the awe which such a revelation inspires those who behold it.<\/strong> Pastor John Piper describes it this way<strong>, \u201cThe glory of God is the manifestation of His holiness. God\u2019s holiness is the incomparable perfection and greatness of His divine nature;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> His glory is the display of that holiness. His glory is the open revelation of the secret of His holiness<\/span>. When God shows Himself to be holy, what we see is His glory\u2014<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">the beauty of holiness<\/span>. The holiness of God is His concealed glory. The glory of God is His revealed holiness.\u201d<\/strong> In summary<strong>, \u201c<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The glory of God is the infinite beauty and greatness of His manifold perfections<\/span>\u201d, John Piper<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And here we see that Moses say, \u201cPlease, show me Your glory\u201d, the glory fall we all fall short of.\u00a0 Having a little bit described the \u201cglory of God\u201d; I can understand why in preaching the gospel we need to start with the glory of God.\u00a0 Imagine you are told of a very important person you are going to meet. You may have despised his name when you heard it. You have heard of bad things that have happened while he was in leadership, and you came up with every thought you could imagine about this person as being such a bad person compared to you. But as they continue to describe this important person you have to stand before, his qualities, his attributes, his likes, his preference,\u00a0 what has been concealed to you is being displayed. Would that not drive you to start thinking of how unworthy you are to stand before such an important person? You look at who you are, where you\u2019ve been, what you\u2019ve done etc and everything good you thought about yourself falls short having heard a description of this important person? That was Isaiah\u2019s experience in Isaiah 6, no one told Isaiah of his sins, he saw the holiness of God, His righteousness, His majesty, how great He is, how marvelous, how powerful, His omnipotence, His sovereignty etc, all summed up in two words, \u201cHIS GLORY\u201d. I can imagine him saying, \u201chow can I stand in a glory like that in my state? I&#8217;m unworthy, He is not like me, He deserves more than this, I\u2019ve fallen short of His requirement to stand before Him. Isaiah did not start with himself as the measuring standard (sinners do), He started with God in His glory, \u201cplease, show me Your glory\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Then the questions to ask yourself is who am I?<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> the crowing glory of the creation of God<\/span><\/strong>, why I\u2019m I here?,<strong> \u201cto bring glory and honor to the Lord Jesus Christ\u201d<\/strong>, what is wrong with the world?, me. I don\u2019t do what I was meant to do,<strong> Romans 1:21, \u201c\u2026although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened\u201d,<\/strong> while other religions may teach how to make it by being good. Be happy by all means by being religious, and even try not to do bad things for fear of punishment or karma, we glorify God because we have seen Him in His glory and His glory has revealed to us our unworthiness and how in our state we would not stand before Him. We have seen the beauty of His holiness revealing to us that in our life we are not bringing him the glory and honor He deserves and only Christ can redeem us, restore us and clothe us with His righteousness.

We all make mistakes deliberately, accidentally or unconsciously. Whatever the case may be, there are always consequences of our mistakes. In nearly all cases, the consequences are never pleasant or desirable. It is usually very hard to predict accurately what the consequences of our mistakes might be and how they will impact our life and the life of those around us.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to refer you to two incidents in the Bible in which two good people made mistakes that bore very grave consequences that almost ruined or cost them their life and relationships. The first case is that of Esau, the eldest son of Isaac and the second is that of Joseph, the son of Jacob, Esau\u2019s youngest brother. Esau sold his birthright. Joseph bragged arrogantly and foolishly to his jealous brothers and un-discerning parents about his future. He didn\u2019t know how to keep secrets. He had a wide mouth and was full of youthful pride, arrogance, stupidity and immaturity. He was power hungry. His mistakes put him in the pit and prison in Egypt. God\u2019s hands, however, lifted him from the prison and placed him in Pharaoh\u2019s palace, and was later made ruler of Egypt. God reversed his misfortune to fortune. Joseph learned from his mistakes. He forgave his brothers<\/p>\n<p>Esau too made a big mistake. He sold his birth right to his younger brother for a bowl of soup because he was hungry. That bad and permanent decision he made in order to satisfy a temporary need cost him a lifetime loss of riches, honor, and happiness. Besides, that mistake later created a wedge between him and his brother Jacob. The consequences of Esau\u2019s mistake were grave. His hunger was genuine and he needed to satisfy it. He did. Only he did it the wrong way. If he had learnt to be patient, thoughtful, prayerful, wise, he still would have been able, by God\u2019s help, to find a good, proven and acceptable solution for his hunger. The spirit of anger followed hunger as Esau tried to deal with the aftermath of his mistake.<strong> Anger and hunger, are two dangerous physical and emotional drivers that are responsible for a lot of mistakes people make every day in life and the consequences of those mistakes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Can you think of a time or occasion when you made a mistake, for instance, by saying or doing the wrong thing simply because you were hungry for something or angry at someone or something? Are you aware of what your anger or hunger might have cost you? Yes, hunger and anger, if not dealt with the right way, can be very costly regardless of whether you are born again or not. Many marriages, for instance, have ended because of mistakes inspired and inflated by hunger and anger. Parents and their children have created emotional distance between them because of anger and hunger. Good friendships have dissolved because of anger and hunger. Many have lost good jobs and missed opportunities for promotion and advancement because they were angry at the boss, company or because they were hungry for more money, power and prestige and were not willing to wait for these things to arrive on God\u2019s time at right place, the right way. Worse of all, many have sold their Christian birthright and heritage and lost all the blessings and privileges that accompany salvation because of being angry at God. Angry because of thinking that God forsook them in times of their desperate need.<\/p>\n<p>Like Esau and Joseph, we sometimes make honest, but silly mistakes.<strong> Mistakes can cause misfortunes<\/strong>.

First, perfect love, described throughout scripture in various ways is the absence of the enmity that once resided, allowing the believer to render all of their affections unto God continuously. This is the culmination of God\u2019s initial work in our hearts, allowing us to love the Lord our God with all of our heart, soul, mind , and strength(Mark 12:30). This is perfect love for God, this is \u201cChristian Perfection.\u201d<strong> This is the chief aim of God in every life, holiness of heart and life. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Boldness here speaks of confidence and assurance, birthed in the heart when the condemnation of sin is removed. Sin will always separate us from God, to sin willfully is to backslide, to fall away from God, therefore God designs to remove the enmity, the very warfare between us and Him.<strong> He desires unbroken fellowship with His beloved, but the self life will always draw us away from that fellowship<\/strong>. To have assurance we must be assured in our hearts that we are children of God, not sometimes, not on Sundays, but all the time! We must stir ourselves up friends, to lay hold of our Lord in prayer, believing by faith that the sanctifying power of His Spirit might fall upon our hearts in all its cleansing power.<\/p>\n<p>The question remains here,<strong> are we as he is in this world<\/strong>? Are you walking daily in the Savior\u2019s power, are you a reflection of Him? Are you daily dying to yourself, that His life might be manifested in your mortal flesh? Let us examine ourselves, opening our hearts to the searching of the Holy Spirit, removing from our hearts all things offensive to our Lord. Let us desire this day to give ourselves entirely to Him, surrendering body, mind, heart, and soul to the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>This is the simplicity that is in Christ friends, the restoration of a relationship broken by sin, where God alone reigns in the heart, no other desire is known, all desires now flow from this love for the High and Holy One, and all within the heart is love.

He likes to push us into dismay, because then we cannot be strong; but the Bible says, &#8220;be strong in the Lord&#8221; (Ephesians 6:10) Friend, we are not alone in the battle, God would give us the necessary strength to trust Him. I remember at one time during the initial stages of my ministry, I felt unqualified to do the Lord&#8217;s ministry, but eventually God gave me the strength to do it. I remember one midnight struggling within myself whether I should preach the next day or not, it was my first preaching experience in a prayer meeting, God clearly spoke to me through the Word that He would give me the strength to deliver the message. We all at one stage or the other, we face the &#8216;How&#8217; test. &#8220;How am I going to do this when I&#8217;ve never done it before?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A church in Boston refused to allow Dwight L.

God would help you grow too, take heart friend!<\/p>\n<p>We often look back on difficult times with a fond remembrance because we realize we grew the most there. I think faith is very similar. Perhaps we will look back on our life and realize that it was only after a time of question or doubt that we grew in faith and understanding. It motivated us to search and explore and pray and read. And we came away with an even greater faith.<\/p>\n<p>Friend, it was not easy for Abraham and Sarah to trust God. Abraham received the promise for a child at the age of 75 but he had to go through many hardships, heart aches up to the age of 100, when he finally received the promise. The strength to wait, endure pain and sufferings comes from God. As we look at the example of Abraham and Sarah, we can see that it is God who does the enabling; it is God who gives the power to overcome the impossible; in each situation it is His work and His alone.<\/p>\n<p>If there is sin in your life, please bring it to the Lord because sin can make you feel insecure and weak.

I cannot overstate how critical it is for you to re-establish Bible reading and study as a high priority in your daily schedule. Please prayerfully consider these reasons why it is absolutely necessary for you to become a person of the Word.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 1.<\/strong><em> The enemy of your soul does not want you to be a person of the Word<\/em>. Since our first parents in Eden, Satan has sought to destroy God\u2019s children by questioning God\u2019s Word. He was bold enough to tempt Jesus by misapplying the Scriptures. If Jesus found it necessary to use the Scriptures to defend himself in this world, your knowledge and application of God\u2019s Word are more than choices; they are matters of spiritual survival.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 2.<\/strong><em> <\/em><em>The Bible is a priceless treasure<\/em>. For thousands of years, God has protected this precious Book from extinction. Believers have died to protect it. Evil regimes and false religions have done everything in their power to keep you from having a copy of the Word of God. Millions of your brothers and sisters in Christ would give their last dime to have a Bible, let alone the three or four copies that many American Christians possess.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 3.<\/strong><em> <\/em><em>The Bible is your resource for absolute truth<\/em>. In a day of spiritual confusion, moral relativism, and intellectual hypocrisy, you hold in your hand a direct communication from God, which gives you spiritual clarity, moral certainty and intellectual revelation. The Bible consists of more than little black letters on a page. It is a \u201ccontract\u201d in force between God and man. Every word is true and unchanging.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 4.<\/strong><em> <\/em><em>The Bible is your manual for living<\/em>. Its Author is your Creator. God knows why you exist and the best way for you to live. No matter how much money and time you spend on \u201cself-help\u201d books, you\u2019re far better off getting back to your \u201cGod-help\u201d book. God is the ultimate expert. He loves you and wants you to succeed. Ultimately, He cares about your eternal destiny.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 5.<\/strong><em> <\/em><em>As a child of God, you should keep up on all the blessings your Heavenly Father desires for all His children<\/em>. God\u2019s promises in His Word are not reserved for a few \u201csuper saints.\u201d They are for every believer. Most Christians do not have any idea how \u201crich\u201d they are in Christ. By some counts, 7,000 promises are yours. Others have found many more. Find them and claim them. The Maker of Bible promises will never die, has all the resources to fulfill every guarantee, and is not running for political office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 6.<\/strong><em> <\/em><em>The Word of God is powerful<\/em>. It is powerful for many reasons. The Bible is the Word of the eternal, omniscient, omnipotent God. Every word of man is conditional and temporal, but God has the final word. The Bible is our powerful defensive and offensive spiritual weapon (Ephesians 6:17; Hebrews 4:12). It is a word of healing and deliverance (Psalm 107:20). People who curse God or refuse to admit He created the world would be shocked to know He sustains the universe by His word of power (Hebrews 1:3).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 7.<\/strong><em> <\/em><em>The Scriptures should be your \u201cfood for thought.\u201d<\/em> The thought processes of the world have become so evil and depraved you must overcome the ideas and philosophies from darkened minds by daily planting the incorruptible seed of the Word of God in your heart (Romans 8:5-8). Everyone knows that positive thinking is better than negative thinking. Imagine how your day would brighten if you met every challenge with a divine promise and every situation with a divine truth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 8.<\/strong><em> <\/em><em>Those who neglect the written Word of God will soon have serious questions about the living Word: Jesus Christ<\/em>. The spirit of Antichrist is certainly evident and prevalent in our culture, but truth about Jesus\u2019 past and present and future is clearly revealed in the Scriptures. Remember, we are saved through faith in Jesus and \u201cfaith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God\u201d (Romans 10:17, KJV).<\/p>\n<p>When Peter stepped out of a fishing boat in a storm and walked on water, he didn\u2019t begin to sink until he took his eyes off Jesus (Matthew 14:22-31). Believers are in serious trouble when they do not constantly read the Word, which reveals Jesus. Like Peter, those who do not keep Christ in plain view will be dragged down by the storms of life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 9.<\/strong><em> <\/em><em>Every person has a desire to know about the future<\/em>. It is amazing to what lengths people will go to see beyond the present. This innate interest feeds fortunetellers, astrologers, palm readers, clairvoyants and other charlatans. Their lack of accuracy is pathetic, yet millions continue to seek their counsel. You have in your possession the greatest Book about prophecy ever written \u2014 the Bible. \u201cWe have also a more sure word of prophecy\u201d (2 Peter 1:19).<\/p>\n<p>When people speak of the future with fear and panic, they have taken their future out of the hands of God. They have neglected the words of Jesus: \u201cSet your troubled hearts at rest. Trust in God always; trust also in me. There are many dwelling places in my father\u2019s house; if it were not so I should have told you; for I am going there on purpose to prepare a place for you\u201d (John 14:1,2, NEB).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 10.<\/strong><em> <\/em><em>How would you like to hear God speak to you?<\/em> How would you like to sit down and listen to the teaching of Jesus, the greatest Teacher who ever lived? You can every day by opening the pages of the Word of God. It really is a letter to you. As you read it, the Spirit of God will quicken and reveal life-giving truth to you.<\/p>\n<p>Reading God\u2019s Word should never be viewed as a laborious task or even a duty. It is a wonderful privilege to open the Book every day and receive divine insights into the nature of God, the purpose of man, and the truth about time and eternity.<\/p>\n<p>The Word of God is vital if you are going to live a victorious life. I pray this letter stirs a fresh desire in your heart to know divine truth. Remember: \u201cMan shall not live by bread alone, but by<em> <\/em><em>every word<\/em> [emphasis mine] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\u201d (Matthew 4:4, KJV).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis book will keep you from sin, or sin will keep you from this book.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Pastor Phil would like to share this with you.

He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire&#8221;<br \/>\nJohn the Baptist I would say was one great evangelist. God had a destiny for him, something that only John would do because he was born to fulfill it. Looking at Luke chapter 1, I can clearly see that John and Jesus\u2019 birth were a few months apart. John was older than Jesus by a few months. John began ministry before Jesus as he was the one to prepare the way for Christ. How he dressed, ate and where he preached showed how humble he was to fulfill the calling that was in his life. He was clothed in camels hair (Matt 3:4), his food was locust and wild honey (Matt 3:4), and he preached in wilderness of Judea (Matt 3:1). He sounds to me like a street preacher who is in the wilderness of the lost people preaching the kingdom of God. Doesn&#8217;t sound like preachers of today who\u00a0 eat well, dress nicely, and preach in a nice sanctuary. John the humble servant of God preached faithfully and many heard believed and were baptized. He could only do what God had raised Him to do.<br \/>\nHow many times did people think that He was Christ the promised one?\u00a0 He kept on telling them that he was not the one by saying, Matthew 3:11, &#8220;I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire&#8221;. God has given us the ability to do things but there are those that He will do Himself. He will not send an angel or any one else to do it, it will be His job. He is mightier than us, what we cannot accomplish because of our limitations and inabilities, only He can go above and beyond. I face many situations that I can only do the best I can then the rest I say, &#8220;there comes another one who is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry, He shall make a way where there seams to be no way, He will make the crooked paths straight when I can&#8217;t, He will show me the way when I loose it or not know it, He will fight for me when I am weak and tired etc&#8221;. John says, &#8220;He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit&#8221;, what did Jesus say about the Holy Spirit? He will be a helper John 14:16, He will abide with us forever (John 14:16), He will teach us all things (John 14:26), He will be a Spirit of truth (John 15:26), He will empower us (Acts 1:8). I am glad that He who comes after me is mightier than I.<br \/>\nThe one who was mightier than John shows up in his place of ministry. John recognized Him and introduced Him to all, John 1:29, &#8220;&#8230; Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! 30, This is He of whom I said, &#8220;After me comes a Man who is preferred before me, for He was before me.&#8217; 31, I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, therefore I came baptizing with water.&#8221; There is something to think about in this line. There had been prophets before who did marvelous things for God, God used them mightily but never once did they have the power to take away sin. If Jesus had the power to take away the sins of the world, there was nothing that He could not do. That is what made Him unique; He had the power to take away sin. Lord help me introduce you to every situation that is challenging, instead of breaking down and weeping, going into depression, scared etc, help me speak to the situation about Your coming. I might be in the wilderness, I might not have the best but I know You are mightier than I. As long as I have You, I am set.

Why is it that we live in a world that shows less or no kindness. Fathers show no kindness to their wives and vise versa, kids are not kind to each other, parents are not kind to their kids, people are not kind to other people, some reasons why we have murders, abortions, rapes, robbery to mention a few. If everyone was kind as the bible puts it, we wouldn\u2019t have any of these issues to deal with, we would all live in peace and harmony.<br \/>\nKind is the state of friendly, generous or warm hearted nature. A state of showing sympathy, understanding, charitable and considerate. Treating the way you would want to be treated. The bible says in Proverbs 19:22, &#8220;What is desired in a man is kindness\u2026&#8221;. How true is this, something that God would want in every man and woman. We know that kindness warms the heart, it brings a smile. It gives a sense of value and belonging. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be shown kindness? Everyone desires for someone to treat them nicely and say nice things about them. We all want to be affirmed, someone to believe in you and speak it out. There is power in words spoken therefore you never know what you speak today could impact an individual&#8217;s life for a long time. Words of encouragements have a way of melting away fear and doubts in a person, hence creating avenues for healing and restoration. We have to learn to be sensitive to each other&#8217;s needs and not blinded by our own.<br \/>\nEphesians 4:32, &#8220;And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you&#8221; Paul in writing to the Ephesians told them to replace all bitterness, anger, clamor and evil speaking by being kind to another, having a soft sport of forgiveness. Being the one to step out and do something that is not always seen or experienced in situations that fight kindness. You and I could brightens someone&#8217;s day at work because we showed kindness, we said something nice about what someone wore, or said, or did, or how they smiled. We can affirm our spouses, appreciating them for who they are, what they mean to our lives instead of looking for things that bring strife. We can encourage our kids in their day to day walk, believing in them and speaking it into their lives. The power of words can begin a process of greatness in the young life. We can also teach them kindness by demonstration between mom and dad on how they treat each other. We all have point of references, something to fall back to. If we all understand that what is desired of us is kindness, we will show more of it on a day to day basis in our homes, in church, community, in our jobs, wherever we go.

When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, But he himself went a day&#8217;s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.\u201d 5 Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, \u201cGet up and eat.\u201d\u00a0 1 Kings 19:3-4<\/p>\n<p>The following is a message that I was deeply inspired by from Charles Swindoll\u2019s book Elijah, about the time in Elijah\u2019s life when he went from victory to depression.\u00a0 Here are some great truths for us to learn:<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, Elijah was not thinking realistically or clearly.\u00a0 Who made the threat? \u00a0It was Jezebel not God that came against Elijah.\u00a0 How was Elijah able to so boldly challenge 450 prophets of Baal, but yet this one woman caused him to feel so threatened and vulnerable to his core?\u00a0 Often it\u2019s the little things that we make bigger than God in our eyes that seem to threaten all that we hold dear, and all that we identify with.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, Elijah separated himself from strengthening relationships. Why did he get alone?\u00a0 Often when one is depressed one tends to retreat to be by oneself, instead of connecting as one should, often one will disconnect at the time he or she so desperately needs others.\u00a0 However when this happens others are pushed away and whatever encouragement others try to give, it is appreciated but not received or heard as much as it is needed.\u00a0 One looks inward and refuses for a time to look outward.<\/p>\n<p>Thirdly, Elijah was caught in the backwash of a great victory.\u00a0 Often after a victory, often comes temptation and vulnerability.\u00a0 Elijah previously battled against and proved that God NOT Baal is the true God that manifested Himself by answering by fire.<\/p>\n<p>Fourthly, Elijah was physically exhausted and emotionally spent.\u00a0 When we are in this state our spirit is affected.\u00a0 We tend to drag, become sluggish, tired, weary in well doing, etc\u2026.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Fifthly, Elijah got lost in self-pity.\u00a0 Have you ever had the \u201cvictim mentality,\u201d whereby you blamed the world, \u201cthe system,\u201d and everyone and everything else for your unhappiness?\u00a0 The blame game has been played since Adam blamed Eve when he was questioned by God.\u00a0 When we are in self pity, as far as we are concerned we are the only one with problems, and they are larger than life, even greater than the Lord.\u00a0 God will not allow us to stay in self \u2013 pity if we are following Him, because He has too much for us to do, and to become to glorify His name in victory, and not in defeat.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>God ministered to Elijah.\u00a0 God allowed Elijah a time of rest and refreshment.\u00a0 God communicated wisely with Elijah (v.9), and gave Elijah a close personal friend (v.19-21) ELISHA.<\/p>\n<p>Elijah reminds us.\u00a0 Let\u2019s look up after the Lord who graciously delivers us from our depression. Let\u2019s look up when he gives us rest and refreshment following an exhausting schedule that has taken it\u2019s toll on us. Let\u2019s look up and thank Him when He gently and patiently speaks to us from His Word after we\u2019ve climbed out of a pit of self-pity. Let\u2019s look up and praise Him when He faithfully proves the companionship and affirmation of a friend who understands and encourages us.

They were full of wisdom, good looking and the greatest thing, they trusted and depended on God. Everything seemed well until the king made his own gods (idols) forcing everyone to fall down and worship the gods he had made. Three men living for their true God are\u00a0 challenged with this. What do you do when what you stand for is challenged? Situations bringing you two sides and you have to choose one. One presents you with the picture of the immediate consequences. Things were going on well but then out of nowhere, everything you\u2019ve lived for is threatened. Should I blame God for bringing me to this place and then letting challenges come my way? Should I give up on God cause of the new development? What is your stand? What is the truth? Are you willing to stand even if it means suffering the consequences in the hands of those who have made the decree? For Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, they were commanded to bow even give another chance to act, and they were told of the consequences (furnace heated 7 times hotter than the usual) if they did not bow. Let us see what they did.<\/p>\n<p>Three things in their response in the situation, &#8220;<strong>our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace<\/strong>&#8220;. No question about God&#8217;s ability, He is the God of the impossibilities, the God who calls those things which are not as though they were,<strong> Jeremiah 32:17, &#8220;Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> There is nothing too hard for You<\/span><\/strong>&#8220;. Second thing, &#8220;<strong>He will deliver us from your hand<\/strong>&#8220;, what a faith to see God coming to your rescue when the pressure from people and things of this world challenges everything you stand for. Wonderful words, &#8220;<strong>Our God is able<\/strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>He will deliver us<\/strong>&#8221; let&#8217;s see their last response to the king,\u00a0 &#8220;<strong>But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up<\/strong>&#8220;. To someone, the last response could mean that they were not sure God would deliver them. I look at it differently, this is the extra mile walk many don\u2019t want to go or unwilling to go, but this is the mile of surrender, this is the mile of the garden of Gethsemane experience, where you say<strong> \u201cnot my will but your will be done\u201d<\/strong>. This is the mile that says, \u201cGod allow me to go through what brings You more glory\u201d. The three men desired God\u2019s will, they said, \u201c<strong>17, If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up<\/span>\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">If God would not deliver them from the furnace of fire, He must have counted them worthy to go through it<\/span><\/strong>.,<strong> Acts 5:41, &#8220;So they departed from the presence of the council,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name.<\/span> 2 Thessalonians 1:5, &#8220;.. that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer<\/strong>&#8220;.<strong> Romans 8:18, &#8220;For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us<\/strong>&#8220;.\u00a0 They obeyed God rather than men, this was an opportunity for them to shine for God. The situation got worse, the furnace was heated 7 times hotter than usual<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.<strong> The hotter the heat, the greater the glory<\/strong><\/span>. Bound and thrown into the fire. Two things,<strong> the fire could only burn what needed to be burnt and revealed who needed to be revealed<\/strong>. The fire burnt the ropes they were tired with, freeing them and the Son of God was revealed in the midst of the fire. I do not find anywhere in the scripture where they were quick to get off the fire. Through their stand, the decree was changed by the king himself who said, &#8220;no one should worship any god apart from the God of<strong> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego&#8221; (paraphrased).

Render your heart and count up the cost. It&#8217;s only what you&#8217;ve done for the Lord that will last<\/strong>&#8220;. When someone goes, it&#8217;s what they did that they leave behind, a legacy. The bible says in<strong> Genesis 5:24, &#8220;And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him<\/strong>&#8220;. He walked with the Lord 300 years, that is the legacy he left behind; he pleased the Lord in his walk. David left a legacy of being a man after God&#8217;s own heart, Moses was known as the most humble man, and Abraham was called a friend of God etc. The common thing about these men, we still talk about them even today and we still have a lot to learn from them. We cannot forget the founding fathers of this nation who left us a legacy still being talked about. Some of their work and messages still impact even after centuries have passed. We cannot forget preachers of the early centuries men like Martin Luther, General William Booth (founder of Salvation Army), Charles Spurgeon, Charles Finney, DL Moody, George Whitfield, and the like, men who preached messages that are still impacting lives today. Messages that have crossed boundaries of age, class, time and even original audiences because the truth knows no bounds. All these people have one thing in common, they are gone yet what they did for the Lord is still alive. They may have never known or thought that it would still go on after they were dead but thank God they are still going on because of God behind the word.<\/p>\n<p>Elisha had died, one of the most powerful prophets of his time. He did more miracles than Elijah for he had double portion of the anointing (responsibility). After dying, buried, decomposed and all that was left was bones, a man who had died and was to be buried was dropped accidentally in Elisha&#8217;s tomb due to raid and when he&#8217;s body touched Elisha&#8217;s bones, he revived. Elisha was long gone yet the effect of his ministry was still working bringing the dead back to life. I am seeing some of the bones of the old bringing back to life the dead with the message of revival. It&#8217;s what they had done for the Lord that lasted and because of that, their bones of teachings, lifestyle, are impacting the body today as many have stumbled and touched their bones. Few years back I landed on the bones of some long gone preachers such as Martin Luther, Charles Spurgeon, Charles Finney, DL Moody etc and their bones of their teachings have revived my way of witnessing, preaching, praying effectively. Through their teachings right from the bible, I have seen some things I never knew and understood. In putting them into practice, I have seen my life transformed with other lives I reached out to. Just like Elisha, they rendered their hearts to God&#8217;s service. They served with humility.<\/p>\n<p>My desire is to do the same, living a life rendered to God because what I do for the Lord is what will last. I want to be like Enoch who walked with the Lord, he pleased the Lord. Through my witnessing, teachings, prayers, encouragements etc will outlast me even after I am well gone.<strong> I want to live for the Lord and leave a legacy.<\/strong> Can you imagine getting to heaven and you hear that God saved someone through what you did for the Lord?

And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?&#8221;<\/strong> I was comfortable just being saved sometime back, but then I was awakened to be an intercessor. It was exciting to talk to God about men; God began to drive me to talk to men about Him.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to read the above verse and try to find excuses why it shouldn\u2019t affect you and me directly. Jesus was telling His disciples,<strong> &#8220;Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of the wolves&#8221;.<\/strong> I have taken a team on the streets many times to reach the lost, it felt like what Jesus said, sheep that He has sent in the midst of wolves. I usually have 101 excuses why I shouldn&#8217;t go out, (feeling I&#8217;m too tired, I&#8217;m scared, I have already witnessed to many before, it could be dangerous), you know of all those excuses we come up with. When I think about being &#8220;sent out&#8221;, I come to an understanding that I have no excuse at all. Of all the years I\u2019ve gone out on the streets to witness, only once did someone get so angry with me. The rest have been receptive, sheep in the midst of wolves. The bible continues to say, &#8220;<strong>Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves<\/strong>&#8220;. Think of it this way, when serpents want to strike, they look for the heel right? God told the serpent that his seed shall bruise man&#8217;s heel. Heel is rounded posterior portion of the human foot under and behind the ankle. If a serpent can get the heel, the venom sips through the blood system, and has the ability to paralyze or kill. Doesn&#8217;t the bible talk about feet (where the heel is found) when mentioning the gospel?<strong> Isaiah 52:7, &#8220;How beautiful upon the mountains Are the feet of him who brings good news..&#8221;, Nahum 1:15, &#8220;Behold, on the mountains The feet of him who brings good tidings..&#8221;, Ephesians 6:15, &#8220;and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace&#8221;.<\/strong> Isn&#8217;t it amazing that the serpent the devil wants to strike our heel that we may be paralyzed to preach the gospel? We get paralyzed by the excuses we have because the serpent struck our heels. Jesus tells us to be wise as serpents, they strike the heel, and we strike the heart with the gospel. He knows his target, we know our target, we have to be as smart as he is or out smart him. &#8220;Harmless as doves&#8221;, what a joy for the lost to know that we care about them not to threaten them with the word but to bring salvation through the word.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> When God interferes with your comfort, nothing will stop you from being where He wants you<\/span><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Jeremiah, a sheep in the midst of wolves, also preached on the streets. Many did not want to hear him, some tried to silence him and even persecuted. It was so much that he wanted to quit but here is what kept him on the streets,<strong> Jeremiah 20:9, &#8220;Then I said, &#8220;I will not make mention of Him, Nor speak anymore in His name.&#8221;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> But His word was in my heart like a burning fire Shut up in my bones;<\/span> I was weary of holding it back, And I could not.&#8221;.<\/strong> The zeal of God will make you do crazy things, it will make you step out of your comfort zone, out of the boat to do the impossible. I remember a song, &#8220;<strong>The zeal of God has consumed me, it burns in my soul, a driving force that cannot be stopped a fire that cannot be quenched.<\/strong>&#8221; We need to have such a zeal for the lost but the enemy wants to put that fire out by striking us, he is wise remember. He knows he has a short time but I know God is sending us, our feet shall bring the gospel of peace. Protect your heel and be a voice.

Paul did not need to run away from what he was going through because that is what God was going to use to put him together. That is what He was using to get more praise and worship out of him.

They may have had collected some toys, had some success, felt more likeable, more accepted therefore they needed someone to tell them who was the greatest. Jesus\u2019 reply &#8220;<strong>the greatest among you shall be a servant of all&#8221;,<\/strong> This went against everything they may have thought, crushing down their ideas of what it takes to be great.<\/p>\n<p>We are called to be servants, that is how our foundation is built. When one begins to build a house, the first thing he does he builds a foundation and that involves digging down deep. The deeper the foundation, the higher and the stronger the building can be. Jesus demonstrated it during the last supper, He girded Himself with a towel, went down on His knees and began to wash His disciples feet. The King of kings and the Lord of lords washing people&#8217;s dusty, smelly feet? I am yet to see a great leader or a celebrity go that low to do something like that. Jesus was getting ready for something extraordinary, He humbled himself to do what most leaders wouldn&#8217;t do and not just leaders, but even the ordinary people. He could humble Himself to do it, how much more do we need to wash each other&#8217;s feet. He said that did not come to be served but to serve.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to wash the feet of our friends, family and even people we respect. Jesus was washing the feet of a guy who was about to betray Him, another one would deny Him and the rest would abandon Him. We need to wash all manner of feet regardless of the race, religion, class, click etc. We are servants of God and so we do what we are called to do and how much a blessing it is to serve the Lord. Our reward is not measured by what we have acquired, it is measured on how we have served whichever place God puts us.<\/p>\n<p>Serve, wait and wash all manner of feet without complaining or murmuring, Remember strong foundation is dependant on how deep you dig down and what materials you use.<strong> Charisma can put anyone one on top but integrity (character) is what will keep him on top<\/strong>. Your faith, your patience, your view on people, humility are being built as you serve.<strong> The way up, is the way down first. The way of the Master, serve!.

No doubt they had seen Jesus spending so much time in prayer and so little time performing miracles.\u00a0 Hence the connection, that the power of miracle working was tied to the prayer life of Jesus Himself.\u00a0 I recall Ray Comfort writing, \u201cIt was in a Garden, the Garden of Eden that humanity said, not thy will, but my will be done, and it was in another Garden the Garden of Gethsemane that Christ would pray the opposite prayer, \u2018not my will, but thy will be done.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Alan Redpath\u2019s word\u2019s ring true in light of this when he said, \u201c<strong><em>Before we can pray \u201cThy Kingdom come,\u201d we must be willing to pray \u201cmy kingdom go,\u201d<\/em><\/strong> and I would like to add before we can pray thy will be done, we must pray my will be gone.\u201d\u00a0 When looking at the book of Job, one must realize that an invisible war rages, to attack Children of God.<\/p>\n<p>You cannot follow your heart!\u00a0 Your heart will deceive you.\u00a0 Jeremiah wrote, \u201c \u201c<strong>The<sup> n<\/sup>heart<em> is<\/em> deceitful above all<em> things,<\/em> And desperately wicked; who can know it?

For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.\u201d <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is the work of Christ, to destroy the works of the devil in our lives. Nowhere in scripture does it condone us remaining in sin, for Christ has made available to us through His sacrifice on the cross complete freedom from sin. Some would say a little sin keeps us humble, this is false, for here John says a little sin makes us of the devil. We must view sin as God views sin. He hates sin. He does not tolerate sin. And because of that, we must realize He has made available to us compete victory over sin. We must realize the depth of God\u2019s work in our lives, allowing the fullness of the gospel to work in us. And sin is more than just the outward, physical things we often boast in not doing. There are inward offenses that run much deeper, things like fear, pride, lust, covetousness, indifference, and bitterness to name a few. These must be removed from the life as well, but they require a much deeper cleansing. We must compare ourselves daily to God, not to others, desiring to be holy as He is holy. We must become so sick of our impurity, our inward depravity, that we cast ourselves fully upon the merits of His cross, His shed blood, desiring to realize the fullness of His work in our lives. I John 1:7 says<strong>, \u201cthe blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from ALL sin.\u201d<\/strong> When he says ALL sin, he means ALL sin! No sin remains! A preacher I enjoy listening to once proposed a question, Are we dead TO sin or dead IN sin? We must each examine ourselves, for there is a deeper, fuller work to be obtained in our lives, a second work of grace, an inward cleansing that destroys the carnal nature that remains after justification. Suppression will not do it, we will wrestle till we die, the old man must be crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin(Romans 8:6). This work perfects the believer in love and empowers them for service, followed by lifelong growth in grace and knowledge of the Lord. John Wesley called it \u201cChristian Perfection\u201d, not Christlike perfection, but a state of being where all things objectionable to the character of God are removed, to be renewed in the image of God, in true righteousness and holiness, allowing the believer to love Christ with all of his heart, and his neighbor as himself. God reigns alone in the heart, all that is in the soul is holiness to the Lord. Matthew 23:19 says,\u201d<strong> the altar that sanctifies the gift.\u201d<\/strong> Christ is the altar, we are the gift, it is He who will sanctify us upon the entire consecration of our lives by faith in the merits of His sacrifice, lay body, soul, and spirit upon Him.

While waiting, a farmer\u00a0 may have to deal with weeds, insects, floods, animals, thieves, etc.,\u00a0 Jesus gave a parable, in<strong> Matthew 13:24, \u201c\u2026The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;<sup> 25<\/sup><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way<\/span>.<sup> 26<\/sup> But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared.<sup> 27<\/sup> So the servants of the owner came and said to him, \u2018Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field?

Trouble came when the sower (farmer) fell a sleep. He did the right thing, sowed good seeds, but when he stopped guarding, the enemy took advantage.<\/p>\n<p>Sowing is just the beginning. He may face such tremendous challenges with his crops before he reaps. A good farmer will not sow and then fall a sleep, he will be diligent to guard and fight all the enemies to his crops till he harvests.\u00a0 While a good farmer may deal with weeds, insects, floods, animals, thieves threatening his crops, he will not quit when the going gets tough because his life, survival depends on his labor.<strong> Psalm 126:5, \u201cThose who sow in tears shall reap in joy\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We must first labor as the husbandman does, with diligence and patience, always watching, before we are partakers of the fruit; we must do the will of God, before we receive the promises, for which reason we have need of patience. Patience has the capacity to create setbacks. Think of Joseph who sowed good seeds of his dream only to have major setbacks for years. They threatened his life, his dreams, his destiny yet he labored with diligence, guarding, working hard, enduring through with little or no encouragement from people but only knowing God\u2019s hand was upon his life.\u00a0 He sowed in tears and reaped in joy. In the end of it, everything that appeared to be working against him was actually working for him. Here is what he says in<strong> Genesis 45:4, \u201c\u2026\u201cI am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 5 But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> for God sent me before you to preserve life<\/span>. \u2026 7 And God sent me before you to preserve a posterity for you in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> 8 So now it was not you who sent me here, but God;<\/span>\u201d<\/strong>, Those who labor for the Lord are blessed and rewarded here and hereafter.<strong> Romans 8:28, \u201dAnd we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose\u201d. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Paul admonishes Timothy to endure as a soldier, race as an athlete and work hard as a farmer while facing challenges of life.

Long distance race as they call it is not short it is very long.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to run, it\u2019s another thing to run according to the rules. The marathon runners face tremendous challenges in their run, sometimes they run down a valley,\u00a0 up the mountain, under the scotching heat of the sun, on rocky grounds among other things. They are ready for the obstacles ahead, and they are aware of it but their thought is to finish the race. That calls for endurance. They don\u2019t allow themselves to be distracted on the way. They don\u2019t let life\u2019s challenges slow them down or even cause them to take an exit. They know where they started from and must finish the race despite the trying times.<\/p>\n<p>To run the race of life one does not break God\u2019s rules and get away with it. As the umpire of the game of life, God calls the fouls real close! Matthew Henry says,<em> \u201cWe are striving for mastery, to get the mastery of our lusts and corruptions, to excel in that which is good, but we cannot expect the prize, unless we observe the laws. In doing that which is good we must take care that we do it in a right manner that our good may not be evil spoken of.\u201d <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Hebrews 11 gives us the hero\u2019s of faith without hiding their scars and if you dig deep to find out how they made it, the word \u201cendurance\u201d was no stranger in their vocabulary. Part of their running according to the rules was to face trying times, even David said, \u201c<strong>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him from them all\u201d Psalm 119:71 (paraphrased),<\/strong> we are afflicted in this race by many things, but we endure.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">To cross the finish line is your sign of faithfulness and to get there may call for suffering.<\/span><\/strong> Timothy would have to comply with the ministry\u2019s \u201crules,\u201d which included the possibility of suffering, while promising a great reward.<strong> 1 Corinthians 9:24-27, \u201c<\/strong><strong>\ufeff<\/strong><strong>24<\/strong><strong>\ufeff<\/strong><strong> Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? <\/strong><strong>\ufeff<\/strong><strong>Run in such a way that you may <\/strong><strong>\ufeff<\/strong><strong>obtain it. <\/strong><strong>\ufeff<\/strong><strong>25<\/strong><strong>\ufeff<\/strong><strong> And everyone who competes for the prize <\/strong><strong>\ufeff\ufeff<\/strong><strong>is temperate in all things.

Our Lord Jesus used familiar pictures and subjects to bring out great truths and now Paul does the same with seven powerful portraits of the Christian life. I pick three for a reason. He likens a Christian life to a SOLDIER, an ATHLETE and a FARMER.<\/p>\n<p>I will share today on a Christian life as A SOLDIER. He says in vs. 2. \u201c<strong>You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ&#8221;<\/strong> . He does not share with him as a good recommendation but a command if he is to make it. He MUST endure hardship not as a soldier but a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Timothy\u2019s mission \u201cendurance\u201d, his call \u201ca good soldier\u201d, his commander in chief and General is none other than Jesus Christ. A soldier is one who has counted the cost,\u00a0 he is commissioned, and equipped for battle. A soldier is at war which\u00a0 may mean wounds and suffering. Paul did not ask Timothy to do something he hadn\u2019t done himself. He says, \u201c<strong>I have endured hardness, now you endure it with me.\u201d Pastors and leaders must lead the way (I Cor. 11:1)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To quote Matthew Henry the commentator, \u201c<em>All Christians, but especially ministers, are soldiers of Jesus Christ; they fight under His banner, in His cause, and against His enemies, for He is the captain of our salvation,<strong> Heb. 2:10.<\/strong> The soldiers of Jesus Christ must approve themselves good soldiers, faithful to their captain, resolute in His cause, and must not give over fighting until they are<strong> made more than conquerors, through Him that loved them, Rom. 8:37<\/strong>.. Those who would approve themselves good soldiers of Jesus Christ must endure hardness; that is, we must expect it and count upon it in this world, must endure and accustom ourselves to it, and bear it patiently when it comes, and not be moved by it from our integrity\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><sup>\ufeff<\/sup>\ufeffThe battle is serious and a soldier cannot be distracted by entanglements of business or family affairs Vs<strong> 4. \u201cNo one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier<\/strong>\u201d, I think here is where a number of believers get paralyzed, avoiding the fight. You don\u2019t want to think about what may happen to you, to your family if you fully commit yourself as a soldier knowing that you may be a casualty.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> A soldier is not one known by label but one who is equipped for battle<\/span><\/strong>. The great care of a soldier should be to please his general; so the great care of a Christian should be to please Christ, to approve ourselves to Him. The way to please Him who has chosen us to be soldiers is not to entangle (entrap) ourselves with the affairs of this life, but to be free from such entanglements that would hinder us in our holy warfare. Those who try to avoid the battles become immature, underdeveloped, malnourished, unprepared, and disoriented. Hard times in the battle grounds break them instead of enduring as a soldier of the Lord.\u00a0 A soldier will endure tremendous opposition everywhere (church, family work), in addition, he does not retreat or surrender when the going gets tough.<\/p>\n<p>As soldiers, \u201c<strong>35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 As it is written: \u201c For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.\u201d 37 Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. 38 For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, 39 nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Romans 8:35-39. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jesus said<strong>,\u00a0 \u201cThese things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\u201d John 16:33.<\/strong> Challenges will be there, there may be pain and suffering, and I may even have losses. The truth of the matter is, I\u2019m not fighting a losing battle. I\u2019m a soldier, in the army of the Lord. If I die, let me die as a soldier of the Lord in the battle field and on that day, He will have no trouble identifying me.\u00a0 Are you a soldier? Are you trying to a void the battle field? Are you entangled by the things of this world?<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> How prepared you are today may be your defining factor for tomorrow<\/span><\/strong>.

It\u2019s an exhortation for Timothy to stand strong in the face of insurmountable difficulties ahead. As the final writing of Paul, it is tender, sympathetic, tearful, and yet heroic and stately. Paul is preparing his young son Timothy for the perilous times as a believer, as a pastor, as a son, as a citizen, as a brother.<\/p>\n<p>Three times in 2 Timothy the note of suffering hardship is mentioned (1:8; 2:3; 4:5), indicating the need for Timothy\u2019s encouragement. Paul instructs Timothy to be a \u201cgood soldier of Christ Jesus\u201d (2:3). The whole tenor of the epistle is a note of encouragement and who better to encourage Timothy than an aged warrior who was about to die. Of all the people, I have read in the bible, I only know of Paul, who understood clearly what\u00a0 awaited\u00a0 him in the future for the sake of the call. Right at his conversion in Acts 9, we are told,<strong> \u201c15. But the Lord said to him, \u201cGo, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel. 16 For I will show him how many things he<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> must suffer<\/span> for My name\u2019s sake.\u201d <\/strong> The other well known person we know that bore the\u00a0 \u201cmust suffer\u201d was our Lord Jesus Christ. Paul was in God\u2019s will and suffering was part of God\u2019s sovereign plan for his life. God had a wonderful plan for Paul\u2019s life, listen to that plan, \u201c<strong>except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me.\u201d Acts 20:23<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Vehicles\u00a0 have shock absorbers for a reason, the makers prepared them for potholes they may encounter in the future. What do shock absorbers do, in a vehicle it reduces the effect of traveling over rough ground, leading to improved ride quality, and increase in comfort due to substantially reduced amplitude of disturbances. Without shock absorbers, the vehicle would have a bouncing ride. Have you ever driven on a highway or any road that was so smooth then out of nowhere you hit a pot hole? These are the reasons the vehicles have shock absorbers to prepare you and the car for what is to come hence reduce the impact and the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Paul had his shock absorbers on from day one, and here we see him helping Timothy get his own shock absorbers while also preparing others too.\u00a0 Paul accepted the call knowing what was a head of him.\u00a0 As \u201cMust suffer\u201d may not be for us, we know as believers, we are not exempt. We are praying and hoping that we don\u2019t but God\u2019s sovereign will must prevail for His own glory.\u00a0 I trust for change but if He has to take me through a different road, I ask for grace and strength to stand and endure. It&#8217;s hard to pray Thy will be done.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Those who can boldly pray Thy will be done are those who have already prayed Thy kingdom come<\/span><\/strong>. I ask for my shock absorbers for the potholes in this journey of\u00a0 life. On my own I\u2019m un able, I don\u2019t know how I would make it without His grace. In the next few devotions, I will pick out three things Paul encouraged Timothy with as he would face hardship in his journey ahead. Begin to seek God to prepare you for the days, years to come. The road may get bumpy, you may hit potholes with your job, family, marriage, children. I hope I\u2019m not scaring you, that\u2019s not my intention.

While listening, not always do all these things come to pass. We are sometimes promised things that Jesus never promised believers. We then come to another new year and the cycle of promises continues. With many episodes of things, we\u2019ve experienced as a family and no doubt you\u2019ve had your own experiences, do we ever sit and wonder whether we are fire proofed for the perilous times to come?<\/p>\n<p>Jesus warned of difficult days a head, read Matthew 24, for instance. To our shame as servants of the Lord, we\u2019ve prepped believers for blessings,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> but rarely have we taken time to prepare believers for difficult times ahead<\/span><\/strong>. If you\u2019ve realized, the world is not changing for better, it\u2019s getting worse and worse, getting darker and scary and as believers we had better get ready for those difficult times. Someone once said, \u201c<strong>tough times don\u2019t last, tough people do<\/strong>\u201d. While the difficult times may not spare His children, God is going to require His children to shine brighter in the midst of difficult times, and I believe that, unless His children prepare or are prepared for those times, many will crumble.<\/p>\n<p>In response to what we are facing, I came across a pamphlet that left me thinking about preparation for a snow storm. You know some of the good tips they give, they say begin by filling your cars with gasoline. This may save your life if you&#8217;re in your car and end up stuck in the snow. Keep a blanket, water, food, a little bit of sand and shovel in your car at all times, this will come in handy if you get stuck in the snow. Even if you can&#8217;t dig yourself out, the blanket, food and water will sustain you until help arrives. Charge the cell phone. You may lose home phone service during a snow storm, and you&#8217;ll need your cell phone battery charged to call for help in the event of an emergency. Go food shopping, get plenty of non-perishables ready-to-eat food, store water you will want one gallon of water per person per day. Get plenty of firewood! You&#8217;ll need dry firewood as a heat source in the event that you loose power during the snow storm. Some winter storms &#8211; ice storms, especially &#8211; can result in power outages that last days, sometimes more than a week!. You don&#8217;t need to prepare if there is no storm a head, but if there is, you owe it to your good senses to pay attention.<\/p>\n<p>To point out, these are more than good suggestions, they are preparation to make you comfortable in the storm to come (mark that I am not using the word happy). To be caught unaware and unprepared in the storm is deadly and so is being unprepared in our spiritual walk. While what I mentioned above are physical preparations, as a believer we need to be spiritually ready. We had better be like the 5 wise virgins who had oil in their lamps burning even at midnight when the groom arrived. We better be ready to have our lamps burning brighter in the midst of the storm, wind etc. to continue\u2026Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Timothy 2:1-13, vs. 3, &#8220;2 ..You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ&#8221; At the beginning of each year as I turn on Christian TV, I always hear things such as \u201cthis is the year of favor\u201d, \u201cGod has promised to do something spectacular in your life this new [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1685","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-rb","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1685","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1685"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1685\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1685"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1685"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1685"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1684,"date":"2010-03-11T20:50:38","date_gmt":"2010-03-11T15:20:38","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/03\/11\/what-are-you-made-of-3\/"},"modified":"2010-03-11T20:50:38","modified_gmt":"2010-03-11T15:20:38","slug":"what-are-you-made-of-3","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/03\/11\/what-are-you-made-of-3\/","title":{"rendered":"What Are You Made&nbsp;Of?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p><strong>Philippians 4:11, &#8220;&#8230;, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I always find it exciting when I discover something new.

Of course there are times I have had something for so long, limited its use because I did not know it could do more and I wondered why I didn\u2019t\u00a0 discover this ahead of time, I could have made use of it long time ago. We as Christians also know what we can do and are capable of but we do not stretch ourselves to our maximum potential.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">You and I cannot know what we are made of until we try things for ourselves<\/span><\/strong>. The reason why I have discovered more of what some gadgets could do was by trying. Yes there are times they broke but there are those times they worked even better and I rejoiced. We have people in our congregations that do not know what they are made of and for that reason,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> they have never learnt the art of trying things out to know what has been deposited in them or they have overlooked what they have and dismissed it as something of no use<\/span><\/strong>. David had no problem trying things out and learning what he was made of. He ran after the bear and killed it and so was the lion. Facing Goliath was nothing to him, he knew whose he belonged to therefore, he added faith to what he was about to do and stepped out to do it. That was his key to victory. This is the reason why I believe when he was being anointed the next king, there is no hint of him saying he did not feel able<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">. I believe it&#8217;s hard to unlock the hidden treasures without stepping out and trying them<\/span><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Paul writing to the Philippians in chapter 4 talks about their generosity towards him. The Philippians church was one of the churches that supported Paul&#8217;s ministry and right from the beginning; Paul had tried some things and learnt what he was made of. He had survived ship wrecks, had been stoned and left for dead, worked (made tents) and did ministry at the same time, he made long\u00a0 journeys, I believe at times he went without and this is what he unlocked in all that he dealt with, \u201c<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">contentment\u201d<\/span><\/strong>. Something he could not unlock unless he stepped out. He says, &#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I have learnt<\/span><\/strong>&#8221; not by sitting in class, or observing but by doing. He says, &#8220;<strong>12 I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 13 I can do all things through Christ] who strengthens me<\/strong>&#8220;. He had a tank of survival opened up when he was facing good times and tough times. Had he not tried and faced these things, for sure he would have not learnt. I know that God gives calling to His people and I also believe God reveals what you are made of as you step out. Stepping out allows you to unlock hidden mysteries He deposited in you. I am a witness to this, I never knew what I was made of until I began to exercise faith, stepped out, and did what I was supposed to do. This ministry was birthed in stepping out. I never knew God could use me with all my limitations but when I stepped out, I unlocked a tank of writing and putting messages together He had reserved for the right time. In stepping out by faith, I applied pressure to a container of treasures stored and pushed out what was stored in there. Shake a bottle of soda then try and open it and see pressure at work. Some of us need some shaking to produce pressure that will push out what is locked in us. In this ministry there are hidden treasures of preaching, teaching, parenting, leadership, encouragements etc inside of you that are yet to be unlocked, what are you doing to unlock what God has deposited in you? Do you know what you are made of? Christ in you, the hope of glory.\u00a0<strong> Don&#8217;t wait till you know (might take a while or not show up), step out and try that you may know. You will be amazed to learn something new about what you are made off.

God knows us better than we know ourselves and what we feel we are not able to do because of what we think of ourselves does not change His plan for our destiny.

He has said that He will provide all your needs; that He will deliver you from all your afflictions,&#8221; Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God delivers them from them all&#8221;.(Psalms 34:19); that He will not fail you; that He will heal, strengthen, protect, promote you; that He will never fail you or let you be a shamed; that if you call on Him He will answer and do to you great and mighty things you have not known or imagined (Jeremiah 33:1, 32:27). The list goes on. Are you aware of the specific promises for your specific problems and needs? Go to the Manual-the Bible and find out.<\/p>\n<p>2.)<strong> You have not claimed the promises<\/strong>. God&#8217;s promises are to be claimed. Just like you must present a check to the bank to claim promised cash, likewise you must identify God&#8217;s promise and claim it. He says, &#8220;Ask it shall be given you. You don&#8217;t ask, you don&#8217;t get.<\/p>\n<p>3.)<strong> You don&#8217;t believe the promise<\/strong>. Knowing and asking without believing the promise and trusting that God will honor the promise will not do you any good. A lot of people make a lot of claims in their prayers, but don&#8217;t believe what they are claiming is possible.<strong> If you don&#8217;t believe, you cannot receive. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>4.)<strong> You don&#8217;t wait for God to fulfill His promises His way in His time.<\/strong> Impatience can be very costly. Waiting is the hardest thing for many of us and impatience is one of the major hindrances to fulfillment to God&#8217;s promises.\u00a0 After you have claimed God&#8217;s promise, you better be prepared to wait until&#8230;.God cannot let you down. People will let you down but God will lift you up. Your circumstances will tear you a part but God will put your torn pieces\u00a0 together. You can never fail or falter if you make a claim that is good, acceptable and is perfect will of God, rest assured that God will fulfill His WORD. (Romans 12:1-2)<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are two very obvious observations you will make when reading your Bible, 1) that it is a book that has real life stories of men and women, families, nations, prophets, disciples, kings and rulers, young men and old men, who loved God with all their hearts and worshipped Him in truth and the Holy Ghost, but who were all greatly afflicted by all kinds of afflictions, 2) that is a Great Book full of God&#8217;s promises and\u00a0 that God faithfully fulfilled those promises in the lives of all those who claimed them in their afflictions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thriving on God&#8217;s Promises,<\/strong> God is a promise keeping God. What He promises you, He will do even when you are not faithful in keeping your promise to Him. The Bible is sacred book from your heavenly father. It is the source of God&#8217;s promises to you. From Genesis to Revelation, God declares, at times, solemnly what He will do without fail. One thing is sure, He has promised to deliver the righteous from, &#8220;all their afflictions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God delivers them from them all&#8221;.(Psalms 34:19)<\/p>\n<p>Rise up, study the promises, claim them, believe them, and wait upon God. Stand still and you will see the salvation of the Lord (Exodus 14:13) Rejoice for all things are yours for today, not tomorrow. It is your day of blessings.

We see Cain bringing fruit of the ground. Now the ground was cursed in Genesis 3 and here he is trying to make something for himself, in his own effort, and he brings it to the Lord (works). On the other hand, Abel offers to God \u201cthe firstborn of his flock and of their fat\u201d. He is offering to God what is from God, a lamb. God honored his sacrifice. Hebrews 11:4 gives us the reason God honored his sacrifice, he offered it by faith.\u00a0 His sacrifice by faith was counted to him as righteousness.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the saving faith that honors God a receiving from us what is from Him. What can we offer God on our own that is good enough? nothing. Hasn\u2019t the bible said already in<strong> Romans 3:20, \u201cTherefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight<\/strong>\u201d. That in as much as we offer to God the offering from the ground, something we have worked, what we are comfortable with, our accomplishments, it\u2019s never good enough. God requires a perfect sacrifice. To offer a sacrifice from the fruit of the ground is not to offer a perfect excellent sacrifice. We all fall short. We need to offer to God a perfect sacrifice and He is the only One who can give that perfect sacrifice. And He did, He gave His Only begotten Son to suffer and die for our sins. And by repentance and faith, we can offer to God Christ (the firstborn (position), first fruit) who offered Himself as the Lamb, the blood sacrifice to\u00a0 save us.<strong> Revelation 1:4-6, \u201c4 \u2026Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, 5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth.

Living for God is much harder than dying for God in my opinion. When you think you\u2019ve mastered Christianity, like Isaiah you are confronted with the Holiness of God that reduces you to nothing. And with one voice you cry out to God, \u201cbe merciful to me a sinner\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, Achan and his family with his belongings were stoned. You may ask, why destroy others who do not appear to have sinned? I think they participated in hiding the accursed things. It started with Achan who brought his family into it and brought about destruction. Not too long ago I was told of a believer who promised to leave his wife if she wouldn\u2019t abort her baby. And because she did not want to be abandoned, she aborted, taking a life. Oh how we would not take accursed things and lead others to be part of what we may do and destroy their lives too. It\u2019s not easy to go down alone but we have to be careful not to destroy other people\u2019s lives especially those whom we love. This puts more fear in me to walk a walk worthy of God.<\/p>\n<p>Achan\u2019s personal sin in taking of the accursed thing brought about the deaths of thirty-six innocent Israelite soldiers. Perhaps the most terrifying thing about sin is that there is no such thing as private sin. All sin affects others; the personal sin of Achan kindled the anger of God against Israel. The personal sin of believers always affects the church at large. Every sin involves society; and since each of us makes up society, every sin affects us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Vs 25, \u201cThen Joshua said to Achan, \u201cWhy have you brought trouble on us?

Therefore he who rejects<em> this<\/em> does not reject man, but God, who has also given us His Holy Spirit.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would like to share with you each this morning about God\u2019s call for each of our lives.\u00a0 Many Christians today run about to try and decipher what God\u2019s call is for their life. They go to conferences, they read books, and they even ask for prayer, when all the while it has been spelled out quite plainly for us, here by the Apostle Paul, we are called to holiness. Holiness is a divine attribute, it is THE divine attribute. If you look at Leviticus 11:44-45, God himself states that He is holy, and that we too ought to be holy. I believe all of God\u2019s invisible attributes are summed up in holiness.\u00a0 Holiness is shunned by most today, for it comes at a great cost, it will cost you your life, your identity, your reputation, and maybe your friends, but it is to be most desired for it is commanded of us by our God, and to truly love him is to keep His commands, and be assured, it is as much a command as \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d Important to note here is that this is not merely an outward holiness. Reading the Bible, going to church, praying, and evangelizing do not make a man holy. It is one\u2019s heart made pure by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, becoming as Hebrews states, \u201c<strong>partakers of HIS holiness.<\/strong>\u201d We truly become<strong> HOLY AS HE IS HOLY<\/strong>, partakers of His divine nature. And this transformation comes as we allow God to chasten us, willingly yielding ourselves to Him, being passed through the refining fire, that all the impurities of the carnal nature may be removed. There is a deeper cleansing that God desires to do in each of us, for it is His will for each of us is that we would be sanctified (I Thessalonians 4:3), which means to be set apart and made holy. And, as Paul states in our text, to reject this call is not to reject men, but it is to reject the very command of God, who has given us His Holy Spirit, the promise of the Father, sent to dwell in the hearts of men, to make them pure, and keep them pure. For years I only felt that I could go so far in Christ, like I was always hitting this wall, then falling back a bit, then hitting the wall again, and so on and so forth. Then one day God began to speak to places in my heart through a very dear friend that He never had before. I started to see things I had never seen before that lived in me. Secret spiritual pride, the fear of men, an unteachable spirit, all these things dwelt deep within me, and as I began to see myself in God\u2019s eyes, I began to see who I really was, and I was undone, and it was at this place that God\u2019s true and lasting work in my life began. He removed from me all of these things, and filled my heart with perfect love for Him alone, and He desires that each would possess what Charles Wesley sang about, a \u201cheart to praise my God, a heart from sin set FREE,\u201d So the question is extended to each one, will you heed this call? Will you give up control of your life? Will you lay aside whatever it is you are doing, will you shut off the TV or the movie, and by faith seek God and the baptism of his Holy Spirit? Ephesians 1:4 says that God chose us, those who would believe on Him by faith,<strong> \u201cbefore the foundation of the world to be holy and without blame before Him in love.<\/strong>\u201d I Peter 1:3 tells us that<strong> \u201cHis divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness<\/strong>,\u201d God has given us everything we need, we just need to give ourselves entirely to Him, nothing held back, and allow Him to show us our hearts, we must die to our opinion of ourselves, that we might \u201c<strong>reckon ourselves dead indeed unto sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord<\/strong>\u201d presenting ourselves as \u201c<strong>slaves of righteousness for holiness<\/strong>.\u201d Lastly, in<strong> Romans 12:1 Paul writes we are to \u201cpresent your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.\u201d<\/strong> To give ourselves wholly to Him is our reasonable service, it is the least we can do.<strong> Matthew 23:19 says it is the \u201caltar that sanctifies the gift.\u201d<\/strong> Christ is the altar, we are the gift. We lay our lives down upon the merits of His sacrifice, and he purifies us, He gives us worth, never the other way around.<strong> Without Him we are nothing<\/strong>.

This was the time to prove to everyone that indeed there was sin in the camp and God was not looking for an excuse not to bless the Israelites or punish them for nothing. God delights in those who come clean, a broken heart and a contrite spirit, such He will not deny (Psalm 51). God\u2019s glory will only be reflected back to Him when the life of God\u2019s servant is cleared of guilt. Bishop Patrick(not sure of his last name) quotes the Samaritan chronicle, making Joshua to say here to Achan,<strong> Lift up thy eyes to the king of heaven and earth, and acknowledge that nothing can be hidden from Him who knoweth the greatest secrets.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Vs 20, \u201cAnd Achan answered Joshua and said, \u201cIndeed <\/strong><strong>\ufeff<\/strong><strong>I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and this is what I have done:<sup> <\/sup><\/strong><strong><sup>\ufeff<\/sup><\/strong><strong><sup>21<\/sup><\/strong><strong><sup>\ufeff<\/sup><\/strong><strong> When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> I <\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">coveted them and took them<\/span><\/strong><strong>.

They all boil down to, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life.<\/p>\n<p>Sin begins with innocent sight, degenerates into lustful desire or covetousness, and falls from there into participation.

Look at God\u2019s promises to him,<strong> Joshua 1:3, every place that sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, as I said to Moses, vs. 5. No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you. vs. 6 be strong and of good courage, vs. 13 the Lord your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land\u201d.<\/strong> What an assurance. He was now ready to lead God\u2019s people who assured him to follow God\u2019s commands given to them. Earlier it was the people that drove Moses to sin; he was tired of their complaint which led him to disobey God. An episode like this was bound to repeat itself under the leadership of Joshua if he was not careful. You can either be living in sin and miss being in God\u2019s will or have people drive you to sin as they did with Moses, ultimately, you are still the one held responsible.<\/p>\n<p>Here we find that although it was Achan who took the accursed thing, the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel. As Paul regards the Corinthian church to have been polluted by the presence of one single offender 1 Cor 5:2, 6, 7, so all of Israel is polluted by the offense of one named Achan. Could it be possible that if we know that someone is living in sin and we keep quiet and confronts them, we are enabling their sin while disabling God\u2019s\u00a0 blessings upon us?\u00a0 For example people taking the name of the Lord in vain, even using it as a curse word but you say nothing.<\/p>\n<p>Look at what happened, right after victory in Jericho, the Israelites move to Ai which was a small city with few people. Those who spied Ai said<strong> vs. 3 Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai.<\/strong> They had strategy; God was on their side as they hoped and if God was for and with them, who could be against them Romans 8:31. If they were going to gain victory, God would have to go before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as pillar of fire. But because of the sin in the camp, God did not go with them. And here we see how a small city defeated the Israelites. The Israelite forces must have been in shock. Their hearts melted, not because of cowardice, but because the strong hand of the Lord, upon which they relied, had apparently been removed from them. Sometimes you are not aware that the presence of the Lord has departed until you find yourself living in defeat. Remember Samson who toyed with sin and when he woke up to go after the enemy did not even know that the presence of God had departed?<\/p>\n<p>This is a very valuable lesson to learn, when you find yourself living in defeat, you want to ask yourself, has the presence of the Lord departed? And if so, is there sin currently present in your life that you have not dealt with or sin in the camp that has not been dealt with. We can be tempted in the midst of victory but to live in victory,<strong> 1John 5:4<\/strong> says,<strong> \u201cFor whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world our faith<\/strong>\u201d. Christ in us is the victory we need. As long as He is present we are overcomers. Our plans and strategies without him will fail miserably and sin disables His presence and\u00a0 hands upon us.

Commitment is a struggle to a number of people, commitment to God, marriage, relationship, family, job, church, etc it requires work, effort, struggle to mention a few. I believe that the reason why certain desires are not fulfilled or delayed is because the Lord would bring them to those who are ready to commit.\u00a0 Some have to be prepared for that desire before they can be entrusted with it.<strong> The bible says commit your ways to the Lord<\/strong>,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> if we can commit our ways to Him, we can commit ourselves to the desire<\/span><\/strong>. And just the same way when we commit ourselves to the Lord it requires work, the same way the desires of our heart will require work.<strong> Proverbs 3:5, &#8220;Trust in the Lord with all<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> thine heart<\/span> and lean not on thy own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path&#8221;,<\/strong> trusting in the Lord with all our hearts requires commitment to prayers, reading His word, fasting, witnessing, ministering and even reaching out. Those are not easy tasks for they involve surrender, humility, obedience, meekness etc. The secret to receiving God&#8217;s direction for your life and mine is being willing to surrender to His will, trusting in Him that He may bring it to pass. When God began to build a desire in me to begin devotion ministry, I knew that it would require work. The first thing was to commit my ways to the Lord and then He fulfilled the desire, but now I have to work hard to maintain that desire and that means many times forgoing certain things to keep the desire alive. I have to pray, fast, read, wake up early to prepare devotions, hear and respond to people simply because I have committed myself to the desire. I am committed to doing this and so whatever it takes, I have purposed in my heart to do it and the more I have committed myself to it, the more the Lord has been gracious to lead, strengthen , bless , encourage\u00a0 and teach me.\u00a0 The joy of being able to commit yourself to a desire allows Psalm 37:6 to come in handy for it says<strong> &#8220;He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, And your justice as the noonday&#8221;.<\/strong> This will cause you to shine and people will see that but they will not know that behind that light, you have committed yourself to the Lord. TO<strong> him that much is given, much is expected<\/strong>.<strong> Proverbs 16:3, &#8220;Commit your works to the Lord, and your thoughts shall be established&#8221;.<\/strong> I am committed to bringing to God my ways and my thoughts that I may entrust Him with them everyday.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Psalm 37:7&amp;8, &#8220;Rest in the Lord, wait patiently for Him&#8230; vs. 8, &#8220;Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; do not fret &#8211; it only causes harm&#8221;.<\/strong> What a blessing to rest in the Lord and patiently wait for Him. All I needed to do was commit myself to bringing my ways and thoughts to Him, the moment I have done that, my worries are over and now I can rest. Resting is the state of having peace inside knowing that someone has control over the situation. Someone once said,<strong> God will ask you to push a rock but he does not expect you to move it<\/strong>. The part of pushing is being obedient to His word and being committed to doing it and when you have done your part, let Him do His. Let us wait patiently for Him and not look to any side and see who has made it and who has not for our desires does not come based on someone else\u2019s success or failures, it&#8217;s based on delighting ourselves in the Lord, committing, and trusting in Him alone. Do not be angry or stretched out because someone is a head of you, praise God for them and trust God for your desire. Also don&#8217;t be angry when someone else is moving to greater levels, at times you don&#8217;t know what they have done or gone through to get to\u00a0 where they are. Some it took many tears, going without, waking up in the cold hours of the night to seek God; some gave up on great things to gain greater things. All that you are seeing is the result but beneath that victory and success, someone was committed to going an extra mile to get where they&#8217;ve got. All I have to do is find out what they did to get to where they got and I will do the same to achieve the desires of my heart. There is a song that was written<strong> &#8220;God will do for you what He has done for others&#8221;,<\/strong> that is true but<strong> God will not do for you what He has done for others until you have done what others have done to get where they&#8217;ve got.<\/strong> The method maybe the same but the results can be different.<\/p>\n<p>So ask yourself this question, are you willing to commit yourself to a desire before and after to work hard to maintain it according to God&#8217;s ways? Don&#8217;t desire what you are not willing to work for.

After dreaming of the promised land for 40 years and tasting victory in Jericho, Israel faces a stunning defeat at Ai which brings Joshua to question things. We will find out why they were defeated when they should have been gaining victory upon victory.<\/p>\n<p>While they were destroying Jericho, a special instructions went out to the people,<strong> Joshua 6:18, \u201cAnd you, <\/strong><strong>\ufeff\ufeffby<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> all means<\/span> abstain from the<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> accursed<\/span> things, lest you become<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> accursed<\/span> when you take of the accursed things, and<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> make the camp of Israel a curse<\/span>, <\/strong><strong>\ufeff\ufeffand trouble it<\/strong>\u201d, look at the word used \u201caccursed\u201d which is different from \u201ccursed\u201d. The Hebrew word translated \u201caccursed\u201d means to \u201cban\u201d or \u201cdevote. To make the verse clear, Israel was not to take anything from the city of Jericho, for it had been<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> banned<\/span> by God; and its destruction was devoted as a monument to the omnipotence of Jehovah, the God of Israel.\u00a0 There were exceptions for a reason to that ban reflected in\u00a0<strong>vs. 19, \u201c\u2026all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated to the Lord; they <\/strong><strong>\ufeff\ufeffshall come into the treasury of the Lord<\/strong>.\u201d This was a serious violation. Greater victory depended on their obedience to God\u2019s instructions. The beginning of chapter 7 tells us of a man by the\u00a0name of Achan who took accursed things and the anger of the Lord burned against Israel.<\/p>\n<p>This story will show us how when the things of God are violated, it brings\u00a0about the anger of the Lord. Our prayer always ought to be, \u201cLord teach us to fear you more\u201d, the bible says in<strong> Proverbs 9:10, \u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\u201d.<\/strong> Where there is no fear of the Lord, people take those things that God has banned and they store it in their lives while hoping that God will continue to bless and keep them.\u00a0 I believe there are people who are sick right now because they have welcomed things accursed by God in their lives and are unwilling to deal with them. Hatred, rage, unforgiveness,<strong> Matthew 6:14, \u201cFor if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses\u201d<\/strong>.\u00a0 Resentments, jealousies, covetousness etc. Living lifestyles accursed by the Lord insisting to keep living that way while hoping and praying the Lord would overlook it and bless you anyway. It could also be something you are into secretly you hope no one finds out. Yes, you are praying and even have people praying for you like crazy but there is no victory in your life for you have harbored accursed things. Not only is the thing affecting you, it is affecting those around you (family, friends, church). A husband may be praying for victory but not gaining it because he has accursed attitude toward his wife. He has refused to honor his wife God\u2019s way, listen to<strong> 1Peter 3:7, \u201cHusbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> your prayers may not be hindered<\/span><\/strong>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Paul gives unexhausted list of accursed things that makes people miss God\u2019s kingdom and God\u2019s blessings,<strong> Galatians 5:19, \u201c19 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> heresies<\/span>, 21 envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> who practice<\/span> such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.\u201d,<\/strong> What are you trusting God for?

Some people tend to add salt to this wound you&#8217;ve created. Instead of it healing, you inflict more pain to it. You just can&#8217;t see living any way better than the way you already know about yourself. Everything God wants to do in your life is assassinated by what you think of yourself. When you have been in a condition for way to long, there is a tendency to throw in the towel and conclude that maybe you were meant to be in this situation forever. Maybe healing and deliverance was not part of God&#8217;s plan for your life. If you are dealing with &#8220;maybe&#8221;, maybe you need to ask yourself, what were you saved from and for? If you don&#8217;t understand this well, I guarantee you a defeated life.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve often said that if we&#8217;ve been saved by God through faith, we ought to identify with our newly birth. The new man ought to assassinate the old man. The new man needs to understand that the God of heaven had a plan for his life from day one. Jacob operated on what they named him, manipulating his way in life. If anything, he did not see himself being anything different than what he already knew about himself. When God is getting ready to use you, be sure of His dealing with the old man. In the case of Jacob, God asks him his name and what does he tell God, &#8220;Jacob&#8221;, which means surplanter, deceiver, and conman if I may add. Here comes God ready to use him but He starts dealing with the old man &#8220;Jacob&#8221; molding him to a new man &#8220;Israel&#8221;. He struggled with God and men and the bible said he prevailed. If the negative energy was turned into positive energy, how cool will that be? Paul&#8217;s strength, teachings, and eloquent speech were turned around by God to be used for His glory after pulling Paul from using these wonderful gifts for evil. Of course we can tell that Jacob was not a quitter, he was a hard worker knew what he desired and went for it. God was about to use these strengths for His glory. At the beginning he was living a lie because of what they called him but when God appeared to him, God showed him who he really was and He called him to be a &#8220;Prince&#8221;. He identified him with his new birth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Just to be clear, I am not talking about positive thinking, I&#8217;m talking about heavenly living<\/strong>. I am talking about knowing that regardless of your past life and even present situations, you are His own. The blessings He brings in your life are not a result of what you can do but what He can do. I quote this scripture with confidence,<strong> 2Timothy 1:12&#8243;&#8230;for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day<\/strong>&#8220;. I believe this report over someone&#8217;s report and mine; I know whom I have believed. I keep killing what he is doing because I speak negative things in my life but let the truth be known.<strong> If I continue to believe a lie, eventually I will live a lie<\/strong>. The devil might accuse me of something I did, and sure he may be right but I am not trusting in myself to be what I should be, I am trusting in God who knows what He can do in my life. Why are you living in the \u201cyesterday\u201d when God is telling you to live in the \u201ctoday?\u201d Your prayer is about what could have happened instead of what can happen now. Rise up today and live like a prince (princess) because you are no longer living a lie. Take this dose and live fully<strong> Philippians 4:8, &#8220;Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy&#8211;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">meditate on these things<\/span><\/strong>&#8220;.

If you see someone faithfully walking with the Lord it&#8217;s not because it&#8217;s easier for them than anyone else, it&#8217;s because they are determined to walk with the Lord faithfully. It&#8217;s in the process of walking with the Lord you realize that His<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">ways are not your ways and His thoughts are not your thoughts, that as high as the heavens is from the earth so are His thoughts and His ways (Paraphrased).<\/span><\/strong><\/span> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">This teaches you not to think and deal with God the way you and I would with someone else. Learning His ways and not our ways eliminates frustrations. A thousand years is like a minute to God therefore when you pray and God says wait a minute, it may mean, wait for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">To wait on God is to stop dictating God when and how He should do things and let Him be God in your situation.

Let&#8217;s break it down, &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">I waited<\/span><\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;, this deals with time, His timing and not mine.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Ecclesiastes 3:11, &#8220;He has made everything beautiful in its time<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;, Learn God&#8217;s time.

You are not ready to progress with God without patience as part of God&#8217;s process in your life. That\u2019 is what patience is all about.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;For the Lord<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;, the reason behind the waiting. David learnt that everything he had desired of the Lord depended on waiting patiently for the Lord to come through for him and because he mastered it, God turned and heard his cry. Abraham needed to go through the same process, in the middle he felt impatient and tried to answer his own prayer by bringing Ishmael. He felt time was running out of time in relation to how he looked at himself. You know the rest of the story. Think of bringing an Ishmael, God is thinking of bringing an Isaac, the true blessing He has promised his servant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Last week I celebrated yet another birthday. My birthday week has always been special in the sense I take time to pray and fast, reflecting back where I have come from and trusting God\u2019s leading for the new year. I see how praying and waiting patiently for the Lord to move in different areas has yielded fruits. There are some areas when I look back it felt like I missed my Isaac (true blessing). Nothing was coming forth and thought of settling for Ishmael (man made promise) was very strong. For example, I patiently waited for 8 years to meet and marry the woman of my dreams. It wasn&#8217;t the easiest thing to do, at times I felt like I had missed God&#8217;s will for my life in that area, at times I felt like I wasn&#8217;t doing something right. Days of discouragements were there but I held on to His word waiting for His timing without doubting His love and ability. In His time He blessed me with Judy (we\u2019ve been married now 3 \u00bd years). I am thankful to God I waited for His true blessing. I know I don&#8217;t deserve the best but I always desired the best, God knows how to give the best, I patiently wait for the best. Those who are desiring to meet someone and settle down, don&#8217;t give up patiently waiting on God. Don&#8217;t doubt His love and ability and most definitely, don&#8217;t settle for an Ishmael when God has designed an Isaac for you. One is a true blessing from the Lord, the other is a false blessing made by man. What God gives, He blesses. A final thought, <\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">It&#8217;s not that the Lord is preparing the blessing for you, the blessing is ready, you are the one who needs preparation for the blessing, that is the difference.\u00a0 That requires patiently waiting.

Our patience is tested while on traffic; check out lines at the stores, at an entrance gate for a game and many more. We struggle with patience because we would rather be the ones in front of everyone else, which makes us selfish if you think about it. In as much as you would like to be the one in the front, the person in the front also deserves a chance. Then it all comes back to &#8220;it&#8217;s about me&#8221; (just an input but not the direction for the message today).<\/p>\n<p>The word &#8220;patience&#8221; appears 33 times only in the NT if you read KJV and God is referred in Romans 15:5 as the God of patience. Would we say that the generation after the OT struggled with patience? I would say so. In OT, Moses, David, Abraham, Jacob, Isaac, Esther, Jeremiah, David, Naomi and others endured with patience to see God\u2019s promises to them happen. Some did not see those promises come to pass in their lifetime yet at a distance, they embraced them.<\/p>\n<p>The writer of Hebrews (not known) reminded believers including himself to run with patience the race set before them (us). Sometime back while watching the Olympics marathon, it was a 26-mile race that many turned out to run.. If you know marathon, it is the kind of race that requires proper practice\/preparation, patience and endurance. It took the winner 2hrs 05 Mins to complete the race. As I was watching it, there were times the runners were running on plain ground, at times up a hill and in the hot sun, which made them slow down at times. The person who was at one point leading was pushed off his truck by one of the spectators. It did affect his speed and left him shaken but he would not quit the race. They were all running with patience, grabbing water to quench their thirst and cool them down. They were looking forward to the finish line. To some it did not matter if they were not first on the finish line, all that mattered was that they finished the race.<\/p>\n<p>Our race with and in Christ is no different, it requires patience and endurance. It is a long journey but we are getting closer and closer to the finish line<strong> Romans 13:11, &#8220;&#8230;for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed<\/strong>&#8220;. Our finish line is Jesus, we look to Him. You know of those who you started the race with Christ, some quit running and some reduced their speed tremendously but you have continued to run the race with your eyes fixed on Jesus. You and I are like the marathon runners running a race with endurance. Jesus ran His race here on earth with patience and a beautiful example is the process of His crucifixion. He could have just had someone spear Him to death and still He would have died for mankind but the bible says, &#8220;<strong>Christ must suffer<\/strong>&#8220;, that is patience and endurance there. Paul went through patience and endurance facing difficult times yet he would not quit why? because His eyes were fixed on Jesus the author and the finisher of his faith. Did he finish his marathon race even after all that? Yes, he did<strong> 2 Timothy 4:7, &#8220;I have fought the good fight,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> I have finished the race<\/span>, I have kept the faith.\u201d\u00a0 Despite the battles, he fought a good fight; despite the obstacles, he finished the race; despite the trials, he kept the faith<\/strong> and that is what I am looking forward to. It&#8217;s about being faithful till the end. I know of those times when this race gets so hard, so tiring, obstacles, barriers, trials and just like the rest, the feeling of quitting presents itself, the enemy keeps reminding you to quit. Didn&#8217;t He whisper the same to Jesus? All I know is that I am getting closer and closer as I run the race with patience.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> I am far from where I started and I am closer to where I am going<\/span>. If I can just hang on a little while and keep looking to the One who can give me strength to finish the race, I will join Paul and many saints who finished the race with joy. We ought to be persevering saints, let us keep running.

The other thing is to know the history of something and misjudge what it is capable of by looking at its history.<\/p>\n<p>It is fascinating to know that Jesus was referred to as Jesus of Nazareth. The King of kings was not even born in an earthly kingdom though He qualified. He was raised up in a normal town called Nazareth the home of Joseph and Mary.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see\u00a0\u00a0 in the Old Testament where they mention Nazareth is mentioned until you get to the gospels, I could be wrong. Tying the pieces together as to how Nazareth would have been, it was no place for a King maybe because it had no class or the people had no great fear of God. And to think that the person who would come out of it and call Himself the King was non other than Joseph&#8217;s son, a carpenter.<\/p>\n<p>Philip finds Nathanael and he gives him the good news<strong> vs. 45, &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote&#8211;Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&#8221;<\/strong> Would you be excited if you heard that the person you grew up with or watched their life style could become someone extra ordinary? I would dismiss that too. When you know someone in and out and knowing where they came from, it can be hard to see far beyond because you have already dismissed them. Even today and I am guilty of this too, I look at some people I know and dismiss what they can do. Ladies can look at men and dismiss them as not being good husbands (husband material); the same can happen to men. You look at a child who is growing up and all you see is disaster and your comments include something like, &#8220;you will never amount to anything&#8221;, you have already dismissed anything they could be.<strong> We have to be very careful not to dismiss people and things based on the little knowledge or information we have<\/strong>.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> As mentioned, one little tiny piece of information is enough to change the destination of what you see.<\/span><\/strong> Nathanael could not see anything good coming out of an ordinary place even after Phillip told him and it is because he did not have a tiny piece of information to complete the puzzle. Are we not like Nazareth where Christ would come out of? Instead of sitting on the throne, He has chosen to dwell in our hearts (Nazareth). He came right where we were in Nazareth to redeem us<strong>.<\/strong> He has chosen to be born in our hearts (Nazareth) the ordinary city. Did you ever think that one day you would be saved?

You were dismissed because the piece, &#8220;<strong>Christ in you<\/strong>&#8221; was not seen and because of that.<strong> Philippians 4:13, &#8220;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me<\/strong>&#8221; could not be seen either.

And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money;] take that and give it to them for Me and you.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I hate being in debt, and I believe everyone does too. I do not like owing anyone,<strong> Romans 13:8, says, &#8220;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Owe no man any thing,<\/span> but to love one another:&#8221;<\/strong> To me this is a clear indication that even God hates to see His children in debt. That is why he had to do something about our debt of sin, the reason we pray<strong> Matthew 6:12, &#8220;Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors&#8221;(NIV).<\/strong> Who in their right mind would want to owe someone else? And yet we find that we are debtors to other people. The most common debt of our day is financial debt. We owe the credit card companies, car payments, appliances, accumulated electrical and gas bills to mention a few. I believe with all my heart that debt can be a disease that needs to be cured before it destroys a Christian. Some bring this disease upon themselves being careless and misusing the resources God has provided for them and to some, life circumstances has brought them there.<\/p>\n<p>In Matthew 17, it happened that Peter and Jesus owed the temple taxes. The bible says the wealth of the wicked is stored for God&#8217;s children right? How come Jesus knowing about this still was liable for taxes? Doesn\u2019t the bible say, &#8220;<strong>the earth is the Lord&#8217;s and the fullness of it<\/strong>?&#8221;, This is to our learning. Yes we are the children of God and God provides for us but He will not let us ignore our responsibility to others (government, companies, those we owe).<\/p>\n<p>Jesus turns to Peter and says, &#8220;<strong>&#8220;\u2026.go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you.\u201d<\/strong> Here is what got me, instead of Jesus calling money into existence and Peter could use to pay taxes, He gives him an instruction that is mind blowing. Backing up to Mathew 15, Jesus fed 4,000 with seven loaves of bread and few little fish. Why couldn&#8217;t He perform a miracle right there to clear up this debt? Why is it that we have Christians in debt who do not want to do anything about it? They are sitting and doing nothing hoping that God will perform a miracle right before their eyes and their debts will disappear. I know God can and we know of some people who have experienced it but we cannot limit God to one method of helping us deal with our problems. Isn&#8217;t it clear that if we owe, we should find a way to pay it back? And our prayer is<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Lord provide away<\/span><\/strong>, we want to owe man nothing? Jesus provides and Peter had a job to do and here is what he had to do, GO, CAST, TAKE, OPEN, FIND, GIVE. God can provide away for you to minimize or clear up your debt, not by calling money into existence but by leading you places to fish. He can provide by creating more work that would require overtime if they pay overtime. You may be required to take a part time job because that is what he has set a side as a way to provide for you. You have to go an extra mile with His help. Peter had to do the same, yes Jesus provided yet in a way Peter&#8217;s other abilities were required.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Now Jesus did not ask Peter to do an impossible task because He already took care of that<\/span><\/strong>, He asked him to do what He knew He could give him strength to perform. What are you doing to pay your debts? Are you praying, Lord provide away then going an extra mile to fulfill what He has provided or are you doing nothing, less or just enough hoping it will go away. If you pray Lord provide away, don&#8217;t be surprised to hear GO, CAST, TAKE, OPEN, FIND, GIVE.

Many people are victims of painful circumstances, frustrations, defeat, depression, confusion, worry, disappointment, failure, and losses, physical and emotional sicknesses etc. because of making incorrect and ungodly choices or decisions for their lives.<\/p>\n<p>What is God\u2019s recommendation? Note the word \u201crecommendation\u201d. God does not impose His will on anyone. He gives us His view, insight to His plans and His word to guide us in making choices. He also expects us to correctly, intelligently, and adequately use our mind to think and reason with Him about every choice or decision we are about to make regarding all areas of our life (Isaiah 1:18). Listen, for example, to what he says in the Bible, regarding making choices and reasoning:<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cThis day I call heaven and earth as a witness against you that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curses, now choose life, so that you and your children may live and that you may love the Lord your God, listen to His voice, and hold fast to Him. For the Lord is your life and He will give you many years in the land\u2026<\/strong>\u201d Deuteronomy 30:19 (NIV)<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cCome now, let us (you and God) reason together,\u201d says the Lord\u2026If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good from the land; but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.\u201d For the mouth of the Lord has spoken<\/strong>\u201d. Isaiah 1:18-19 (NIV)<\/p>\n<p>These and several verses in the Bible clearly indicate and confirm that knowledge, reasoning and obedience to his voice, are paramount for making decisions and choices that conform to his will and ensures our blessings.<\/p>\n<p>How then can we avoid confusing our wishes with His will? How can we avoid conflict between our wish and His will? How can we escape the temptation of conforming to the world\u2019s standards instead of being transformed by the renewing of our mind by the word of God so we can meet God\u2019s standards?<\/p>\n<p>In life, whenever we are making any choices, we are either choosing God\u2019s will or our wish. That is how life is set to operate. It is unfortunate that many people, including Christians, because of their ignorance due to lack of proper teaching and understanding the meaning of the will of God, do miss God\u2019s best. In addition, confusion and error in judgment are major contributors to missing God\u2019s will.<\/p>\n<p>We operate on wishes most of the time. God operates on His will at all times. We keep a wish list. God keeps a will list. Often, we express our wishes and in some cases insist on them when trusting God to provide for our need. But God insist on His will; it is His will that He approves and appropriates in the lives of His children. Nothing less!<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c Insisting on getting your wishes is a sure guarantee of missing God\u2019s will, for God may grant or permit a wish, without approving of it, for He approves and affirms His will only\u201d.<em> <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Why then do we often insist on our wishes? Why is it that often we let our wishes override the will of God? Why is it that when God\u2019s will conflicts with ours, we choose and insist on our wishes? Why do we find it hard to say \u201cThy will be done\u201d when God cannot give us our wishes? Why is it that we sometimes insist on having our preference and not God\u2019s provision? If God is all knowing and is the supplier of all our needs, why is it\u00a0 that we refuse, arrogantly, at times, to listen to God\u2019s truth and be convinced so we can accept God\u2019s will? How, then, can one know His will? Why do we often insist on our wishes so we can please ourselves and others instead of accepting God\u2019s will so we can please him, first, and then ourselves? Pray that God will help you know and walk in His will. God bless you.

If anything, He takes time to do things. Whatever He is doing is not just for today and tomorrow, He is doing it for days to come. He is building His people who will stand through time. I am amazed at how some Christians want things yesterday. They get saved today, tomorrow they are dying to be on talk show teaching everyone how to get saved. Many are anxious to be recognized and entrusted with positions and when it does not happen within their time frame, they get angry and leave. In church if their talents are not recognized, they change churches. Such people do not make it long with God. Why?\u00a0 They want God to fit in their schedule and that is not going to happen, either you are in His program or you are alone.<\/p>\n<p>Genesis dedicates about 12 chapters on the life of Joseph. It is a vital story that relates to the life of a believer. From the time Joseph receives his dream to the time the dream is fulfilled takes a great deal of process.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> We shout over the end results but forget that there is a process<\/span><\/strong>. When you understand that there is a process, you ready yourself for it.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> If you want to live a meaningful life, your goal should be large enough to serve as a challenge<\/span><\/strong>.<strong> Your greatest responsibility is however to do the will of God in the circumstance in which He has placed you as His representative<\/strong>. Whatever you have to accomplish has to have a beginning, you cannot jump to the result without starting from somewhere. Someone once said, &#8220;<strong>A journey of ten thousand miles begins with a step<\/strong>.\u201d Joseph rejoiced over his end result, even shared it with his family and we all know how it was not received well. God Almighty in His own wisdom knew that this armature would\u00a0 need work to maintain that dream and develop a character that will keep him even after the dream was fulfilled.<strong> I see that God&#8217;s main thing in our lives is not so much to deliver us out of situations or give us what we desire, He is in the business of building characters<\/strong>. Character causes one to live in any kind of situations and still shine while in it. Their character changes not with time or positions, it remains intact. Patience is an ingredient that should not miss in a believer&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>James 1:4, &#8220;But let patience have its perfect work.\u201d<\/strong> James (Jesus half brother) tells us to\u00a0 let patience do it&#8217;s thing; we cannot dictate it, push it, or work it up. It goes in it&#8217;s own pace. With patience expect obstacles, barriers, setbacks, walls, and delays. Let it perfect your character through each step, that\u2019s its job. Joseph had his share of struggles, and it wasn&#8217;t even clear if the dream would come to pass because of the turn of events but yet he persevered.<strong> His responsibility was to persevere in every stage, patience was building his character and God was orchestrating His destiny.<\/strong> David and Job had different experiences that required a lot of patience, God built their characters. &#8220;&#8230;<strong>that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing&#8221;.<\/strong> Perfecting something means taking time to work on it, at times things may not go as expected but you stick with it. This is what God is doing with His children, taking them through a process of perfection and completion leaving them lacking nothing. Joseph, David and Job took the class and we read about\u00a0 their later life, they lacked nothing character wise. If you are frustrated with God because of what He has not done, check to see if you are growing in patience, see how your character is affected by it. When God delays promises, it&#8217;s not because the promise needed time to be made, it&#8217;s because the person whom He made the promise for was not ready for it. In short,<strong> the problem is not with God but with us<\/strong>. There are so many things that I have prayed to God about and now I see why they have not come, I don&#8217;t have enough character to support the results yet. I am letting patience do its work,\u00a0 I don&#8217;t want to mess the blessings God will send my way because I had no character. I\u2019m checking in with Dr patience, I need work. I am a patient of patience, what about you?.

I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness<\/strong> (Psalm 84:10).<strong> Also as the Pslamist said,\u00a0 \u201cOne<em> thing<\/em> I have desired of the Lord, That will I seek:<em> That I may<sup> f<\/sup>dwell in the house of the Lord All the days of my life<\/em>, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To behold the<sup> 2<\/sup>beauty of the Lord, And to inquire in His temple (27:4).\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The ultimate tent dweller however is Jesus.\u00a0 John writes,<strong> \u201c<sup>14 s<\/sup>And the Word<sup> t<\/sup>became<sup> u<\/sup>flesh and dwelt among us, and<sup> v<\/sup>we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,<sup> w<\/sup>full of grace and truth.<\/strong> When John wrote that Christ \u201cdwelt among us\u201d it literally means &#8220;to pitch a tabernacle,&#8221; or &#8220;live in a tent.&#8221;\u00a0 Deity put on the humanity, and became like us, yet without sin, to reach those dwelling in tents of sin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1 Tim 3:16 reads, \u201cGod was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jesus planted his tent among us that He would glorify the Father by coming to reach you and I in our sin.\u00a0 Thank the Lord for this reality, for otherwise we would dwell in a tent headed for Hell.\u00a0<strong> \u201c<sup> r<\/sup>Do you not know that you are the temple of God and<em> that<\/em> the Spirit of God dwells in you?<sup> 17<\/sup> If anyone<sup> 2<\/sup>defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him.

tents in Christ and walk by faith, not by sight, moving where the Lord see\u2019s fit for our lives and not simply where we see fit.\u00a0 Our tents must be hidden in Christ.<\/p>\n<p>SO WHAT:\u00a0 Examine your life, and look for any areas that display that you have planted your tent in areas that are not pleasing to the One that planted His tent among us.\u00a0 May you build an altar before the

as far as Sodom (Genesis 13:12).\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many people say that we are a product of our environment.\u00a0 It would seem that there is some truth if this is taken as a principle and not as an absolute truth.\u00a0 We know this because God can take a life that has been influenced by evil all around, and transform that life into something He can glorify Himself through.<\/p>\n<p>Abram prior to having his name changed to Abraham had been called out of Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the Land of Canaan.\u00a0 Abram was traveling with his nephew Lot, and at some point in their travels together, a problem arose.\u00a0 The place where this took place was called Bethel, which was an ancient place and seat of worship in Ephraim on border of Benjamin, identified with Luz (former name).\u00a0 The name Bethel in Hebrew means \u201chouse of God.\u201d\u00a0<strong> Genesis 13:6-7 reads, \u201c Now the land was not able to support them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together.<sup> 7<\/sup> And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram\u2019s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot\u2019s livestock.\u201d<\/strong> Something had to be done about this problem, so Abram made a decision which would involve separating from his nephew Lot, and parting ways.\u00a0 \u201c<strong>So Abram said to Lot, \u2018Please let there be no strife between you and me, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we<em> are<\/em> brethren.<sup> 9<\/sup><em> Is<\/em> not the whole land before you? Please separate from me. If<em> you take<\/em> the left, then I will go to the right; or, if<em> you go<\/em> to the right, then I will go to the left.\u201d<\/strong> This seemed to be a very diplomatic and loving approach to the problem on the part of Abram. It seems that he allowed Lot to make the first choice of where he desired to dwell.\u00a0 The Bible states that \u201cLot lifted up his eyes and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of the Lord,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> like the land of Egypt<\/span><\/strong> as you go toward Zoar.\u201d\u00a0 Egypt was a prosperous land, but it was also an idolatrous land, full of polytheistic worship, hence they did not worship the one true God.\u00a0 Abraham and Lot lived in the city of Ur (Gen. 11:28, 31) at the height of its splendor. The city was a prosperous center of religion and industry. The Babylonians worshiped many gods, but the moon god Sin was supreme. Accordingly, the city of Ur was a kind of theocracy centered in the moon deity (New Nelson\u2019s Illustrated Bible Dictionary).\u201d\u00a0 It would seem that Lot was taken out of Ur, but Ur wasn\u2019t taken out of Lot, and perhaps this is a strong reason why he looked to a place similar to the one he left.\u00a0 Lot \u201c<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">pitched his tent even as far as Sodom<\/span><\/strong>.\u00a0 But the men of Sodom were<strong><em> exceedingly<\/em> wicked and sinful against the Lord<\/strong>.\u201d\u00a0 Paul wrote, \u201c<sup>33<\/sup> Do not be deceived: \u201c<strong><em>Evil company corrupts good habits<\/em><\/strong> (1 Cor. 15:33).\u00a0 Furthermore he writes, \u201c<strong><sup>16 r<\/sup>Do you not know that you are the temple of God and<em> that<\/em> the Spirit of God dwells in you?<\/strong>\u201d\u00a0 It would seem that Lot pitched his tent (both literally and spiritually) near evil, and his life and his family would certainly be affected by his decision to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Lot would eventually be confronted with the issues of homosexuality, lust, drunkenness, incest, the death of his wife, and the destruction of the land (Sodom) he lived in.\u00a0 It matters where one plants one\u2019s tent.\u00a0 I would compare Lot to the foolish man that built his house upon the sand (Matt 7:26-27).\u00a0 John writes,<strong><sup> 19<\/sup> And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and<em> men loved darkness rather than light<\/em>, because their deeds were evil (John 3:19)<\/strong>. Furthermore he states, \u201c<strong><sup>1<\/sup><\/strong><sup>5<\/sup> Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<sup> 16<\/sup> For all that is in the world\u2014the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions\u2014is not from the Father but is from the world.<sup> 17<\/sup> And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.\u00a0 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand.

Moreover, if we are going to have a glorious marriage, then we need to have more than just knowledge, we need wisdom to apply the knowledge. God laid in my heart back in November to pray for more wisdom in my life. I have been doing it since then because I need it.<\/p>\n<p>What is wisdom?<strong> \u201cGood sense shown in a way of thinking, or action. The ability to make sensible decisions and judgments based on personal knowledge and experien<\/strong>ce. Wisdom discerns and directs on application.\u00a0 People mess things up because they are unable to discern (examine, evaluate, understand and approach with wisdom), in<strong> Proverbs 9:10,<\/strong> we are told,<strong> \u201cThe fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding\u201d.<\/strong> I am amazed at some believers I have met who have zeal but little or no wisdom. They wreck good things because they do not know how to handle it. See how we are told, the fear of the Lord is the \u201cbeginning\u201d, it is just a start to gain wisdom, and as we walk and are led of Him, we gain more wisdom that is helpful to us in life.<\/p>\n<p>It is by wisdom as one of the ingredients that a marriage grows. By it we learn our role, our position in our God given marriage. How we treat each other, how we manage family affairs, finances, assets, balancing ministry, and marriage among others are going to depend on how we apply wisdom. It\u2019s\u00a0<strong> \u201cThrough wisdom a house is built, And by understanding it is established\u201d Proverbs 24:3<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Paul says, \u201c<strong>be very careful, then, how you live\u2014not as unwise but as wise<\/strong>\u201d, lack of wisdom has wrecked a number of marriages. I have heard of cases where a husband confessed that he was the one who wrecked his marriage. He wanted to do good things even had the knowledge but lacked wisdom to pull it through. We have to be very careful how we live and how we treat those we live with.<\/p>\n<p>You can say the right thing but without wisdom it may come out wrong in your tone or presentation. You need to ask yourself, what you want to say, will it come out as disrespectful, demeaning or unloving? We need wisdom in communicating. Are you applying wisdom in how you spend what God gives you? Are you applying wisdom in balancing your work and marriage? You could be working hard to provide excellent living for your family and nothing wrong with that, the question is, \u201care you out of balance\u201d? neglecting your time with your spouse?. Have you fallen on this trap many believers fall on; too busy serving the Lord, sacrificing your marriage for the sake of your ministry?. Be wise, your marriage is your number one ministry. If you are involved in ministry right now and your marriage is suffering, I would ask you to quit the ministry and go and work on your marriage first. By wisdom, you will know who your enemy is, your spouse is not your enemy. By wisdom you will defend your spouse and not put him or her down. By wisdom you will know who to hang out with knowing there are threats to your marriage, what I would call parasites (that drain you and your marriage), the parasites could be friends or family members. By wisdom, you will not allow those little foxes to devour what is good.

How many times can you recall fighting on Sunday morning or some other times and you did not feel like being nice to each other that day, you go to church fighting all the way and then nice to each other to show other people things are ok between you.<\/p>\n<p>Read what Paul addressing as signs of a person walking in the light 9 (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all<strong> goodness<\/strong>,<strong> righteousness<\/strong>, and<strong> truth.<\/strong> How do you walk in the light before your spouse, show<strong> GOODNESS.<\/strong> Goodness here is, moral excellence, benevolence in thought, word, and deed. Husband, if you are looking at things online you should not, entertaining lustful thoughts, you are not walking in the light before God and your spouse. We need pure thoughts, looking out for God\u2019s daughters who He gave us to care for. We will one day give an account as to how we treated His daughters. So let us thrive to walk in the light without covering things or stone walling. If you are struggling, share with your spouse, be naked and not a shamed (be real). Part of your freedom comes about by being real. Let us be thoughtful in word and deed. Give each other a reason to look forward to coming home, a place where words of encouragements, helping each with responsibilities, leaving kind notes, complimenting, lay down your lives to each other. Be a light unto the young ones who are growing up, neighbors, family members, a demonstration of a glorious marriage ordained by God.<\/p>\n<p>Life of<strong> RIGHTEOUSNESS<\/strong> is a life of moral integrity and rightness as God sees it and in relation to man. There are some who are living double lives, not people of their word, living in dishonesty and are not in right standing with God. God will not anoint lies neither will He bless a life that is not real. To walk in the light is to get your act together. God put you in that marriage to refine you and conform you into His image. This is a learning and stretching ground, which will drive you to honor your spouse by living a life that is pleasing to God. A life of integrity, a life of character. If you were asked to do a presentation, would you not put additional effort to work hard to bring the best? How is this not different with marriage, I have a responsibility as a husband to be the best God wants me to be, I have to work hard, learn, grow because someone\u2019s life is in my care. Will that not drive me to live righteously?<\/p>\n<p>To walk in the light is to live in<strong> TRUTH<\/strong>, what is truth?, moral reality, honesty, sincerity, and straightforwardness, as opposed to all that is false. How many times do I hear couples say they do not trust each other? Insecurities, spying on each other, always trying to investigate. Where there is no honesty, sincerity or straightforwardness, marriage suffers. Where there is no agreement how will two walks they agree. ?Leaving a truthful life is a challenge but it brings about freedom and unity. We can have glorious marriages when we walk in the light of goodness, righteousness and truth. Examine yourself today, where are you? Are you walking in love and light? Pray to God, let Him show you areas you have compromised, how you have treated your spouse<strong> James 5:16, \u201cConfess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed.

People we look up to, people who set up standards that serves as a challenge to get us to the next level. We see it in the bible days, Joshua had a mentor Moses whom he looked up to until the torch was passed over to him. We see also with Elijah and Elisha, the bible describes Elisha as the prophet who washed Elijah&#8217;s hand. When Elijah called him to follow him, he kissed everything goodbye including the family business he was running to follow Elijah across the country washing his hands and cooking his meals. If that is not enough, we see it again with Naomi and Ruth, we see how Naomi&#8217;s life influences Ruth&#8217;s that she is inspired to follow her wherever she went. &#8220;Your people shall be my people, your God shall be my God, wherever you will die, I will die there too&#8221;, she says. Last but not least we also see it with Paul and Timothy.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you but if I did not have some kind of mentor in my life, I would not be where I am spiritually and even ministry wise. Some did not know that they inspired me until much later when I mentioned to them. Why mentor? If you do not have someone around that challenges you spiritually, or in any other areas, it&#8217;s easy to loose your edge the reason being that when you don&#8217;t see anything more than what you already have you might feel you have attained it all. I remember when I got saved and then five years later lead into the ministry of intercession, my dad was a huge inspiration without him even knowing in the line of prayers, he has always prayed effectively, earnestly and powerfully. When it came to beginning to preach, I was inspired by one youth pastor back then who has since moved to other positions. I told God that if my youth pastor could preach, I could preach too if He anointed me to do so. I have been preaching since then. God used Pastor Phil to challenge me to reach the lost on the streets, been doing it since then (about 8-9years now). I always struggled to do memory verses until I got inspired and rebuked by someone&#8217;s life. He did not tell me or encourage me to do it, the way he memorized verses inspired me to ask God for grace and strength to do it. I believe that there are people who come our way we may not be close to but their life style will cause us to want more. I&#8217;m not talking about competition or jealousy, I believe God put such people around us to awaken us by reminding us there is more. If God never allowed me \u00a0to come across these people may be I would still be stagnant never knowing there is more I can ask God to do in my life for His glory.<\/p>\n<p>My point today is that it&#8217;s good to have certain people come our way, we may not know them or even be close to them but something in their lives will give us an appetite to call on God for more. When Moses died, Joshua took over for he had learnt a lot from Moses and so did Elisha from Elijah, Ruth from Naomi and Timothy from Paul. To close, there are people who God will also bring in our lives who are inspired and challenged by us. Let me share with you about one of my best friends. He was once upon a time, a drug addict, sold drugs, was involved in drive by shootings, arrested about 15 times to mention a few. When he got saved, a few weeks later I was introduced to him and we began to hang out, teaching him the things of God, building his faith. \u00a0One time he shared with me how he desired to know how to pray effectively and so I invited him to my prayer nights to come listen and be part of it. Being that he was a new believer, I thought my prayer nights would drive him away. But, he came faithfully, listened to me pray every week and not long after, he started praying little by little. Today he is a prayer warrior, the youth pastor at my church, he preaches in jails and soon he will be opening a troubled teen center. I was his best man, my friend is Pastor Paul. Be an example of believers in every place God sets you, you never know who is taking notes and praying that they will be raised like you are. I believe only you can limit what God can do in your life. God will&#8217;s by bringing people your way, then waits for you to respond.

We would have a boy play father, a girl play mother; the kids who were a little younger would play the children. We did an excellent job as we tried to imitate what we would see our parents do, how they treated each other, children, responsibilities. We never had a script to act out of, we played along off memories.<\/p>\n<p>Early chapters of Ephesians all the way to chapter 5 prepares us believers. Teaching us how we ought to live. I believe part of it prepares us to be better in our marriages. When you come to chapter 5, there are three things addressed I believe are key ingredients to a glorious marriage<strong> 1. Walking in love 2. Walking in the light 3. walking in wisdom<\/strong>. The first thing Paul tells us in vs.<strong>1 Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. 2 And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma\u201d,<\/strong> Unless you are daily cultivating a vertical relationship with the Father of love who teaches you and I what love is, how can you love another person. This is why many girls who never had a father figure in the home find it hard to pick a good husband because they never saw it acted at home. They never had a chance of learning what it means to truly be loved, unconditional love so the world gives them their own version of love. The same for boys who never saw and felt what it means to be loved and in turn learn to give love. How would he do It? We are told to be imitators of God, that vertical relationship is what will drive us to better our horizontal love relationship to our spouses. In remembering how we played games imitating our parents, it later played in life on how I chose and relate to my wife. How do we imitate God, vs. 2 tells us,<strong> Walk in love<\/strong>, walking in love means more than saying \u201cI love you\u201d or having warm feelings. Christ loved us and demonstrated that love by giving us Himself as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling aroma. This is sacrificial love<\/p>\n<p>Christ did not give Himself to those who deserved it, He gave Himself because He chose to love us and He did it to the glory of God. If marriage to you is a means to an end, brace yourself for more disappointments for the person you are married to is far from perfection and need work themselves and God will work on you in the process too. The Christian in this case the spouse has no greater calling or purpose than that of imitating Christ our Lord. Christ laid down His life for His bride even when she did not deserve it. This is the kind of love that keeps marriage strong, self sacrificing love that goes beyond faults and weaknesses and looking at the person you are married to and saying something like this, \u201cif Christ has loved you even when you did not deserve it, I will love you because the love of Christ dwells in me\u201d, \u201cI will imitate Christ\u201d<\/p>\n<p>How do we strengthen this love? By protecting it from things that want to diminish in it vs. 3 tells us to put away immorality\/adultery (lust), greed, filthiness, foolish talks or coarse joking, deception and give place to thanksgiving which brings about contentment. You have limited growth trying it be what the spouse God wants you to be in your marriage unless daily you commune with Him. You cannot deal and resist the things that want to diminish love unless you are constantly cultivating your vertical relationship. Be in the word, be in prayer and imitate Christ in your marriage.

Hence the statement \u201cyou don\u2019t know my wife,\u201d should be an extreme positive and not a negative. Solomon writes of the futility of life, and hence because it is here today and gone tomorrow, one should rejoice in one\u2019s marriage, instead of being depressed in one\u2019s marriage if marriage is done God\u2019s way.\u00a0 Solomon shares the following points in how one can rejoice in marriage:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Live       Joyfully<\/span><\/strong>.\u00a0 This speaks of being full of Joy (JOY-FULLY). Joy       is the fruit of being in the presence of the Lord (Psalm 16:11).\u00a0       Paul writes of the fruit of the Spirit one of which is JOY (Gal.       5:22).\u00a0 The popular question had been \u201care you living a purpose       driven life,\u201d however I think the better question is, \u201cAre you living a       \u201cpresence driven life.\u201d\u00a0 When two people in a marriage are both       spending time in the Lord\u2019s presence all that needs to be done is to       bring all that JOY together, to live joyfully. Are you and your wife       spending DAILY time in His presence?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Relate with Joy together<\/span><\/strong>.\u00a0 The key word here is \u201cWITH\u201d.\u00a0 God\u2019s desire for marriage is that not only do both husband and wife spend time in the presence of the Lord thus creating a dovetail of like-mindedness, but husbands are privileged to do this WITH their very best friend.\u00a0 I heard an acronym for J.O.Y., which stood for<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> J<\/span><\/strong>esus<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> O<\/span><\/strong>thers<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Y<\/span><\/strong>ou!\u00a0 Jesus must come first, others, in this case your wife is second on the top of the others list, and you are last but not forgotten.\u00a0<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Love Your Wife<\/span><\/strong>. Why did you get married?\u00a0 People have many reasons, and many which are selfish. Paul however tells us in Ephesians 5,<strong> \u201cHusbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her<\/strong>.\u201d\u00a0 In the Garden of Eden Eve ate the fruit and therefore deserved to die.\u00a0 God, \u201cAdam I have to kill her.\u201d Adam replied, \u201cNo God, please take my life instead.\u00a0 I will die in her place\u201d Now of course the account didn\u2019t really lay out this way with the first Adam, but it did with the second Adam. Christ gave His life for His beloved bride, and modeled what men are to do for their wives. Jesus said,<strong> \u201cNo greater love is there than this, that a man lay his life down for his friends<\/strong>.\u201d\u00a0 Men, our wives are to be our very best friend, and therefore in one word we are to show them love through SACRIFICE!<\/p>\n<p>When one lives<strong> JOYFULLY<\/strong>, relates<strong> WITH<\/strong> joy<strong> together<\/strong>, and<strong> loves SACRIFICIALLY<\/strong>, the principle remains that one can live a full life with ones\u2019 life marked by JOY IN MARRIAGE!\u00a0<strong> Now go live with His Joy in your marriage, it\u2019s really possible!<\/strong> Blessings Pastor Phil`<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201cEnjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun\u2014all your meaningless days.

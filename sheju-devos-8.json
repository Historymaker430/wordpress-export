The Lord shall fight for you, and you shall hold your peace\u201d. Exodus 14: 13-14<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">I want to bring to your attention, today, that life is not easy, and that your life is and will be full of trouble. No matter who you are or where you are, you will encounter moments and experiences that will leave you not knowing what to do. Have you ever said to yourself in the face of a problem or situation, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do\u201d? I have, many times. We each face times when our life is filled with fear, doubts, confusion, hopelessness, sorrow, pain, anxiety and uncertainty, exhaustion and desperation, distress and depression, and a lot more than I can catalogue here. Sometimes, we are surrounded by pain and perplexity. In addition, we wonder whether life if still what it used to be or should be. We sometimes question the love of God and even, accuse him for negligence. We sometimes ask questions like<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> \u201cWhy has God allowed this to happen to me?\u2019 or \u201cWhat I have done or not done to deserve this?\u201d or \u201cWhy cant I be successful or be blessed with this or that, like other people or my friends?\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Whatever your questions are or may be, I don\u2019t have an answer, but I want to remind you or make you aware of a few facts of life that you need to know and live by, and give you some recommendation of what to do to overcome, be blessed and stay blessed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">One, understand and accept that life is full of trouble and that as a man (human being) born of woman, all your days on earth, you will face and deal with trouble. Job, one of the patriarchs of faith, who faced more problems than you can imagine understood and accepted that fact positively. Here is what he said:<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u201cMan that is born of woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down: He fleeth also as a shadow, and continues not\u201d. Job 14: 1-2.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Two, understand that no effort of your own will deliver you. You need God to save you. When Israel faced the impossible Red Sea and didn\u2019t know what to do, God, alone, intervened and instructed them what to do. He said,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u201cDon\u2019t move. Do not cry or try to fight. Stand still and see My salvation<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u201d. That is what they needed to do. They needed to stop crying, complaining or blaming everyone else, but themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Three, understand and accept that no one&#8217;s got an easy ride in this life.\u00a0 Everyone has their own share of trials, challenges or trouble. Yours is not unique nor are they special. They are only different. Even Jesus had His, and at one point wished, He could escape one of the worst and most painful experiences of His life, when He was dying on the Cross,\u00a0 He felt lonely. He could not bear or endure the pain, alone. He cried<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u201c\u2026My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\u201d (Mathew 27: 46).<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">God, His Father, strengthened Him to go through that pain.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">It was His exit to recapture eternal glory<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. May be, today, you are resisting and fighting something that could be your last exit to a brand new day of victory, peace, hope, prosperity and pleasure, in the Lord. Stop fighting and stand still, instead, let go and let God. Don\u2019t just fold your hands passively, doing nothing. Stand still in prayer, faith, hope, love, and perseverance. Listen to His instruction, and do His will. Not yours. Do your<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u201cWill Alignment\u201d<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">today. Align your will to His. If you don\u2019t, you will wobble, shake, veer off the road and you may be very dangerous to yourself and others, who are around you and who depend on you or look up to you. Stand still. Will you? God will surely visit you and bring you up, and out. <\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Blessings Boaz<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201c\u2026And Moses said unto the people, Fear not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will show to you today: for the Egyptians (your enemies who are pursuing after you) whom you have seen today, you shall see them again no more forever.

I see everyday how it is impossible to live in this cruel world without having God on my side. Everyday when I pray I continuously tell God that without Him, I am doomed. I look around and see many people who need the hand of God yet they do not want to admit it. Healing, deliverance, peace, joy, provisions and the like are the things people need everyday but who can provide them apart from God?<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">King Jehoshaphat, mark the word<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">King<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> at one point needed the hand of God in his life and so were the people he was leading as they faced three powerful Kingdoms coming against them. This was not a war initiated by King Jehoshaphat yet here it was. Ultimately his next move was to call on God for help when no one was around to give a helping hand. Psalms 46:1 always comes in mind when one is going through something and no one can help,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u201cGod is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble\u201d.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> There is power in prayer as it gives God permission to move in one&#8217;s life. So the king proclaims a prayer and fast all over his kingdom, adding fast to their prayer showed how desperate they needed God&#8217;s answer. Whenever we desperately need God&#8217;s hand in our lives, you may be moved to add fasting into your prayers. Those who are craving for God\u2019s move will do desperate things, they will seek him fervently, earnestly, boldly, persevering, lingering etc<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">How amazing it is to hear the Lord say you don&#8217;t need to fight in a battle that is scheduled for you. A word comes from above telling them not to be afraid or dismayed because the battle is the Lord&#8217;s. I&#8217;m learning<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">when I let go, He takes my hand and gently leads me and He lets me know how peaceful my life can be because He fights for me<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. The only times I fight the battles is when He promises me that His presence will be with me in the battlefield. When He tells me to stand still, it&#8217;s time to let go. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, Be still and know that I am God. Many people are not willing to let go because they don&#8217;t trust that if they let go this, they can get that and so they hold on to step one. Let go today that He may get you to step two. As the Lord fought for them, they praised Him. It\u2019s good to bring a request before the Lord, but while you are in the waiting mode, find in your heart to thank Him in advance, praise Him like it\u2019s already been done.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">What the Lord approves, it\u2019s done even before anyone sees the results.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> Those who are not praising and thanking God open themselves to worrying as they constantly check to see if the Lord has already done it or not. As for these people, while they were praising and thanking God, they did not see how the Lord destroyed the enemies, all they saw was the result. At times I just need to get lost in praising and thanking Him and after it has been said and done, all I will need to do is see the results. After their enemies were destroyed, the king and his people marched to the battle ground and gathered the possessions of the enemy. They were more than conquerors that day because God conquered for them. They only desired victory over the enemy but the Lord gave them more than they asked for,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Ephesians 3:20, \u201cNow unto Him who is able to do exceeding, abundantly above all we ask or imagine according to the power that works within us\u201d<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. You asked for little, He is giving you much for He is the God of abundance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">When we have called Him and it\u2019s done, we will all be glad that we involved Him in our business for<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">it is not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the Lord of host<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Call Him in your situation today and choose this day to let go of everything you are holding onto as He is in control when things are out of control.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">When the enemy comes to you like a flood, the Lord will raise up a standard against him. When he shows you of what he is capable of, show him\u00a0 what God is capable of and remind him of his future.

If someone is to approach and ask you to let go, you stand there wondering if they really understand what the other person did to you. This is dealing with someone who has crossed the line. I am talking about forgiveness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Based on the dictionary definition,<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">forgiveness is an act of excusing a mistake or offense<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. It\u2019s not very easy to walk to someone and excuse them when they have wronged you. At one point it was a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye. In other words, you received back what you gave. But we are living at a time\u00a0 where we have an awesome opportunity to pardon why? because over and over again in the bible, we hear men going before God seeking forgiveness for sinning against God. vs. 14<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">, &#8220;For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you\u2019<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. Trespass is to enter onto another\u2019s land wrongfully, so when we are offended, we see that someone has entered into our land wrongfully and has committed an offense. Such a person deserves to be brought to justice. Here is something that caught me, Jesus said,<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u2018forgive men their trespasses\u2019<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">which means that instead of bringing that person to the courts to accuse them of their offences against you, settle the issue out of court by forgiving them. No need to accuse them before God over what they did, all you need is to forgive even as your Father in heaven is always ready to forgive you. Many times we hold people so high thinking they will never fail us but the truth is, man has issues and we all have to learn not to put our confidence in man. Jesus said, \u2018it\u2019s impossible for offences not to come\u2019, the more they come, the more we ought to learn the art of forgiveness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">There are people who cannot progress until they have let go of what they are holding onto.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">You could have been wronged; your key to release is to forgive<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">This means that the one who owes you an apology is the one you owe forgiveness<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">You are in debt as long as you are still holding onto unforgiveness, therefore until you let it go, you still owe it<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. You will not get that release until you pay that debt by releasing it. It\u2019s not about deserving to be forgiven but about pleasing the Lord by forgiving. Isn\u2019t it amazing that the Lord will not accept our worship and sacrifices until we have forgiven?, and that the Lord will not forgive us if we are not willing to forgive?. We don\u2019t deserve His forgiveness, yet He forgives us and forgets. You\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">I will forgive you but not forget\u2019<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">, the Lord forgives and forgets. No one will ever wrong us the way we wrong the Lord, yet He is always faithful to forgive us. One thing about forgiveness is that when you let it go, a whole big load is lifted off you and your burden is lightened.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Matthew 6:12,&#8221; And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtor\u2019<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">, Lord forgive us as we are in the process of forgiving those who owe us an apology. Who has wronged you, are you waiting for them to apologize before you can forgive them? Are you determined not to forgive them? have you purposed to forgive and not forget? The bible says, \u2018<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">blessed are the peacemakers\u2019,<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">it may not be easy but they vote for it by making peace with everyone so be one.

There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">What do you see the world recognizes?\u00a0 Money, Fame, Power, Prestige, Talent, etc<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Batang;\">\u2026<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.\u00a0\u00a0 What are some of the things that you have been recognized for in your life?\u00a0 Are they awards you\u2019ve won, degrees you earned, positions you\u2019ve raised too, a certain financial status that you\u2019ve obtained?\u00a0\u00a0 We must realize that what we value, and what the world recognizes is certainly NOT the same as what God recognizes.\u00a0 Sure almost everyone appreciates recognition for things they have done, but it\u2019s an entirely different ball game when the God of heaven looks upon your life and measures it from his perfect perspective, which is vastly different from yours, perhaps even offensive to you.\u00a0 God is not recognizing Bill Gates in heaven because of a huge earthly success and the plethora of money that he earned.\u00a0 Yes, he worked hard, and did a lot of good with his products and software which most of us are probably using right now to read this devotion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Yet in Job\u2019s day and time, he himself was the Bill Gates.\u00a0 Let me explain how this I know so from a preacher that I heard on the radio although I forget his name, his word opened my eyes even further to this man called Job. He lost all his sheep &#8211; Sheep were used to make clothing at that time to which Job had more than anyone.\u00a0 When fire fell from heaven, HIS WHOLE CLOTHING LINE, before GAP, Tommy Hilfiger, Sean John, etc.., was gone.\u00a0 He lost all his camels when the Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on his camels and carried them off. Camels were used to take long journeys.\u00a0 Job\u2019s TAXI CAB SERVICE WAS DESTROYED! A mighty desert wind then came in and caused the house to collapse were his sons and daughters were abiding.\u00a0 THERE WENT HIS CHILDREN! And if that was not enough, Satan then afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.\u00a0\u00a0 Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.\u00a0 JOB\u2019S BODY WAS IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN.\u00a0 This only added insult to injury or perhaps better said injury to insult. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Yet with all that Job had that God had blessed him with, God honored Job\u2019s character not even mentioning his great wealth that he had when He spoke to Satan.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what God pointed out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">1 &#8211; There is no one like him in all the earth.\u00a0 Job was many notches above the rest.\u00a0 When put under a microscope his life shows what no other life can show.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">2 &#8211; He is blameless and upright.\u00a0 No one can find any dirt, deception, deceit, jealousy, pride, or crooked ways in his life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">3 &#8211; A man who fears God.\u00a0 Job recognized that God was in charge and he so reverenced the Lord NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to worship God when everything is hunky-dory (great), but to fall to the ground in worship and say:\u00a0\u00a0 &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Naked I came from my mother&#8217;s womb, and naked I will depart.

A few verses that lead to verse 13 paints a different picture, and leads us to understand it&#8217;s proper application if we were to use it. Listen to Paul<\/span><span style=\"font-family:SimSun;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">s words 11-13,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;Not that I speak in regards to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound.

When you can be content with the little and trust God right where you are, be calm while others are freaking out; learn to be full and be hungry, learn to keep your coolness under frustrations, learning to share the little you have, learning to let go of things others struggle to hold on to. In short being able to deal, to stand, and be comfortable right where you are and not allow the challenges to destroy you because of Him who strengthens you.

They depend on each other, without one, the other would be dead.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Psalm 85:10, &#8220;Love and faithfulness meet together..&#8221; They are patterned and woven together into each other. They have kissed and bonded to become one.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">I would not waste time talking about &#8220;love&#8221; because if we can master &#8220;faithfulness&#8221;, we would have mastered &#8220;love&#8221;. Let&#8217;s take the word &#8220;FAITHFULNESS&#8221; and break it into two parts, &#8220;FAITH&#8221; and &#8220;FULLNESS&#8221;. The bible defines faith<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">&#8220;as the assurance (the confirmation) of the things [we] hope for, being the proof of things [we] do not see and the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses (Hebrews 11:1 AMP)<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">. In a relationship, it&#8217;s taking what you see as falling and failing and believing that it&#8217;s not always bound to be the same forever therefore laboring to keep it alive and better. You don&#8217;t expect to give up on it when the going gets tough, you keep seeing something good far beyond the natural and reality. The other aspect of faith is &#8220;LOYALTY&#8221;, a choice made by an individual to keep a promise (a vow) he or she made.\u00a0 &#8220;FULLNESS&#8221; is to complete, to give it maximum attention it needs. Give faith a 100% with no doubt of mind and I would term that &#8220;FAITHFULNESS&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">One of the things killing marriages today is lack of faithfulness.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Faithfulness is the cornerstone of a relationship<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">. If I was to ask couples today what they would consider the most important\u00a0 thing in their marriage, I bet they would tell me &#8220;FAITHFULNESS&#8221;. Why not love, kindness, respect, support etc as first? It&#8217;s because all these are centered around the word &#8220;FAITHFULNESS&#8221;.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Faithfulness involves loving your partner in ways that meet his or her needs<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">. You will love because you are faithful, you will support because you are faithful and you will be kind because you are faithful. Faithfulness implies duty. Faithfulness begins as a choice, the reason<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Proverbs 3:3<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">, tells us not to &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">&#8220;. It&#8217;s the essence of a good Godly blessed marriage (relationship). We can choose to let it leave us by our words and actions. A husband or wife can feel safe knowing their spouse is faithful<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">. Proverbs 20:28 &#8220;Love and faithfulness keep a king (queen) safe; through love his (her)\u00a0 throne is made secure&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Husbands are kings of their home (throne) and wives are the queens of their home (throne), their aim is to love and be faithful to each other to keep their kingdom safe and secure. If the kingdom is not safe and secure, expect intruders which leads to unfaithfulness. How many have fell on that trap because their kingdoms were not secured by love and faithfulness? Faithfulness (trustworthy) is very fragile, once broken it&#8217;s hard to mend it.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">The best ways you demonstrate your faithfulness today will build bridges of trust for a life time<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">. Being trustworthy is keeping your word. Don&#8217;t let love and faithfulness leave you if you want you marriage (relationship) to grow and flourish.

Thereafter I refine that elephant to bring to a completion what I had in mind when I thought of making it&#8221;. I have read somewhere that \u201cleaders are not born but are made&#8221;. One of our mission statements at church is to raise leaders. Leaders are few because we have so many followers. In as much as so many people don&#8217;t feel they are leaders or have the qualities of leadership in them, what they need is to have everything chopped off them that does not make them look like a leader and what they will be left with is what they need to be one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">I believe that all of us have qualities of leadership. It may not be for a big corporation or group but a leader just over a person. What will take for that to happen is first determining who you are, where you are, where you want to go. Getting into conditions that will boost you to your destination. To bring a mental picture, look at an egg, if a chicken is expected out of that egg, then number one: it has to be put under certain temperatures which will lead to incubation and when it&#8217;s time is due, the\u00a0 chick will then fight it&#8217;s way out of the shell. Remember that it had to be given the right conditions to develop from being an egg to being a chick. As long as it&#8217;s just a yolk, nothing will happen but when it matures into a chick, the shell is no longer its dwelling place. This mental picture shows me that we have the qualities of being leaders whether we know it or not, all that is needed is to be in a right incubator.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">It&#8217;s okay to be an egg but when you know that you have the ability to be more than an egg, you will not be comfortable being one<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">. You will desire to fight your way through. Often times a word that lingers within our hearts and mind is &#8220;I CAN&#8217;T&#8221;, that&#8217;s good because you just passed the test and now you can be made one.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Just because you can&#8217;t do it doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t be done<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Joseph was a leader developed, for a while he was in an incubator of life being developed to be one. When he was but a young man, he was to me like an egg, comfortable being one but when he dreamt twice, the dreams triggered and awakened something inside of him reminding him he wasn&#8217;t all the Father wanted him to be. From making the mistake of bragging about how his household will bow before him, to being sold into Egypt, to being in Potiphar&#8217;s house, to being in jail to finally rising to power, I can see every part of his leadership being developed.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Joseph being developed to be a leader recognized the leadership of someone else above him and he yielded to that leadership<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">, he was first under the leadership of Potiphar and then Pharaoh. He was a man in authority and under authority, through his struggle in life, God developed the humility in him, a quality of a leader.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">A servant&#8217;s heart is a required quality, this does not just come, it&#8217;s developed through a pattern of life.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Mark 9:35, &#8220;And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, &#8220;If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">&#8220;. Being a leader is not about bossing people around but leading by example, this has to be developed. Jesus was not a bossy leader but one that led by example. Doing what many leaders of today would not do,<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">being a servant of all<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">. Joseph learnt servant hood through serving his brothers, Portiphar, the people in prison, the people of Egypt and his own.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Wisdom was one of his leadership qualities<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">, again we can see how foolish he was in the beginning but in due time, what was inside of him was developed to maturity. His interpretation of the dream to giving the advice on what was to be done was a God given developed quality the Egyptians needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">You can see that it took time to develop his leadership skills but he was ready for it,<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">he knew of his limitations but did not limit God<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">. He may have not understood the leadership class he was taking but I believe he appreciated it in life because God put him in an incubator. That egg, the thing that was delicate, that which could not move, that which could not function beyond, and that which was small had to be awakened to push its way out to become more than just an egg. Do you see yourself as more than an egg? it&#8217;s okay to be an egg but not bound to stay an egg forever. There are so many things in you that have not materialized yet, you need to be in an incubator. Ask God to show you what you could be as a leader and let that trigger something inside of you to desire to be one.

Having questioned God, God turns around and gives him 101 questions that leave him thinking and humbles him the most.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Through God&#8217;s questions to Job, Job had a new awareness of the wisdom of God&#8217;s hidden plans, a new sense of awe of His greatness and shows him his limitations even in the midst of the storm. In the midst of the storm, He appeared unto Job. At last Job understood God whom he had seen through the eyes of faith. No one who has seen the Lord in the storm can remain the same; it either breaks you or makes you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego were thrown into the fire and in the midst of their storm, the Son of God revealed Himself in that fire and they felt comfortable in the fire though their situation did not change. It was amazing to for them to see the Lord they had believed in, walked with, and lived for manifest Himself in their situation. So was Stephen just when he was about to be\u00a0 stoned, and Stephen in<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Acts 7: 55\u2026, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">, 56 and said, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Look!

At the beginning it may not make sense but as we trust and yield to Him then we will move from just hearing about the Lord and what He has done to actually see Him before our very own eyes by faith. He is the fourth man revealed in the fire in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego\u2019s story. It appears that there would have not been a better way for Job to see God but while in the midst of his fire storm. He had never so well grasped the greatness, majesty, sovereignty, and independence of God as he did at that moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">If I can\u2019t understand what is happening and why it\u2019s happening, I pray that we can believe that He knows where we are and where we are going.\u00a0 You may have been praying for change in a situation and it doesn\u2019t seam like its happening, in fact it\u2019s getting even worse. Let your prayer be, \u201cmay I see You the way Job, Stephen, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego did in what would be considered a painful hellish situation\u201d His presence alone in the midst of it changes us completely and is enough to carry us through the storm, His presence brings about Joy and peace in the midst of it.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">1John 3:2, \u201cBeloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be,<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Therefore, as we are sanctified by faith, we must be sanctified by hope.

\u00a0How much time did I spend on the Internet? \u00a0I felt a deep conviction about my Facebook addiction.<\/p>\n<p>I determined that day to read my Bible, my FaithBook, before I turned on my computer each day. \u00a0I would network with God, before networking with my friends. \u00a0When I made this decision, I saw scripture jump back to life. \u00a0God&#8217;s Word spoke to me with a freshness that seemed as if He had just posted it Himself.<\/p>\n<p>The addiction stopped. \u00a0Oh, I still enjoy Facebook and other social networks, but I have learned to keep them in proper perspective. \u00a0Psalm 119:59-60 sums up my new intent: &#8220;I pondered the direction of my life, and I turned to follow your laws. \u00a0I will hurry, without delay, to obey your commands&#8221; (NLT).<\/p>\n<p>Will you join me in the commitment to spending time in God&#8217;s Word before time spent on Facebook?<\/p>\n<p>Dear Lord, I recognize that I spend too much time on the computer. \u00a0Forgive my inattention to Your Word. \u00a0Help me each day to place You first in my life. \u00a0In Jesus&#8217; Name, Amen.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, This devo was sent to me by Maria and thought of sharing it with you. this shows how even good things can be a distraction, distracting us from what ought to be our priority. let this be a challenge to us all not just with facebook but other things that take our time [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1391","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-mr","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1391","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1391"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1391\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1392,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1391\/revisions\/1392"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1391"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1391"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1391"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1389,"date":"2009-07-16T19:33:55","date_gmt":"2009-07-16T14:03:55","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1389"},"modified":"2009-07-20T22:15:14","modified_gmt":"2009-07-20T16:45:14","slug":"faith-comes-by-hearing","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/16\/faith-comes-by-hearing\/","title":{"rendered":"Faith Comes By&nbsp;Hearing&#8230;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Good morning<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Romans 10:17, &#8220;So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Commercials are one of the greatest tools the manufacturers use to convey messages of their new products. Millions of dollars are poured into commercials to create awareness of the latest products. The commercials are supposed to be catchy and sometimes funny, some with twisted humor. Why do people go for things they go for? either someone told them about it and were convinced it works or saw it on TV, heard it on radio, bill boards, news papers. The product will not do them good if they don&#8217;t try it. For a fact, most commercials exaggerate what their products can do only to discover it\u2019s ability to work for a short time and it&#8217;s effectiveness is gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">We have talked about faith so many times but let this help build your faith.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Faith is the confident belief in the truth, value, and worthiness of a person, idea or a thing. It&#8217;s being loyal to a person or a thing<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. If you were to tell me your name, I must have faith to believe you told me the truth. If I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you&#8221;, chances are, you will be offended because I am insinuating you are deceiving me, the same way\u00a0 if you told me where you live and I told you I doubt it, you will not take it kindly.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Hebrews 11:6, says &#8220;For without faith it is impossible to please God&#8230;&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> You want to please God, you\u00a0 have to have faith, believing what He has said without doubting. Doubt is an indication of mistrust, and what an insult it is to God. He has displayed his products to us inform of creation, life, blessings over again therefore He is God who can be trusted, have faith in Him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Faith is commitment<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. When the bible talks about FAITHFUL servant, it refers to one who is committed to a task because he has believed the one who authored the task. It&#8217;s away to build more faith because the person whom you hang around for long, their character is displayed, you have a better way of dealing with them when it comes to faith. It&#8217;s evident that you have no faith in some people, you cannot trust them with things like information or finances, they have no character to support that trust. Thanks be to God who is faithful, never leaks your information to someone else, and does not mess with what you have trusted Him with. The children of God are people of faith, committed to this walk of life with Christ,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">2Corinthians 5:7, &#8220;For we walk by faith and not by sight<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;. It&#8217;s a tough one but we are determined to ride it out because we want to please Him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">He that uses the product must first believe that it works and what is the testimony? I don&#8217;t think faith just appears from nowhere and we believe it. It comes by hearing, hearing someone&#8217;s testimony that God can, hearing the word that drills through the nutshell of doubt and unbelief. The continuous word spoken goes around that shell and melts it down allowing it to have a new master<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">FAITH<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> (<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">F<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">orever<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">A<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">ll<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">I<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">n<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">T<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">hy<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">H<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">and). You can only come to someone because you know they have it, Christ does have it forever in His hands. Doubt is the enemy of faith and it comes easily, but faith needs a lot of force to occupy. Faith is gradual concurring one step at a time depending on what it&#8217;s given to feed on. We have established what faith comes by, &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Hearing<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;, this presents a little problem because you could hear things but wrong things and for sure those can also build faith but only towards the wrong things. &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">It comes by hearing by the word of God<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;. God&#8217;s word is like the commercial that we see out there, the only difference is that<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">His word is not exaggerated, nothing can be added to it and nothing can be taken away from it. It presents it self, defends it self and also proves itself. It never fails, it does not work for a season, and it works always<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">It does not fall short of anything and it does not return void.

Ev <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'MS Sans Serif';font-size:x-small;\">In life today, there are many people looking to find love, a sense of worth and a place to belong. People are looking for that one person who will make them feel special, loved and close. When we first meet someone, we are so in love. Nothing else seems to matter. All we think about is that person and wanting to spend every single moment with them. Sometimes these are true genuine feeling which only grows stronger with time, while other times they are just infatuation or temporary emotions that fade away after the immediate gratification is satisfied. True love is the Kind that grows stronger with time, not excitement for the moment. There is no way that a relationship can grow without spending time with the one you love. It is that feeling of closeness that makes someone feel loved, wanted and appreciated. Because when you are with that person, you feel safe, and un afraid to open up or give yourself totally without holding back.<\/p>\n<p>And so it is between us and God. When we first got saved, we were so excited. We wanted nothing more than just spending time with God, reading the bible, praying, and constantly telling others of our new found relationship with Christ. But what happens after a while? Some of us &#8220;burn out&#8221;. We don&#8217;t feel as passionate as we did in the beginning, while others hold on and grow stronger. The key to a successful relationship is spending time with your partner and knowing each other&#8217;s needs and desires. It is saying I&#8217;m sorry when you are wrong, rather than being defensive. It is saying that I love you when you don&#8217;t feel like you are in &#8220;the mood&#8221; to say it. It is holding on when the storms rage, rather than packing up your bags and leave.<\/p>\n<p>When David sinned with Bathsheba, and the prophet confronted him, he didn&#8217;t begin by giving excuses to justify his actions. He immediately acknowledged his sin. He knew that his relationship with God was not where he wanted it to be. They were having issues. But David didn&#8217;t do what many of us do today in our relationships. Many of us point fingers. We withdraw and build walls. We pack and leave. We look for other boyfriends and girl friends. But David didn&#8217;t pack up and leave. He didn&#8217;t try to find another God. He didn&#8217;t choose to withdraw and avoid the issue. He says in<strong> Psalms,51:3, &#8220;For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Against you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight.&#8221;<\/strong> You see David realized that to make up with God, he had to realize that he had done wrong, (which was the first step), Then he realized where he wanted to be, (which is the second step) then he took a step to fix things, (which was the third step). He then asked God for forgiveness. In verse<strong> 7, he says, &#8220;Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean. Wash me and I will be white as snow. Hide your face from my sins and blot out my iniquity.&#8221;<\/strong> then he goes to pray one of the most powerful prayers of repentance in the bible. he says,<strong> &#8220;create in me a clean heart oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not a way from your presence. Take not thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me&#8221;.<\/strong> Sometimes when we have fights in our relationships, we tend to withdraw. we feel like the joy is gone. That closeness tends to fade away. But God wants different of us. He wants us to spend time with him. He wants us to love Him no matter what, because that&#8217;s the same way He loves us. If God was to withdraw from us every time we did Him wrong, He would be so far away from us and we wouldn&#8217;t feel His love. He wants to have fellowship with us. His arms are always wide stretched waiting to embrace us, but we have to take the step of reaching out to Him.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> We are responsible for being wherever we want to be in Christ. we have to want it so badly that we wont let anything mess our focus<\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong>. James<strong> 4:8 says, &#8220;draw near to God, and he will draw near to you&#8221;<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> If you truly want to experience that ultimate closeness with God and be at the peak of your love life with Him, we must realize that we are not where we want to be, then we must want to be where he wants us to be, then we must take action and head towards our goal<\/span><\/strong>. When you love someone, &#8211; Let me rephrase, &#8220;<strong>When you truly love someone, you stop at nothing to let that love manifest. When you truly love someone, nothing can separate you from them<\/strong>. Neither trials, nor pain, tribulations or challenges, storms or death can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. If God went to the extend of giving up His son to prove how much He loves us, How much and how far are we willing to go to prove that we love Him???

But David didn&#8217;t do what many of us do today in our relationships. Many of us point fingers. We withdraw and build walls. We pack and leave. We look for other boyfriends and girl friends. But David didn&#8217;t pack up and leave. He didn&#8217;t try to find another God. He didn&#8217;t choose to withdraw and avoid the issue. He says in<strong> Psalms,51:3, &#8220;For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Against you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight.&#8221;<\/strong> You see David realized that to make up with God, he had to realize that he had done wrong, (which was the first step), Then he realized where he wanted to be, (which is the second step) then he took a step to fix things, (which was the third step). He then asked God for forgiveness. In verse<strong> 7, he says, &#8220;Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean. Wash me and I will be white as snow. Hide your face from my sins and blot out my iniquity.&#8221;<\/strong> then he goes to pray one of the most powerful prayers of repentance in the bible. he says,<strong> &#8220;create in me a clean heart oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not a way from your presence. Take not thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me&#8221;.<\/strong> Sometimes when we have fights in our relationships, we tend to withdraw. we feel like the joy is gone. That closeness tends to fade away. But God wants different of us. He wants us to spend time with him. He wants us to love Him no matter what, because that&#8217;s the same way He loves us. If God was to withdraw from us every time we did Him wrong, He would be so far away from us and we wouldn&#8217;t feel His love. He wants to have fellowship with us. His arms are always wide stretched waiting to embrace us, but we have to take the step of reaching out to Him.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> We are responsible for being wherever we want to be in Christ. we have to want it so badly that we wont let anything mess our focus<\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong>. James<strong> 4:8 says, &#8220;draw near to God, and he will draw near to you&#8221;<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> If you truly want to experience that ultimate closeness with God and be at the peak of your love life with Him, we must realize that we are not where we want to be, then we must want to be where he wants us to be, then we must take action and head towards our goal<\/span><\/strong>. When you love someone, &#8211; Let me rephrase, &#8220;<strong>When you truly love someone, you stop at nothing to let that love manifest. When you truly love someone, nothing can separate you from them<\/strong>. Neither trials, nor pain, tribulations or challenges, storms or death can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. If God went to the extend of giving up His son to prove how much He loves us, How much and how far are we willing to go to prove that we love Him???

The gospel is the good seed that was sowed in us through repentance and faith. The gospel (good news, good seed) was sowed in well prepared fields. Everything was okay as he natured his seed, dug around it, watered it and watched over it. This is how a Christian life ought to be, a life of hard work.<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> Acts 14:22 \u201c\u2026strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, \u201c<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> Following Christ is hard work.<\/span><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Proverb 4:23, &#8220;Keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life&#8221;,<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> In the process of time, the sower fell a sleep and stopped watching over his sowed seeds. If we were to look at it in this day and age, he stopped praying, stopped reading the word, stopped going to church and mixing up with believers. He took off the whole armor of God, threw down his sword, and stopped fighting sin. The enemy came in and planted doubt, fear, hatred, confusion, lack of patience and many things. We are told to keep our hearts with all diligence meaning guard our heart at all times for it\u2019s is where the issues of life flow. We are told to protect the seed at all cost, fight for the seed, so as not to allow the enemy to plant weeds in our lives. While Jesus was in the garden praying with His disciples shortly before He was arrested, He comes and finds them asleep instead of watching and praying,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Luke 22:45 When He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow. 46 Then He said to them, \u201c<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Why do you sleep?<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.\u201d<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Philippians 2:12,\u201dTherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, w<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">ork out your own salvation with fear and trembling<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">;\u201d<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">It concerns us above all things to secure the welfare of our souls: whatever becomes of other things, let us take care of our best interests. We must not only work at our salvation, by doing something now and then about it; but we must work out our salvation, by doing all that is to be done, and persevering therein to the end.\u00a0 Though we must use our utmost endeavors in working out our salvation, yet still we must go forth, and go on, in a dependence upon the grace of God. His grace works in us in a way suitable to our natures, and in concurrence with our endeavors; and the operations of God&#8217;s grace in us are so far from excusing, that they are intended to quicken and engage our endeavors.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">All our working depends upon his working in us.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Have you been guarding the seed like you should or are you sleeping on the job?

The way we are treated by men is the same way we think God is going to treat us. If we are failed by men we somehow feel that God might do the same. We always need to remember that God is not like any of us,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">His ways are not our ways and His thoughts are not our thoughts, as high as the heaven is from the earth so are His ways and His thoughts<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. If you have been in an airplane you see how far the ground is while you are up in the air and still you are not even close to where heaven is. This is how we are shown that God is not like us, not even close. His wisdom is unsearchable, who can understand God? whose mind can contain the thought of who God is? Who can explain His existence? No one else is like Him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Why is it that we feel like God owes us an explanation? What makes us think that even if He was to explain Himself we would understand? our mind capacity cannot register the explanation. Why feel like God is hiding something from us that we should know so we want to discover it? It all started in the garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were told everything they needed to know about the trees in the garden but curiosity led them to want to discover more. They were instructed not to touch the tree in the middle of the garden or they would die. Here comes the serpent who brought another message to Eve and gave her an impression that the Lord God Almighty was not completely honest with them, infact He was hiding what she felt should have been something reveled to them,<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Genesis 3:4, Then the serpent said to the woman, &#8220;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">You will not surely die<\/span>. 5,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.&#8221; Can&#8217;t understand why man wants to try and discover or uncover what he feels is not revealed. In the process of being deceived like Eve, you find that you&#8217;ve opened yourself to lies that will eventually kill you. Human beings want to be like God whether they admit it or not. I am utterly convinced that the Bible is the book that has everything God needed to reveal to mankind. Yes there are so many things that are not recorded in the bible but everything that God needed us to know is right there. His secrets that belonged to Him have been revealed that they belong to us and our children.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">John 21:25, &#8220;And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Already there are many who are trying to reveal what they believe is not told in the Holy Scriptures and already many are being deceived as to questioning the word of God. If it&#8217;s not reveled to you in the Holy Scriptures don&#8217;t even try to dig into it cause you will be trying to add to the word of God or extract from His word. I want the Lord to reveal to me what I NEED TO KNOW and NOT DIG WHAT I THINK I SHOULD KNOW. He is the one who has taken time to reveal to us the secret things we should know.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Psalm 37:4, &#8220;Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">your<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> heart<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;, if we can master the act of delighting ourselves in Him, the secret things He has always had in His warehouse for us will be reveled to become our desires and to our children. I am safe knowing that I can delight myself in Him as He reveals what He has purposed for me to know and have. Jesus came to fulfill what was written on the books without adding or subtracting,<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Hebrews 10:7, &#8220;Then I said, &#8220;Behold, I have come&#8211; In the volume of the book it is written of Me&#8211; To do Your will, O God<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;.

The God who is out to bless His children far beyond what they could ever imagine or think. He has not reserved the blessing for some people but to everyone. I am fascinated by the fact that God has blessings for everyone, He has not withheld any blessing from anyone, what troubles me is people. <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">See when God begins to bless you and take you places, you don&#8217;t have a problem with God but have a problem with people because people have a problem with you being blessed by God.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> This is not new, in the book of Genesis, the first murder occurred because someone was blessed. As long as Abel had not won the attention and the affection of God, Cain was alright, the moment Abel was blessed, Cain had an attitude with him. There was nothing in him to trigger jealousy and hatred for his brother until the blessing was bestowed on Abel. Cain takes his jealousy and frustrations and dumps it on his brother by taking his life. I saw this with Saul and David, as long as David had not won the attention of God and God in turn God blessed him, Saul was ok but the moment God began to bless David, Saul was out to take his life. What about when Jesus was born, king Herod heard Jesus king of the Jews was born. A little tiny baby was already a king\u00a0 being worshipped. The three shepherds were led of by the star to the place where a king who did not even have a throne here on earth was worshiped. Upon hearing all these, king Herod was out to destroy Jesus. All these three (Abel, David, Jesus) had something in common, &#8220;Blessed of God&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Where I&#8217;m I going with this? When God begin to bless don&#8217;t expect to be liked and well received by everyone. Blessings in your life are enough to trigger jealousy and hatred from some people. I hate to say this but I see this mostly among Christians. Christians who desire to see you blessed of God, they even talk about it and the moment God begins to bless you, they begin to give you attitude. They will try to assassinate your blessings, say things to make you feel guilty about being blessed, lie on you, trying by all means to put you down, saying things to kill your spirit then the blessing that you were suppose to enjoy, becomes a curse. People&#8217;s comments pierce you deep within, you try to explain yourself, you even try to hide the blessing or if revealed, you want to act like it is nothing for example, someone looks at a material thing God has blessed you with and says something nice about it and what do you do, you degrade the blessing by saying, it&#8217;s nothing, it was just a cheap, simple thing.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Why are we afraid to enjoy God&#8217;s blessings?<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Hasn&#8217;t the bible said,<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;the living God gives us richly all things to enjoy<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">?&#8221; Good family, good job, beautiful wife, handsome husband, well behaved children, blessed ministry, nice home, nice car (all things to enjoy) .<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">If a person has a problem with you being blessed, ask them not take their frustrations on you but on God who blessed you.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> Why would you want to forfeit your blessing because of someone else actions? Why should you get people&#8217;s approvals before you enjoy God&#8217;s blessings? After all God will not check with anyone if He should bless you. Those who are frustrated with you right know nothing about your history. They don&#8217;t know what you went through to get where you are, the mountains you had to climb, the valleys of the shadow of death you had to pass through. The days you would sit and wonder whether God had even a blessing for you. The days you felt like giving up, sat down and just cried your eyes out. Now that you are blessed of God, why should you continue to feel bad because someone has a problem with God blessing you? You and I need ask ourselves this question, &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">CAN WE STAND TO BE BLESSED?&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Can you stand to ride above what people say or think when you are blessed<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">? Many people&#8217;s blessings are turning out to be curses because they have allowed people to make them feel bad about being blessed<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. It&#8217;s not people&#8217;s attitude that will cause God to bless you more, it&#8217;s your attitude towards the blessing. It&#8217;s how you respond and act upon it. <\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">2 Corinthians 1:20, &#8220;For all the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Because God has promised to bless me and I am blessed, I refuse to act like I am not blessed and I refuse to let anyone make me feel bad about being blessed, I want to survive being blessed because he has given me all these blessings to enjoy. If I wait till everyone likes me to enjoy the blessings, I will waste everyday and I won&#8217;t be surprised if God stops blessing me.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">I enjoy His blessings, He gets all the glory we call it a deal.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> Blessings Ev<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:'GE Inspira';color:#000080;\">&#8211; In light of what&#8217;s been happening since we heard of Michael Jackson&#8217;s death, I&#8217;m putting a gospel presentation together to share with you and ask you to forward to family, friends, people you know who need to hear the gospel.

Hope you are all well. Let&#8217;s get to the word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">In a fast paced world, patience is one of the challenges we are faced to deal with. Who wants to be delayed in anything? For example, you leave the house, may be running late only to hit heavy traffic or come to a red light and it&#8217;s taking forever to turn green. You feel your patience is tested. Customers, kids, colleagues, and different situations are other things that test our patience. Besides those who are testing our patience, what we desire requires patience. Most people I meet say patience is not in their vocabulary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Patience is not taught in a classroom; it is taught and mastered in the sea of life<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. A dangerous prayer one can make is, &#8220;God make me patient&#8221;, it&#8217;s a prayer for those who know the end result but do not know the process but are willing to stick it out. What happens when you are dealing with something that requires patience, if you are like me, you may try to find an alternative. If there is traffic, it<\/span><span style=\"font-family:SimSun;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">s easy to try and find alternative routes. The problem I found is that, I got more lost and took even longer to reach my destination. Some things looked familiar as I made the choice only to find I was going further and further away from my destination. When God is teaching us patience,<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">the test comes always as an open book test<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. If you fail the test, you can take it again and again.\u00a0 What does this tell us, God is very patient with His children. Can you imagine a teacher giving an open book test, all the answers are there but the student keeps failing the test? After a while his or her patience will run out but God is ever patient with us. He was patient with the Israelites who complained and murmured, He was patient with Gideon who kept on asking for a sign. He was patient with David who was weak in the flesh, He was very patient with Peter who kept on messing up things.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">He who invented patience knows how to be patient<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.\u00a0 Faith goes with patience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">The writer of Hebrews recalls\u00a0 how Abraham had hope and patience to inherit the promises of God. He is encouraging us to do what some people like Abraham did before the promise was fulfilled,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Hebrews 6:11&amp;12, &#8220;And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end, that you do not become sluggish,<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;. Some of these people are the open books to teach us how to endure through faith till the promise comes. Their promises are the result of their faith and patience. And out our attitude should be, \u6403f they did it, we too can do it by God&#8217;s grace? Everyone has a dream, promises, desires, some of them have to come to pass but there are some that have not. In the valley of decision calls for an action, &#8220;should I stay on this road I already know of, wait patiently to receive the promise or should I take a back road hoping to lead me there? Abraham took the road God had set for him, there were a lot of traffic and I bet many times he thought of taking the back roads as the traffic was not moving but faith kept him on that road.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Hebrews 10:35&amp;36, &#8220;Cast not therefore your confidence with has great recompense of reward.<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> For you are in need of patience<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> that after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. The key to fulfilling the promise is sticking with the will of God in a situation till the end. Your confidence and my confidence in Christ has great reward because when we have confidence in someone that they can and will do it, regardless of when they do it.<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> Patience is a must to every wise man, we need it<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. &#8220;Want&#8221; is not the word that goes with patience only &#8220;NEED&#8221; which teaches me to be in the will of God gearing me to the promise. In the end when you look back you begin to see why patience was a must in your journey to the promise. In the valley of decision though hard, I will stick to the road He set for me. I will be tempted to take the back roads but I will learn to stay on the main road. He is patient therefore He will help me be patient. If I fail, I can take the test again, I will utilize the open book in the valley of decision. After we have done the will of God&#8230; Blessings Evans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Hebrews 6:9-19, &#8220;And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise&#8221; I&#8217;m back from vacation, my wife and I celebrated our third wedding anniversary on July 01, praise God.

I think that many are loosing sight of the reason we serve Christ, it&#8217;s not about us but about Him. God is not a means to any one&#8217;s end, He is the glorious end. To quote Dr. Michael Horton oh now many Christians view Jesus Christ, they view him as &#8221; \u2026<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">a coach with good game plan to our victory rather than a Savior who already achieved it for us<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;. He died for all then all died that we now should no longer live for ourselves but for Him. To quote again Dr. Horton on how people view God, &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">God is used as personal resource rather that known, worshiped and trusted<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;. There are things that drove Paul to live for God the way he did and had nothing to do with living his best life now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">When the disciples preached the love of God, they did not say &#8220;Jesus loves you&#8221;, they preached Christ crucified,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Romans 5:8, &#8220;But God demonstrates His own love towards us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">, anyone who carried the cross was not coming back and we who now carry the cross are too not coming back. Christ&#8217;s loving, substitutionary death motivated and compelled Paul&#8217;s service for Him. Paul emphasized the strength of his desire to offer his life to the Lord. Christ demonstration of His love to the point of death was a driving force unto Paul to serve Christ to the point of death. He says, &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">If One died for all, then all died, and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him, who died for them and rose again<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u201d. Christ died for all who died in Him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">As he defended his integrity to the Corinthians, Paul wanted them to know that his old, self-centered life was finished and that he had an all-out desire to live righteously. For all genuine believers, their death in Christ is not only a death to sin, but also a resurrection to a new life of righteousness. And the life of righteousness is not to please self but to please God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Matthew 16:24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, &#8220;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> deny himself,<\/span> and take up his cross, and follow Me. 25For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Galatians 2:20, I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">The journey in Christ is a journey of SELF DENIAL and not SELF FULFILLMENT and Paul demonstrates it over and over again.\u00a0 What we ought to ask ourselves as we walk this walk, what drives us to serve Him?

Philip didn\u2019t run to the chariot and then decide to abandon his evangelistic mission.\u00a0 He was determined to be a faithful ambassador as Paul wrote, \u201c<\/span><strong><em><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Now then, we are<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading

passage that the eunuch was reading?\u00a0 In Acts 6, seven men were to be chosen for ministry and the men needed to posses certain qualifications for ministry.\u00a0 The qualifications were the following:\u00a0 \u201c\u2026<\/span><em><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">men of good<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom,\u201d to which Philip was chosen as one of the seven.\u00a0 Philip had a good reputation among the Church.\u00a0 He was also full of the Holy Spirit; he didn\u2019t operate on his own but was rather guided and obedient to the Holy Spirit which was upon his life.\u00a0 And finally Philip had wisdom, knowing the Word of God and the God of the Word!\u00a0 It\u2019s no wonder why he was able to explain the Word of God to this man.\u00a0 Ray Comfort often says there are only two times to share the Gospel, \u201cin season and out of season,\u201d to which Philip exemplified this reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Preach Jesus<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.\u00a0 Perhaps this sounds like a no brainer, but there is something that can easily be missed here.\u00a0 Philip preached Jesus, because the man he spoke to was humble and therefore ready for the Gospel of Christ.\u00a0 Although Philip finished with preaching Jesus, he did not start there.\u00a0 He started with the prophets, specifically the book of Isaiah chapter 53.\u00a0\u00a0 Philip realized how to take this passage and point to the man to Christ with it.\u00a0 Would you have been able to the same?\u00a0 It is wise to be able to start with the Law and the Prophets but they both point to Christ and we should learn how to take people from there to Jesus as Philip did.\u00a0 Some people are not ready to hear about Christ yet however, because they are not broken over their sin by the Law of God nor does the one you may be witnessing to see by the Old Testament prophets that the prophets all pointed to Christ and the coming of the Messiah.\u00a0 In this Isaiah passage it reads,<\/span> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u201c<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">He was led as

witnessing done in the New Testament was when a follower of Christ shared the Gospel with a stranger as opposed to a follower of Christ only sharing their faith with someone they had a previous

She does not so much care about what everyone else will say or think, all she cares about is how good she will look for the groom and how the groom will respond to her efforts. Because she cares about how she will look, she makes sure that she has everything she needs to bring herself to that perfection. If you are going to perfect yourself, by whose level will you do it? The one you want to please. If I was to measure myself with the life of certain people, I would look better because I will conclude that I am not as messed up as they are but when I create my own standard, that would mean living the way I feel is good for me is my standard. If I am okay or comfortable with it, then its right for me, I would call that my own perfection. The bride is not out to create her own perfection, she is out to look perfect before the groom. That is her standard, that is the mark and that is the measure. She may fall short of it, but she would have done everything in her power, and even get advises from people who know what catches the eyes of the groom and go for it.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Mathew 5:48, &#8220;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your heavenly Father which is in heaven is perfect&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> Jesus is the groom we want to please on that day, Revelation 19:7Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.\u201d<sup> 8<\/sup> And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.\u00a0 Will we be perfect? of course not, but that is the mark we all strive for.

Everyone seated chatting and having a good time, occasionally the groom chats with others but his mind is consumed by how beautiful his bride will look when she walks through the door. Suddenly they announce the arrival of the bride, everyone rises up, every one quiet and all eyes looking at the bride as she walks gracefully down the aisle towards the groom. She is not looking around at those who are there in as much as they matter, all she can see before her is her groom. What about the groom standing there majestically looking at the bride he has waited for and finally here she is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">We are the bride preparing ourselves to meet the groom on that day. Our motive and zeal is not to please the people who will show up at the wedding but the groom Himself. I can imagine on that day that as the bride walks in, all heaven becomes silent, all angels on their feet and all eyes locked on the bride who has been adorning herself here on earth and the groom saying, this is the bride I have waited for since the day I gave myself for her on the cross. I died for her because I loved her and she has kept herself pure because she loved Me too. What a glorious day that would be.

Continue to keep my wife and I in your prayers. Also if you could remember me in your prayers, this Saturday I will be speaking to men at our church (men&#8217;s breakfast). Be blessed.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>While Jesus was here on earth, He was also referred to as Teacher. As we know the work of a teacher is to impart knowledge and skills to his students to help them become whatever they need to be once the teacher is gone. Teachers give their students the necessary tools for their day to day life and preparation of what is to come. If taught, the teacher can only give guidance and answer questions not live a life for his students.<\/p>\n<p>Isaiah 48:17 first tells us who is speaking (the Lord), to whom He is speaking to (the redeemed), and who He is and His message. It&#8217;s very important to know who is speaking to otherwise we are pruned to errors and mistakes. Often times you hear, &#8220;The Lord told me&#8221;, the real question is, did you really hear the Lord speak or was that your imagination. It&#8217;s a struggle to hear the Lord speak but when He does, you will know that it&#8217;s the Lord. He is our redeemer, thank God we cannot redeem ourselves neither can He teach us how to. This is His job glory be to Him. He reminds us that He is the Holy One of Israel and that He is our God.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The next line says, \u201c<strong>Who teaches you to profit,\u201d &#8230;<\/strong> Redeeming part is His job, &#8220;to profit&#8221; He teaches us how to. Mark that it does not say &#8220;WHO MAKES YOU&#8221; but &#8220;TEACHES YOU&#8221;. God may provide a job for you but He expects you to work in that Job because there is profit in working hard, <strong>Proverbs 14:23, &#8220;In all labor there is a profit<\/strong>&#8220;. God blesses more when what he has entrusted you with is put to work.<strong> Ecclesiastes 2:24, &#8220;Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> This also, I saw, was from the hand of God<\/span>&#8220;<\/strong> Laziness cripples and here is what Paul says, &#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">whoever does not work should not eat<\/span><\/strong>&#8220;.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Don&#8217;t do a poor job just because you don&#8217;t like being where you are<\/span><\/strong>,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> there is a profit in being faithful<\/span><\/strong>. Profit is an advantageous gain on an investment, you invest your time, resources, skills, ideas, and you will be channeling yourself for blessings from the Lord. I am a living testimony to this. For where you are, ask God to teach you how to multiply, to be the best in what you do, leading you in the way you should go. Are you profiting in your job, in your family, in your church or are you just putting time?<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Where you want to get to has everything to do with how you handle where you are now<\/span><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that instead of David praying &#8220;GIVE ME&#8221;, you hear him pray mostly &#8220;TEACH ME&#8221;. Giving is not as profitable as teaching, giving maybe for a season, teaching remains with you.<strong> Psalm 25:4, &#8220;Show me Your ways, O LORD;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Teach me Your paths<\/span>&#8220;, Psalm 119:66, &#8220;Teach me good judgment and knowledge, Psalm 119:68, &#8221; Teach me Your statutes&#8221;, Psalm 143:10, &#8220;Teach me to do Your will&#8221;. <\/strong>David understood that being taught would be more beneficial to him; he would take the teaching and put it to work to bring profit and gain leading the glory back to the Teacher who imparted those teachings in him<strong>.<\/strong> Jesus had to teach His disciples to carry on with the work He had started. He called them (redeemed them), provided for them for sometime and taught them to profit in every area. Are you expecting God to give you everything, money falling from heaven, companion coming from no where, being approached with a position etc, asking Him to teach you what to do, how to do it then asking Him for grace and strength to do what He has taught you to do then give Him all the glory for what He has done.

So many of us want good marriages and it scares us to death when we think of &#8220;what if it does not work as we expected it&#8221;. I would say I have heard more negativity about marriages than good and makes me wonder then I stop and look at the thriving marriages and I ask myself, what is their secret?. The more I wonder, the more I research, the more I want to learn, the more I want to exercise. Some thing I have learned already is that, lovely marriage requires ACTION and ATTENTION. I discovered that one of the deadliest diseases that kill marriages is withdrawal, lack of acceptance.<\/p>\n<p>Think of this, &#8220;<strong>the feelings of love towards your spouse in marriage will ALWAYS require your attention<\/strong>&#8220;. Some time back, my pastor preached on &#8220;reclaiming the virtue of love&#8221; , we learnt that in the bible, love always goes with service. So when I say &#8220;I LOVE you&#8221; in actuality I mean &#8220;I SERVE YOU&#8221;.\u00a0<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> This is an investment that yields high returns<\/span><\/strong>. This will happen through three things, TREASURING, GUARDING and NURTURING.<\/p>\n<p>TREASURE is considered precious and valuable. For you to have a successful marriage, you have to learn to treasure your spouse. You have to see her\/him as precious and valuable in your life and in your marriage. The moment you stop treasuring, there will be an element of withdrawal. There is a great need of acceptance as to who he\/she is. Loving (SERVING) him\/her in a language he\/she understands rather than a language you understand. This goes far beyond feelings. Serve your spouse by treasuring him\/her.<\/p>\n<p>GUARD is to protect from harm. You can only guard what you treasure.\u00a0<strong> Proverbs 4:23, &#8220;Keep (guard) your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life<\/strong>&#8220;. You can guard by what comes out of your mouth. We can be together and still feel vulnerable and exposed. Wives want to feel safe and guarded in the presence of their husbands. Harsh words springing from the heart fueled by anger strips that protection a wife craves for. Wives on the other hand can guard the self worth their husbands need. A husband&#8217;s number one supporter is his wife, the moment a husband feels exposed to critical attacks rather than being guarded by encouragements, there can be withdrawal. Who else can believe in him like his wife? How often do we hear husbands thanking their wives for believing in them and encouraging them to make it? You can serve your spouse by guarding him\/her<\/p>\n<p>What you TREASURE and GUARD requires NURTURING. NURTURING is the ability to help grow or develop. This is investing even more as you realize that you are not bound to stay in the same place forever. A travel in this life leads to discovery every day. Dreamers who want something better look for ways and avenues to explore as they discover more. Marriage is also a daily discovery. As a gardener nurtures the growing flower, digging around it, watering it, the gardener is giving the flower a chance to unfold its inner beauty that would not come if not nurtured. You can nurture hope, the expectation of good even in the midst of tough things. You can serve your spouse by nurturing him\/her.<\/p>\n<p>Treasuring, guarding and nurturing are some means of loving (serving). If married or in a relationship, ask yourself, do you treasure your spouse\/marriage? Do you guard by all means? Are you nurturing each other that you may blossom even more? There is still more work to do, serve each other.\u00a0 Blessings Ev<\/p>\n<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p><strong>1 Timothy 4:8, &#8220;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">For bodily exercise profits a little<\/span>, &#8230;&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you work so hard in the day, you feel tired and worn out. Any activity you add to it is expected to make you even more tired. The body which is suppose to be the temple of God ought to be looked after. This goes with what you do with it and what you put in it. We ought to do everything to maintain it as not only will be doing what is right before God, it will also be to our benefit. How often do you see people abuse their bodies? They drink their heads off, inject drugs into their body system and not care for their body at all, how many know that smoking is bad for their health but still do it? There are Christians who can&#8217;t quit smoking, they don\u2019t want to. If you thought that God only cares about your spiritual being, think again. God cares about our spirit, soul and body. Though the body is not the number one, he formed it and gave everything needed to care for it.<strong> They say cleanliness (healthy) is next to Godliness<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Paul writes to Timothy by saying bodily exercise profits a little. So we can say that bodily exercise does profit. Sometimes back I started exercise and found that it had such great benefit and impact to my body. I thought leaving work tired and going to the gym to work out was going to make me more tired only to realize that it increased my mental alertness, left me refreshed, created good eating habit and made me stronger. It&#8217;s been profiting me as it&#8217;s causing my body to relax and be in good health. Not only that, it has created a balance, spiritual and physical. When your body is weak and tired, it becomes hard to work your spiritual life. Remember when the bible says<strong>, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak<\/strong>, tired, worn out? If you can get the body strong, the spirit will not work overtime to get the body in tune with it. I have found that my prayer life has increased as the common feeling of always being tired has reduced. I now have the strength to wake up early and pray. This has revived my spiritual life even more.<strong> 3 John 1:2, &#8220;Beloved, I pray that you may prosper<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> in all things<\/span> and<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> be in health<\/span>, just as your soul prospers<\/strong>&#8220;. I believe that how you treat your body has away of affecting your spiritual life. It may just be a little thing, but it&#8217;s significant. God&#8217;s children ought to be in good health resulting from exercise and proper nutrition and not being careless, overweight and sloppy.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> All this calls for discipline<\/span> as you set yourself to do things you would not normally do but because you care about your physical health, you will do it anyway. No one wants to have conditions of heart problems, high blood pressures etc this is why<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> physical exercise reduces the intensity of many illnesses or the risk of developing them,.<\/span><\/strong> You can do some walking, running, press ups, in other words, exercise.<\/p>\n<p>Did you ever think that bodily exercise did profit? Try it out if you did not know and see how it affects both your physical and spiritual life. You will be amazed!!!

Any activity you add to it is expected to make you even more tired. The body which is suppose to be the temple of God ought to be looked after. This goes with what you do with it and what you put in it. We ought to do everything to maintain it as not only will be doing what is right before God, it will also be to our benefit. How often do you see people abuse their bodies? They drink their heads off, inject drugs into their body system and not care for their body at all, how many know that smoking is bad for their health but still do it? There are Christians who can&#8217;t quit smoking, they don\u2019t want to. If you thought that God only cares about your spiritual being, think again. God cares about our spirit, soul and body. Though the body is not the number one, he formed it and gave everything needed to care for it.<strong> They say cleanliness (healthy) is next to Godliness<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Paul writes to Timothy by saying bodily exercise profits a little. So we can say that bodily exercise does profit. Sometimes back I started exercise and found that it had such great benefit and impact to my body. I thought leaving work tired and going to the gym to work out was going to make me more tired only to realize that it increased my mental alertness, left me refreshed, created good eating habit and made me stronger. It&#8217;s been profiting me as it&#8217;s causing my body to relax and be in good health. Not only that, it has created a balance, spiritual and physical. When your body is weak and tired, it becomes hard to work your spiritual life. Remember when the bible says<strong>, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak<\/strong>, tired, worn out? If you can get the body strong, the spirit will not work overtime to get the body in tune with it. I have found that my prayer life has increased as the common feeling of always being tired has reduced. I now have the strength to wake up early and pray. This has revived my spiritual life even more.<strong> 3 John 1:2, &#8220;Beloved, I pray that you may prosper<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> in all things<\/span> and<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> be in health<\/span>, just as your soul prospers<\/strong>&#8220;. I believe that how you treat your body has away of affecting your spiritual life. It may just be a little thing, but it&#8217;s significant. God&#8217;s children ought to be in good health resulting from exercise and proper nutrition and not being careless, overweight and sloppy.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> All this calls for discipline<\/span> as you set yourself to do things you would not normally do but because you care about your physical health, you will do it anyway. No one wants to have conditions of heart problems, high blood pressures etc this is why<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> physical exercise reduces the intensity of many illnesses or the risk of developing them,.<\/span><\/strong> You can do some walking, running, press ups, in other words, exercise.<\/p>\n<p>Did you ever think that bodily exercise did profit? Try it out if you did not know and see how it affects both your physical and spiritual life. You will be amazed!!!

There is a difference between wisdom and knowledge. Knowledge is being aware, learning by teaching. Wisdom is having knowledge and applying it in different ways to produce a result that is even greater. Wisdom goes about differently, that is well calculated options to give something better while knowledge may sometimes be one way in the sense that if you learned it this way, it\u2019s got be done that way. The bible puts both of them in different scriptures and are very significant,<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Proverbs 9:10, &#8220;The fear of the Lord is the<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> beginning of wisdom<\/span>, and the knowledge of the holy (forgot something here?) is understanding&#8221;, Proverbs 1:7, &#8220;The fear of the Lord is the<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> beginning of knowledge<\/span>: but the fools despise wisdom and instruction&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. I know people who never went to school and but have such wisdom. I believe that wisdom is mostly learnt from experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">1King 3:5,&#8221; At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, \u201cAsk! What shall I give you?\u201d &#8220;,<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">and Solomon said<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> vs. 9, &#8220;<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil.

Solomon asked for nothing but wisdom to judge his people wisely and fairly. Without wisdom, you could have everything you desire, most likely those things will kill you. Give someone a million dollars and you will see what happens, if one has never been trained, or skilled to handle that kind of money, it will destroy him. Let someone else go through different process of learning to utilize, being a good steward, learning to invest, you give him little by little, they become content and faithful and when they get to the top, you give them that kind of money, it will not bring them down for they will be wise.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Mathew 25:<sup> 22<\/sup> He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.<sup> 23<\/sup> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;. It&#8217;s a matter of being faithful with the little that you increase, be it with a job position or ministry that God makes you ruler over much. Many people want to be enlarged but they have problems maintaining where they are. Some want to make a progress but are not faithful in that which is little. If you are given anything that you are not prepared for, either it will destroy you or you will destroy it. Don&#8217;t be discouraged because you are not where you want to be; be like Joseph who was faithful even in the small beginnings and God in due time entrusted him with larger things because he had demonstrated that he could be trusted. Through his small beginnings, he learnt more of wisdom and understanding that when he reached to the top, he became one of the most humble people on the earth.

If we knew our end result, it would scare some to death.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">We always try to see our destiny based on our history<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. One of the people who was told about his destiny was Jeremiah, it scared him to death. The first thing we are told of where God was involved in his life was not when he was born or when he was conceived, God knew him when He thought of making him. &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Before &#8220;I&#8221; formed you in the womb &#8220;I&#8221; knew you&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">God is telling Jeremiah that He is a result of His making and God does not make anything that has no purpose? God orchestrated every life not when it was born but right before the thought of the parents to have one. Why is it so important? because you begin to understand your life is God planned. God planned it, stepped in, made it, fixed it. &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Before you were born I sanctified you<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;, He knew that Jeremiah would be born in sinful world but He was already sanctified in the womb. Sanctify means to set a part, to make holy or purify. Those who are saved are sanctified even if they don\u2019t feel like it? It&#8217;s not a matter of feeling but knowing that you are. &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">I ordained you a prophet to the nations<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;, this was to be Jeremiah&#8217;s calling, a prophet. The word ordain means to invest with ministerial or authority. Three things God tells Jeremiah about him,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">FORMED, SANCTIFIED, ORDAINED<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. I can see how no one can form, sanctify or ordain but God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">In our thinking we would wonder how can this be?. One Jeremiah is too young to understand all these; two, he can\u2019t see how he can be what God had called him to be. Now I know why God would not show many of us things, we will not understand them even if He explained, they would not make sense, they will look foolish compared to what we know of ourselves so He just leads us to them.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Romans 8:30, &#8220;Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;. Paul talks about how God works and says that those whom he predestined, in other words those that He elected by divine will, He also called them. Something to think about, when he predestined them, there is no where it shows they were perfect or complete and the reason being the next line reveals to us that He also justified them. Justified means, declared free of blame from guilt and penalty attached to grievous sin. And those that He justified, He also glorified. The glory part puzzled me a bit for I know Only God receives the glory but how can He glorify us then. Here is an interpretation the Holy Spirit gave me. That which has taken through the process of formed (predestined), sanctified (justified), ordained (called) He lives in them and glorifies Himself in them. You shine because He shines through you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">If you are a believer, there is a calling in your life. It may not be what you thought you will be or planned to be. I never saw myself preaching, teaching, encourager and a prayer warrior. I grew up a very shy skinny boy, bullied by so many in school, I was nicknamed every name I could think about, average student. I never thought or saw myself being used of God mightily but now I understand that I am a result of Formed, sanctified and ordained. God had deposited so much in me I did not know till the right time. It&#8217;s the same with you, you have no idea what God has deposited in you yet to be revealed.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">You may be looking at your history, God is looking at your origin<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. Since you have no recall of your origin, let God who was there tell you of what He made you to be. My history did not affect my origin though I concentrated on my history. My history showed more of my failures than success, my origin showed &#8220;Formed, sanctified and ordained&#8221; Blessings Evans<em><\/em><\/span><em><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Thanks <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Ev<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Jeremiah 1:5, &#8220;Before I formed you in the word I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations&#8221; The more I walk with the Lord, the more I see my life being changed as I go to new dimensions.

WWJD (What Would Jesus Do?) was very popular years back and many asked themselves this question in every life situation that needed answers. Of course this was also opened to abuse as some people came up with ideas of how Christ would have handled situations contrary to what the bible teaches about Christ. If you do not know who Jesus Christ is or you are not getting to know Him daily, how would you know what He would do? you will merely come up with things thinking that it is Christ like only to discover you are operating in the flesh. I prefer this one, WDJD (What Did Jesus Do?), this helps me find out and learn more of Him leading me to do what He did so as to be like Him.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">I can only do what He has done to be like Him, creating anything besides that is not of Him.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Paul is more responsible for most of the new testament; he is a person who dedicated his life to walk with the Lord.

All that he had done for the Lord would not be compared to knowing the Lord. He wanted to have a taste of the power of His resurrection. Knowing that if he was going to resurrect, there had to be death somewhere. Die to self for the sake of the call. He also desired to have a fellowship of His suffering in order to appreciate what Christ had done for him. I see a man who is not satisfied with what he has and done but wants more. Christians ought to desire more (blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness Matthew 5), if you are comfortable with what you have and where you are, it&#8217;s because you haven&#8217;t allowed God to reveal to you through His word that wakes you up and desire more to be like Him.

Who would like to start something with no aim to finish successfully?<\/span><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Mark 4:37, &#8220;And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat in the boat, so that it was already filling<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;. In the process of desiring to finish your race successfully, a great wind comes about to shift things up. Wind of persecution, fear, doubt, confusion, frustrations from people and work, anxiety, depression. What was peaceful and likeable all of sudden stopped bringing joy anymore. Before the great windstorm came over, the disciples were navigating the boat correctly, they knew of what to do, everything was peaceful and promising, they had everything under control but the moment the storm came, they began to loose their ability to stabilize the boat. This is what the devil does, he comes in when you think you have everything under control and starts sending storms in your life. For these guys the waves beat into the boat, the thunder was roaring, the earth was shaking, it&#8217;s was dark and everything they knew to do had failed at this point. Watch this,<\/span><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">boats that float do not sink however hard the wind tries to blow them<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">,<\/span><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">the only thing that will make them sink is when the outside is let on the inside<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. The moment the water starts coming into the boat, that boat is destined to sink. The moment you start allowing the junk of this world to come in when you are in a storm, you will sink. I would rather go through the storm without the storm going through me. The storm shouldn&#8217;t dictate how you make it, you ought to dictate how you will survive the storm by blocking all the means the outside stuff might come in. When you are in a storm, it&#8217;s easy to cry out to someone or blame them for what is happening in your life but when you understand that man cannot help in your storm, you will change who to call on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Where is Jesus in all this?,<\/span><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Mark 4:38, &#8220;But He was in the stern, a sleep on a pillow&#8230;&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">There is something about this picture, remember that the boat is rocking, the wind is howling, the thunder is roaring and it&#8217;s dark, everyone is getting frustrated and out of control, the boat lost balance, in spite of all that, Jesus was sleeping peacefully.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">He must have been comfortable in the storm<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. Real faith will make you comfortable in the storm. Can we be comfortable in the storm because Jesus is on board (our lives), besides, if the boat was to sink, do you think Jesus would drown? If Jesus\u00a0 lives in you and you are going through a storm, do you think you can drown? Watch this again,<\/span><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Mark 4:38, &#8220;&#8230; And they a woke Him and said to Him, &#8220;Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. Do you sometimes feel like Jesus is sleeping when you are going through a storm? Interesting thing again, the wind, thunder, boat rocking did not wake Him up but when one of His disciples came and woke Him up, He awoke. That\u2019s neat because your problems will not wake Him up, just because you are in a storm does not mean He will move, you got to reach and cry out to Him for help.<\/span><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Romans 10:13, &#8220;Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Stop trying to fix it and start calling\u00a0 on Him right in your a storm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Mark 4:39, &#8220;Then He rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, &#8220;Peace, be still&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">What a Man, the only reason He could speak peace out is because He had it within. The reason you can&#8217;t speak peace in your situation is because the enemy has disoriented you and instead of tearing the enemy apart, you are tearing yourself apart. Jesus rises up and says, Peace, Be still and<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">it becomes the word, against the situation<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. Later He asked them, where is your faith? in other words, you needed not to wake me up for this cause<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u00a0I have given you power<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">and<\/span><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">My presence in your life<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">should cause you to speak peace in the storm you are in.

Big, tall, thin, young trees are everywhere. Some do bear sweet fruits and some don&#8217;t. Many have pleasant looking leaves making them look attractive and yet some don\u2019t. I also see that some do provide shade in hot and sunny seasons. We appreciate trees for many reasons because of the results, what they have turned out to be, the question is,<\/span><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">where does their strength lie?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Every believer has to know where his or her strength lies. Other things will fall in place when the introduction to this is correct. In as much as every one appreciates the tree, the strength of that tree lies in its roots. I believe that for a believer to be strong, he or she has to have roots grounded somewhere. When we look at the tree, we don&#8217;t see the roots but we see the result of what the roots are doing. The deeper the roots, the healthier and stronger the tree can be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Prayer is one of the biggest and strongest roots a believer can have as part his life.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">The destination of the tree depends on the introduction of the roots<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. If the roots are shallow, most likely when it rains heavily, that tree will be washed away and when a mighty wind comes along, it will not be able to stand. The only way that trees can stand and look good is by allowing it to be planted in the right soil, the roots going deeper and deeper seeking and searching for food that will sustain it. In my life I found out that my prayer life is my roots, very important. I am what I am because of my prayer life. The more I was shallow in prayers, the more I could not stand for long but the more I prayed, the more my roots went deeper and the more I became stronger as I sought the Lord. People appreciate the good things that came out of me, but they don\u2019t understand that my strength is not on what they see but on the roots they don&#8217;t see. To grow in righteousness, I have to sink my roots deeper in prayers and God\u2019s word, so as to reach the lost,<\/span><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Psalm 1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night. 3 He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. When we pray, we don&#8217;t pray to be seen, it\u2019s done in secret, the results is what every one sees. You want to be blessed, stay strong, and grow, the question is, are you willing to do whatever it takes to dig your roots deeper? It\u2019s easy to ask someone to help you out by praying for you, or even encouraging you, I believe the greatest way you can be a victor is by going to the Lord yourself. Let someone come and add to what you already have. The woman with the issue of blood sought the Lord, her strength was in her faith and her move, and so was the blind man who cried out to the Lord while everyone tried to silence him. He knew that, that was his moment; his strength was in his faith and voice.<\/span><strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness (develop your roots) and all these things shall be added unto you (You will blossom in the natural).

The question was, &#8220;If you are saved and maybe while driving you lust and we know that lust is sin and suppose you die before repenting of that sin, would you still make it to heaven?\u201d There is a great difference between living in sin (sin is a lifestyle, habitual) and falling in sin (battling sin and sometimes falling in sin against your own will).<\/p>\n<p>When you are saved, all your sins are washed away, true. I know that the blood of Jesus not only takes care of what you did, meaning all past sins, it also takes care of the present sins and sins to come. Here is a mental picture, you have weeds growing in your back yard, you&#8217;ve been trying to get rid of them for sometime but nothing seams to be working. A chemical is offered to you at the hardware store that is able to get rid of the weeds, not only does it kill the present weeds, it also kills even the roots of the weeds that might try to surface in the future. With this in mind, when we are saved, not only are past sins covered but also the future sins. Hebrews 10:14, &#8220;For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified&#8221;. Does this mean we can therefore continue sinning because it&#8217;s covered? Not quite, I will talk more on this. I listened to a preacher say there are sins that lead to death and there are sins that don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>This is my thought from looking at the scriptures; there is a difference between falling into the hands of God and falling out of His hands. 1John 1:6, &#8220;If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.&#8221;. I would say that this is for someone who claims to be born again Christian but he is not for he is still living in sin (darkness). This is someone who has never made it to the hands of God. God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all according to verse 5. Just looking at this, you can see that a person walking with God is walking in the light and is safe in His hands. Yes, there might still be some darkness in him but that darkness cannot dim the light of Christ, the arms of the Father molds him to be like His Son. This is a person whose spirit has been set free, cleansed, his entire being is going through a process of sanctification. So you can be saved and still fall in sin while still in His hands but you continue to stay in sin, you can roll off His hands and what a tragedy that would be. Here is something that got me, 1John 1:8, &#8220;If WE say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us&#8221;. Here is where we all are generalized, &#8220;WE&#8221;, collectively and that is why no one is good but God. Just because I am saved does not mean I can never have issues with sin again, it\u2019s not about perfection but direction. I still may fall but I will fall in His hands. 1John 2:1, &#8220;My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous&#8221;. The first thing we are told of is \u201cnot to sin\u201d, that is the standard, that is the mark. If this scripture had left with thee part &#8220;sin not&#8221;, we would all be in trouble. The last part of the verse &#8220;and if any man sin&#8230;&#8221; is not an option but incase. It&#8217;s in the process of living in the light that if you fall, then there is away out. A person who has never made it to His hands dives into sin while the other falls into sin.<\/p>\n<p>Hebrews 10:31, &#8220;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God&#8221;, it\u2019s a wrathful hand for those living in sin but a gentle hand for those He has redeemed. Thank God that we are still in His hands, no matter what we go through as believers, we are still in his hands, broken but still in His hands. You are under a covering. Don&#8217;t let yourself stay in sin until you have fallen off His hands. If you have never made it in His hands, you are NOT safe at all, but if you have, there is an advocate Jesus Christ ready to plead your case. Guilt will be there, but choose to rise up, repent and move forward. David said 2Samuel 24:14, &#8220;&#8230;let us fall now into the hand of the Lord, for His mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man&#8221;. He said this when he sinned and God gave him three options to pick from for his punishment, he chose to rather fall back in the hands of God of mercy. Therefore, are you in His hands or off His hands?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,\u00a0 Hebrews 10:31, &#8220;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God&#8221; Sometimes back someone asked me a question that is common.

Blessing the Lord is not reserved for special occasions, He deserves to be blessed at all times just as we don&#8217;t except to receive blessings on special occasions. Bless Him in the morning, at noon time, in the evening, all night long. The Psalmist in our text begins by blessing the Lord, giving God back what He requires of us which is worship. He understands that the moment he begins to give this service, not every part of his body will comply with his desire, but if he can get his soul to begin, the soul has a way of affecting his entire being. This is why the Lord deals with the heart first before dealing with the body and mind. If the heart is touched, the heart is in a position to affect the mind and the body. With our hearts, we bless His holy name for He is holy.<\/p>\n<p>As we bless the Lord, we are reminded of the benefits bestowed upon us. There is a great difference between the benefits and the benefactor for there can be no benefits without the existence of a benefactor. It&#8217;s in our process of worshipping God that we are reminded of His benefits. Today I will touch on the benefit of healing (Who heals all thy diseases). Healing is a benefit from the Lord, a benefit that came with salvation package. Salvation is the main thing just like applying for a job, the job is the main thing but besides the main thing, there are benefits to go with it. Not only does healing become a benefit, we are told that He heals all our diseases. If He said some, then we will dig in further to find out which ones are covered in the benefit but when He said all, it&#8217;s an indication that there is no sickness that cannot be handled by God. Isaiah 53:5, &#8220;He was wounded for my transgressions, He was bruised for my iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon Him and by His stripes we are healed&#8221;. He was beaten that I may be saved and not just saved but healed also from all my diseases. He says, &#8220;I am the Lord that heals you, I sent forth my word and it healed all your diseases for there is nothing too difficult for me&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Since the year started, we have heard cases of people sick and we&#8217;ve been praying for them. You might be sick in your body this morning or someone whom you know is sick, know that sickness is not from the Lord, it\u2019s from the devil. You might have this thought that sickness could be coming in as a punishment for sin from the Lord, well God is not the author of evil but good, He may allow but He will not start it. We have a chance to bless the Lord, remember His benefits and call on Him to bring them according to His will. He is a God of restoration Joel 2:25, &#8220;And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten&#8230;&#8221;, God will restore health in the days, weeks, months, years that the enemy has brought sickness in your life and loved ones. The word restoration is to be brought back to its original state before loosing anything. Some people&#8217;s health need to be restored, you may be having a cold, asthma, stomach pain, chest pains, back pains, cancer, kidney problems and you name it. God is able to restore back your health because that is His benefit for us. Eph 3:20, &#8220;Now unto Him who is able to do exceeding, abundantly, above all we ask or imagine according to the power that works in us&#8221;. Let God be God in your situation and may He receive glory for being God in your needs. Healing is a benefit, why not trust God to move in your situation according to His written will?<\/p>\n<p>Have a blessed day full of healing.

24:51).\u00a0 The kingdom of this world cannot and its most horrific torture cannot compare to the eternal torture of an eternal Hell!\u00a0 Once again, I realize that there are those that would say,<\/span><strong><\/strong><strong><em>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">My God would never create hell.\u201d<\/span><\/em><\/strong><em><\/em><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">Those who say that are right: their \u201cgod\u201d would never create hell, because he<\/span><em>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">couldn\u2019t<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;color:#000000;\">.

Idolaters will not inherit the kingdom of God. The one true God, however, could and did create hell for those who reject His mercy. They will reap His just wrath. Hell is a reasonable punish from a Holy King.\u00a0 Jesus said in Matthew<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u00a010:28, \u201c<\/span><strong><\/strong><strong><em><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">And fear not them which kill the body<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u00a0[the world\u2019s torture]<\/span><em>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather<\/span><\/em><\/strong><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.\u201d<\/span><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Hell is real<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">!<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">The Evidence Bible states,<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\u00a0\u201c<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Obviously, those who flippantly say such things don\u2019t believe in the biblical concept of hell. Their understanding of the nature of God is erroneous. The slowwitted criminal thinks that the electric chair is a place to put up his feet for a while and relax.\u00a0 It may be wise therefore to speak with him for a few moments about the<\/span><em><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">reasonableness<\/span><\/em>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">of a place called hell. Reason with him by saying, \u201cIf a judge in Florida turns a blind eye to the unlawful dealings of the Mafia, if he sees their murderous acts and deliberately turns the other way, is he a good or bad judge? He\u2019s obviously corrupt, and should be brought to justice himself.\u00a0 If he is a good judge, he will do everything within his power to bring those murderers to justice. He should make sure that they are justly punished.\u00a0 \u201cIf Almighty God sees a man rape and strangle to death your sister or mother, do you think He should look the other way, or bring that murderer to justice? If He looks the other way, He\u2019s corrupt and should be brought to justice Himself. It makes sense then, that if God is good, He will do everything in His power to ensure justice is done. The Bible tells us that He<\/span><em>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">will<\/span><\/em>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">punish murderers, and the place of punishment\u2014the prison God will send them to\u2014is a place called hell.\u00a0 \u201cGod should punish murderers and rapists. However, God is so good, he will also punish thieves, liars, adulterers, fornicators, and blasphemers. He will even punish those who<\/span><em>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">desired<\/span><\/em>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">to murder and rape but never took the opportunity. He warns that if we hate someone, we commit murder in our hearts. If we lust, we commit adultery in the heart, etc.\u201d\u00a0 Then take the time to tell him of the<\/span><em>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">reality<\/span><\/em>\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">of hell. Sinners like to picture hell as a fun, hedonistic, pleasure-filled place where they can engage in all the sensual sins that are forbidden here.\u00a0 But Jesus said that it is a place of torment, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched (Matthew 9:45-47). We tend to forget what pain is like when we don\u2019t have it. Can you begin to imagine how terrible it would be to be in agony, with no hope of relief? Many human beings go insane if they are merely isolated for a long time from other people.\u00a0 Imagine how terrible it would be if God merely withdrew all the things we hold so dear\u2014friendship, love, color, light, peace, joy, laughter, and security. Hell isn\u2019t just a place with an absence of God\u2019s blessings, it is punishment for sin. It is literal torment, forever. That\u2019s why the Bible warns that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\u00a0 God has given His Law to convince men of their sins, and unless a sinner is convinced that he has sinned against God, he won\u2019t see that hell is his eternal destiny. He may consider it a fit place for others, but not for himself. That\u2019s why we mustn\u2019t hesitate to open up the Law and show that each individual is personally responsible for sin, and that God\u2019s wrath abides on him because of it. Ask him to consider why you would say such things to him if it wasn\u2019t true. Tell him to examine your motives. You are so concerned for his eternal welfare that you are prepared to risk offending him.\u00a0 Then ask him if he would sell an eye for a million dollars.

On Friday I was out on the streets witnessing, talked to about 10 people directly and indirectly, gave out gospel tracts. Met some Christians too who I had a chance to challenge. Everyone was open to the gospel and were very glad I was out there to share with them the truth, but yesterday Monday  was a different story, there was rejection after rejection, overwhelming and discouraging but here I receive a devotion that is encouraging from the Lord to strengthen us not to quit, I needed this. The enemy wants us to quit fighting, I will not quit reaching the lost, neither should you with whatever he is trying to use to make you quit.  Ev  Good morning,  Acts 18:9 &#8220;One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: &#8220;Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.10 For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.&#8221;  God spoke Encouraging Words to Paul! God did not want Paul to quit and he wants none of you to quit as well. Got that?  &#8220;A man was shoveling snow from his driveway when two boys carrying snow shovels approached him. &#8220;Can we shovel your snow mister?&#8221; one of them asked. &#8220;Only two dollars!&#8221; Puzzled the man replied, &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see that I&#8217;m doing it myself.&#8221; &#8220;Sure,&#8221; said one of the enterprising young men, &#8220;that&#8217;s why we asked. We get most of our business from people who are half through and feel like quitting.&#8221;  While working for a multinational company, I would struggle and writhe in pain when I look at the atrocities around, foul language, immodest dressing and crazy living, I would wonder, &#8220;how am I going to present the Gospel to them&#8221;. I would just walk to a person while at the coffee machine and say, &#8220;can I get a moment please&#8221;, then I would rattle off my testimony. All the while I would see the other person&#8217;s eyes wonder around, though my heart would pound when I look at the person&#8217;s uneasiness, yet I would end my testimony quoting the Bible. I would walk around during lunch and tea time with the Bible in my hand. People looked strangely at me and until the last working day in the bank, many people avoided me. Friend, if you want to really walk close with Jesus, then the world would leave you. God trained me to be ALONE and now I am reaping the fruits of my labor for Christ. The Lord is teaching me many things which I would not have learnt if I had not separated myself for Him. Many people rejected me and asked me not to disturb them anymore. While distributing tracts on the roads and highways, I would sometimes be stared at and just ignored. Though it pains to be rejected but now I know I was on a mission for Christ. I would just pass on to the next person. Many times, God would whisper a word of encouragement and I would happily continue.  In the above scripture, not only is Paul overwhelmed with the immorality of Corinth; he is very much alone. Paul had left all of his co-workers, Silas and Timothy behind. But we see that many people were set on fire for God because of Paul. Even in a city like Corinth, God had some people who had the thirst to work for God but it needs FIRE to light it. You never know, there may be some Aquilla, Priscilla, Crispus and Apollos among you in the office. It needs a person like Paul to go around and HUNT for them for Christ.

He so much longs for the presence of God such that his heart and flesh cry out to God. Though my heart is anxious to know the Lord, the flesh constantly fights the heart. When you know you are not where you need to be, something within you will long for something greater than what you already have inside. Something that will propel you to leave the visible and long for the invisible. Something that will cause you to see things not in the natural but in the supernatural. It&#8217;s easy to get satisfied by what you see naturally, but when God brings you to a place like where the psalmist found himself, your spirit will yearn for more.

His house is not reserved for certain occasions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">In His house that is where there is refuge and safety, that is where He speaks to you through His chosen servants, the train of His robe fills the temple (His house). It&#8217;s the best place to be at and meet Him. The psalmist discovered and realized that just a day in his dwelling place, is better than a thousand days elsewhere. Even if it meant not being in a position to be in His house, he would still be comfortable at the entrance. God cares for His house and He cares for His people to be in His house to worship and praise Him, to meet Him in the inner courts. Do you get excited about being in his house or is it just another drag? When was the last time you were in His house? Get your life back on\u00a0 track. Find a church that reads and preaches the bible, a church that prays, and worships the Lord God Almighty, and be plugged in His house.\u00a0 Blessings Ev<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 84:1-12, &#8220;For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand.

Also he made him a tunic (coat, robe) of many colors<\/strong>&#8220;. Jacob had a reason for making his son a coat of many colors. I see it this way, though Joseph had a coat of many colors, he did not know that was symbolic for when he was sold into Egypt and later became the number 2 man, he was able to serve everyone without discrimination, he was able to serve all races, colors, personalities, and\u00a0 gender in other words, he served everyone equally.

In Genesis after the fall of man, Adam and Eve having had knowledge they were naked decided to cover themselves by making\u00a0 clothing out of leaves. When men fell; 1. Immediately knew they had failed God, 2. Discovered they were naked and 3. Developed a need to hide. We understand that there are things as human beings we can do on our own and might work but the truth is, it will not last for long. They had leaves covering them not realizing that leaves would soon dry up and fall.\u00a0 So man tries so hard to cover his nakedness only for it to work but for a season. The bible tells me that there are things that if God does not do, anything someone else will do will be in vain.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Psalm 127:1, &#8220;Except the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain that build it: Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh in vain&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0I would say that this verse means that anything you are going to do if the Lord is not involved in it, however hard you try and do it, it will never work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Genesis 3:21, &#8220;The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0Here comes the Lord who knows that whatever man will do, will not work unless He steps in. He made garments of skin for Adam and his wife. Lets pause here for a sec, the Lord did not tell them what to do and how to do it, He stepped in and did it for them. We see the first death of an animal, the first sacrifice. Even in the midst of their failure, God still knew how vulnerable man was without Him therefore He reached out to the poor material \u201cman\u201d and does something for him. Remember the scripture we just looked at, \u201c<strong>Except or unless the Lord does it, man will be doing it in vain\u201d<\/strong>. Whatever the Lord does comes already blessed, he can only bless what His hands are on. I also wondered why garments and nothing else, let&#8217;s look at why the Lord loves garments, In Exodus 28:1-5, God is giving instructions to Moses on what to do about the priests He had appointed (Aaron and his sons). Look at<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Exodus 28:2, &#8220;Make sacred garments for your brother Aaron, to give him<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">dignity and honor<\/span>, vs. 3, &#8220;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Tell all the skilled men to whom I have given wisdom in such matters<\/span>\u00a0that they are to make garments for Aaron,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">for his consecration<\/span>, so he may serve me as a priest&#8221;.<\/strong>Can you see that the garments were to give him dignity and honor and then for his consecration. In the olden times, the priests ministered to the Lord and brought messages from the Lord to the people. There were people who were given special tasks to do this kind of service, when Jesus died on the cross, the ones who received Him,<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>He gave them power to become,<\/strong>\u00a0and now we are priests who minister to the Lord daily. Only God could clothe us again with dignity and honor by sending His Son to the cross to die for the shamed human race and He says in<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Romans 13:14, &#8220;Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ \u2026 &#8220;,<\/strong>putting on the Lord Jesus gives us dignity and honor and we get consecrated which is to say being set apart for the Master. God had to clothe us with Jesus to remove all our guilt and shame.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>NOT ONLY DID HE PROVIDE THE GARMENTS, HE ALSO CLOTHED THEM.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The garments were not made of cheap imitated materials, lets go back to<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Exodus 28:4, &#8220;These are garments they are to make: a breast piece, an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban and a sash vs. 5, &#8220;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">have them use gold, and blue, and purple and scarlet yarn, and the fine linen<\/span>&#8220;.<\/strong>\u00a0We said God is skillful in making things, everything is done systematically and goes through different stages.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Because this was a special project ordained by Him, the skilled men could not make the garments outside His instructions (Except the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain),<\/strong>\u00a0it&#8217;s like<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">God is giving them the architectural plan executed in heaven in readiness for the building down here<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.<\/span>\u00a0The plan, the structure, what kind of materials to be used, budgeted for in heaven and by God. Him giving the final architectural plan is a sign that He has built it already. Yes it may still look like it&#8217;s ink and paper but it&#8217;s a done job.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>He calls those things which are not as though they were.<\/strong>\u00a0Our garments are skillfully designed in heaven and God is executing that plan here on earth through His Son and the Holy Spirit. Garments reserved for us are not made of cheap materials and they are not just made, they are skillfully designed by the Creator of all. It&#8217;s a blessing to know that my garments is<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">CUSTOMIZED<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0 and has the label \u201cJESUS\u201d, He is the reason for the garment.

glorified through the life of that vessel as far as that vessel submitting to God so that He would specifically be glorified through that ministry.\u00a0 I recall many times when I have been hammered

Later in an interview he said, &#8220;<strong>God gave me that so I could remember that I&#8217;m not the greatest, but He is.&#8221;<\/strong>\u00a0That&#8217;s pretty good advice, and a pretty good attitude.<\/p>\n<p>Ali\u2019s self proclaimed greatness was connected to his accomplishment in the ring.\u00a0 As great and commendable of an accomplishment that was for Ali, it was only for a season, and therefore temporal.\u00a0 Ecclesiastes 3 reminds us that, \u201c<strong>There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven<\/strong>.\u201d\u00a0 Well if Ali isn\u2019t the greatest, then perhaps the one remembered as Alexander the Great filled that title, which preceded Ali, however last I knew he was dead too.\u00a0 Well then who is the greatest then?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Jesus\u2019 disciples surely grappled with this issue in their lives, and as they were arguing among themselves about which one of them was the greatest, Jesus drops a monkey wrench in the gears of their thinking as He said \u201c<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The greatest among you will be your servant<\/span><\/strong>.\u201d\u00a0 I can picture the confused look on each of their faces as they struggled to understand Jesus\u2019 words of servanthood.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If we follow in the thinking of Christ, then to discover who the greatest one of all was we must look at the greatest servant in history.\u00a0 The Apostle Paul writes, \u201cYour attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">taking the very nature of a servant<\/span><\/strong>, being made in human likeness.\u00a0 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death\u2014even death on a cross!\u00a0 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<sup>\u00a0Phil 2:11<\/sup>\u00a0and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (Phil 2:2-11).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Paul points out that Jesus was God in the flesh, and took upon Himself the form of a servant, and that servanthood was connected to death as He died the death on the cross.\u00a0 He faced capital punishment on that shameful cross, because He was a servant, but who did He serve?\u00a0 Mark reminds us,\u2026whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. \u201cFor<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve<\/span><\/strong>, and to give his life as a ransom for many (10:43-45).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There were other servants that lived both before and after Jesus.\u00a0 However, only Jesus became a servant to all humanity giving His very life that all might receive salvation through Him.\u00a0 No other person in history has ever come and served all of humanity past, present, and future, by their one life.\u00a0 This is the greatness of Christ, and what makes Him unique above all others that have ever been proclaimed as great.\u00a0 Unlike others, His greatness has no end because He is eternal.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application<\/span><\/strong><strong>:\u00a0 You serve a great God, thank Him today for His greatness and meditate on His greatness manifested in your life past and present, as you live to shine His greatness in the future.\u00a0 Who are you serving to show your service to the Lord?

Often times people don&#8217;t excel because of what they have believed,\u00a0 so they stop fighting to move from point A to point B left feeling condemned in point A. All they now do is nurse all the failures and defeats they encountered previously. The bible says, \u201c<strong>whose report will you believe<\/strong>\u201d? As long as I have breath in me, I&#8217;m going to keep pumping life in me, encouraging myself that regardless of what I have gone through as long as it did not kill me, it gave me an opportunity to understand that greater things have been deposited in my spirit that will not be terminated prematurely. You and I did not come this far to call it quits, we still have to look to God as He shows us ways to survive in our desert experience in search for that water brook.<\/p>\n<p>A loving father in my text has a child who has a deaf and dumb spirit. We are not told of his age but we are told of his condition. Many diseases that Jesus healed, He did not get into details trying to figure out when it started, what the symptoms were.\u00a0 On this particular incident He gets information about who this child was and what he had. I do believe with all my heart about being specific with the Lord, general prayers have never worked for me that well and so when I have an issue, the first thing is to identify what it is, the symptoms, what it&#8217;s doing to me and being able to bring it to the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Just before Jesus came to the scene<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>vs. 14, &#8220;Then one of the crowd answered and said, &#8220;Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a mute spirit&#8230; So I spoke to Your disciple, that they should cast it out, but they could not&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0We see a caring father in need of help for his son. He brings his son to Jesus only to find His disciples instead. I can imagine the father thinking that since these people had been with Jesus, and had seen what Jesus regularly did, they too could perform miracles but they were unable. Was it because they were never equipped to do the job or was it a job just for the Master? Jesus tells us in<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>John 14:12, &#8220;verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than this shall he do&#8221;,<\/strong>\u00a0with that verse, it&#8217;s very clear that Jesus would have loved to see His disciples do what He had been doing, the things He had been teaching them, listen to what He says in<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Mark 9:19, &#8220;He answered him and said, &#8220;O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bare with you?&#8221;<\/strong>\u00a0this implies He needed not to be there for the healing to take place for He had already given them power to heal, let&#8217;s see it in<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Mark 16:17&amp;18, &#8220;And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover&#8221;<\/strong>. What a word from the Lord, He says, these signs shall follow you only if you believe (faith) and not just faith, but faith in the Author of it,<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Hebrews 12:2,&#8221;&#8230;looking unto Jesus the Author and the finisher (perfecter) of our faith&#8221;<\/strong>. Faith is the key that unlocks doors to victory.<\/p>\n<p>Friends, we got to have faith that He who is in control is bigger than the situation and the circumstances around you and me. The reason why many cannot trust God with their situation is because they have reduced God to a level of \u201cpeople breaking promises\u201d and are in no position to help. I guarantee you that before you begin to even look to Him for anything, take Him out of the box you placed Him in, begin to praise Him, magnify His name, talk about His names, His nature and you will see how your faith will be elevated to a greater level. The thing that was a challenge will appear too small in your eyes for you are seeing it the same way the Lord sees it. Understand that whatever is impossible with man is possible with God; whatever gets out of man&#8217;s control does not get out of the Lord&#8217;s control. Have faith in God and the signs of victory, rain, joy, peace shall follow you for what intimidates you does not move Him. All the disciples needed in this case was faith and the name and the job would have been done. We too need the faith and the name to help us through it.

In His weak time in the flesh having fasted 40days and 40nights, the devil thought he could take advantage of Jesus\u2019 weakness in the flesh. One thing the devil knew was that before Jesus came on earth He had power over the devil in heaven, because he was cast out of heaven. Now Jesus is on earth, in human form (flesh, body), flesh that gets tired, weary and tempted. The devil thought he now had Jesus this time and so he tries something on Him. Yes Jesus was tired and weak after fasting and so He was vulnerable to any attacks. Amazing thing, He had a different weapon to fight back. He had the word and every time the devil tried tempting Him, He responded \u201c<strong>IT IS WRITTEN\u201d<\/strong>. The word has power if used correctly \u2018because the devil also quoted scriptures in this passage but not in its proper use. After the enemy tried Him three times and failed, he left Jesus for a season and the angels came and ministered to Him (Matt 4:11). We as believers will be tried persistently and when we have resisted with the word, the devil will leave us for a season, meaning he is bound to come back, and when he leaves, the angels will strengthen us.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Arm yourself with the word at all times!!!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Aren&#8217;t we glad that we can be weak in the flesh and we can be tempted but we can retaliate using the word of God?

The bible already says, \u201cThere is nothing good in us (that is in ourselves)&#8221;, I believe you find yourself in this dilemma sometimes. When you have waited for so long, labored hard, did all you could but still wonder whether any good can come out of you? You might have a habit you have been trying to get rid of for years, it has left you crippled in some way and you are constantly thinking, &#8220;Can any good thing come out of me even in this situation?&#8221; At times you want to rip off what is standing on the way of your victory because you can feel it, sense it, see it but you can&#8217;t seam to find away to gain it.<\/p>\n<p>I have not studied the history of Nazareth but by listening to what Nathanael had to say, there was something about it that couldn&#8217;t allow him to see anything good come out of it. Maybe the sins in that city were great and if we look at the records, we see Jesus having a hard time in Nazareth where He grew, many were offended and wanted to cast Him out, the bible says that twice He was expelled from the city, there was unbelief and perhaps they were rude people. From the book of Genesis to the book of Malachi, there are prophesies of birth of Jesus mentioned and how He would become the King, Messiah, Emanuel, Lord, born of a virgin in Bethlehem. If a baby like that would be born today, they would find the best city, hospital, in other words, the best place to have him. It will be all over news. Jesus wasn&#8217;t like that, yet, He had all the titles. So when Phillip approached Nathanael to give him the good news of having met Christ, the one they had all been waiting for, it did not make sense to him. To make it worse,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Phillip referred to Him as Jesus of Nazareth<\/span><\/strong>. We do want good things to come out of good places and we can put our focus on that good place and fail to understand that God tends to do things differently why?<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>1Corinthians 1:27, &#8220;God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are might<\/strong>&#8220;. I&#8217;m always amazed because we tend to program ourselves as to how God will move and if He does not move as expected and anticipated, we get frustrated.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Don&#8217;t focus on how He moves, focus on this thought, HE MOVES<\/span><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>John 1:46, &#8220;&#8230; Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0Can anything good come out of your\u00a0 position at work; in your husband who you think is not amounting to anything, a child that is just out of place, giving you a hard time and you sit and wonder, can anything good come out of him\/her?. How about you have been sick for many years or trying to stop a habit, nothing is happening. You are just like Nathanael who could not see beyond the sins in Nazareth.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">People who cannot see beyond their weakness and some people\u00a0 are always left wondering whether there is anything good left reserved for such people in spite of who they are<\/span><\/strong>. We praise God for the great things He is doing even in the midst of all the things we do not see Him use to bring that which is good. Jesus Christ came out of Nazareth, the Christ in each of us helps us and others see that good things can come out of us (boldness, courage, strength, joy, peace, victories etc). It&#8217;s not a matter of how you feel, it&#8217;s a matter of who comes out of the city that no one ever thought something good could come out of.<\/p>\n<p>Christ came out of Nazareth in spite of Nathanael\u2019s thought. Jesus revealed Himself at that point,<strong>\u00a0John 1:49, &#8220;Then Nathanael declared, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel. vs. 50, &#8221; Jesus said, &#8230;. You shall see greater things than that&#8221;<\/strong>. Praise God because we will see Him do things and greater things than this shall we see. Jesus makes disappointments into appointments, junks into assets, mess into order, and doubt into faith. Next time you see something or someone or in yourself that nothing good could come out of you, may you be reminded that it can because of Him.

And distractions bring about detachment, moving your attention away from what you should be concentrating on, very important things. Sometimes we get distracted by even good things but not necessary at a given time.<\/p>\n<p>We see this example in Luke 10:38 when Jesus entered into a village and Martha welcomed Him into her house. It was Martha\u2019s idea to welcome the Son of God; her sister did not have part in it. If you welcome someone or a distinguished guest, presentation is very important right? And I can see Martha working hard to give a good presentation; cooking, cleaning, setting things up because she had a guest in her house. Then here comes Mary, Martha\u2019s sister who instead of helping her, sat at Jesus feet to hear His words. While one was busy prepping the natural food, the other was busy sitting to feed on spiritual food.<\/p>\n<p>Isn\u2019t it amazing that we too can be busy prepping things for the Lord but forget the most important thing, sit at His feet and feed on His word, be in prayer? How easy it is to be distracted doing everything else for the Lord but have no time for Him. Yes, Jesus was in Martha\u2019s house but I believe it\u2019s not so much about what Martha could give to the Lord but rather what the Lord could give to her and her household if she wasn\u2019t distracted. While distracted and waiting for her sister to come and help, I can imagine frustrations beginning to creep in and that is when she turned to the Lord to ask her sister to come and help. Instead of Jesus asking Mary to go and help her sister, He said<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u201c<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things.\u201d<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0Any time in the bible the Lord calls a person twice; I believe it was to get that person\u2019s undivided attention. See the Lord noticed that she was worried and troubled by many things trying to please the Lord. What she would have learnt was that pleasing the Lord meant sitting at His feet to hear Him teach why,<strong>John 4:34, \u201cJesus said to them, \u201cMy food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work<\/strong>\u201d and for Mary<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Romans 10:17, \u201cSo then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0and Mary chose the best thing, Jesus continues to say, \u201c<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><sup>42<\/sup>\u00a0But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.\u201d<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you were to take a moment right now and scan your life, would you find anything distracting you from being in His presence and listening to His voice? Do you have too many things going on that has shifted your focus from what is important that even reading His word and praying are not appearing to be your priority? Martha was distracted that she missed the food for her soul, Mary chose the best. Are you going to be a Mary or a Martha? Don\u2019t let distractions shift your focus.

One thing that bothered me was seeing children from even Christian homes go a stray, walk away from God and go their way. They were raised going to church, in the word, parents prayed for them and this is what they turned out to become?<\/p>\n<p>How is this verse then applicable when it suggests that if you train the child the way he should go, HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM THE TEACHING? Already it appears they are departing according to these statistics \u201c<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">88% of children raised in evangelical homes leave church at the age of 18 never to return<\/span><\/strong>.\u201d That is an alarming rate. The Holy Spirit gave me an understanding on this scripture by viewing it this way, \u201ctrain up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, however hard he may try to run away from the teaching, it will always be present with him, he cannot depart from it\u201d. Whatever he was taught or observed at home will not depart from him. That is why it\u2019s important that children be invested in. As a parent, you don\u2019t want to suffer the heartache of your children rebelling against their Christian upbringing. While only God can save us and keep us, there are biblical principles you can implement to help prevent your children from tragically falling away from the faith even in their later years in life.<\/p>\n<p>I remember my dad setting the best example for his children and also was mom. I learn more by observing and many of his teachings in my life came from observing his Christian walk. My dad was (is) a prayer warrior, who conquered more devils in his family on his knees. To raise up a big family sometimes making tough decisions had to be done on his knees (praying). I listened to him many times praying for our future (my siblings and I); to be used of God one day, to have godly blessed relationships, to make intelligent decisions, to be successful etc. I learnt what it meant to be in a good respectable relationship by watching him treat his wife (my mom). What I\u2019m I saying, even in my teenage life where the urge to rebel was beginning to creep in, their teachings, their life style could not depart from me. This is why it\u2019s important that parents live an example of grace before their children through worship, reading of the word, praying, relating to each other (husband and wife), and how you train your children. It\u2019s sad when spouses fight before their children, disrespecting each other before their kids. Do everything with dignity; you are setting an example to your children. At times it\u2019s good to show tough love, it may not be popular at the time you are giving it but it will be appreciated later in life. Seeing dads become more responsible at home sets an example to the boys, its key, it\u2019s vital. Who better teach them what it means to work hard, be responsible, have character and integrity than the parents.<\/p>\n<p>I believe this could be a reason to have brought home the prodigal son in Luke 11,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><sup>\u00a0<\/sup><\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><sup>17<\/sup><\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0\u201cBut when he came to himself<\/span><\/strong><strong>, \u2026!<sup>\u00a018<\/sup>\u00a0I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, \u201cFather, I have sinned against heaven and before you,<sup>\u00a019<\/sup>\u00a0and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants\u201d,<\/strong>\u00a0I don\u2019t think only the food and the good life at home would have driven him to go back, love, support, the teachings he had received would bring him back home. Yes he tried to run away from them all, but they would not. The earlier teachings brought him to himself to revisit how he was raised and how he turned everything into a mess. This brought about the heart of repentance and willing to go back home because regardless of where he had been, and who would not receive him, he knew he had a father who loved him and would be willing to receive him. How did he know, he had learnt it years back. It is a tough job but you and I have a responsibility to train and therefore it starts with us.

The bible tells us that \u201c<strong>the joy of the Lord is my strength\u201d<\/strong>. If we take a close look at the word joy, it&#8217;s more than happiness for happiness tend to go with how you feel at a given time especially when everything is going the right way, joy comes when you know that regardless of what you have to deal with whether going forward or backward, you will make it, in other words rejoicing in the end result rather than the process. The joy of the Lord makes us comfortable in the situations that make other people uncomfortable.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 100 is a psalm of joy and singing, it starts with make a joyful shout to the Lord. I don&#8217;t have to shout joyfully to be heard by people, I can shout inside and when my inside is affected, my outside appearance will be the result of what is going on inside. Serving the Lord with gladness is awesome for I know that whenever I sit to work at my station, I&#8217;m working and serving the Lord. This is a blessed time where I come in the morning to work and say Lord, I thank you for another opportunity to serve in my department and serve others shinning for the Lord at my work place. You see His word says that whatsoever thy hand finds to do, do it with all of your might without murmuring or complaining and the Lord of reward shall reward you.<\/p>\n<p>Come before His presence with singing. I believe that music is the greatest tool used to uplift hearts. There is nothing I know people respond to like music and that is why we can buy music over and over again; we can have hundreds of music collections. We can listen to music over and over again. The bible says that the Lord inhabits the praises of His people and we do a lot of praises through singing and listening to music. Y<strong>ou got to give something to get something<\/strong>. A song with you will help you go through the day. When King Saul was being tormented by evil spirits, guess what he did, he had David playing music in his presence and the more he played, the quicker the evil spirit left. Replace your worries and anxieties with a song in your ear.<\/p>\n<p>Enter into His gates with thanksgiving and into His courts with praise. I love this line for this reminds me to go beyond where I am. Entering into His gates and into His courts allows me to leave outside everything that will interfere with my praise while I&#8217;m serving Him everyday.

This morning I will touch on the ARK looking at it from the blessings perspective.<\/p>\n<p>It happened that as David and his men were bringing the ARK home, they did not follow the proper procedure of handling the ARK. The Levites were the priests chosen to carry the ARK and be worshippers but David decided to have the ARK on a new cart and drove it. One man by the name of Uzza was struck dead by God when he reached out to help the ARK that had stumbled. Because David did not follow the proper way of handling the ARK, one man died.\u00a0<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>1Chronicles 13:12, &#8220;David was afraid of God that day, saying, &#8220;How can I bring the ARK of God to me?&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0David recognized the mistake he had made for God wasn&#8217;t going to be treated casually and served anyway men wanted.

They were excited from the beginning about bring home the presence of God, all of a sudden, the joy\u00a0 turned into mourning. However, look further at what the Lord did. David decided to leave the ARK in Obed-Edom&#8217;s house who I believe was a Levite, meanwhile David went back home to get things ready and this time to bring home the ARK the right way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1Chronicles 13:14, &#8220;The ARK of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months.

A man opened his house for the presence of God to dwell in inform of the ARK of God, which opened ways for blessings. The Lord says,<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>&#8220;Blessings, I will bless you&#8221;<\/strong>\u00a0but we have to allow Him to come in and dwell with us for the blessings to flow.

Proverbs 10:22, \u201cThe blessings of the Lord makes rich, and adds no sorrow with it&#8221;<\/strong>. This is more than the material richness, this goes for spiritual stuff, wisdom, understanding, discernment, character enlargement. The blessings of the Lord touches on every part of our lives.<\/p>\n<p>Are you worried about position or His presence? Is the position more important to you than His presence? Do you want the blessings without the presence? As long as the ARK of God remained in Obed-Edom&#8217;s house, God blessed him and his home abundantly. I desire the ARK always in my life, which means desiring God&#8217;s presence everyday.

Only one place at a time could He be in. He was stretched in the life span of three years of His ministry on earth and I would say He worked overtime.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Matthew 8:20, &#8220;And Jesus said to him, &#8220;Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head<\/strong>.&#8221; While the disciples slept, He labored at night in prayers and did ministry during day time. He did not have an organized structure, He wasn&#8217;t a pastor of an organized church meeting in a place but indeed He was a Shepherd. Being that He was limited to time and space, He did the much He could do and left the rest for the disciples and us who came along to continue with the great work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Matthew 9:37, &#8220;Then He said to His disciples, &#8220;The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few<\/strong>&#8220;, Looking around, I am a witness of the harvest truly being plentiful. We can act like it&#8217;s not but the truth of the matter is, it is indeed. As the harvest is plentiful guess what?, the devil is working overtime when believers are seating on their pews singing &#8220;Amazing grace&#8221;. Wars have increased, kidnappings, rapes, murders, abortion, disobedience, hatred, rebellion, lawlessness, all these have increased because the devil is working overtime. Think about it, temptations are working overtime, fear is doing the same and the devil is putting off fires in believers who are careless to discern the time they are living in. Many are naming the name of Christ thinking they are safe but here is something to think about, &#8220;In our societies it&#8217;s always<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">INNOCENT till proven GUILTY, in Christ, GUILTY till proven INNOCENT<\/span><\/strong>. Can you see how the harvest is plenteous? Yes we have people who have never received Christ and they know it and then there are those who are deceiving themselves to thinking they have Him simply because they mention His name. If someone tells me that he\/she is a believer, they are guilty before my eyes till they prove they are innocent through Repentance towards God and Faith in Christ. In other words hearing them say they have made peace WITH God. The harvest is plenteous and we as believers have to wake up from doing regular hours to doing overtime to win that which is lost, from guilt to innocence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vs 38, &#8220;Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.&#8221;<\/strong>\u00a0I used to think that by being called to be a prayer warrior, I was suppose to pray that God would raise up other people to do the work only to discover that the more I prayed to God to raise up laborers, the more I realized that I was the answered prayer. You pray for laborers and you find you are the laborer you&#8217;ve been praying for. Imagine a blind man walking towards the cliff, and you know for sure that he is going to die when he falls over, but you stand there and pray that God will bring someone else other than you to run and tell him to turn around. You and I have a moral obligation to tell the blind man walking towards the cliff to turn around. Check this,<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>James 5:19, &#8220;Brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back, 20, let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins<\/span><\/strong>&#8220;. It&#8217;s a blessing to know that God could use you to save a soul. There is so much to be done and very few people to do it. The ones who could step out and do the work have been consumed by structures, programs and traditions. Nothing wrong with them but at the expense of the lost? If we continue to sit and do nothing, the enemy will continue to work overtime. We better rise up and begin to work overtime ourselves. We might not see the payoff immediately but the One who holds the universe has your records of faithfulness in the back of His mind. God help me to be faithful in harvesting, help me work overtime, go out of my way. Correct me if I am wrong, overtime is time and a half and sometimes double time right? could God reward overtime? Why not, can&#8217;t wait for my pay. If the devil is working overtime, why can&#8217;t we? .

She was married to Elkanah who also had another wife called Peninnah. We are not told who was the first wife of the two, we are told Elkanah loved Hannah more than Peninnah for we see how they get treated when it came to getting gifts<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Vs 4&amp;5, &#8220;And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife&#8230; vs. 4 But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah&#8221;<\/strong>.\u00a0 God had blessed Peninnah with the fruit of the womb, she had children while Hannah was barren for the Lord had [closed her womb. You would think her\u00a0 joy would come from all these.\u00a0 In life we always assume that people who have riches are happy because they can afford to have anything they want but most of the time they are the most miserable people.<\/p>\n<p>Hannah may have been ok with her situation until her rival Peninnah began to provoke her severely to make her miserable according to<strong>1Samuel 1:<\/strong>6 and I am not surprised for I saw this between Leah and Rachel, Jacob\u2019s wives who had the same rival. Leah had children, Rachel did not, Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and therefore Leah provoked her daily and that made Rachel desire a child. Hannah was provoked so much that she desired a child of her own too. We too can be provoked by people around us to desire bigger cars, bigger houses, bigger promotions, bigger ministries or anything you could be provoked to want but the question is,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0what is the motive that drives you to pray<\/span><\/strong>. Yes they are good things that one can desire to have but the motive for desiring them can be wrong. &#8220;I want to be big that I may fit in, or feel better than someone else, or not feel rejected, or that my pride may get the best of me&#8221; remember<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>James 4:3, &#8220;Ye ask and receive not, because you ask a miss, that you may consume it upon your lusts&#8221;. In other words<\/strong>\u00a0at times when we ask, it&#8217;s for the wrong reasons, even something good. Hannah desired a child, question is, what was her motive? Did she want a child to get back at her rival, or did she want a child so that she could\u00a0 feel blessed too,\u00a0 or that she would not be attacked any more? Any of the above could have been her motive and therefore, year in year out she prayed but God would not answer her prayers. Don&#8217;t blame God for not answering your prayers when you know for sure that if He answered them, you will not go to church anymore, you will not give Him glory, you will be prideful. God will not give you something He knows will destroy you until you begin to get your act together. Some people desire to be in a relationship, married, used of God, etc, the question is what is your motive?<\/p>\n<p>Hannah may have revisited her year in year out prayers and saw how selfish her prayers was and how God would not respond to such a prayer because we see her pray in<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>1Samuel 1:11, &#8220;Then She made avow and said, &#8220;O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maid servant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, no razor shall come upon his head&#8221;.<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">This is effective praying<\/span><\/strong>, this is the type of prayer that supersedes\u00a0 our selfish desires and ambitions for we begin to see that anything God is going to bring our way is not for us but for many. He may entrust it in our custody but it&#8217;s not for us. Her vow was to allow her son to be God&#8217;s servant all the days of his life, I could imagine God saying &#8220;I\u2019ve waited\u00a0 for you to pray like this for I now know for sure that honor and glory will come back to me&#8221;. After she prayed this prayer, her desire was granted but more than she had asked for. She asked for a male child, God gave her a prophet<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Ephesians 3:20, &#8220;Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now I understand why many people cannot be used of God, they will love the praises of men and God will not get any of it.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>2Cor 4:7, &#8220;But we have this treasure in the earthen vessels that<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">the excellence of the power maybe of God and not of us<\/span><\/strong><strong>&#8220;.<\/strong>\u00a0The bible says that our God<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>is a jealous God<\/strong>\u00a0and He will not share His glory with no one else. About 12 years ago God could not use me fully for every time He did something through me, I took the credit in the sense that when people thanked me, I responded &#8220;you are welcome&#8221; instead of saying give God all the glory. He began to work in me and then trusted me with the work again and the more I gave Him the glory, the more He used me; the more I decreased, the more he increased because my motives were now right. When I pray now for a promotion, a better place to live, and to be used more is because I want to glorify Him in all things and many may be blessed through the elevation for it&#8217;s all about Him. My motive is to build a testimony that many may know that God is able. John the Baptist was told that Jesus was doing the work that John should have been doing, his response,<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>John 3:30, &#8220;He must increase, that I may decrease&#8221;.<\/strong>Because of Hannah&#8217;s change of prayer attitude, Samuel is born to become of the greatest prophets for he served many. Yes the mother rejoiced to have received a male child (prophet), God used His gift to the woman to reach many, God also blessed her some more<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>1 Samuel 2:21, \u201cAnd the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters.

Instead of blaming God or asking themselves and the Lord why they were in such situations, they began to praise and thank God for counting them worthy to go through it. Their prayers in situations like that changed as they saw an opportunity to pray to God to do something greater for Himself while they were in the situation. This is why I say, \u201cdon\u2019t waste your trying moments\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>There has been great persecution of believers in some parts of India. While we would want to pray for persecution to stop, you know what most of them are praying? That they will be bold to stand firm in their walk and in their preaching. What an effective prayer and why pray in this manner? they understand that through adversities, the gospel spreads like wild fire. The more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites and even killed them, the more they multiplied and grew Exodus 1:12 and so is India and many other countries where there is great persecution yet it\u2019s not silencing the gospel.<\/p>\n<p>Acts 4, Peter and John are arrested for preaching Christ; they had just performed a miracle that started the trouble. They were then brought before the high priest and their family members and with boldness, Peter preached Christ. Even with that they threatened them the most not to preach Jesus, Acts 4:17-21. How would you have prayed in this situation? probably for the persecution to stop, but they prayed in this way<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>vs. 29, \u201cNow, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word\u201d,<\/strong>\u00a0they were not going to let adversities dictate what they could do, they saw it as an opportunity to preach the word and their cry to God was for boldness. They refused to waste their trying period.<\/p>\n<p>Then we see Paul and Silas in Acts 16 perform a miracle by casting out demonic forces out of a girl who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling Acts 16:16. The girl\u2019s masters seeing their lost means of income, dragged Paul and Silas before the magistrate, falsely accusing them of many things. They were beaten severely, thrown in prison, their feet locked, and even having guards to securely watch them. In that situation, the bible says, vs. 25.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>At midnight Paul and Silas were<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">praying<\/span>\u00a0and singing hymns to God, and<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">the prisoners were listening to them<\/span><\/strong><strong>\u201d,<\/strong>\u00a0what did they pray for, to get out? I doubt it. I believe they preached Christ and then prayed for the prisoners\u2019 hearts to be softened to receive the gospel. Then<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Acts 16:26, \u201cSuddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone\u2019s chains were loosed.<\/strong>\u201d, it appears their work there was almost done until the prison keeper awoke from his sleep, almost killed himself because he thought all the prisoners had escaped but Paul assured him they were all present.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Vs 30, \u201cAnd he brought them out and said, \u201cSirs, what must I do to be saved?\u201d<\/strong><strong><sup>\u00a0<\/sup><\/strong><strong><sup>31<\/sup><\/strong><strong>\u00a0So they said, \u201cBelieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household<\/strong>.\u201d Imagine if they just sat there nursing their pain and complaining to God, they would have wasted their trial moments instead they maximized the opportunity to preach, pray, give praise to God through singing and led the prison keeper and his family to the Lord. They too refused to waste their trying moments. After it was said and done, I could see them saying, &#8220;it was worth the experience&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>You could be sick and may end up in hospital, or are facing the worst trying time and feel like asking God the \u201cWhy\u201d question, or feeling persecuted at work to name a few. What is your prayer when you feel like you are between a rock and a hard place? Are you going to waste your trying moments by complaining or pray to God to show you how to maximize every opportunity in that trying moment?.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>James 5:16, \u201c\u2026The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">avails much<\/span><\/strong><strong>\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0, your effective prayer will avail much.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Read this testimony about the lady we were praying for last week concerning her trying moment and how she maximized.<\/p>\n<p>Dear Bro Olang in Christ,<\/p>\n<p>All Glory and Honour to our Mighty God.<\/p>\n<p>Sister Rani is getting discharged from the hospital today.

John tells us of Jesus relationship to Lazarus, Mary and Martha (sisters and brother).\u00a0 John says, Mary is the one who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil.<\/font> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">When Lazarus was sick<\/font><b><font face=\"Times New Roman\">, vs. 3. &#8220;&#8230;the sisters sent to Him, saying, &#8220;Lord, behold, he whom<\/font><\/b><b><u> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">You love<\/font><\/u><font face=\"Times New Roman\"> is sick.&#8221; Vs 5. &#8220;Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus<\/font><\/b><font face=\"Times New Roman\">&#8220;. John stresses the word love for a reason. There was such a bond, such connection. Anything they may have needed the One who loved them would provide if they asked. Lazarus is sick, they ask (pray) the Lord to come and heal. We would expect Jesus to rise up and rush to the aid of His friends He loved. Well, we are told He stayed where He was for two more days. I believe Jesus knew Lazarus would die and He let him die, He did not even make it to the burial. What was the mind of Christ in this situation and how would have others processed His mind?<\/font><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Let&#8217;s find out why He did not respond to their prayer when they needed Him the most. He had a bigger picture in mind than what Lazarus&#8217; sisters and others would have thought. For them a brother alive and well was good enough, while Jesus had a different way of looking at it<\/font><b><font face=\"Times New Roman\">, 1<\/font><\/b><font face=\"Times New Roman\">. This was a situation that would allow God the Father to be glorified in it and so was His Son glorified through it,<\/font><b> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">vs. 4. &#8220;When Jesus heard that, He said, &#8220;This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.<\/font><\/b><font face=\"Times New Roman\"> 2. He wanted the situation to build the disciples faith far beyond healing<\/font><b> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">vs. 15, &#8220;And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe&#8221;, 3.<\/font><\/b> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">He wanted to show those who were present that He was sent of God and had the power to resurrect the ones He loves (salvation)<\/font><b> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">vs. 41,<\/font><\/b><font face=\"Times New Roman\"> &#8220;<\/font><b><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, &#8220;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.<sup> 42<\/sup> And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the people who are standing by I said this, that they may believe that You sent Me.&#8221; T<\/font><\/b><font face=\"Times New Roman\">he sisters and the people who came to mourn did not have the mind of Christ otherwise they would have seen the bigger picture. Mary and Martha both said &#8220;<\/font><b><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died&#8221;<\/font><\/b> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">at different times,<\/font><b> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">vs. 36, &#8220;Then the Jews said, &#8220;See how He loved him!&#8221;<sup> 37<\/sup> And some of them said, &#8220;Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, also have kept this man from dying?&#8221;<\/font><\/b> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">minds limited to the natural human thinking.<\/font><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Jesus on the other hand wanted to pray the heart of the Father in the situation. How about when the devil desired to sift Simon Peter, the Lord did not rebuke the devil, what did He tell Peter,<\/font><b> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">Luke 22:31, And the Lord said, &#8220;Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat.<sup> 32<\/sup> But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.&#8221;,<\/font><\/b> <font face=\"Times New Roman\">Again we see the Lord addressing a bigger picture. The bigger picture show that it&#39;s way bigger than us and our needs. When we have the mind of Christ, our approach to effective praying would be through His eyes and not ours. Making prayers that are Christ centered and for it to be Christ centered, it has to begin with the mind of Christ.<\/font><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><\/font><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>James 5:16, &#8220;\u2026The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much&#8220; What comes out of our mouths in prayer reveals what&#8217;s in our mind and heart when we pray.

And what a blessing to bring needs before the Lord and I always do. Not too long ago the Lord began to deal with me about praying for needs, something bigger than what I am used to praying. Hope I can lay some groundwork first and then give examples from the bible about effective prayers that avails much.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I am constantly reminded that prayer is not so much about what I get but how I am changed by it and in it<\/span><\/strong>. And because prayer changes me, it changes how I approach God too for my needs and needs of others. For example, if you were to pray for someone\u2019s salvation, how would you pray? You may pray something like this, \u201cLord save my loved one, so that he can know you and go to heaven when he dies\u201dNothing wrong with that, what I will call an effective prayer for a lost one would be something like this, \u201cLord awaken my loved one lost in sin, rebelling against you, Lord help them see their deep sin and wound their pride and ego, take away anything that cloud their minds and blocks their eyes even if it\u2019s a good thing, that they may surrender to you in repentance and faith. Lord I\u2019m not praying that you save my loved one so that he can go to heaven, I\u2019m praying that you save my loved one for your glory, so that He can serve you, live for you, walk with you, and one day be with you in heaven\u201d, it\u2019s easy to pray for salvation when you see how it will benefit you, \u201cif my loved ones are saved, I will see them in heaven; oh and the fights at home will stop; at least we can raise our children in the things of God as we would be in agreement, he can be better husband, treating me right etc\u201d, all these are ok prayers, but not effective to avail much, why?<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>James 4:3, \u201cYou ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss,<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that you may spend it on your pleasures<\/span><\/strong>\u201d, either we do not ask for the right ends or not in a right manner, not in faith or fervency. There is amiss in those prayers that takes God off the focus and places the focus on the person you are interceding for.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Where there is amiss, there is a drift.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How about praying for someone else who has a need, instead of first praying that God provide the need, how about you pray that God will establish their faith. If you are praying for them and they are doubting, how will that be effective? Jesus performed miracles based on the individual\u2019s faith,<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Matthew 9:22, \u201cBut Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, \u201c<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Be of good cheer, daughter; your faith has made you well.<\/span>\u201d And the woman was made well from that hour<\/strong>.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Matthew 9:29, \u201cThen He touched their eyes, saying, \u201c<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">According to your faith let it be to you.\u201d<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0Their faith gave God the glory. In praying also, why not sometimes pray that in that situation God would grow them more in holiness, patience, establish their character, integrity, that the blessing may be more to His glory than for what it means to them and to you. Praying His will may to prevail.<\/p>\n<p>In our own needs we could be praying \u201cGod get me out of this\u201d or pray effectively, \u201cLord teach me to endure, teach me self denial, help me learn all that I need to learn in my situation. Help me see the bigger picture than what I desire for you to do in my life\u201d. We often hear declarations in prayers \u201cclaim it and receive it\u201d, that can be dangerous and this is why, you may not have the character and integrity to maintain the blessing, so what was supposed to be a blessing turns into a curse, how about we pray, \u201cLord prepare me, show me my pride, my stinginess, build a strong foundation in me, help me grow in the fruit of the spirit, perform what is best to your glory\u201d.

A CT scan showed a blood clot in the vein that passes thru  her lower abdomen. this happened two weeks back when she was travelling on a  scooter with her family (husband and two daughters) . The scooter skid and they  fell off the bike. she hurt her stomach but did not realise then as it was an  internal injury. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:sans-serif;font-size:85%;\">First the doctors  tried to link it with  her last years report which had showed stones in the  gall bladder but she was healed at the King&#8217;s Temple Church, Secunderabad in  August 2008 and she had given a testimony on this healing. We believed in the  Lord&#8217;s promise in Isaiah 55:10-11 and the first miracle happened. It was not the  gall bladder problem Halleluiah. It was the clot in her lower abdomen that was  troubling her. the doctors say this needs to be dissolved but with great care  and it is risky to do it. I don&#8217;t want to say how and what  the doctors  feel about it as I  believe in our Lord with whom All things are possible.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:sans-serif;font-size:85%;\">Tomorrow the doctors will start the  process.

I know of divine (miracle) healing or using doctors to bring to treat but He gets the glory. There are some religions that rule out God&#8217;s ability to bring healing by medicine, that&#8217;s a lie to be rejected. We cannot limit God to what He can and cannot use. He has a lot of ways and means to heal. You could be needing healing this morning but right in the back of your mind, you are condemning yourself thinking that the reason why you are sick is because of a sin in your life. Let me tell you,<b> God is not the author of sickness; He is the author of healing.<u> Sickness gives Him an opportunity to demonstrate His power<\/u><\/b>. Satan is the author of all kinds of problems including sickness, &#8220;<b>John 10:10, &#8220;The thief (Satan, devil) does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy<\/b>. Jesus says, &#8220;<b>I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly<\/b>&#8220;. This is not just for spiritual life but also physical. God desires that we maybe healed for His glory. He is  sovereign over all. <\/p>\n<p>In my text, Naaman comes to Elisha sick with leprosy. A slave girl mentioned there was a prophet who could heal him yet Naaman does so many wrong things before his actual healing takes place simply because he was proud and arrogant. When he comes to Elisha, he has his own idea of how he should be healed. Elisha is about to teach him that healing is far beyond praying for someone and they get healed. He sends his messenger to tell Naaman to go and wash seven times in the river Jordan. Does Elisha know that Naaman is a captain? deals with Kings? has servants beneath him? instead of him even coming to meet him, he sends a messenger (servant) to tell him to go and wash in a dirty river. What a nerve!!!!. That is what is wrong with many who come to Christ today,<u><b> they want to come and serve Christ in their terms<\/b><\/u>! they exercise that mentality in everything in their lives including healing. Here is the thing, God&#8217;s way or no way, you are the one in need of a touch not God.<u><b> You have to humble yourself, have faith in God to do whatever He says<\/b><\/u>. Naaman is very upset and ready to go back home because he feels Elisha has insulted him. Finally his servants convinces him to do it cause had Elisha asked him for something big and greater, he would have done it. Out of what Naaman was suppose to do, Elisha had no gain in it, it was all to Naaman&#8217;s benefit. <\/p>\n<p>Finally he goes and deeps himself in the river 7 times, gets healed and has a better skin compared to how his skin was before he had leprosy. You might say, the healing was waiting for him at the river, NO,<u><b> the healing took place the moment he humbled himself, had faith and moved<\/b><\/u>.<b> Mark 16:17, &#8220;And these signs will follow those who believe..<\/b>&#8220;<u><b> miracles are the aftermath of having faith that it can be done<\/b><\/u>. Naaman&#8217;s victory was not in the miracle. It&#8217;s like God depositing healing in your bank account. The moment you believed that He could deposit it that was your victory there, the miracle becomes a confirmation. Signs and wonders only follow those who have believed. Have faith, that is where your healing lies. Laying hands on you and praying over you are the after math. Remember victory is not in the miracle, victory is in the faith you have in God.

Graduations tend to be one of those happy times seeing someone graduating. Surrounded by family and friends. Because it&#8217;s a joyous day, you will not find anyone in such occasions sad. But go back to what led to this occasion and find a lot of hard work, sleepless nights working on unending projects, writing reports, researching, studying etc, There were times of feeling like giving up but still endured to make it till the end. A goal was set and had to be worked towards. One thing that strikes me out of all these,<\/span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\"><u><\/u><\/span><\/span><u><b><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\"> <\/span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\">the plan did not change for things to take place; one had to gain strength and confidence to work out the plan already executed<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/u><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\"><b><\/b><\/span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\">.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\">How often do we hope that things will change when they get hard and complicated. We even pray for the Lord to move and change them. He has set the plan that you can see at the end of the tunnel but you hope that the burden will get easier for you to make it through. I am here to let you know that the Lord will not rearrange the process because it&#8217;s the process He is using to put you together.<\/span><\/span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\"><u><\/u><\/span><u><b><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\"> <\/span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\">The process is the recipe to produce an end result<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/u><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\"><b><\/b><\/span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\">.

It&#8217;s required to endure meaning to carry you through to continue in existence.<\/span><\/span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\"><u><\/u><\/span><u><b><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\"> <\/span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\">So don&#8217;t pray for the rearrangement of the process, pray for the strength to endure the process<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/u><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\"><b><\/b><\/span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\">. Night can be associated with loneliness, darkness not seeing what lies a head and believe me, it can be long. At times when it&#8217;s getting to dawn, it becomes even darker, that reminds us of the students when they are about to graduate, more endurance to study for the finals and it becomes hectic and hard but the student just can&#8217;t give up at dawn, their joy in the morning is just around the corner when they finish the finals and pass. They may endure alone in the night, but thank God it&#8217;s not forever.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\">The bible says in<\/span><\/span><b><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\"> <\/span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\">Psalm 126:5, &#8220;Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/b><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:'trebuchet ms';\">, how that is so true and that is why we need God everyday to give us strength to go on. It is hard and we all know for sure, we need a bigger hand not to change what we are facing but give us the strength and grace to endure through the night. The endurance has a lot of lessons you cannot learn in a classroom. Martha Stewart learnt a lot in prison while she endured her night. She confessed that there are things she would have never learnt in any other way had she not gone through what she went through. You have a greater testimony when you endure so whatever you are going through today, don&#8217;t ask God to change it, ask Him for strength to go on, your joy is about to come and you are about to reap too.

What is my purpose? Is my presence in this earth even significant? How do I play part in history. Discovering who you are and your purpose builds hope to know that you are not here in vain. Those who have terminated their lives often tend to have lost hope and purpose in life. There is nothing else to live for so why live.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard for many of my friends to believe I grew up a very shy boy, I never felt that there was more I could do in life. I felt who I was, was all I could be. My brothers and sister could do different things, myself, I did  not feel able or capable of doing anything, especially standing before a congregation to speak. I was so shy that I told everyone that the day they would put me before a congregation, someone needed to make sure there was an ambulance outside waiting to drive me to the emergency room. It&#8217;s always easy to think that what you have now is all you got,  What I came to realize as time went by in my walk and growth in the Lord was that all the treasures I needed to give me a purpose and worth in this life was not from<b> WITHOUT<\/b> but from<b> WITHIN<\/b>. It was always there waiting to be discovered. The ability to teach, preach, encourage, witness etc was always there. I often thought that God had to bring something new, no; it was always present within me. It&#8217;s about knowing where it should be and searching far and wide. Looking for it in the wrong places will not make you find it however diligent you may try.<b> Matthew 6:21, &#8220;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also<\/b>&#8220;. Why do people look so hard?, because they think their treasure is out there, their hearts wander but the good news is, the treasure has always been within therefore the heart needs to be directed to the right place where the treasure is. It&#8217;s not your boyfriend or girl friend that gives you meaning in life, it&#8217;s God who does. It&#8217;s not even your wife or husband or your boss but God. In other words, you have to look down deep within yourself and see what God deposited in you to discover. What tanks within you are still left unopened? <\/p>\n<p><b>2 Corinthians 4:7, &#8220;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels<\/b>&#8220;, whenever we talk about treasures, we are not talking about cheap, broken, useless things, we are talking about valuable and precious possessions. These are things that ought to be guarded by all means, things that you don&#8217;t just let anyone on. God has placed such great treasures in each of us, the earthen vessels. I want you to see something out of this, first, you are a vessel, a container, a jar. No one makes a vessel if he has nothing to put in it,<b> God made you a vessel because He had a treasure in mind to put in you, so you have a purpose and meaning in this life<\/b>. Second, the vessel becomes meaningful when someone looks at the what is placed in it, this is what gives the vessel value. God has placed His Son Jesus Christ in your heart, the greatest treasure of them all.<b> Luke 6:45, &#8220;A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good<\/b>&#8220;. You bring out the good because Christ in you is the treasure, the greatest possession you have. As we know we don&#8217;t bring out good because we are good, we bring out good because He is good.<b> Isaiah 33:6&#8230;the fear of the LORD is his treasure&#8221;. Christ in you is enough to help you open the vessels with the talents, gifting and abilities you never knew you had.<\/b> I took time to discover my treasures by trying them out with the help of God, the more I did, the more I saw life differently and the more I became fulfilled in Him. You might have not known you could sing, teach, encourage, build etc,  you may have thought all you have now is all you are. You may have even tried finding it out there. You can discover your God hidden treasures by not looking from without but looking from within. What is it that God  deposited in you and you never took time to find out because you were busy trying to find it somewhere else? It&#8217;s hidden to be discovered.

Salvation is the beginning of ones new life in Christ and not the end. We are sealed at the salvation stage and then the growth begins.<b> Salvation is free, the growth and the anointing will cost you.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Mary visited Elizabeth when they were both pregnant. Both women were carrying seeds they never worked for and did not contribute to their existence in their wombs. The reason they carried the seeds was because they were<b> CHOSEN<\/b>. We too have been chosen by God to carry seeds as He is in need of us to accomplish certain things in this life for His kingdom. Every one has something that they can do for the Kingdom of God. Mary was pregnant with the Messiah, the Savior of the world and Elizabeth was pregnant with the preparer of the way. Both have different gifts but significant. Whichever good seed you are carrying it&#8217;s significant whether it be small or big. We are all called to be followers but not everyone is led to be a preacher, pastor, worship leader, manager or the like. You may have been led to be an encourager, singer, or prayer warrior. Some have been led to reach out to certain people no one can reach but them. Being faithful in carrying that seed will cause you to be fulfilled and that requires hard work. <\/p>\n<p>When these two women met and greeted each other, the baby in Elizabeth leaped for joy and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. There is something about getting yourself close to those of the same spirit, same faith, growing in the Lord. Part of my growth has been contributed by others. Their life style and ministry provoked me to desire more of the Lord and talking to them, I always find that it cost them dearly to be where they are with the Lord. In every area be it in prayer, reading the word, doing memory verses, preaching, I had someone somewhere provoking me to get to where I needed to be. They were like God sent messengers to stir up something in me what He wanted to do in my life and the awakening is what I needed.  This pushed me to adjust my life style, cut down things that hindered and slowed me down. I had to learn to deny myself things that brought about temporary pleasure and pursue Godly things. &#8220;<b>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence,<u> work out your own salvation with fear and trembling<\/u>, Phil 2:12<\/b>.&#8221;, there are no shortcuts to growth.

They had work to do, nature the babies when they were born until they were of age to fulfill the call of God in their lives. It was hard work to raise these babies. We are not led to be cheerleaders in the kingdom, we are players in a team who need to be in uniform then find our position in the field and be the player God wants us to be. Not every one can play defense, some play offense. Find your place in the kingdom and be active in it. Carry the seed, carry the fruits and change your entire surrounding because you are chosen. Surround yourself with those who challenge your walk. Be pregnant with destiny that heights, depths, principalities, rulers of darkness, spiritual wickedness, things present not even the things to come will abort the seed inside of you.<b> Use your talents God has given you because God has chosen you for a time like this and &#8220;Blessed are you among women (men), and blessed is the fruit of your womb<\/b>!&#8221;.

I discipline myself through my struggles to read my bible and pray. It&#8217;s easy to do these things when you feel like it yet there is more to it than feelings, it&#8217;s all about discipline. As already said, getting into the presence of God and praying is hard but there is such a great joy when you do it. How often do we first try to do something, when it does not work out that is when we remember prayer?, I do. I think it&#8217;s a guy thing. Women are quick to ask for direction when they get lost, men try hard to find their way and sometimes get frustrated when encouraged to ask for directions.<\/p>\n<p>In Luke 8:24, Jesus tells his disciples, &#8220;<b>Let us cross over to the other side of the lake<\/b>&#8221; and they launched out. It was Jesus idea to cross over with them. Being told to come from the familiar to the unfamiliar; from what they knew to what they did not know. There are people who get sea sick and there are people who are afraid of heights. No one is afraid of the ground because the ground is solid and you trust that it&#8217;s going to hold you up.. You do not need help with what you know, it&#8217;s what you don&#8217;t know. You may try get to help after failing to do it yourself. In this case, everything seams to be going well while Jesus is in the hindermost parts of the ship sleeping. The disciples seem to have everything under control, when all of a sudden there comes a storm. In the midst of the storm, they try to do everything to steady the ship and when all fails they remember that Jesus was on board \u2026<b> vs. 24, And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, &#8220;Master, Master, we are perishing<\/b>!&#8221;<b> Philippians 4:6, &#8220;Be anxious for nothing&#8221;<\/b> these men were anxious (very worried); they did not even stop to calm themselves down. All that consumed their mind was drowning. They had faith in Jesus but that faith seams to have leaped in the storm. Our faith should not disappear while in the storm, if anything, that is the time we need it the most. Had they meditated on the fact that Jesus was on board, they would have not worried, in fact it should have increased their faith. Think of it this way, if the storm came so strong, do you think Jesus would have drowned? Can God drown? That was enough to build their faith. &#8220;<b>but in<u> everything<\/u> by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God,<\/b> Instead of freaking out and trying to do it themselves they could have called on Jesus on board. See, it says &#8220;in everything&#8221;, not some things. At times we feel like He is far away when we are in a storm when in the actual sense, He is with us and in us, on board. These men had an urgent need; their cry to Jesus was earnest and fervent. They called on Him, what took them so long to do it? Simple, they tried doing it themselves. The bible says<b> Romans 10:13, &#8220;For &#8220;whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved.&#8221;<\/b> Easy to thank God when it&#8217;s done but here we are being reminded to thank God after making our petition in a situation. <\/p>\n<p><b>vs. 7 and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus&#8221;.<\/b> Jesus wakes up and first deals with the situation,  He says to the wind<b> Mark 4:39, &#8220;&#8230;Peace, be still&#8221;,<\/b> I see this as not just speaking peace to the wind but also speaking peace to the disciples. This is the peace that originates from God, it&#8217;s the peace that does not make sense cause they came back to speak to themselves saying, &#8220;What manner of man is this that even the winds obey His voice&#8221;, (paraphrased). Why peace and not deliverance? Peace can make you comfortable in a storm. Jesus was comfortable, sleeping peacefully in the ship knowing that He could never drown. When He woke up, He didn&#8217;t even make the ship move faster to the land.<u><b> He wasn&#8217;t going to be subject to the situation, the situation was going to be subject to Him<\/b><\/u>. Showing the wind who is boss. Jesus presence was peace alone and they could not be afraid anymore even if there came another storm. They did not even tell Jesus that they should to go back to the land. They had a journey started and yet to be finished so they needed to ride through by faith in Him who was on board.

If the angels who I would consider more holy than man could gaze upon the Lord and cover their faces because of His holiness, how much more should we fear God and reverence in his presence? None of us comes even close. At least those who are saved are better off yet we still fall short of God&#8217;s glory. What about the lost souls? To quote<b> Matthew Henry<\/b><b><u>&#8221; Those who are to teach others the knowledge of God ought to be well acquainted with Him themselves<\/u><\/b>&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>I am a sinner; particularly, I have offended in word; and who is there that has not?. We are unworthy and unfit to take God&#8217;s name into our lips. With what a pure lip did the angels praise God! &#8220;But,&#8221; says the prophet, &#8220;I cannot praise him so, for I am a man of unclean lips.&#8217; The impurity of our lips ought to be the grief of our souls, for by our words we shall be justified or condemned. It&#8217;s by the lips man curses God, uses His name as a curse word. Here is a man slain by the holiness of God, to have this experience, his thought could have been, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t the holiness of God slay me when He saw the sin in my life&#8221;. I ask myself this question many times.<\/p>\n<p><u><b>Holiness is not what God does but who He is<\/b><\/u>. God&#8217;s holiness is not tainted or corrupted. His character will not let Him turn blind eye to sin and let people go free. Because of his goodness, He will serve justice. He has done everything to rescue man from His wrath and by repentance towards Himself and faith in His Son, He will save.<b> &#8220;God&#8217;s holiness demands that all sin be punished, but God&#8217;s love provides the plan and way of redemption for sinful man&#8221; Billy Graham.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Vs \ufeff6\ufeff Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from \ufeffthe altar. \ufeff7\ufeff And he \ufefftouched my mouth with it, and said: &#8220;Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, And your sin \ufeffpurged.&#8221;, <\/b> the live coal directly to Isaiah&#8217;s mouth was a symbolic act of forgiveness.<u><b> This action suggests that no painless cure exists for sin<\/b><\/u>.

When they cry out &#8220;I&#8217;m undone then we give them grace. Why tell a sinner &#8220;God loves them and has a wonderful plan for their lives&#8221; when in actuality God is angry with sinners daily?. Are we not supposed to be witnesses? Meaning we share what we have seen, heard and experienced? Why try to change the message unless we have not experienced it ourselves or ignorant of it.<\/p>\n<p>Those who have such an experience will have a new appreciation for grace. We sing Amazing grace and so are the lost and many times it appears to both sides as just another hymn with nice melody. How about we revisit the lyrics and bring us back to what it meant to be in sin and appreciate the words more and then turn and show sinners who God is. When they see who God is in His laws, they will see themselves in themselves undone and in need of a Savior and when they have been converted, they too will answer to the call. Let us to cry out to God for passion and compassion then respond to His call. If you are lukewarm, may an Isaiah&#8217;s experience awaken you. I challenge you to pray then get up, get out and this month witness to at least ONE lost soul as a start if you are not already sharing.

He saw the posts of the door shaken by the voice that terrified him, but nothing terrified him, I believe, like His sin made clear by the holiness of God. Think of it this way, you are dusting your table in the morning, it appears very clean after you dust it, then you open the windows for the early morning sunlight to come in. To your horror, you see dust on the table you just cleaned, and you see dust in the air. Would you say the light created dust? Of course not, the light merely exposed what the natural eyes could not see. Isaiah&#8217;s experience was like the Lord pulled the curtain of the holy of holies\u00a0 and he saw the sin (dust) in his life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span>Have we see our deep sins to cry &#8220;<\/span><b><span>Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips&#8221;?<\/span><\/b> <span>The question we need to ask ourselves is, is sin a disease or a crime? Most of us may consider sin as a disease, God considers it a crime. Would you call yourself wretched (meaning a person of great hardship, deprivation, and hopelessness)? Many believers believe they are sinners but have never had the curtains of the holy of holies pulled back to show them their deepest darkness so that they can see how wretched they are. We sing it in the hymn Amazing grace in the line &#8220;\u2026<\/span><b> <span>that saved a<\/span><\/b><b><u> <span>Wretch<\/span><\/u><span> like me<\/span><\/b><span>&#8220;, easy to sing what we don&#8217;t mean\/understand. These are the things that wake us up to our condition and especially to the condition of the ungodly. If we found ourselves hopeless having seen our sins with no way of escape until God saved us, how can we assume and be comfortable that the lost will find away out unless we become the witness of what we have seen and experienced? Woe is me, I&#8217;m a man of unclean lips Isaiah says, vs. 5, &#8220;\u2026<\/span><u><\/u><u><b><span>And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><span>; For my eyes have seen the King, The LORD of hosts.<\/span><\/b> <span>Here is a man who was shown his condition and\u00a0 instead of looking at others first, he decides to start with himself and right there and then begins to think about the fate of those who are just like him. Having seen the King, the Lord of hosts and did not die shows how the goodness of God preserved him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span>At this point he is not only concerned for himself, he is also concerned for the people around him.<\/span><b> <span>2 Corinthians 5:11, &#8220;<\/span><\/b><b><u><span>Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men;&#8221;<\/span><\/u><\/b><span> Isaiah&#8217;s vision made him painfully aware of his sin and broke him, in this way God would prepare him for<\/span><b> <span>his cleansing<\/span><\/b> <span>and<\/span><b> <span>his commission.<\/span><\/b> <span>If we are convinced by our own thoughts that God is all loving and will accept everyone, there would be no drive to change and be used. When we learn the terror of the Lord from our own experience with the Lord, it will ignite something in us to hunger for cleansing and have a deep desire and passion to warn those who are lost and bring them to the saving knowledge and grace of Jesus Christ.

Everything is normal, we come to church, we sing songs, we pray, we hear the word, we are involved in ministries but have we had an experience that awakens us to HUNGER for more?. How can we be hungry when we feel full by what we do day to day. Isaiah had seen the state of his people, the question is, was he hungry enough for God to move in his life and use him to reach his people? Not until he had an experience that messed his comfort. When we see the Lord sitting on the throne, high and lifted up, Righteousness and justice as foundation of His throne Psalm 97:2, Psalm 89:14 and we see how Holy He is and we are convinced,<b> &#8220;.. we are all like an unclean thing, And all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags; We all fade as a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, Have taken us away&#8221;, Isaiah 64:6<\/b>, we will not be ready for change.

He thought to impose upon the prophet, but soon found that the Spirit of prophecy could not be deceived, and that it was in vain to lie to the Holy Ghost. What you crave for is what you will be opened to pursue. While the world craves for happiness and pursues it, we as believers ought to pursue righteousness. Paul in his life had things he pursued which were assets to him but when Christ met him, all his assets he characterized as liabilities. There was nothing as fulfilling as living for Christ., <b> Philippians 3: 7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ<\/b>&#8220;, the more he pursued Christ, the more he was content. One act of untamed passions destroyed Gehazi, his health, his family, his reputation, tainted his character, his ministry, his destiny.

After Elijah was taken to heaven, Elisha became the next prophet and he too had a servant by the name of Gehazi. Gehazi was instrumental in Elisha&#8217;s ministry. We see him play an important role in identifying how the Shunammite woman in 2kings 4 could be blessed with a child for her generosity. Who knows whether Gehazi was also being prepped to take Elisha&#8217;s position when he was gone. Prophets would receive gifts for their ministry and their servants I believe were also part of the gifts as they served. In this episode, Naaman, a commander in the army of Assyria comes to Elisha to be healed of his leprosy. Vs 5, &#8220;&#8230;So Naaman started out, carrying as gifts 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold, and ten sets of clothing&#8221; (NLT). This man came fully loaded, with the best and greatest gift a prophet would have ever received. He is sent to the river Jordan to deep himself seven times; he fights it and then reluctantly agrees to it. Long story short, he comes back rejoicing having been healed of leprosy. He then says, vs. 15 &#8220;&#8230;Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.&#8221; And Elisha would not receive the gift though it was customary for Prophets to receive such gifts. In our day today how many including preachers would have sent this man back with his gift? I choose to believe the reason for not accepting the gift was to show that the miracles of God are free and cannot be bought, as a result he was humbled and changed. For the first time he was worshiping the true God. Vs 17, &#8220;Then Naaman said, &#8220;All right, but please allow me to load two of my mules with earth from this place, and I will take it back home with me. From now on I will never again offer burnt offerings or sacrifices to any other god except the Lord&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Vs 20, &#8220;Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, &#8220;My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.&#8221; (NIV)&#8221; Gehazi sees a lost opportunity to receive the gifts he may have been eyeing. He may have worked hard to help Naaman because there was a reward in the end of it. Instead of rejoicing with Naaman and standing by his masters who chose to let go, he goes after Naaman behind Elisha&#8217;s back. Passions and greed rise up reminding us of the time Cain became angry with his brother Abel over their sacrifices to the Lord. Abel&#8217;s was received, Cain&#8217;s was rejected and the Lord said to Cain, Genesis 4:7, &#8220;If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it.&#8221; The sin of greed was crouching at Gehazi&#8217;s door but instead of mastering it, he yielded to it. This opened doors to what we will look at. Untamed passions takes a person off the Lord&#8217;s will, sets them up for disaster. It&#8217;s sin waiting to devour and must be mastered and none of us is not tempted with greed be it in small or large scale.

Then his next actions after what happened indicates he was ok with what was done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">The first thing, he approached Naboth about his vineyard, vs. 2  \u201cSo Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, \u201cGive me your  vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near, next to my house; and for it I will give you a vineyard better than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.\u201d I don\u2019t see anything wrong with his approach to desiring the vineyard and offering money or a better vineyard to Naboth. Where things began to change for Ahab is when Naboth chose to honor God by not willing to sell his vineyard. The reason was that the vineyard was his ancestral property. The Lord, the owner of all of the land of Israel, had forbidden Israelite families to surrender ownership of family lands permanently (Lev. 25:23\u201328; Num. 36:7\u20139). Out of loyalty to God, Naboth declined Ahab\u2019s offer. Instead of Ahab accepting Naboth\u2019s explanation, his ambition to get this vineyard drove him into depression indicating coveting and obsession spirit. He would rather have Naboth disobey God so as to  get what he wants. He had everything but still wanted Naboth\u2019s vineyard. How do you react when you can\u2019t get what you are ambitious to get? What are you willing to do to get it? How far are you willing to fulfill your ambitions? At what and whose expense? You may not think and act like Ahab, but the question is, would the Lord be pleased by what you are pursuing and how you are pursuing it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Upon Jezebel hearing what happened, the reason Ahab was depressed and would not eat, vs7 Then Jezebel his wife said to him, \u201cYou now exercise authority over Israel! Arise, eat food, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\u201d. His wife response was like you are the king, you can do whatever you want and get it. It\u2019s like forget about the true judgment, get what you are ambitious to have and if you find it hard, I will do it for you. Jezebel then wrote letters and sealed them with Ahab\u2019s name. In the letters there were lies accusing Naboth of blaspheming God and the king. This led to his death by being stoned. One man who wanted to honor God was accused of dishonoring God because one man was ambitious to get whatever did not belong to him tramping on his continuous that bring about judgment. .\u201d 16 So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Isn\u2019t it sad that ambitions have brought wedges upon some family members that sometimes people will go against their judgments so as to get what they are ambitious for, that which does not belong to them?. That they would do whatever it takes to get what is not theirs. People can also be very ambitious in business that it clouds their judgments, e.g. if they cannot get what they aspire for, there are driven to do shady business to get their way which in turn dishonors God. Check your motives, don&#8217;t let your ambitions in anyway cloud your judgment hence you dishonor God like Ahab, do what you need to do in line with God&#8217;s word and then learn to be content with what God has given you. One act of compromise could open doors for greater evil.

Rarely do I share along these lines, it&#8217;s not my priority message but I believe God blesses His people and uses these blessing to further His kingdom too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">If you were to receive a million bucks, you will have a list of things to do with it. A house may be first, then other things like investments, give to God to further His kingdom, feed the hungry and support the poor in Africa, Asia and even South America. Money can do a lot of things the bible tells us and we all know that to be true. We work for money, to pay our bills. We need money to live comfortably, you go to restaurant and money will be required of you. The world does not understand any language but the money language. Eat at a restaurant and try and offer faith to pay for your meals and see if it works. A man of faith needs money. I don&#8217;t live by luck but by faith, luck would mean playing lotto hoping to hit a jackpot, gambling hoping to win. We serve a God of too much; we can have faith in Him to provide what we need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Does God support prosperity, wealth, and money? Deuteronomy 8:18, &#8220;And you shall remember the LORD your God, for it is He who gives you power to get wealth&#8221;. Though this was a promise to the Israelites if they met required conditions, the principle still applies for us not the equivalent of a covenant. Though wealth here does not only talk about money but He does support it. He gives the power, the ability, skills, and ideas on how to gain it and then to complete it, He helps such people enjoy what He has provided them with. Ecclesiastes 2:24, &#8220;Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God. I would say, &#8220;Prosperity without God is trading on a dangerous path&#8221;. There are people today who are rich but are not enjoying what they have, it&#8217;s not bringing them peace or even joy, it has broken some families to mention a few. If every good and every perfect gift comes from above, the same author who provides prosperity is the same that will have to navigate it. Ecclesiastes 5:18, &#8220;&#8230;It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor in which he toiled under the sun all the days of his life which God gives him, for it his heritage. Vs. 19, &#8220;AS for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and given him power to eat of it, to receive his heritage and rejoice in his labor, this is the gift of God&#8221;. By just looking at the few verses, I don&#8217;t see any shortcut anywhere, it requires hard work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Prosperity could begin by having an idea, ability, talents and knowledge. Ecclesiastes 7:12, &#8220;For wisdom is a defense as money is a defense but the excellence of the knowledge is, wisdom gives life to those who have it&#8221;. Having wealth, prosperity, money whichever way you look at it requires wisdom to back it up for one to have life.  The scripture we just looked at says, wisdom gives life to them that have money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">The same bible that supports wealth and riches also warns seriously of what it can do to a person, Matthew 19:24, &#8220;And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God&#8221;. It&#8217;s very clear that riches have made man forget about God, no wonder Solomon, a man who God had given riches speaks these words to us in, Proverbs 30:8, &#8220;&#8230;Give me neither poverty nor riches&#8230;vs. 9, &#8220;Lest I be full and deny You and say, &#8220;Who is the Lord?&#8221; or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God&#8221;. Solomon had riches because God had blessed Him but at the same time he allowed things in his life such as the women he married and those who were his concubines turned his heart from God. 1Timonthy 6:10, &#8220;For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil&#8221;. For those who thought that money is evil, it&#8217;s not so, it&#8217;s the love of it. I would also say that lack of money is also the root of all kinds of evil according to proverbs 30:8. Even in hard work, ambitions can cloud your judgment. Contentment with God takes you far. The world craves for happiness, believers ought to crave for righteousness, what is your driving factor?.

In part one of &#8220;When to Contend&#8221;, Paul and Barnabas were in agreement and contended together against the Judaizers (Acts 15:1 \u2013 5).  However, now in Acts 15:39 they had such a disagreement that they ended up going their separate ways.  So the question remains who was right in this contention, Paul or Barnabas?  They had worked together for so long.  It was Barnabas that took Paul under his wing, and helped the disciples to receive Paul, as they previously knew him as Saul the murderer of those that were part of the Way.  Acts 9:26-27 says, &#8220;And \ufeff \ufeffwhen Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple. \ufeff27\ufeff \ufeffBut Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road.&#8221;  Barnabas validated Saul&#8217;s conversion on the road to Damascus to the Apostles that were fearful of him, and they obviously took trusted Barnabas, whose name means the son of encouragement.<br \/> However, despite the fact that Barnabas took Paul under his wing and I believe discipled him Paul would not exactly take on Barnabas&#8217; level of encouragement at that time in his life.  Barnabas was probably very patient and gracious toward Paul, but Paul did not seem to have the same attitude toward one, John Mark.  Paul and Barnabas and Paul&#8217;s disagreement was over whether to take Mark on the second journey.  He had deserted and part way through the first journey and Paul was not willing to risk the same thing happening again.  However, Barnabas was not prepared to journey without Mark.  Therefore the question remains, which was right, Paul or Barnabas?<br \/> One must examine both men in order to respond to this question as there is something to be said in favor of both men.  On Paul&#8217;s side is the fact that Luke records no sanction or disapproval.  The brothers in the church commend him to God&#8217;s grace as he leaves on the journey.  Luke writes positively about the immediate effect of the journey &#8211; churches are strengthened.  At the start of the next chapter Timothy enters the picture and we know from the rest of the New Testament that he goes on to play an important part in the work.  It almost seems as though he takes Mark&#8217;s place.<br \/> On the other hand Barnabas disappears from sight.  However there is a clue to his vindication in Paul&#8217;s final letter &lt;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnpcb.org\/esv\/search\/?q=2+timothy+4%3A11\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.gnpcb.org\/esv\/search\/?q=2+timothy+4%3A11<\/a>&gt;  where he writes to Timothy (2 Tim 4:11) about the usefulness of Mark.  He wants Timothy to bring Mark to Paul in Rome.  That is a significant reference.  It demonstrates that change has taken place in Paul and, presumably, also in Mark.  Paul has not held a grudge and has not written Mark off indefinitely.  We can only imagine that Mark had grown and learned about perseverance.  I don&#8217;t think it is unreasonable to think that Barnabas may have played a key role in this growth.  It is typical of Barnabas to open doors of opportunity to others; he did it for Paul, both in Jerusalem and at Antioch, and his refusal to abandon Mark kept the door open for him.<br \/> Paul&#8217;s eye was on the success of the mission; Barnabas had an eye for the recovery of wounded soldiers (perhaps there was an added dimension in this case as Mark was a relative).  Both kinds of people are needed in the church.  If the church was filled with people whose eye were only on the mission, much work would get done but the path would be strewn with hurt and heartache from the wounded that get left behind.  If the church was filled only with those who wanted to move at the speed of the slowest or &#8220;weakest link&#8221;, how much new ground would be broken, or when would the mission ever get carried out?  With both kinds of people &#8211; including in leadership &#8211; both areas can be taken together.  Where do you tend to lean more toward?  How do you treat those that lean more toward the opposite direction?  How have you dealt with this type of conflict in your circles?<br \/> But the story of Paul and Barnabas shows that it is not easy.  They were unable to minister together at this stage.  Since these two kinds of leaders are so different, conflict is more or less inevitable.  However, were it not for the grace of God, conflict would be hopeless.<br \/> Acts 15 is along the lines of the story of Joseph and his brothers.  God does not allow the brothers off the hook for their sinful behavior, but it recognizes the overruling sovereignty of God.  It cannot have been pretty to watch Paul and Barnabas disagree sharply; who knows what illusions were shattered at Antioch that day?  But God got his work done.  The mission advanced.  Timothy came into the picture to become one of Paul&#8217;s disciples.  And the work of healing, restoration and strengthening was done in the life of Mark.  Although they chose to contend with each other, the Gospel went forth, and God was glorified at end!<br \/> Inspired by Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/coastalpastor.wordpress.com\/2008\/05\/14\/who-was-right-paul-or-barnabas\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/coastalpastor.wordpress.com\/2008\/05\/14\/who-was-right-paul-or-barnabas\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026<br \/>Blessings, Phil Sessa, Evangelist, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.soulfishingministries.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.soulfishingministries.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"> <\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Then the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another (Acts 15:39)This account is the famous argument that took place between Paul and Barnabas over John Mark.

So he called its name Rehoboth [meaning spacious], because he said, &#8220;For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall <span>\ufeff\ufeff<\/span>be fruitful in the land.&#8221;<br \/>\n<br \/>In this day and age, there are many that are arguing about different areas of the Gospel, about people in ministry, about areas of ministry, and about styles or methods of ministry.  There are certainly times that the argument is productive and other times it is destructive.  Each of us needs to learn how to choose our battles, carefully and wisely, so that God is glorified.  There are times to engage, and times to disengage in arguments.  In Acts 15, there are two conflicts that arose, one concerning over the question of having to be circumcised to be saved, and Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputed with the men from Judea.  These men were Judaizers\u2014false teachers who were self-appointed guardians of legalism, teaching a doctrine of salvation by works.  Should Paul and Barnabas have argued about this issue, or just walk away and let it go?  Well, many would have walked away and would have perhaps &#8220;agreed to disagree.&#8221;  However, this is an issue to go to the mat on (to use a wrestling term), because it is a Gospel issue.  As Christians we must determine which issues we are going to go to the mat over and which ones are not worth battling over.  The issue here was clearly salvation by works, and therefore would make null and void Ephesians 2:8, &#8220;For by grace you have been saved <span>\ufeff\ufeff<\/span>through faith, and that not of yourselves; <span>\ufeffit is the gift of God,<\/span> <span>\ufeff<\/span>9<span>\ufeff not of \ufeffworks, lest anyone should \ufeff\ufeffboast.&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n<br \/> Look at the word of Jude who wrote, &#8220;Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you <span>\ufeffconcerning our common salvation, I found it necessary<\/span> to write to you exhorting <span>\ufeff\ufeffyou to contend earnestly for the faith<\/span> which was once for all delivered to the saints. <span>\ufeff4\ufeff For certain men<\/span> have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord <span>\ufeff\ufeffGod and our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;  Jude actually<\/span> encouraged contending!  I think it is clear that we must contend for the faith and contend on Gospel issues.  Apologetics is the study of actually defending the faith, which is still a crucial issue in this day and age.  We defend the faith, because it is worth defending, and God is glorified as we stand for His word!  Do you stand for God&#8217;s word?  The issue of faith alone being essential for salvation is still an issue today, are we willing to stand for a Gospel issue and make it clear that we cannot agree with those that hold to a salvation by works?.  In the Genesis 26 it reads, &#8220;For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall <span>\ufeffbe fruitful in the land.&#8221;  God will make room for<\/span> you as you are faithful to the Gospel and cause you to be faithful in the Gospel even as you contend for the Gospel when necessary.  To close one of my favorite scriptural accounts is from Acts 7, when Stephen is put on trial for Christ.  Stephen stands and contends for the Gospel, using harsh but true language toward his Jewish accusers.  As he is about to be stoned he says, &#8220;Look! <span>\ufeff\ufeffI see the heavens opened and the \ufeff<\/span> <span>\ufeff<\/span>Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!&#8221;  Jesus stood for Stephen as Stephen stood for Christ!  What a blessing!  Yet he was willing to contend, and then the blessing followed, and I am sure that God made room for Stephen (his life is recorded in Scripture!) and fruitful, we are still encouraged by the stand that he took, and his story is a model for us to learn how to stand and contend.  What a great example, and a great God!  Now go and be faithful to the Gospel.<br \/>\n<br \/>Until the nets are filled\u2026<br \/>\n<br \/>Blessings, Phil Sessa, Evangelist, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.soulfishingministries.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.soulfishingministries.org<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Also Isaac&#8217;s servants dug in the valley, and found a well of running water there. \ufeff20\ufeff But the herdsmen of Gerar \ufeff\ufeffquarreled with Isaac&#8217;s herdsmen, saying, &#8220;The water is ours.&#8221; So he called the name of the well \ufeff\ufeffEsek [meaning quarrel], because they quarreled with him. \ufeff21\ufeff Then they dug another well, and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1247","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-k7","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1247","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1247"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1247\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1247"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1247"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1247"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1246,"date":"2009-03-24T18:29:00","date_gmt":"2009-03-24T12:59:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/03\/24\/uncovered-wells-by-phil-the-evangelist\/"},"modified":"2009-03-24T18:29:00","modified_gmt":"2009-03-24T12:59:00","slug":"uncovered-wells-by-phil-the-evangelist","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/03\/24\/uncovered-wells-by-phil-the-evangelist\/","title":{"rendered":"Uncovered Wells, by Phil The&nbsp;Evangelist"},"content":{"rendered":"<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Good morning,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Genesis 26:18\ufeff And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. \ufeffHe called them by the names which his father had called them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Have you ever been frustrated that the Gospel that you hear preached is not the Gospel According to Jesus Christ?  Have you ever asked yourself, if the Gospel you hold to is the saving, biblical Gospel that Jesus preached?  It seems that in our day and age (although it is really not a new thing) the Gospel message has been vastly compromised in pulpits across our country and our world.  Many have taken the pure, unadulterated Gospel, and attempted to put sinful humanities rendition of the Gospel on display.  Dare I say many have attempted to cover the genuine Gospel, with man-made, man \u2013 centered unbiblical, dirt and filth and yet have proclaimed that it too was indeed the Gospel.  No it is not!  I recently ran across a passage in the Old Testament in Genesis 26 that spoke of the wells that Abraham dug to help sustain life, to people that needed the water to live as one of life&#8217;s basic human needs.  Can you imagine perhaps this being the most precious commodity in the desert where Abraham dwelt?  John MacArthur points out, &#8220;Plugging someone&#8217;s well was ruinous to them and constituted serious aggression, often leading to war.&#8221;  This was a serious thing the Philistines (which were the enemy of God&#8217;s people) did toward the Israelites.  Isaac came upon these same wells years later and could have retaliated, and attempted to come against the Philistines, but yet he didn&#8217;t take that path.  He dug up the wells which were covered by dirt from the enemy.  Now once again the water could flow, unstopped by man&#8217;s devices, unhindered by the enemy, and unadulterated by those that would have preferred to see God&#8217;s people defeated.  But no, this was not the plan that God was going to bring forth.  He dug, and the precious water could flow once again, giving life to all those that would partake of it&#8217; life giving sustenance and refreshment.  Many under the guise of Christianity have put their man-made doctrinal dirt on the well which contains the living water of Jesus Christ.  Many have bought into Christ-less Christianity which includes: Christ-less conversion, Christ-less discipleship, Christ-less evangelism, Christ-less worship, Christ-less prayer, and Christ-less fellowship.  The terms, sin, righteousness, repentance, has been replaced with more acceptable non-offensive (yet unbiblical terms).   Paul in 2 Tim 4:16, warns &#8220;Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.&#8221;  Those that drink from the living water will experience what Jesus promised.  &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. \ufeff38\ufeff \ufeff\ufeffHe who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, \ufeffout of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&#8221; \ufeff39\ufeff \ufeff\ufeffBut this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those \ufeffbelieving in Him would receive; for the \ufeffHoly Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet \ufeff\ufeffglorified (John 7:37-39).&#8221;  The Holy Spirit will flow forth from a vessel that is not covered up by the unbiblical doctrinal dirt, but from a vessel that has tasted and seen that the Lord is good by realizing that after one repents God can save the worst of sinners, for His own glory.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"> Perhaps you know some that have an unbiblical worldview and you clearly see the ungodly dirt of the enemy upon their lives.  Then it is time to uncover the dirt by taking them through the Law of God, and once humbled, share the precious living water of Christ with them.  Biblical evangelism is Law to the proud and grace to the humble.

We saw how one of the women was deceiving herself trying to live a life of her friend while Jonathan is out to do everything to protect his friend who will take his position as king. A good friend will cover your back, will care for you no matter what comes in your life that puts you in a higher position than them. A friend who will speak truth in love for he cares so much about your well being. After the king heard the story of the two women fighting over one baby, he had a solution. His solution was to divide the baby into two and have each one take half of the baby. One woman says, that is a good idea and the other one is not for the idea. The one who says it&#8217;s okay knows that if that is done, then both will be equal again but the other one is seeing something far much bigger than the situation. She would rather loose her son to her one time friend than have the baby killed. She is a friend who has compassion for the living. In other words, I would rather loose than destroy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Remember the hymn we sing in church, &#8220;What a friend we have in Jesus&#8221;. A friend indeed, the bible calls Him a friend who sticks closer than a brother. John 15:13, &#8220;Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one&#8217;s life for his friends&#8221;. Can we spot friends who will lay down their lives for other friends? It doesn&#8217;t matter where I am or what I am to you, all that matters is who I am to you. Jesus laid down His life for the sake of His friends as a sign of love. A friend will let you on the inside, wash your feet and the like. John 15:15, &#8220;No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you&#8221;. What a friend who does not look at you as a servant &#8217;cause a servant is not let on the inside. A friend willing to help you get where He is. A friend that declares that greater things than this shall ye do &#8217;cause I go to the Father. A friend that goes down on His knees and washes all manner of feet yet He is the King of kings. He has become a servant of all, for a good friend is not so much concerned about what he gets from a service but what he gives as a service. Why do we have so many broken relationships and friendships? it&#8217;s because people look at what they can get out of a relationship and not so much what they can give. You will submit to a friend because you recognize his or her authority over you, you will not even be intimidated by what they have because you too benefit from what they have. Going back to David and Jonathan, when Jonathan was dead and David took over, David looked for someone left in Jonathan&#8217;s home and they found a young lame boy. David showed kindness to Jonathan&#8217;s son because of the friendship and covenant he had with Jonathan. Jesus is a friend who sits on the right hand of God making intercession for us therefore we also thank God for those friends who uphold us in prayers. The friends who we share deeper insights of what is happening in our lives that we wouldn&#8217;t share with any one else. The friends who encourages us and let&#8217;s us know that they are standing with us. Jesus had friends and then very close friends (Peter, James, and John), He took them with him to certain places that he wouldn&#8217;t take the rest of the disciples, He also shared with them deeper stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">My message this morning is very simple, Friends are supposed to benefit from each other. God does not bring friends our way for competition but for completion. There are certain things He will show you through a friend, therefore, you are there to benefit from him or her. We can learn from our greatest friend Jesus and apply the principles of what we have learnt from Him about building friendships and execute them down here. 1Kings 3:27, &#8220;So the king answered and said, &#8220;Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him; she is his mother&#8221;. Because one woman was willing to let go of what was bringing strife, she had compassion, and she looked at it as not just about her. In the end she received what belonged to her. This is what Jesus did for His friends and this is what we need to do for our friends. What we expect, we can be the first ones to give.

Inspiring and encouraging are good and may be temporal; life changing devotions is what we want to bring you. Where we grow and mature in the things of God. Where our foundation in Christ is solidified that even in peril times (false teaching, troubled economy, under attack etc) we have a strong foundation to fall back on. I am growing in the Lord, which is life changing. Parents will be troubled if their babies whom they are feeding, teaching, nurturing are not growing day by day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Resurrection day depicts the victory of Jesus over death when He rose from the dead. There had to be a death experience before there was resurrection victory. Death could not hold or contain Him, sin tried but He conquered the day that death was crucified, 1 Corinthians 15:55, &#8220;O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory? Jesus died once and now lives FOREVERMORE. He came back to life, complete and whole yet with visible marks on his body, (scars). The marks of nails on His hands, feet, where they pierced Him on His side, I believe even the marks of the crown of thorns and marks on His back. I&#8217;ve often wondered why the marks did not disappear at His resurrection. I believe they would serve as a reminder to us of what it took for us to be saved, also proof to those who found it hard to believe it was Him like Thomas. He was wounded for our transgressions according to Isaiah 53:5 yet in His coming back to life He did not have wounds but scars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Scars ought to be reminders but there are believers who treat them as wounds. They go about poking their scars bringing back wounds already healed by the Lord. Are you living a condemned life over what God forgave you for and given you freedom to live for Him? The scars brought about by your history are not wounds to be poked but rather scars serving as reminders of where He brought you from. Whenever I remember I look at my scars, I&#8217;m humbled to the fact that He saw me wounded and dying in my sins and He picked me up from the miry clay when no one else could. I don&#8217;t use the reminders to condemn myself; I use the reminders to thank Him for what He did on the cross for me. I&#8217;m glad that even though He saved me, He did not take away my scars (history), which brings this scripture alive Romans 8:1, &#8220;There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,&#8230;&#8221;. Those who are in Christ have their sins washed way by the blood of the Lamb. The blood of the Lamb is the only blood that could  screen sin in our lives when nothing else could . The blood of the Lamb not only took care of what we did, it also took care of what we almost did and what we could have done. It took care of the past, present and future. Because we are washed clean, we might still have scars but we will not feel condemned anymore as they are not wounds. Psalm 103:12, &#8220;As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us&#8221;. You might remind the Lord of your past sin but He chooses to remember them no more, He took care of them. Why not put the things in the past and look to Jesus as you desire to grow more and more in the fear and the knowledge of Him. Building your life on a foundation He has laid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Lord if You chose to leave scars on Your body, Help us to live with our scars of where you called me from. No more will we treat them as wounds; we are not condemned anymore now that we live for You.

I&#8217;ve seen some broken over relationships, positions, and gifting to mention a few. Good friends, I mean really good friends end their friendships over things that shouldn&#8217;t, that don&#8217;t matter. In my text this morning, the bible talks about two women coming to king Solomon for judgment. It seams as if they are in the same level for both are prostitutes living in the same house. They must have been good friends to live together. They have a lot of things in common; same occupation (if I may call it that), both gave birth to babies three days apart, both are nurturing babies dear to them, the only thing (person) they can call their own. The bible gives details to these two women who are almost equal in all things. What really keeps two good friends together is it what they have or who they are to each other?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">1Kings 3:19, &#8220;And this woman&#8217;s son died in the night, because she lay on him, vs. 20, &#8220;So she arose in the middle of thee night and took my son from my side, while your maidservant slept, and laud him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom&#8221;. We now understand what brought them before the king. I can see a friendship being shaken because of a problem, what was equal is not anymore, one baby is dead. One lay on her baby most likely by accident and now she is deceiving herself by trying to take the other friend&#8217;s baby. Trying to live someone else life. Let&#8217;s bring this in our day to day, so many good friends started well but when one friend laid on the good and killed it he or she felt it was not right for the other friend to have something they didn&#8217;t have. &#8220;Why should you have a better job and I don&#8217;t? we started the same way, but something happened to my dream&#8221;. Jealousy finds its way, opening doors to bitterness and resentments. Friends are supposed to build each other even during tough times; a true friend will not be intimidated by your success or the opposite. That is why I praise God for David and Jonathan. Jonathan was a king&#8217;s son; he knew he was next in line to be king once his father was dead. When he learnt that God had anointed David to take over instead of him, he was at peace with God&#8217;s decision. What would that mean today, Jonathan by all means would be looking for ways to get rid of David. Already Jonathan&#8217;s dad King Saul was determined to kill David but Jonathan protected his friend from his dad&#8217;s wrath, listen to this, 1Samuel 19:1, &#8220;Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David; but Jonathan&#8230; delighted in David&#8221; because he delighted in him, he warned him, spoke well of David before his father. Remember that David would take Jonathan&#8217;s position and we see Jonathan helping his friend David get there because he loved him, 1Samuel 20:17, &#8220;Now Jonathan again caused David to vow, because he loved him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul&#8221;. This is a friend indeed. Compared to the other two women, one is deceiving herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Instead of the one who lay on her child accepting the situation and dealing with it, she refuses to go down by herself and she takes that which does not belong to her and calls it hers. I have seen this with believers too, maybe not to the extreme but many don&#8217;t like it when their friends are elevated by God. Either they will talk behind their backs or accuse them of pride and even disconnect from them. How I pray that friendships will be built that glorify God, friendships solidified, bound with codes of love that cannot be broken. Jonathan and David were friends indeed. To continue.

The cross is never too easy to carry because of the magnitude of it&#8217;s weight, many times I stumble and fall while carrying the cross, even tempted to put it down then I\u2019m reminded, soldiers don&#8217;t stop, don&#8217;t quit, don&#8217;t retreat or surrender. I pick up the cross I\u2019m daily crucified on. Galatians 2:20, \u201cI have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me\u201d.

Carrying the cross is daily dying to self for the sake of the call.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">If someone says, &#8220;if you are going to be my disciple, pick up your cross and follow me&#8221;, check what happened to Him when He picked up His cross and you will understand what you are bound to face when you pick up yours. He was mocked, beaten, spat on, stressed out, exhausted but would not put down the cross. If this happened to Him, don\u2019t be surprised if the same happens to you. Don\u2019t expect to be treated any better than the way they treated Jesus. While carrying the cross, He wasn&#8217;t going down the hill, which would have been a little easy; He was climbing a hill that was high. I can imagine Him saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to hang on to it a little while that I might reach the top&#8221;. He wasn\u2019t\u2019 doing it for Himself, He was doing it for those He loved. Someone wrote a song and said, &#8220;go ahead and drive the nails in my hand, go ahead and put them inside of me for after this I will rise again for no power on earth can hold me down&#8221;, Did He not say, &#8220;no man takes My life, I lay it down for the sake of My friends?&#8221;. With this I keep fighting and if I fall (sin), I rise up again, ask for forgiveness, pick up the cross and keep following Him saying, I  will make it, I will survive, I will stand for if He did it, I too can do it with him strengthening me (Phil 4:13)? This journey is not easy and it will never be easy no wander Paul tells us to run the race with patience looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith. Then my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock (cross) that is higher than I? It&#8217;s darker at dawn a sign that morning is around the corner. The bible says, &#8220;Joy comes in the morning&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Don&#8217;t give up fighting for it&#8217;s worth fighting in Christ, don&#8217;t stop living in Christ, don&#8217;t stop trusting and believing in Him, don&#8217;t stop calling on His name for He is all you&#8217;ve got. Right now there are some struggling with different issues and at times you have felt like giving up. I want you to know that the Lord is on your side and if you will give Him a chance to guide and lead you, He will bring you to the place He wants you to be. Is it going to be easy? of course not but you have to be willing to take the stand. Discouraged, confused, broken, feel like giving up, stressed out, burdened by something, weak, and fallen? you name it, check out how Christ made it and know that if He made it, you can make it too for the bible says we are more than conquerors which in other words means we conquer what has already been conquered. Joshua 1:5, &#8220;&#8230; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you&#8221;, as &#8220;I was with Jesus as He was going through the cross experience, so I will be with you in all that you go through&#8221;, says the Lord.

The Philistines learning of his affection for this woman said to her vs. 5, &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;Entice him, and find out where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and every one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.&#8221; While he loved her, she did not love him back. Likewise, there are people who are in the light beginning to love the world, be aware the world does not love you back. It&#8217;s been paid to entice and destroy your life. It will not begin in a noticeable way, it will be subtle. Another way believer&#8217;s sleep on Delilah&#8217;s lap is by making them too busy with other things that take away priorities. Some can even be good things. Too many programs have crept in to make men a sleep on Delilah&#8217;s lap in the church. Delilah began to toy with Samson&#8217;s mind and emotions, preying on things we are vulnerable to. If she discovered where his strength lied, she could put him to sleep and detach his strength from him. Samson played along with her for a while but we know the enemy does not give up easily unless you give up and give in.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Upon sharing with her where his strength lied, &#8220;19 &#8230;she lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him&#8221;, the tragedy of a believer is to lay his head on the lap of the Delilah&#8217;s of this world and fall a sleep. A person in a deep sleep does not know the time, what is happening, could be slain and not fight back. The enemy has shaved of your locks of Prayers, Reading of the word, reaching the lost, strength to overcome sin, hunger for righteousness etc. You now have no strength, Samson didn&#8217;t even know that his strength was gone until he tried to go after the enemy as he had done always. Jesus told a parable Matthew 13: 24, saying: &#8220;The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; 25 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way. It&#8217;s when men are a sleep that the enemy takes full control, planting tares. Jesus told His disciples Mark 14:38, &#8220;Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. &#8230;&#8221;, Those who are awake cannot be easily destroyed unless they are a sleep. What did he find them doing when he came back from praying Himself? He found them fast a sleep instead of watching and praying to evade becoming vulnerable to the enemy&#8217;s prey.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">You and I need to check to see if we have fallen asleep or are falling asleep on Delilah&#8217;s lap. We need to check and see if Delilah has had our locks of strength shaved off. We cannot loose our effectiveness because we are enticed by the enemy. We got to stand strong, we got to wake up before it&#8217;s too late. Those who have their locks shaved off, fight and grow your hair back, 1 Thessalonians 5:6, &#8220;Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober&#8221;, 1 Peter 1:13, &#8220;Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, 1 Peter 5:8, &#8220;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour&#8221;. We need to be sober, we need to discern and know what the enemy is planning on doing.

And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall betray me. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I? (Matt. 26:20 &#8211; 22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">At the Last Supper Jesus is eating with His twelve and speaks about betrayal.  This is perhaps the worst gesture that a &#8220;friend&#8221; can do to another friend, even worse than death, because one has to live with the fact that betrayal meant a complete hardening of the heart in the midst of the relationship.  Jesus makes the statement that one of his &#8220;friends&#8221; there would deny him, and when He did everyone of them became sorrowful and looked introspectively saying &#8220;Lord is it I?&#8221;  No one pointed fingers at Judas as if he had a big hook nose and devilish horns coming out of his head.  The Scriptures point out that two of the disciples went against Jesus at his hour of need.  Peter denied Jesus and Judas betrayed Jesus, so what&#8217;s the difference, or are they not the same?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Well let&#8217;s look at Peter first. Jesus says to the group that &#8220;all you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.&#8221;  Peter answered and said to him, &#8220;Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet will I never be offended.&#8221;  Jesus responded by saying to him, &#8220;&#8230;this night, before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.&#8221;  Peter said to him, &#8220;Though I should die with you, yet will I not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.&#8221;  Peter really meant to keep his word, but when he was tested he folded under pressure three times just as Jesus said.  We know that later is Peter&#8217;s life he got things together and became a leader among the Apostles and wrote two books of the Bible bearing his name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Judas on the other hand turned against Jesus a bit differently.  &#8220;Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, And said to them, What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.&#8221;  Judas was plotting and scheming behind the scenes with those that wanted to see the destruction of Christ, and the disbanding of his disciples.  Those evil men used Judas as a pawn to work an inside job on Jesus.  While in prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, Judas comes with his entourage of chief priests and armed soldiers. &#8220;And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. And Jesus said to him, Friend, wherefore are you come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.&#8221;  Jesus calls him friend and yet Judas still sells him out in betrayal.  With friends like Judas who needs enemies?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Peter grabbed his sword when they laid hold of Jesus and cut of one of the soldier&#8217;s ears to defend the Lord.  He was showing his seriousness of protecting Jesus at all costs, even death.  After Peter&#8217;s denial the Scriptures says that Peter &#8220;went out and wept bitterly [in repentance].&#8221; Judas however felt the guilt of betraying Jesus for thirty pieces of silver and tried to give it back, admitting that he had sinned against innocent blood, and he threw the coins down at the feet of the priests and went forth and hung himself.  Both men felt sorrow for their sin, but Peter repented while Judas committed suicide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Application:   If you find your actions plotting against your relationship with Jesus, repent right away, because the Judas lives in us tries to rise up and take charge.  If you have denied Jesus by your life in anyway also repent and move on and do great things for your Lord.  Remember your faith MUST stand trial, so that it can be refined.

Women in this culture, part of their service to the family was fetching water. While she met Abraham&#8217;s servant, she served him with no strings attached. No indication she was thinking of marriage. This makes me believe that those God will bless are people who are not over consumed with marriage that they neglect their service to Him for He knows when He blesses them, they will still be faithful in serving Him even in that relationship. Keep serving while waiting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, &#8220;The thing comes from the LORD; we cannot speak to you either bad or good. 51 Here is Rebekah before you; take her and go, and let her be your master&#8217;s son&#8217;s wife, as the LORD has spoken.&#8221; The servant shared with Rebekah&#8217;s family instructions given to him by Abraham, his journey, his prayer, Rebekah coming and acting exactly as he prayed, and his thanksgiving. As they listened keenly, weighing every action, every word, they sensed this was of God. No. 7 Principle, Confide in those who value your well being if you believe you&#8217;ve met the right person. I find this to be very important because your spiritual leaders, your family members, close friends know you well to desire the best for you. They can advise, encourage and pray for and with you. They may help you see things you cannot see and keep you accountable. If they are not at peace with your decision, they will advise, work and pray with you. There is safety in confiding, Proverbs 11:14, &#8220;Where there is no counsel, the people fall; But in the multitude of counselors there is safety&#8221;, Proverbs 24:6, &#8220;For by wise counsel you will wage your own war, And in a multitude of counselors there is safety&#8221;. After Pastor Phil met Stephanie, he confided in me. My input in his decision was important to him, and so were his pastor&#8217;s and other close friends and family. He wanted to make sure they were at peace with his move. The same happened in my case, I valued his input when I met Judy, and so were my family, my other close friends and my pastor. There are some who do not want anyone to advise or give them counsel and I find that those who do that know there is something wrong about the relationship they are about to embark on. They know that friends, leaders, family will not approve of it. To have a blessed relationship, surround yourself with counselors, there is safety within. They will save you from things you may be blind sided about. They are your God given voice to counsel you. Heed to their counsel, weigh matters, pray together and what is of God will stay, what is not of God will be terminated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;57 So they said, &#8220;We will call the young woman and ask her personally.&#8221; 58 Then they called Rebekah and said to her, &#8220;Will you go with this man?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;I will go.&#8221; 59 So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham&#8217;s servant and his men. 60 And they blessed Rebekah&#8221; What is of God will flow even when there are some little resistance, in this case there was no resistance and what I love about this verse is that the family did not force Rebekah, after weighing everything and she also said yes, &#8220;They blessed Rebekah&#8221;, there is nothing like an answered prayer sealed by a blessing. The blessing makes the prayer whole, it&#8217;s the crown. And what the Lord has blessed no man can undo. Oh what a joy when those who are close give their seal of approval and bless the relationship, invest in it by prayers, encouragements, and gifts; it does make them proud&#8230;. God has not left us alone to figure things out, He has given us enough principles in His word, 2 Peter 1:2-4, &#8220;2 Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, 3 as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue, 4 by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust&#8221;.

We often quote Proverbs 3:5&amp;6, &#8220;Trust in the Lord with ALL your heart, And lean not on YOUR own understanding  6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.&#8221;, we tend to stop here, lets read on to the next two verses that follows? Vs 7 &#8220;Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and depart from evil. 8 It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones&#8221;. These are benefits that come with trusting in the Lord to direct your ways<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">The bible says, as Abraham&#8217;s servant was still praying for direction, 15 &#8230;, that behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham&#8217;s brother, came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. 16 Now the young woman was very beautiful to behold, a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the well, filled her pitcher, and came up. 17 And the servant ran to meet her and said, &#8220;Please let me drink a little water from your pitcher.&#8221; 18 So she said, &#8220;Drink, my lord.&#8221; Then she quickly let her pitcher down to her hand, and gave him a drink&#8221;. If you read a few verses before this, the servant&#8217;s prayer was that the woman God chooses for Isaac would be the one that he asks for a drink and would give him and not only that, also give water  to his camels to drink. Watch this, the servant only asked the woman for water for himself, not only did she give him water; she also gave his camels water. If you know camels, they drink a lot of water so this must have been several trips to give water to dessert thirsty animals. She even called Abraham&#8217;s servant &#8220;my lord&#8221;, vs., &#8220;21 And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not&#8221;. You may be like this servant who saw the qualities he prayed for in this woman and you may have seen qualities in a person you&#8217;ve prayed for, may be even started building friendship. You can imagine yourself getting married to this person. There is something exciting about the person, No. 5 Principle, hold your peace, don&#8217;t be quick to make conclusion or even rush into decision making, trust in the Lord and patiently wait. You will be amazed at the learning you do in the waiting mode. What is of God cannot be rushed, and what is of God will not fail however long it may take. The servant could have just said, that&#8217;s her; she has every thing I have prayed for, let&#8217;s move to the next thing. People tend to rush in situations like this. He waited, so we should also learn how to ask from the Lord then wait for him to give us the green light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">No. 6 principle, Praise and thanksgiving, &#8220;26 Then the man bowed down his head and worshiped the LORD. 27 And he said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His mercy and His truth toward my master. As for me, being on the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master&#8217;s brethren.&#8221; Understanding that this could be of God as the Lord had led him this far, he took time to thank God not only for what had transpired but even that which was to come.

Praying to be developed in the fruit<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">of the spirit Galatians 5:22, &#8220;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness&#8221;. To teach you<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">honor and integrity; in short, praying to God to prepare you. There are<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">singles  out there praying that God would bless them yet they are not<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">ready character wise and are frustrated with God because it&#8217;s taking too<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">long. You need to understand that blessing may be delayed because you<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">are under construction. I praise God He did not give me a companion when<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">I felt I needed one, He took me through years of building a strong<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">foundation in preparation for my companion. I&#8217;m not saying someone will<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">ever be completely ready, I&#8217;m talking about basic foundation. This could<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">take a short time or a while but it&#8217;s worth it. I know gifted people who<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">love God, even anointed ones, who can preach, and pray like crazy but<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">have no character and if God gave them someone as they have prayed, they<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">will ruin that person&#8217;s life. Angry people, people with no patience, and<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">no credibility. How will you desire a quality in someone else when you<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">don&#8217;t have it yourself? This is how selfishness is brooded; it&#8217;s all<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">about me. Relationship requires a strong foundation, a foundation where<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">you are willing to lay down your life and die. While you are praying for<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">your future companion with certain qualities, pray that you too will<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">have those qualities. There are some which will be built within a<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">marriage, there are basics that a person should have before they come<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">into a marriage covenant.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"apple-style-span\"><span>No. 4 Principle, Be specific in your prayers and pray with your eyes<\/span><\/span><span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">opened.

Abraham servant was specific in<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">his prayer and if you read his prayer, he is not setting up unrealistic<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">requests. He went by the well where women would come to draw water and<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">while there, he prayed for a young woman, with a servant&#8217;s heart, a<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">virtuous woman, a woman of character at the same time opened to whatever<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">the Lord would do because God knows best. He already knew where he was<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">going, these people feared God, and he just needed that fear of the Lord<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">to be accompanied by character. An example of unrealistic prayer is<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">something like this, &#8220;God give me 6&#8221; 2&#8242; man who has a great job, well<\/span> <span class=\"apple-style-span\">built, of this race etc&#8221;.

About 10 years ago as I began to pray for the same, God gave me Genesis 24 that was a great encouragement, the same chapter was also an encouragement to Pastor Phil, we were both single men busy serving the Lord and with a desire to be married and settle down.<\/p>\n<p>I find Genesis 24 to be loaded with principles on preparation for marriage that helped me a lot and I hope it will be a blessing to those who are single. The chapter has 67 verses all talking about finding a wife for Isaac yet Isaac does not come to the picture until verse 62. Now Abraham was old, well advanced in age, the Lord had blessed him in everyway. He calls on his oldest faithful servant who would have inherited all he had if Abraham never had a son and gives him instructions that required an oath. And this is the instruction, vs. 24:3, &#8220;&#8230;swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell&#8221;.  Abraham did not want his son to get a wife from among the people he lived. They were pagans, did not worship God, and did whatever was right before their eyes. Abraham knew a woman from the land he lived would mess up his son and his future with God, and so are we, yes we live in this world, and it&#8217;s not our home. No. 1 principle, to be in a blessed God given relationship, to be in His will, refrain from establishing relationship with the unsaved where you dwell. 2 Corinthians 6:14 &#8220;Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?. This is not God trying to spoil your fun, this is God trying to protect you from the heartache of life to give you the best He has reserved for you. This calls for total trust that He is able to do what we cannot do. When you are yoked to an unbeliever, you are setting yourself on a dangerous path because the unbeliever does not have the same morals and convictions, they do not have the vertical relationship that drives them to build a horizontal relationship. When two oxen are yoked together to plow, they walk in agreement, working together, heading to the right direction. You don&#8217;t find that a donkey is yoked to a bull.  This is very important , Amos 3:3, &#8220;Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?&#8221;. God will only bless what He has provided. Some are hoping they will convert the unsaved they are dating or would like to date, advise for you, missionary dating is not wise. You are setting yourself to live a lie waiting to haunt you.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 4 but you shall go to my country and to my family, and take a wife for my son Isaac.&#8221; Abraham directed his servant to journey to his country, to his family. No. 2 principle, go back to the house of God that is where people from the same kingdom are, born of God, speaks the same language. Those who you know their ways and their character because they are abiding in the same vine you are abiding in. Those who walk in truth, have cultivated vertical relationship with God, and they love the Lord. You May find that your spiritual levels are different but you are all heading in the same direction.

Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">There is no relationship that God honors like the relationship between a husband and a wife. He instituted it (invented marriage), addressing it right from the book of Genesis, the book of beginnings. It&#8217;s God who saw that it was not good for man to be alone therefore He made him a helpmate. The marital relationship was established as the first human institution. God&#8217;s ideal plan for marriage is one man and woman for one lifetime. And of all the love, God made a special love expressed between husband and wife consummated in the physical. This implies their sexual completeness. One man and one woman constitute the pair to reproduce. The &#8220;one flesh&#8221; is primarily seen in the child born of that union, the one perfect result of the union of two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Look at how God created both man and woman then joined them to become one flesh. After forming man out of the clay, God did not reach the ground again to pick clay to make the woman; he took one of Adam&#8217;s ribs and formed a woman, Eve. God performed a Divine surgery, isn&#8217;t that amazing?. Genesis 2:22, &#8220;Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. 23 And Adam said: &#8220;This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.&#8221; Imagine the Lord made her and as a loving Father presented his daughter to Adam to care for her as his wife. She was called woman because she was taken out of a man. Even though our world today tries to redefine marriage, we understand God established marriage between a man and a woman and blessed it. Upon completing creating her, He brought her to Adam. Right there and then Adam recognized her as the bone of his bones and the flesh of his flesh. Special relationship, made, blessed and sealed by God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Marriage is so unique that in marriage that 1 plus 1 does not equal two but 1 and that unity God honors and treasures, Matthew 19: 5 and said, &#8216;For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh&#8217;? 6 So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.&#8221; Not even those in that marriage covenant saved or unsaved have the right or ability to alter it or break it. God honors it. The relationship between children and parents cannot be compared to the relationship between a husband and wife. Look at God dealing with Job, He allowed Satan to take everything away from Job including his children but did not let Satan touch his wife. God would not let Satan separate them. Is this not telling us something about marriage? Another example, God came in a dream to King Abimelech and was going to kill him because he eyed Abraham&#8217;s wife. Until we see how God honors marriage first, we will never understand His full purpose of allowing marriages to take place. We may think we are the ones who decided to get married; well God planned it, put that desire and directed you to the person He designed for you. I believe the primary reason for God to allow marriage is to make us HOLY, to conform us to the image of Christ in that covenant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">I love listening to preacher Paul Washer, this is what he says when he is asked what he does, &#8220;I&#8217;m a husband&#8221;, when asked what else he says, &#8220;oh, I&#8217;m also a father, and if I have anytime left, I preach a little.&#8221; Hence, putting God first, his wife second. His philosophy last.  &#8220;What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world (including ministry) and loose his wife?&#8221; Proverbs 18:22, &#8220;He who finds a wife finds a good thing, And obtains favor from the LORD. What is your thought on marriage? I pray that as we share in the next few days, the Lord will transform our view and approach towards marriage.

However hard we try, sometimes we just fall short. You look at how time ran fast while you accomplished little. You are left exhausted gasping for strength and some headache. The best cure at this point is not medicine; the cure you need is rest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">In Genesis 15:1 the Lord appears to Abram in a vision and His words to him, &#8220;Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward&#8221;. In one line he gave him one instruction and two promises. In other words, do not be afraid if you do not finish all you needed to do, don&#8217;t feel bad that you failed to accomplish it, why? because I am your shield. Believe it or not, no one understands REST like God. He created the earth in 6 days and on the 7th day He rested. His word to Abram is that I am your shield, protecting you from all that make you exhausted, bring fatigue, those things that appear to be like headache because I have called you into rest. God also tells him that He is Abram&#8217;s exceedingly great reward, which I would interpret, this way, God gives you ability to do something and then there are those He takes over. He rewards those who diligently seek Him. We do the best we can with the help of God, we leave the rest for Him to handle as we go to rest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">God asked Abram to prepare a sacrifice, 3 year old heifer, ram, goat, then with turtle dove and young pigeon. After he cut and prepared the sacrifice, no fire yet, Genesis 15:11, says &#8220;?the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away&#8221;. For a whole day, he was fighting chasing the vultures from devouring the sacrifice. You too will find that when you offer yourself to God for service, what happens? vultures of fear, frustrations, anxieties, confusion, and anger try to come in and for the whole day, all you do is trying to chase them away to protect what you are offering to God. Romans 12:1, &#8220;Brethren I beseech you by the mercies of God that you present yourself a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable which is your reasonable service&#8221;. The moment you surrender yourself as a sacrifice, all hell breaks loose. Do not be afraid, you are in His will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">When you have done all you can, the Lord takes over and gives you rest in the spirit, body, soul, and mind. Vs 12, &#8220;Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram&#8221;. You cannot sleep when you are troubled. Those who are troubled toss back and forth on their beds worrying, fighting vultures. Sleep through it, rest while He takes care of the rest. While Abram was deep a sleep horror and great darkness fell upon him, the Lord already told him not to be afraid, He was in control. He then spoke to him in a dream of his future. Remember the Lord said to him from the beginning, &#8220;I am your shield&#8221;. And while he was asleep, vs., &#8220;17 &#8230;when the sun went down and it was dark, that behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those pieces&#8221;. If he was a sleep, how come the vultures did not devour the sacrifice? the Lord protected the sacrifice. When you have done your best, close out everything, and commend the rest to God and go to sleep, relax, and gain your strength back. Philippians 4:6 Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; 7 and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Therefore rest and let God handle your rest and the rest that you need to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Blessings<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Ev<\/span><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 15:9-12, &#8220;And when the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away&#8221; You and I know those times when we have so much to do and we want to do it all well.

Psalm 40:1, &#8220;I waited patiently for the Lord; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry&#8221;. The word wait has different meanings, sitting down waiting for someone or something is one meaning, the other means busy doing something for others (serving). Waiters wait on people in restaurants. I believe this is what the Psalmist is telling us that he patiently served the Lord (waiting) while petitioning his needs before<span>  <\/span>Him. In his faithfulness in serving, the Lord was able to hear his cry and attend to Him. &#8220;Cast not your confidence which has great recompense of reward&#8221; . Not confidence in man or self, confidence in God who we cry out to.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Not only did the Lord hear his cry and attend to him, in Psalm 40:2, &#8220;He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, And set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps&#8221;. While you are busy waiting (serving) the Lord,<span>  <\/span>hell won&#8217;t be happy with you but keep serving. Remember Jesus words in, John 16:33, &#8220;These things have I spoken unto you, that in me you might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world&#8221;. Tribulations are there, we are not to deal with them alone. How will you know what He can do if there is no challenge in your life He can use to display His power?. 1John 4:4, &#8220;Ye are of God little children for you have over come them. For greater is He that is inside of you than he that is in the world&#8221;. Attacks will come, but the good news is,<span>  <\/span>greater is He that is in us than he who is in the world. Don&#8217;t be surprised at times when you are in horrible pits or in a miry clay for He will pick you up and set your feet upon a rock. He is the Rock of Ages who stands for sure, Psalm 18:46, &#8220;The Lord lives; and blessed be my Rock; and let the Lord of My salvation be exalted&#8221;. He will set you on Himself, the Rock. The Lord heard his cry, attended to him, brought him up out of the pits, set his feet upon the rock and believe me, the Lord is still doing much more in his life. &#8220;And established my steps&#8221;, the Lord establishes our steps in other words recognizes our steps. Our steps could be into good ministries, good friends, dealing with issues, meeting deadlines, dealing with arrogant people, etc. In short, all that you have to deal with He recognizes and establishes your step that you may walk worthy of his vocation. Walking with Him requires patience, back to Hebrews we looked at, &#8220;For you are in need of patience&#8221;. Psalm 37:23, &#8220;The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way&#8221;.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Psalm 40:3, &#8220;He has put a new song in my mouth &#8211; Praise to our God; Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord&#8221;. There is power in singing praises to God, it encourages you to overcome. It may not be very easy to pray in certain situations but you can singing a song. Singing helps you lift Him up and what did He say in John 12:32, &#8220;And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me&#8221;. You lift Him up, you will be part of the people who will be drawn. The neat thing about this verse is that He does not even ask you to look for a song, He puts one in your heart that you may praise Him. Certain songs that we sing out of our mouths, I wonder whether they praise Him? &#8220;Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord&#8221;, whenever the Lord is doing something in your life and mine, He has someone else in mind. So everything He is doing in your life is that someone may see the goodness of the Lord in your life and fear Him. The fear here is reverencing before God and they will say, &#8220;The God whom so and so serves is a true God&#8221; and they will in turn trust Him. Sad enough, many Christians walk as though the God they serve is dead and the unbelievers have no one to set an example for them.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">  <\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Psalm 40:4, &#8220;Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust&#8221;, there are so many things you will not understand about how God operates but trust Him. We are in situations right now where we don&#8217;t know what to expect but sure enough, we will wait on the Lord as we put our trust in Him to bring us through. He has heard our cry and attended to them, He has brought us up from the pits and miry clay, He has set our feet upon a rock, He has established our steps, He has put a song in our mouth, And He has set people to see what He has done in our lives what else can I do but make Him my trust.

              "<strong>Psalm 61:1-8, “vs. 2…From the end of the earth I will cry to You, when my heart is overwhelmed; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I…”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe often get overwhelmed with daily responsibilities. Sometimes when you are still working on this, here comes another one. While trying to work on another one, here comes a new one. Everything has its season and how we deal with situations during certain seasons may determine the outcome. The overwhelming situations can choke out peace, confidence and courage, as weeds do choke good plants if they remain active in the same field with good plants. You may be dealing with overwhelming situations both at home and work, let us see what the Lord has for us.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nVs. 1 “<strong>Hear my cry, O God, attend to my prayer”, </strong>the first thing addressed in this line is prayer, have you prayed over your situation or are you waiting for someone to come and lay hands on you to make it? Lay your own foundation of prayer faith and others will come around you to help you build the walls. I have met people who wanted to see things happen in their lives and the first question I would ask them, “<strong>Have you laid your foundation?”,</strong> What is the foundation, <strong>prayer of faith?</strong>\r\n\r\nVs. 2 “<strong>From the ends of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed, Lead me to the rock that is higher than I”. </strong>Of course our hearts will get overwhelmed and so are our minds and bodies, but what happens when they get overwhelmed? Please do not lead me to temptations, friends, neighbors, programs etc., lead me to the <strong>Rock, </strong>not just any rock, but the Rock that is higher than I. Simply because the Rock cannot be overwhelmed, moved or shaken and if the Rock is higher than I, I will make it my dwelling and hiding place.\r\n\r\nVs. 3 “<strong>For you have been a shelter for me, A strong water from the enemy”. </strong>The Lord is our shelter strengthened by <strong>Proverbs 18:10, “The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous run into it and they are safe”. </strong>Just His name alone is a strong tower in other words a strong Rock. When you find yourself overwhelmed, calm your nerves, keep your mind on Him for peace and be led to the Rock that is higher than us. The bible says in <strong>Nehemiah 8:10, “…for the joy of the Lord is your strength.”</strong> The unbelievers ask me why I always have this joy even when things at times go wrong, I simply say, “the joy of the Lord”\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 8, “So I will praise Your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows”, </strong>just because you are under a shelter does not exempt you from work, this is the reason we continue to praise and be glad and daily perform our vows. We have vowed to be the best we can wherever the Lord plants us by His grace. We pray for freedom to serve Him “...<strong>for it is God which works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure”, Philippians 2:13. </strong>So keep on fighting the good fight of a soldier, enduring for He is your Rock of Ages, Strong Tower, Firm Foundation, Solid Rock, Anchor of your Life and more.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we are all children in warriors’ gears. God is our Armor therefore stand and make it however hard times are. When it gets too much and sometimes we cry, they have no understanding by what means we make it, they do not know that underneath the armor, the warrior is just a child. Check out this portion of lyrics from the song “The warrior is a child”, by Twila Paris <strong>“They don’t know that I would go running home when I fall down, they don’t know who picks me up when no one is around, sometimes I drop my sword and cry for a while, because deep inside this armor, the warrior is just a child”, </strong>Thank God for the being the Armor, Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/27/take-it-to-the-lord-in-prayer-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Take It To The Lord In Prayer, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/strike-again-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Strike Again, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/2211/\" target=\"_blank\">Lord Teach Us to Pray 1of10: Our Father...Hallowed Be Your Name, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/lord-teach-us-to-pray-4of7-give-us-this-day-our-daily-bread-part-2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Lord Teach Us to Pray 6of10: Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread, Part 2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/perfect-peace-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Perfect Peace, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/commend-all-to-god-part-1of2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Commend All To God, Part 1of2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/revive-me-in-your-way-part-2of2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Revive Me In Your Way, Part 2of2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>2Kings 4:1-6, “3… go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors-empty vessels; do not gather just a few…”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image8.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6286 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image8.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nNaturally man is selfish knowingly or unknowingly, that is the nature of man. We always come for us, it’s always about what we can get, how to get it and how we are going to benefit from it. Look at many of the praise and worship songs today, the lyrics of the majority of the songs have (me, my, I etc).\r\n\r\nThe text above tells of a woman had two sons but her husband was dead. For some unknown reasons, her husband owed creditors who came to take her sons to be slaves. This was a form of satisfying the debt. She cries to the Elisha and all she can testify was the fact that her husband feared the Lord.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe first question Elisha asked her, “…<strong> Tell me what do you have in your house?…”</strong> and the woman’s response is amazing,<strong> “...Nothing but a little oil in jar</strong>“.<strong> Sometimes, what you have is all you need to get you started.</strong> She was not hiding anything, she was transparent. If we are going to desire blessings from the Lord, we have to be transparent with what we have.\r\n\r\nShe may have hoped for the man of God to call things from heaven to fill her house with good stuff but that’s not the response she received. She was told to go borrow vessels from everywhere, from all her neighbors and friends,<strong> empty vessels</strong> and not few as she was advised. How can one borrow vessels when there is only very little in a jar, and the vessels borrowed are not even filled vessels, they are empty borrowed vessels? Being obedient to the word is a channel for blessings, that is what they needed. They went and borrowed vessels until they could not borrow anymore. They then closed the door behind them (sign of going into your closet to seek God) and poured little oil in every vessel. As they did, God filled all the vessels they poured little oil in. God gives increase.\r\n\r\nWhat is my message? For one, the bible calls us jars (vessels) of clay <strong>2Corinthians 4:7</strong><strong>. Therefore, prayers is the little jar of oil we have and are, and the empty vessels are the people around us who need our prayers</strong>. Friends, neighbors, family members need our prayers. The moment we begin to borrow these vessels, <strong>we move from thinking of ourselves and how we can get more blessings from the Lord and we respond to the call of God in borrowing vessels and not thinking of how to benefit from them. </strong>In this call we begin we borrow vessels of those who are struggling, have nothing, weak, sick and the like and we pour the little oil of prayers in those vessels and God will fill them. God allows us to go through some things as a reminder that there are people going through the same. Why pray for them? because you have learnt how to approach the throne of grace and you know how prayer works. You are the attorney God has chosen to represent them in the courts, you will fight for them as you know the truth, you know what to do for them to obtain mercy for those you are representing. You put little oil in those empty vessels,<strong> God will fill those vessels and what He has done for others, He will do the same for you.</strong>\r\n\r\nEvery jar this widow and her sons poured little oil into, God filled and that became the means by which their needs were met, through borrowed vessels. <strong>God also turned Job's captivity</strong> <strong>when he prayed for his friends (borrowed his friends as vessels and poured little oil of prayers), </strong><strong>Job 42:10.</strong>\r\n\r\nAt times forget what you are going through, forget what you don’t have and remember that there is someone out there who’s condition is worse than yours. Always remember to borrow these kind of vessels and more. Take care of God’s business and He will take care of yours. There is power that flows when one pours little oil in borrowed vessels<strong>. </strong>Blessing Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/the-warrior-is-a-child-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Warrior Is A Child, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/lord-teach-us-to-pray-4of7-give-us-this-day-our-daily-bread-part-2-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Lord Teach Us to Pray 6of10: Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread, Part 2, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/27/take-it-to-the-lord-in-prayer-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Take It To The Lord In Prayer, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/what-you-pray-for-the-most-indicates-where-your-heart-is-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">What You Pray For The Most Indicates Where Your Heart Is, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

                  "Thank you Evans! I have been serving the Lord and preaching the gospel as a pastor’s wife, and minister. I’m serving the Lord for over 40 years. I have asked, sought for a clear, step by step understanding of this text, in particular “borrowed” vessels, without a full understanding or explanation. If one borrows, he must at some point return, give back to owner. Evans you have made it so clear, and the Holy Spirit gave me a revelation while reading your message: the borrowed vessels will be returned to  the rightful Owner, the Lord Christ. When? On that last day of their life on the earth, or at the coming of Christ (can reference Matthew 25:14-30). Thank you so much!!! Excellent teaching!"

              "<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>2Kings 6:17, \"And Elisha prayed, and said, \"LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.\" Then the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw\"</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image9.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6288 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image9.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong></p>\r\nHave you ever been frustrated because someone or some people did not see what you see? You have vision, shared it but the impression they gave you indicated they did not see it, catch it or were unwilling to see it? You sit and wonder why they can't see what I see? I've been there, been frustrated and in the midst of it, the Lord taught me something profound.\r\n\r\n<strong>2Kings</strong> gives us a picture of Elisha and the Syrians. Elisha discerned the plot the Syrians had against the Israelites and he sent a message to warn the king of Israel of what awaited them. <!--more-->The Syrians were not pleased with Elisha who revealed their plan. They therefore devised plans to capture him. They came at night with such a great army and surrounded the city where Elisha was. In the morning when his servant woke up, went outside only to see that they were surrounded by such a great army and right there he panicked. One thing that amazes me about this story is the fact that two men were surrounded by such a great army. This indicates the panic the enemy has at those who trust and depend on God. There was no need for Syrian king to send a big army to surround two men unless the discerened something about these men, Elisha in particular.\r\n\r\nNow the scripture tells us that Elisha was aware of everything happening in the enemies inner chambers, behind closed door meetings. It had to be through a God given vision. And if the army came at night, I am sure <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Elisha already discerned their presence and still slept through the night peacefully,</span> this was extraordinary. You can make a decision that goes against the ordinary, and it may freak some when they do not understand why you can make such a moves. Only with time will God let them see what you see. The servant was not at peace because all he could see in the natural was an impossible situation. What will you do with people who are not seeing what you see? <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I believe that when God gives you a vision, yes there may be panic all around but you with the vision will be at peace in God.</span> You are not seeing in natural, you are seeing in the spiritual realm.\r\n\r\n<strong>vs. 15; \"...Alas; my master! What shall we do?\" 16, \"So he answered; \"Do not fear; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them\". </strong>We can encourage people not to be afraid because God is moving and still few will embrace the word. Elisha was seeing that there were more with them than those surrounding them. There is less in the natural (just them two) but there are more with them in the spiritual realm. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The natural eyes perceive of now situation, the spiritual eyes perceives of something greater</span>. The natural is limited to what it can see, the spiritual sees beyond barriers.\r\n\r\nInstead of Elisha rebuking, condemning, or being frustrated with his servant for not seeing what he was seeing, he prayed for him. <strong>2 Kings 6:17, \"And Elisha prayed, and said, \"LORD, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I pray, open his eyes that he may see.</span>\" Then the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw\". </strong>This is the best thing you can do for such people. Not praying about them but praying to God to open their eyes to see what you see, to experience what you experience.\r\n\r\nIf you are like Elisha’s servant, don't condemn or discourage someone of what they are doing (seeing) until you first understand why they do things the way they do. I have been rebuked in the past by people who thought I was harsh in the way I presented the gospel. And my response to them, \"<i>before you rebuke me, find out why I share my faith the way I do</i>\" and often times when I share why, they come back to agree with me because they now see what I see. To continue. Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>2Kings 6:17, \"And Elisha prayed, and said, \"LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.\" Then the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image10.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6290 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image10.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"234\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference between <strong>SEEING WHAT YOU BELIEVE</strong> and <strong>BELIEVING WHAT YOU SEE</strong>. I prefer the first one, it teaches you to see things through the eyes of faith. Faith negates facts, it sees beyond the natural and presents a whole new picture of things which produces hope. People can see something the way it is, you are seeing what it can be, that is seeing what you believe.You can be in a situation that everyone has stopped hoping for good for it or you can be like the woman with the issue of blood who saw far beyond the natural that she could be healed and in the midst of it encourage yourself into the victory, trusting in the One who is able and touched the hem of His garment.<!--more--> All people saw was her 12 years condition, what she was seeing was healing. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">It's our perception of things that channels us to see things from either men's point of view or God's. Whose report will you believe? </span>If you wait for people to always see it the way you do and agree with you before you move, you will never move. The woman with the issue of blood moved alone because of what she saw. <strong>Proverbs 23:7, \"For as he thinks (sees) in his heart, so is he\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIn my text, the servant of Elisha freaked out when he saw the soldiers surrounding their camp, the man of God was peaceful because he saw what he believed. Is it possible for the Lord to take away temporarily what He has given you so as to boost your faith in Him? Or He could take away something that He knows you can't do without and then He becomes your eyes to prove to you that He is in control of every part of your being. Paul (Saul) was persecuting Christians, after encountering with the Lord on the road to Damascus, <strong>Acts 9:8-9,”8 Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 9, And he was three days without sight</strong>\". His ability to see in the natural was taken away and had to be led for a season. His spiritual eyes were activated at that point and he was never the same again. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">At times what we see with our natural eyes can contaminate what we should see with our spiritual eyes.</span> For Saul (Paul), he was beginning a great journey that needed assurance that “<strong>it wasn't by</strong> <strong>might nor by power but by the Spirit of the Lord says the Lord of host”</strong>. He needed more of His spiritual eyes than his physical eyes. One man said, when he had his two natural eyes living in sin, he was blind but when he came to Christ after losing one of his physical eyes through an accident, he could clearly see things with one eye than with his once upon a time two eyes. Is not the eyes the windows to our soul? Is not eyes associated with vision? It's also through the same eyes that we can be deceived.\r\n\r\nElisha prayed and his servant’s eyes were opened to see that those who were with them were much greater than those who surrounded them.\r\n\r\nMy question to you, what do you see? have you reached to that place where you prayed that God would take your ability to see naturally in other words see things men's way and desire to receive the Spiritual eyes to see far and beyond. I believe you have to lose something before you can gain something. I desire to see more of what He sees rather than what I see. May the Lord pray for me to see what He has set aside like Elisha prayed for his servant. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Nehemiah 6:1-3 “…Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. 3 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? </strong>\r\n\r\nWhat distracts you? When you sit in a class or at church and are trying to be focused what are the things that draw your attention away? When you are at work and trying to diligently stay on task, what tends to deviate you from your task? Nehemiah was in a situation where he was doing a task for God, rebuilding the wall of the temple, and a distraction came to try to divert him from his task.<!--more--> Nehemiah said, “<strong>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates</strong>;” 6:1. He was busy working diligently for God. Nehemiah teaches us about being diligent and how to stay on task for the Lord.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Distraction will try to trap you</strong>. “<strong>Come let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono</strong>.” Ono was located seven miles southeast of Joppa near Lod (Lydda). It may have been proposed as a kind of neutral territory, but Nehemiah recognized the invitation as a trap. Temptation will always try to draw you away, and trap you from what God has called you to do. Some are easily distracted at the slightest thing when it comes to being committed to God’s work, but Nehemiah recognized the trap. These enemies tried to distract Nehemiah and take him away from his task.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Distractions display disobedience</strong>. “<strong>But they thought to do me mischief.” </strong>The purpose of those who were trying to distract Nehemiah was to divert him from the task. Temptation (distraction) itself is not sin, but yielding to it is. Perhaps they wanted Nehemiah to go out to eat, or to have “fellowship” with him. If Nehemiah went to Ono he would be seven miles away from the task at hand. However he sensed that they were scheming against him. Nehemiah was being diligent and obedient to the Lord’s work.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Distraction must be met with Determination</strong> “…<strong>I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease.” </strong>Nehemiah was doing a GREAT WORK for the Lord, building the wall of the Temple for Him. When they tried to divert him from his task, he said, I CANNOT COME DOWN. He couldn’t find it in his heart to allow his diligence to be sidetracked, or even slowed down. I picture Nehemiah working and talking at the same time, sending the messenger with his determined word for his enemies, that he refused to come down off the wall to go seven miles away from his ministry.\r\n\r\nDo you have that kind of commitment to laboring in ministry, whether you are paid or not (as I am not, as Evans is not) for ministry? Nehemiah then gives his reason for not being diverted when he asked, “<strong>WHY SHOULD THE WORK CEASE</strong>?” Why should our ministry for the Lord cease? Many distractions will try to lure you to trap you and cause you to be disobedient to God. Nehemiah met distraction with determination. “<strong>WHY SHOULD I LEAVE AND COME DOWN TO YOU</strong>.” If Nehemiah would have gone he would have placed his distraction on a higher priority than God’s work. Examine your heart today, when distraction come are you diverted or is it met by your determination. Do you, will you, say to your distractions, “<strong>I CANNOT COME DOWN, WHY SHOULD THE WORK CEASE</strong>!?”\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/the-harp-vs-the-javelin-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">The Harp VS The Javelin , Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/when-god-interrupts-your-ministry-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">When God Interrupts Your Ministry, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/a-picture-worth-living-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">A Picture Worth Living, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Psalm 100:1-5, “1 Make a joyful shout to the LORD, all you lands! 2Serve the LORD with gladness; Come before His presence with singing. 3Know that the LORD, He is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. 4Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. 5For the LORD is good; His mercy is everlasting, … “</strong>\r\n\r\nIt's very important to start your day on a good note; it sets the tone for the rest of your day.I get very busy and tired a lot, it therefore matters to me how I start my day. It is a choice we have to make otherwise we easily drift to become victims of stress, frustrations, and lack of joy trying to do what is right. The bible says in <strong>Nehemiah 8:10</strong>, “<strong>the joy of the Lord is your strength”</strong>.<!--more--> If we take a close look at the word “joy”, we learn that it is more than happiness. Happiness which goes with happening deals with how you feel at a given time when all is well. Joy comes when you know that regardless of what you have to deal with, you will make it with God. In other words rejoicing in the end result rather than the process. <strong>The joy of the Lord makes us comfortable in situations that make other people uncomfortable.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 100</strong> is a psalm of joy and singing, it starts with make a joyful shout to the Lord. I don't have to shout joyfully to be heard by people, I can shout inside and when my inside is touched, my external appearance will be the result of what is going on inside. Serving the Lord with gladness is awesome for I know that whenever I sit to work at my station, I am working and serving the Lord. This is a blessed time where I come in the morning to work and say Lord, I thank you for another opportunity to serve You in my department and serve others, shinning for you. <strong>1Corinthians 10:31, “Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs.” 2 Serve the LORD with gladness; Come before His presence with singing”</strong>. I believe music is the greatest tool used to uplift hearts. There is nothing I know people respond to like music, we have music collections. We listen to music over and over again. <strong>Psalm 22:3, “But You are holy, Enthroned in the praises of Israel</strong>”, in our praises is the Lord enthroned by Israel, by His people. Vs. “<strong>3Know that the LORD, He is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; We are His people and the sheep of His pasture”</strong>. A song with you will be advantageous to you all through the day because of who it lifts. When King Saul was tormented by evil spirits, guess what he did, he had David playing music in his presence and the more he played, the quicker the evil spirit left. Replace your worries and anxieties with a song in your heart and ear.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs.” 4Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name”. </strong>You cannot bring things that interfere with your spirit through the gates and into His courts. This is why we make the Lord our secret dwelling place, there is safety within. It is there that we praise and be thankful for who He is and what He will do.\r\n\r\nThis is a choice everyone has to make, yes we will have so much on our plates to accomplish and yes we will be dealing with tough things, but we have been given the power to change the course of the day by allowing the joy of the Lord to be our strength. Keep a song with you, enter His gates and into His courts, refuse anything to steal your praise, have a thankful heart and joy and be a beacon of light. <strong>I've made up my mind to start and finish the day well: I'VE SAID IT, I MEAN IT AND I'M HERE TO REPRESENT IT, </strong>blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/psalm-23-the-divine-shepherd-part-1of6-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Psalm 23: The Divine Shepherd, Part 1of6, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/28/teach-us-to-profit-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Teach Us To Profit, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/the-warrior-is-a-child-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Warrior Is A Child, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/because-of-who-you-are-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Because Of Who You Are, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/he-takes-knowledge-of-me-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">He Takes Knowledge Of Me, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Philippians 4:6-7, </strong><b>\"6 Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; 7 and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus</b>.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to do things when you feel like it, this journey is not about feelings but discipline. Getting in the presence of God and praying is hard but there is such a great joy when you do it. How often do we first try to do something, when it does not work we remember to pray? I think it's a guy thing. Women are quick to ask for direction when they get lost, men try hard to find their way and sometimes get frustrated when encouraged to ask for directions. I struggle with bible reading and praying in my walk too, however I keep striving<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Luke 8:24</strong>, Jesus told His disciples, \"<strong>Let us cross over to the other side of the lake</strong>\" and they launched out. It was Jesus idea to cross over with them. To move from familiar to the unfamiliar; from what they knew to do to what they did not know. There are people who get <strong>sea sick</strong> in the water and there are people who are afraid of heights. Few are afraid of the ground because the ground is solid and you trust it to hold you. You do not need help with what you know, it's what you don't know that gives you anxiety. You may try to get assistance after failing to do it yourself. In this case, everything seemed to be going as planned with Jesus in the innermost parts of the ship sleeping. The disciples seemed to have had everything under control, when all of a sudden there came a storm. In the midst of the storm, they tried to do everything they knew how to so as to steady the ship, and when all failed they remembered Jesus on board … <strong>vs. \"24, And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, \"Master, Master, we are perishing</strong>!”. <strong>Philippians 4:6, </strong>says<strong> \"Be anxious for nothing\"</strong> these men were anxious (very worried); they did not even stop to calm themselves down. All that consumed their mind was drowning. They had faith in Jesus but that faith seemed to have leaped out the hour they needed it the most. <strong>Our faith should not disappear in the storm, if anything, that is the time we need it the most</strong>. Had they meditated on the fact that Jesus was on board, they would have not been worried, in fact it should have increased their faith. Think of it this way, if the storm came so strong, do you think Jesus would have drowned? Can God drown? That truth should have been enough to build their faith. \"…<strong>but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God”. </strong>Instead of freaking out and trying to do it themselves they could have called on Jesus on board. \"in everything by prayer\", not some things. At times we feel like He is far away when we are in a storm, when in actual sense, He is with us and in us, He is on board. These men had an urgent need; their cry to Jesus was earnest and fervent. They called on Him, but what took them so long to do it in the first place? Simple, they tried doing it themselves. The bible says <strong>Romans 10:13, \"For \"whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>vs. \"7 and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus\". </strong>Jesus woke up and first dealt with the situation, He said to the wind, <strong>Mark 4:39, \"...Peace, be still\". </strong>This was more than peace to the storm but also peace to the disciples. This is the peace that originates with God, it is the peace which makes no sense. They getting caught up in what had just happened spoke these words to themselves, \"<strong>What manner of Man is this that even the winds obey His voice</strong>\", (paraphrased).\r\n\r\nWhy peace and not deliverance? Peace can make you comfortable in a storm. Jesus was comfortable, sleeping peacefully in the ship knowing that He could never drown. When He woke up, He didn't even make the ship move faster to the land. <strong>He wasn't going to be subject to the situation, the situation was going to be subject to Him</strong>. Showing the wind who is in charge. <strong>Jesus presence was peace alone they needed in the storm. </strong> After what they went through, you don’t hear them hurrying back to land to avoid another storm. They had a journey started and yet to be finished so they needed to ride through by faith in Him who was on board. <strong>Philippians 4:6&amp;7</strong> is our <strong>sea sick medication</strong>.

              "<strong>Isaiah 6:1-8, \"8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: ” Whom shall I send, And who will go or Us?”Then I said, “Here am I! Send me.”</strong>\n\n<strong>Isaiah 6 </strong>is one of my favorite passages. In the early chapters of the book of Isaiah, we see him having a vision from the Lord concerning the wickedness of Judah. He goes into lengthy detail to address its condition based on the vision. He talks about the future house of God, the day of the Lord, judgment on Judah and Jerusalem, oppression, the renewal of Zion and then in chapter 6 we see dramatic experience that changes him forever.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIsaiah may have felt fine and comfortable until he had an experience with God, he says in<strong> vs. \"1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. 2 Above it stood seraphim; … 3 And one cried to another and said: ” Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts;” The whole earth is full of His glory!”</strong>. In looking at the world, we have lost the fear of the Lord. This has crept even in the body of Christ. It is now easy to have a form of godliness but deny the power <strong>2Timothy 3:5.</strong> Everything is normal, we come to church, we sing songs, we pray, we hear the word, we are involved in ministries, but have we had an experience that awakens us to HUNGER for more?How can we be hungry when we feel full with what we do on day to day. Isaiah had seen the state of his people, the question is, was he hungry enough for God to move in his life and use him to reach his people? Not until he had an experience that messed his comfort. When we see the Lord sitting on the throne, high and lifted up, His righteousness and justice as foundation of His throne <strong>Psalm 97:2, Psalm 89:14 </strong>and we see how Holy He is and we are convinced,<strong> “.. we are all like an unclean thing, And all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags; We all fade as a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, Have taken us away”, Isaiah 64:6</strong>, then we will be ready for change. We need a hunger that drives us to change and that change will motivate us to be concerned for the lost sinners to reach them with the gospel. Reaching the lost is not reserved for certain people, it is for every believer. Those who act upon it are the ones who are hungry with passion and compassion.\n\nIn the state of our world today as Pastor John Piper preaches, “<strong>The glory of God is not honored, The holiness of God is not reverenced, The greatness of God is not admired, The power of God is not praised, The truth of God is not sought, The wisdom of God is not esteemed, The beauty of God is not treasured, The goodness of God is not savored, The faithfulness of God is not trusted, The promises of God are not relied upon, The commandments of God are not obeyed, The justice of God is not respected, The wrath of God is not feared, The grace of God is not cherished, The presence of God is not prized, The person of God is not loved”. </strong>Maythese words drive us to hunger for an Isaiah’s experience.\n\nAs a believer, having been saved, what experience in your life have you had that altered, challenged and awakened you to respond to the call of God? 5 years after I was saved, the thought of going to heaven consumed my mind. I felt secured and comfortable being saved. I did not want do anything more, after all I was already rescued from hell. It was not until I had my own Isaiah’s experience while praying that awakened me and put a hunger in me for more. The more I saw the glory of God, the righteousness of God, the holiness of God etc, the more I saw myself undone and the world I live in needed the gospel. I saw myself as one of the vessels to be used to bring them out of their own self righteousness to God’s righteousness. That they would have their own Isaiah’s experience that would alter their lives forever too.<strong> Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God“. </strong>Without the righteousness of God, they will perish<strong>.</strong> to continue, blessings Ev"

When you look at the marriages on the rocks, families in chaos, schools in trouble, the government having challenges, kidnappings left and right, murders, suicides, accidents, you name it is on the rise, how will we stand? There is a constant fear of what might happen even before it happens. Fear of tomorrow cripples majority.<!--more-->\n\nKing Hezekiah was faced with a situation that threatened him too, the threat was made by Sennacherib, king of Assyria. Now Assyria was known to be a powerful kingdom and they had subdued many nations even breaking their gods. Coming to King Hezekiah, they knew that Judah was protected by God but they tried to bring fear by saying God will not save them from Assyria's attacks. They said <strong>Isaiah 37:10, \"Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, \"Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria\". </strong>This is no different from what the devil whispers in our ears every day. The devil will accuse you of making mistakes with no avenues of a second chances or victories. He could be right that you blew it, but who told the devil our victories are based on what we did? They are based on the One who laid aside His majesty, giving up everything, suffering at the hands of those He had created, taking all the guilt and shame when He died and rose again. Today He has called us His own and He is seated at the right hand of God the Father making intercession for us. He says, \"When you pray, pray in my name\" because He knows how it feels to be lied on. You cannot cry over what could have been and how it could have been, you cannot also continue to plead with the enemy to leave you alone, you need to stand and tell him of who you are in Christ. If he reminds you of your past, remind him of his future. Hezekiah had been told that there was no way God would come to his rescue.  Instead of calling his servants to help him weep, he went to the house of God to pray. You understand what you are going through better than anyone else. You have a better way of expressing and presenting your case as you pray earnestly, constantly, effectively better han anyone else on your behalf.\n\n<strong>He received bad news but did not take it as the final word</strong>. Whatever the enemy whispers in our ears is not final, God has a final say in every situation. As long as He has not spoken against it, we should continue to bring it to Him. He received the letter, read it and thought, <strong>\"I have to take this to the Lord in prayer</strong>\", <strong>Isaiah 37:14</strong>, \"<strong>and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD\". </strong>Stop covering up what you are going through or trying to fix it in your own strength. Like Hezekiah, take it to the Lord and spread it out as it is in prayer. Remember this hymn <strong>\"What a friend we have in Jesus</strong>? Here are the lyrics\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">What a friend we have in Jesus, All our sins and griefs to bear!</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">What a privilage to carry <strong>Ev'rything to God in prayer!</strong></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Oh, what peace we often forfeit, Oh what needless pain we bear,</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">All because we do not carry,<strong> Ev'rything to God in prayer</strong>!</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\"></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">We should never be discouraged, <strong>Take it to the Lord in prayer</strong>:</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Can we find a friend so faithful Who will all our sorrows share?</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Jesus Knows our every weakness, <strong>Take it to the Lord in prayer</strong>.</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\"></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Are we weak and heavy laden, Cumbered with a load of care?</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Precious Saviour, still our refuge; <strong>Take it to the Lord in prayer:</strong></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? <strong>Take it to the Lord in prayer</strong>;</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:center;\">In His arms He'll take and shield thee; Thou wilt find a solace there.</li>\n</ul>\nJust as Hezekiah refused to take the enemy's word as final, we too can do the same today. You know what your needs are, take it to the Lord in prayer and spread it like it is.

              "<strong>Matthew 2:2-3, \"When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.\"</strong>\n\nWhen I read this verse what troubled me was what would cause Herod and all Jerusalem with him to be troubled? To answer that we have to look at a few aspects including who Herod was, how he came to rule, and how the Magi were connected to all of this all during the perfect timing of the birth of God's Son.<!--more-->\n\nLet us start with the Magi. What the magi likely did not know was that Herod ruled not in greatness of kingship but with great paranoia and deadly tactics of power and destruction. He is described as a madman who put to death many of his own family members, including two of his sons out of fear of their disloyalty and rise to power. The IVP Bible Backgrounds New Testament states, \"<em>King Herod, who was aware of broad currents of thought in the Roman Empire and sponsored pagan temples among Gentile cities in his realm, might have been especially apt to consider the Magi’s mission significant</em>.\" Needless to say, when Herod learned of the magi’s journey to behold the birth of a new king, he was angry and threatened by the news. Matthew reports, “[<b><i><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Herod] was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him.” The people of Jerusalem were well acquainted with Herod’s murderous tactics when fear and paranoia reigned in his kingdom.</span></i></b>\n\nWhen Herod discovered that the magi had tricked him, leaving town without reporting where they found the child king, what did he do? He did not sit idle, no not at all. The character of Herod was one of rule by the iron fist, and he would certainly implore more deadly tactics of power and destruction because that is what he did. John MacArthur shares, \"<em>Now let me set the stage. Politically speaking, Rome was scared of the eastern Empire. Now if you'll just focus in your mind a little map of Europe and that was the Roman Empire, this massive chunk of Europe. And technically it swept to the east. But by virtue of distance cross the Mediterranean, across the blazing desert to get to the east, there was a certain isolation in the east which caused Rome a lot of anxiety. And they were always fearful that what then became known as the Parthean Empire, the eastern empire made up of the Medes and the Persians and the old Babylonian territory, that Parthean Empire was always kind of an anxiety for Rome. Rome, you know, had stretched its tentacles out as it were to rule the world but they never really felt very secure about the Parthean Empire. And they had become violent enemies, violent enemies. And they fought. In 55 B.C. they fought. In 40 B.C. they fought. And what's fascinating is, you know where they always fought? The great empire in the west, the great empire in the east came together and guess where they always fought? Right along the coast of the Mediterranean, Syria, Jordan, Palestine. Israel was a little no-man's land between the powers of the east and the powers of the west”.</em>\n\nFurthermore MacArthur states, \"<em>Herod got panicky. When suddenly these Persian king makers appeared in Jerusalem no doubt traveling in full force with all their oriental pomp and they use to wear conical hats with points on the top and big deals clear down to the bottom of their chin and they rode Persian steeds not camels. And when they came in they didn't come alone, the estimates of history are they came with Persian cavalry. When they came charging into the city of Jerusalem and Herod peeked out his little palace window he flipped</em>.\n\nThese are powerful men and to make it worse his army was out of the country on a mission. And the Bible says Herod was troubled. I guess he was. The word in the Greek is he was agitated like your washing machine, he was shaking. You see, Herod had a title. Do you know what Herod's title was? King of the Jews. He got it from Caesar Augustus. Caesar Augustus crowned him king of the Jews. And he realized the great dream of his life was to get that little buffer state under his power and here he was in the middle of two huge contending empires. And all of a sudden this massive coterie of Persians arrive in the city and he is panicked and they say we're coming to find the new king.\". Herod is thinking, \"I'm the King of the Jews, and all the people better know it, and know and respect me in that role. Any threat to my rule will be met with death as I did with others, no one is exempt from my wrathful, vengeful, hand of power.\" <em>It is important to note, that \"at the time Herod was close to death. And Caesar Augustus was really old and hanging by a thread. And since the retirement of Tiberius the Roman army didn't even have a commander-in-chief. And they knew that this would be the time to bring about an eastern war against the west. It was right. And so Herod was shaking</em> (MacArthur).\"\n\nTherefore, he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under. At this decree, Matthew recalls what was said through the prophet Jeremiah long ago, now sadly fulfilled: “<strong><em>A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more”</em></strong> (<strong>Matthew 2:16-18).</strong> Herod’s violent reaction to the news of a newborn king casts a very sad shadow on a beautiful story. We remember with delight the magi outsmarting Herod by leaving for their country on another road. We remember with triumph that Mary, Joseph, and Jesus are able to escape to safety despite the murderous arm of a powerful ruler. But at what despairing cost? For the little town of Bethlehem, Herod’s command brought about excruciating sorrow. In fact, the inclusion of this frightful story at all is a grim and curious addition in an otherwise joyful telling of the beginnings of Christmas. It is no wonder we seldom reflect on it (Jill Carattini, RZIM).\n\nChrist was born during the slaughter of the innocence, but God protected His Son, but allowed a multitude of other children, from other parents to still die. If it is a much more serious offense to murder the US President than a homeless man in the eyes of the law, then how much more to murder the Son of God over those God merely created? Yes, God allowed the deaths of many children, but in His Master Plan, he guided His Son from the cradle to the cross where His own Son, \"...<strong><em>came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many</em></strong> (<strong>Mark 10:45),\"</strong> that we might be saved and redeemed by the blood of the real innocent, spotless Lamb of God, who came into the world to save sinners. He came to save His people from their sins and His is still saving them. God honored His Son with gifts from a foreign Magi, protected His Son by warning Mary and Joseph, and glorified His Son by seating Him back on His right hand. May we honor the Son, proclaim His name, and glorify the one that was born to die for my sin and yours!\n\nUntil the nets are filled...\n\nPhil Sessa, Soulfishing Ministries Evangelist <strong>&lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://qdvf.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/the-magi-history-meaning-22/\" target=\"_blank\">The Magi: History &amp; Meaning (2/2)</a> (qdvf.wordpress.com)</li>\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://shalommysticwind.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/epiphany-wise-men-come-to-worship-jesus-mt-2-1-12/\" target=\"_blank\">Epiphany: Wise Men Come to Worship Jesus (Mt 2: 1-12)</a> (shalommysticwind.wordpress.com)</li>\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ptl2010.com/2012/12/16/gods-promise-jesus-christ-slaughter-of-children/\" target=\"_blank\">GOD'S PROMISE - JESUS CHRIST - Slaughter of children</a> (ptl2010.com)</li>\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://qdvf.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/the-magi-history-meaning-12/\" target=\"_blank\">The Magi: History &amp; Meaning (1/2)</a> (qdvf.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>"

              "<b>Joshua 1:8, “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success”</b>\r\n\r\nGrowing in the Lord only comes from seeking Him daily, and feeding on his word. Saying you want to grow and be blessed is easy, but if you do not do what it takes to generate this growth, then do not be surprised if the enemy defeats you. Hibernating animals feed, while gathering and storing food for winter months because they will be incapable of leaving their dens during the season. Prior to the winter, these animals gather and store enough food to take them through the cold season. As believers, we also ought to do the same—eat the word, while gathering and storing enough for the challenging and harsh seasons. When those seasons come, and they will, we will be able to pull verses we learnt and stored in good times, and apply them in difficult situations.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhen Moses passed away, the Lord made Joshua the new leader of his people. Compared to his predecessor, God gave him different instructions, and adhering to each of them would make him prosperous and successful. “Meditate on it day and night, and not only that, but put its contents to practice.” These instructions were clear and concise. The journey ahead was in no way destined to be a smooth one, so as God’s appointed leader, Joshua needed to prepare himself and the people. “<b>The word is not effective when it’s heard or read, it’s effective when it’s utilized</b>.” James validates this point in James 1:22, when he says, “<b>But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.”</b> There are many times we hear the word, and even allude to its power. The question we must all ask our selves is this, “are we doers of the word, and are we practicing what we have studied?” Sometimes the word is placed in our lives to test our faith, especially during those wilderness-like experiences. It’s during those times that we should remember where we stored the word, and pull from it to get us through any kind of challenge. Several men in the Bible encourage us to be in the word:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Peter says, “DESIRE” God’s word. <b>1 Peter 2:2-3 says, \"As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, 3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.” </b>I pray daily for a hunger and desire for God’s word: it doesn’t naturally come to me.</li>\r\n\t<li>Job says, “TREASURE” God’s word<b>. Job 23:12 says, “I have not departed from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food.\" </b>Of all books, which one do you treasure most? Would you treasure it more than gold, silver, and other things?</li>\r\n\t<li>Paul says, “STUDY” God’s word<b>. 2 Timothy 2:15 says, \"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\" </b>In a day of errors and false teaching, we should be like the Bereans, mentioned in <b>Acts 17:11, which says, “These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.”</b></li>\r\n\t<li>David says, “HIDE” God’s word in our hearts. In <b>Psalm 119:11, </b>he says<b>, “Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.” </b>I do not know of any other way of overcoming sin, than by hiding God’s word in my heart. The thing we feed the most, ultimately wins. If we feed our spirit, it will win. If we mostly feed our flesh, it will trump over our spirit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe have what God recognizes as a means of blessings—His word. Do you desire his word? <b>Matthew 6:33, “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” </b>\r\n\r\nBlessings Ev\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</span>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/basic-instructions-before-leaving-earth-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/2572/\" target=\"_blank\">I Have A Life To Live, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong></strong><strong>Zechariah 4:6, “Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of hosts.”</strong>\r\n\r\nAre you facing any obstacle, challenge, situation or threats, which are like huge and impossible mountains to climb? Are you right now having piled up needs like a high mountain? Do you feel discouraged and distressed over some things that do not seem to give up, no matter how much you pray? Are there issues in your life and around you, which have built up into mountains too high for you to climb? Do you feel like giving up, at times, because you do not seem to be heading the right direction or realizing your dreams or having your desires met?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhatever your case may be, I want you to know that there is no mountain standing on your way, which can stop you from becoming the person God created you to be. <strong>Obstacles, which appear like huge mountains can be great stepping-stones to greater victories and success in our lives</strong>. <strong>Without them, we would not know how powerful our God is and the value of His grace upon our lives.</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you want to turn any mountain in your life to a flat plain, there are three steps I recommend to you to take today and always, whenever you face the impossible mountains:\r\n\r\n1. Decide to depend entirely and totally on the Spirit of God for your victory. Your strength, strategies, ideas, friends, church, family, finances, talents, skills etc. may be great and helpful, but will not by themselves push any mountain from your way. You need God \"<strong>For it is not by might (personal strength or power) by my Sprit says the Lord. God is dependable and capable of meeting any need, if it’s according to His will. He is God of all flesh and nothing is impossible with Him (Jeremiah 32:27).</strong>\r\n\r\n2. Determine in your heart to finish whatever you have started. Run to finish the race (<strong>1Corinthians 9: 24-27).</strong> Many people quit salvation, relationships, marriages, ministry, dreams and projects they started because they came a cross impossible mountains. Ze-rub-ba-bel, in the passage I referred to, was assure that if he stayed on, he would finish what he had started, <strong>not by his might but by the Spirit of God</strong>.\r\n\r\n3. Despise not the days of small beginnings or small things. Rejoice over your small achievements and praise the Lord for them. Give thanks in all things at all times. Testify of the Lord’s power and provisions in your life. Exalt Him and give Him the glory for the great things He has done and has promised to do. Remember great things grow from small beginnings. Mighty oak trees grow from tiny seeds. There is a seed of greatness planted in you. It needs time for it to grow into its fullest potential. Trust God. Look up to Him for help. Your up look will determine your outlook. Let Him turn every mountain in your life into a flat plain.

              "<strong>Hebrews 11:13-16, “These all died in faith, not having received the promise, but having seen them a far off, and were persuaded of them and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not a shamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city” </strong>\n\nThis passage of Scripture refers to the O.T saints who died with the faith that God had something better for them in store. What concerned them most was not when the promises were to be fulfilled but what they had to do in order to receive the promise.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThey were concerned also about the correct paths or ways they were to take to lead them to the promises in the now and then life. In their lifetime, they did not see the final promised blessing of the redeemed. Their primary hope was for was eternal life with God in a heavenly homeland (Where there is true homeland eternal security). They fixed their eyes on the new citizenship in the new heaven and new earth. See <strong>Isaiah 65:17 and Philippians 3:20 and Revelation 21:1.</strong>\n\nThe believers of today must likewise perceive correctly in faith their life’s destination and persevere in faith and trust in God, even when they do not see all the promises of God fulfilled in their lives.<strong> Believers must be ready and allow God to test their faith. For faith that cannot be tested cannot be trusted</strong>. On the long life’s journey to the destinations God has determined for us, one thing is critical, if we are to reach the destinations: and that is having correct map. A map is simply what shows the right way of getting to a destination from the point where one is. A map is about a territory. It is not the territory. It shows points and locations in the territory. Christians are citizens of two territories: the earth, where we live right now and the heavenly kingdom where we are headed. On earth, we are called pilgrims or strangers or sojourners. In other words, we don’t belong here permanently. Our permanent citizenship is heaven. But while we are here, on a journey, we have dreams, goals, wishes, hopes and desires which we would like to achieve, acquire or reach. And, it is in God’s best interest that we successfully reach the destinations. These things are in the territory of life. Do you know where they are? Do you know how to get there? Can you be able to tell when you arrive or whether you should still be on the road? These are important questions to ask on your way to your destiny.<strong> Faith is wonderful and you cannot do without it. But accurate roadmap is crucial. The Word of God is your accurate roadmap. It must be studied, correctly interpreted, understood and correctly applied</strong>. God has given the directions to all you could ever need or desire, in The Word. Use it. Don’t’ depend on your own knowledge or experience or assumptions, for direction. Worse still, do not depend on others who don’t have the correct map, don’t know the way and yet are always trying to give directions. Faith, correct perception of where you are headed and perseverance will lead you to receiving the promise. “<strong>Seek you first the Kingdom of God and all these other things shall be added unto you” Be independent most of the time; dependant on others sometimes; but, depend on God all the time for direction</strong>, strength to persevere and faith to receive the promise. Avoid any misguiding direction or information. Then, like the O.T saints, you will embrace the promises even if you don’t receive them.\n\n<strong>“It is the way we “see” the world-not in terms of our visual sense of sight, but in terms of perceiving, understanding, interpreting, in light of God’s Word (which is what faith is) that determines how we choose paths that lead us to our desired destination” Blessings Boaz</strong>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/faith-flavors-we-favor-boaz-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Faith Flavors We Favor, Boaz Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/turning-your-mountain-into-a-plain-pastor-boaz-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Turning Your Mountain Into A Plain, Pastor Boaz Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Genesis 39:6, “Thus he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate”</strong>.\r\n\r\nTo take a way a man’s freedom is to take away his reason for living. Watching inmates being interviewed especially those locked up in a confined environment talk candidly about what it means and feels to loose freedom. There are some who end up going crazy because their freedom is taken away due to what’s been done.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nRecently I shared from <strong>Genesis 39</strong>, I feel compelled to look at it again as I gained additional insight off the passage. From <strong>Genesis 39-42</strong>, about 20 times the word ALL is used in reference to Joseph, which I find very important. The ALL I see deals with freedom given to him to act in different capacities. Going back to <strong>Genesis 39 </strong>where Portiphar made Joseph the overseer of ALL that he had, we see him living freely. Given freedom to control, direct, handle, in charge of all in Portiphar’s house. What is freedom? There are several definitions depending on the circumstance, for the sake of this message, I would define it as <strong>the ability to act freely or a state in which somebody is able to act and live as he or she chooses, without being subject to any undue restraints or restrictions. A state of independence</strong>. Joseph had that in Portiphar’s house. He was brought to be a slave, the way he lived suggested more than a slave.\r\n\r\nOf course we know that freedom was taken away from him and confined in prison where he was no longer in charge of Portiphar’s house and his movement was restricted having been accused of attempted rape. All that he was in charge of was gone.\r\n\r\nWho does not love freedom? Yet in the realm of our day to day, lives crave for freedom, however we have an enemy who wants to take that freedom away from us. There are people right now reading this who at one point felt freedom in certain areas of their lives but right now feel caged, imprisoned, bound because an enemy has done this, oppressed. The joy of being free is gone; you wake up each day feeling imprisoned in fear, doubt, depression, and defeat. Your financial situation has left you imprisoned to debt and you don’t feel freedom to serve the Lord like you should. Family situations, sickness have imprisoned you.\r\n\r\nI have a word for us from the Lord, <strong>Psalm 146:7, “…The LORD gives freedom to the prisoners”, </strong>but for what purpose? To be free to just enjoy ourselves and do what we want? No, <strong>Free to serve Him</strong>. That ought to be the drive to desire freedom. When God said in Exodus that he heard the cry of His people the Israelites, He’s main reason for coming to their rescue was not to bring them to the promise land to escape their bondage, prisons and enjoy the land, it was to make them free that they may serve Him. <strong>Exodus 4: 22-23, \"Then you (Moses) shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Israel is My son, My firstborn. 23 So I say to you, let My son go that he may serve Me</strong>”. Joseph had the same freedom to serve God in Portiphar’s house, even in prison and when he was elevated out of prison to be Portiphar’s boss. We also thank God for benefits too that come about when He frees us. <strong>John 8:36, “Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed”</strong>\r\n\r\nAre you craving for freedom? Is this your cry? “<strong>God free me from my prison to freely serve You”?,</strong> this is my prayer, I am imprisoned in some areas of my life and only Him can free me from my prison and lead me to serve Him more and more freely.

              "<strong>Acts 5:17-20, “17 Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with indignation, 18 and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. 19 But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, 20 “Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe disciples in early church as recorded in the book of Acts were powerful having been filled with the power of the Holy Ghost to be witnesses for Christ. After the departure of Christ, we see Peter assume the role of leadership over the disciples. We see him and the rest used mightily of God. The once upon a time coward Peter who denied Christ was bold enough under the unction of the Holy Spirit to preach Christ even to the point of being thrown in prison. <strong>Peter was no stranger to prison neither were some of the disciples as we read in the book of Acts</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Acts 2</strong>, Peter preached the gospel and about three thousand people were converted, in <strong>Acts 3, </strong>Peter and John under the power of the Holy Ghost healed a man. They used the healing as a spring board to preach Christ which led to their arrest. We need to note that the devil is not happy when the work of God is in progress. He does not want God glorified; he would rather take the glory and not God. And as long as you are determined to bring glory to God where you are, be ready to be under attack. The enemy will always say, “<strong>throw down your weapon and I will leave you alone, stop serving and I will leave you alone</strong>”, he will threaten to take away your freedom, squeeze, frustrate, try to silence and get you overwhelmed. His aim is to stop God’s work whatever the cost.\r\n\r\nWhile they threatened the disciples to take away their freedom, they prayed for boldness to continue to preach the word of God stopping at nothing. Continuing in power in the early church, the bible says, <strong>Acts 5:12-16,″12… through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon’s Porch. …. 14 And believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, 15 so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall on some of them. 16 Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed</strong>”. God’s work was on the move and this opened more to persecution.\r\n\r\nWho tends to be a threat to the enemy? Those who are in the will of God, hungry to see Him glorified. Those who want to serve Him. Those who are not a threat are less under attack but those who have counted the cost and placed their lives on the line for the sake of Christ are opened to attack. And the attack I take a close notice of in the book of Acts is freedom taken away from God’s people so as to silence them from proclaiming what they had seen and heard. But God will not let the enemy prevail, <strong>Acts 5:17-20, “17 Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with indignation, 18 and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. 19 But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, 20 “Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life</strong>.” They imprisoned them, God sent His angel to free them for His service. You would wonder why the Lord would not prevent them from going to prison. I believe the Lord used those times to confirm to them that they were in His will, to strengthen their faith as He demonstrated His power, and to prove to those who wanted to silence His work His power.\r\n\r\nWhenever you feel imprisoned for doing God’s work, the Lord will always provide a way of escape by opening the prison doors for your release to keep serving Him.

              "<strong>Acts 21:12-14, \"12 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. 13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. 14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nStay the course is a term that one would hear from a leader, when one a mission, and is tempted to take an easier road. Scott Peck wrote a famous book, The Road Less Traveled, and Jesus said that there were two roads as well, the wide way and the narrow way. The narrow way is the road, or course, less traveled which is why Jesus said few find it (<strong>Matthew 7).<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nThe Apostle Paul seemed to always live his life on a mission. If you recall his life before his conversion, when his name was Saul, his mission was to kill Christians <strong>(Acts 9, 22)</strong>. When Paul was converted Jesus spoke to Ananias saying about Paul, “<strong>For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake\", Acts 9:16. </strong>Although Paul would face suffering on the course that he was on for Jesus, he refused to be deterred. In the above verses, there were some well-meaning believers who tried to persuade Paul not to go up to Jerusalem for fear that Paul would be killed. Paul however would not be persuaded, or taken off course. What kept Paul to stay the course?\r\n\r\n1. Paul’s eyes were fixed. <strong>Hebrews 12:2 </strong>reads, “<strong>Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” (NIV</strong>) Paul kept his eyes on Jesus and he knew that Jesus would keep His eyes on Paul. If Jesus calls you then He will keep you. Are your eyes fixed on Jesus as you make your daily decisions? What decision are trying to make, and is Jesus’ will even a factor in the process?\r\n\r\n2. Paul did not swerve <strong>Proverb 4:27, “Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.</strong>” It’s easy to be deterred when your eyes are not fixed on Christ. One doesn’t intend to go off course; usually one slowly drifts away from the course. What causes you to swerve left or right? What are the obstacles? Have you identified your “course – deterrents?” Laziness? Time/business? Wrong or unbalanced priorities? If your lazy, stop; too busy, change it; priorities wrong, alter them. Stop swerving!\r\n\r\n3. Paul was ready to die. <strong></strong><strong>1Corinthians 15:31, \"I p</strong>rotest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily\". Paul was even ready if need be to die for Jesus. Now I don’t want to die, however, Paul died to his selfishness, his agenda, his course, and embraced Jesus’ course for his life. Do you die daily to these things? At the end of Paul’s life he was able to say these words, which we should all hope to be able to say, “<strong>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith\", 2Timothy 4:7. </strong>Will you be able to say that one day, will I? Will you STAY THE COURSE!\r\n\r\nDear Father, guide me to stay the course. Father help me to identify my course-deterrents. Help me to resist the temptations that enter my life, that push me off of Your will and plan for me. Lord, help me slow down and spend more quality time with You. Help me make the moment-by-moment decisions in my life that please You. Lord, forgive me for veering off Your course. I pray all this in Christ’s name, Amen.

              "<strong>Colossians 1:28, \"... Christ in you, the hope of glory\"</strong>\r\n\r\nMost times, hopeless people have no reason to live. Most suicides are as a result of hopelessness. Over one million people commit suicide every year. The World Health Organization estimates that suicide is the thirteenth-leading cause of deaths worldwide. The National Safety Council rates it sixth in the United States. Suicide is the leading cause of death among teenagers and adults under 35. I further discovered that worldwide, an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal suicide attempts occur every year. In the midst of these startling statistics, I take comfort in knowing that hope keeps man alive. As long as hope remains alive, it doesn't matter what we go through, including pain and suffering because hope propels us to continue fighting until the end. People who lose hope throw in the towel and call it quits; however, hopeful people keep standing through time and seasons. Hope is an expectation and an anticipation; something to look forward to. Hope isn't about uncertainty, it's a certainty that just hasn't yet been realized.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Faith is the backbone that keeps hope alive.</strong> You hope for something that has not materialized yet. When you hope for something, you just can't stop thinking and talking about it, watching for it, and even waiting for it. In <strong>Luke 15</strong>, Jesus tells the parable of a father who had two sons. This is now famously referred to as “The prodigal son.” In the story, the younger son took his inheritance and went to a far country where he wasted it on a riotous living. When he finally came to his senses after spending everything, he decided to go back home. While he was gone, his father had been hoping, praying, waiting, and watching for him to come home. <strong>Luke 15:20 says “And he rose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.”</strong> His father didn't just see him passing by; he had been hoping that one day he would come home. Hope had been keeping him alive, and for that reason, he was never plagued with depression and fear. Hope will make you embrace promises and desires even they seem so distant. When the things you are hoping for finally appear, you will run to receive them.\r\n\r\n<strong>Someone who is hopeful is at rest</strong>. The Psalmist says in <strong>Psalms 16:9, “Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh shall rest in hope.</strong>” Feeling restless is a painful situation to be in. People who are in “Hope” mode do different kinds of things to keep that hope alive. <strong>Psalm 71:14 says “But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</strong>” You can be in hope mode and still complain and wonder when the thing you are hoping for will come to fruition. The Psalmist said he would keep hope alive daily and consistently, and praise the Lord even more. Praising the Lord while in hope mode is vital because it keeps fueling the faith needed to trust the Lord even more, so you won't give up.\r\n\r\n<strong>Colossians 1:28 says “Christ in you, the hope of glory...”</strong> Our greatest hope is in Christ. What a way to hope. He is always with us, and promises to never leave us. When we get discouraged and feel like giving up, His words of comfort and hope keep us alive, so we can trust Him. As He orders our steps and guides us, He teaches us to hope in Him even more. If he brought us this far, He will certainly take us even further. If He provided for us then, He will do it again. If He fought for us then, we hope that He will do it again. If He provided a job then, He will do it again. We must hope in Him all day long.\r\n\r\nHave you lost hope in the possibility of getting married, being in ministry, and being used by the Lord? Have you lost hope in finding your desired career, achieving your goals and becoming somebody? If you have, don't let hope die because Christ lives in you. Keep living to the fullest and exercise the things that will keep your hope alive, and remember, “<strong>Christ in you, the hope of glory, the hope of splendor, of magnificence, of wonder, of brilliance, and of many more\"</strong>\r\n\r\nKeep Hope Alive!!!!!

              "<strong>Genesis 45:4-5, 7-8 \"Then Joseph said to his brothers, \"Come close to me.\" When they had done so, he said, \"I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.\"...... vs. 7-8 \"But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.\" NIV.</strong>\r\n\r\nI have been reading the Bible from cover to cover and this is my 3rd time starting from Genesis and it always amazes me how every time I read the passages I already read before there is always a new revelation or a renewed understanding of what I am reading at the time. I am assuming we are all familiar with the story of Joseph, how his father Jacob loved him more than his other brothers and this resulted into jealousy among his brothers and they eventually sold him off to the Egyptians and they came back and lied to their father that Joseph died<!--more-->. I have always wondered if that was me and I survived like Joseph did, what I would want to do to my brothers, people that I thought loved me and were my own flesh and blood. Could you imagine the kind of feelings that would be going inside your heart? But what did Joseph do? I believe the first and the second time he encountered with his brothers he was tempted to revenge or get even but I believe he stopped himself because he was a man of God and he realized that what he was doing was not right.We all face or have faced or will face circumstances like Josephs' where your own people that you thought you could count on, sell you out. Family members that you thought had your back actually didn't and friends that you thought were closer than a brother were just pests. So when you come into that situation, what are we as Christians supposed to do? As humans we want revenge and we want them to suffer as much as we did, but is that the heart that a Christian should have? We are told in the bible that vengeance is of the Lord. So what do we do? We become the bigger people and return good for evil, we forgive even when it's clear that the other person ought to be the one asking for forgiveness. We live in harmony and peace as much as possible with our neighbors and we carry ourselves like Christians. We watch our tongues, what comes out of our mouths should not make people's heads turn with disbelief and wonder what kind of a Christian are you. We should truly love one another not just giving lip service but actually being it and doing it just as God loves us regardless of the many times we sin against him. And that's what Joseph did, he revealed to them who he was and told them not to  be afraid because I'm thinking they were afraid for their lives.\r\n\r\nIf you meet someone you did something awful to, you know you are in trouble because that person will want to give you a taste of your medicine. So they were terrified and Joseph tells them no worries, forget about everything, <span id=\"__mceDel\"><span style=\"font-style:normal;\">you guys actually did me a favor, and you know what? It was all God's doing, He allowed all this to happen because He knew you all would need help and I am your help. Isn't that amazing? Whereas sometimes or many times when we are faced with challenges like Joseph did, we want someone to blame instead of taking on that challenge as a blessing, a time to grow, to be pruned (as my husband would say), a time to reflect, and maybe a time to step back, relax and come back stronger and wiser and more blessed.</span><strong><span style=\"font-style:normal;\"> A challenge can be a blessing if channeled correctly.</span></strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"__mceDel\">So my dear brothers and sisters, when faced with impossibilities and challenges, remember Joseph went through all that, even being put in prison for something he never did but he rose, he became the head, from the pit that he was, he became a ruler. Rise above whatever it is you a</span><span id=\"__mceDel\"><span id=\"__mceDel\">re facing and know that the Lord is fighting your battle, you are not alone! Believe it because we serve a mighty mighty God!! Blessings Judy</span></span>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/when-you-cant-get-what-you-want-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">When You Can't Get What You Want, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/god-crowns-faithfulness-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">God Crowns Faithfulness, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>John 4:20-26-Verse 22, “You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for Salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. 24 God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth...”</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are anything like me, every now and then, you probably find yourself meditating on something profound that you should have paid closer attention to in the first place to understand why it was done, so you can explain it to others. I have been meditating on this passage for about a week now. What does it mean to be a worshipful person or be in a worship service? The question isn't whether I know what being worshipful is, it's more of finding ways to articulate it to people in a way that makes sense, as I continue to discover more about the mysteries of worship.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI don't know whether the scripture clearly defines what worshiping God really is. I know what it means to worship Him, but I haven't been able to find a clear biblical text that defines it in its entirety. When I read the scriptures, I conclude that worship isn't limited to praising. In a broad perspective, it can be regarded as directly acknowledging God-his nature, attributes, ways and claims, whether by the outgoing of the heart in praise and thanksgiving, or by the deeds done to honor him. <strong>Worship goes with worthiness; ascribing to God’s greatness</strong>. True worship service is where Christ is exalted in and through us by the Spirit of God. Pastor Gregg Johnson, senior pastor of The Mission Church said <strong>“By His Spirit…For His glory.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn <strong>John 4,</strong>Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman at the well and taught her what true worships is, amongst other things. Until that time, most people believed that only in a temple, and specifically at the tabernacle, could anyone truly worship God. But Christ came to establish a new thing. He came to clarify what true worship really is. He stressed the irrelevance of an actual geographical location or physical structure specifically set aside for worship. The place of worship isn't the essence of true worship because true worship is a state of heart and mind. In <strong>John 4:23</strong>, the Samaritan woman says <strong>“Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.”</strong> Worship isn't about where it is done, but how it is done. It has nothing to do with our outward appearance or our actions, but something much deeper than that. In verse 21 of the same chapter Jesus said to her<strong>, “Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.</strong>”\r\n\r\nMatthew Henry made the following statement: “<em>As creatures, we worship the Father of all: as Christians, we worship the Father of our Lord Jesus. Now the change shall be, in the nature of the worship. Christians shall worship God, not in the ceremonial observances of the Mosaic institution, but in spiritual ordinances, consisting less in bodily exercise, and animated and invigorated more with divine power and energy. The way of worship which Christ has instituted is rational and intellectual, and refined from those external rites and ceremonies with which the Old-Testament worship was both clouded and clogged” </em>\r\n\r\nJesus reiterated that where we worship shouldn't be the primary focus (though at times it can be), but our attitude and the condition of our hearts. This is the first point I want to emphasis in this devotion. Worship is about how Christ is exalted above every word, thought and deed, in your heart, in your life, and through you “<strong>by His Spirit...for His glory</strong>.”\r\n\r\nTo be continued.

              "<strong>John 4:20-26, “22 You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. 24 God is Spirit, and those who worship, Him must worship in spirit and truth.”</strong>\r\n\r\nAs Jesus mentions in this passage, Samaritans were worshipers. However, their only problem is that they did not know who they were worshipping. By the same token, I am convinced that in our churches today, many people come to worship a God they know little or nothing about. They may know about Him, but have little or no understanding of who He really is; most times, because they haven't studied His word enough to actually get to know Him.<!--more--> How can we worship the true God and still believe that there are many ways to Him? If we truly worship Him, how can we still believe in evolution, and conclude that abortion and homosexuality are not sin? How can we worship God and still embrace gambling and many other vile things that are contrary to the God revealed in the divine scriptures? Some people struggle with dealing and accepting because they are learning, the ones mentioned here are those who have bluntly rejected many of these truths and have acknowledged their way to be okay, they have even given seals of approvals. True worshipers know who their God is, and what He requires of them.\r\n\r\nIn<strong> Acts 17:16</strong>, Paul encountered the Jews and Gentiles in Athens. These people were very religious, they worshipped idols and other unknown gods. They worshipped gods, but they did not worship the true God because they had never been introduced to Him. They were zealous, but they lacked knowledge. In verse 22 and 23 of the same chapter, Paul says to them “<strong>vs. 22…Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; 23 for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you:” Acts 17:22-23.” </strong>The true worshippers of God the Father must worship him in spirit and truth. These two go hand in hand. By spirit, the scripture isn't referring to the Holy Spirit, but the human spirit--a willing heart. For true worship to occur, a willing heart must be accompanied by truth. God has magnified His Word above His name. I believe the reason for this is simply that believers may learn Biblical truth and turn their worship to Him in spirit and truth. This is one of the reasons I love the preaching of the Word. The preaching of the word exalts Christ, the God of the Bible, rather than the god of my choosing. Heaven and earth will pass away, but the Divine Word will not. With this understanding, the word is preeminent to every other form of manifestation.\r\n\r\nPaul Washer, a preacher and missionary with Heart Cry Missionary Society said “<strong><em>Preaching is not the end for those who are hearing, but the means to worship</em>.” </strong>In <strong>Psalm 138:2,</strong>David says,<strong> “I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your loving kindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your word above all Your name.”</strong> The Lord had ordained a center of unity; a place of sacrifice and a house of His indwelling, and David accepted the type of worship revealed in the Lord's Word. Even so, a true-hearted believer in this day must not fall into the will worship of superstition, or the wild worship of skepticism, but worship reverently as the Lord Himself describes in His word. When Christ is exalted, the Word is the means to an end whereby which God is worshipped.\r\n\r\nJesus preached nothing but truth to the Samaritan woman at the well. He did not sugarcoat her sin; instead, He exposed her adulterous lifestyle, but stated that only in true repentance would she finally be able to worship the Holy and Just God. We see the same thing while Paul was preaching to the Athenians Therefore, let us adore the Lord who has spoken to us by His word, and by His Son. In the presence of unbelievers, let us both praise His holy Name and extol His Holy Word.

              "<strong>Romans 1:16, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes …” </strong>\r\n\r\nSince last week, the Lord has been dealing with me concerning the power that ought to be present in my life, and in other people as well, and I have found myself meditating heavily on this word “power.” Many people know about God's power. The question is this; is it present in our lives and are we craving to see it at work, or is it possible that the Lord has shut down his power in our lives because we are not hungry enough to actually cry out to Him for it?\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAs I was meditating on <strong>Romans 1:16, </strong>I could not think of a more fitting story that highlights God's power more than that of Lazarus, who Jesus raised from the dead in <strong>John 11</strong>. I have seen people who I never possibly imagined could get saved, actually come to Christ, and I believe the Lord does this to constantly remind us of his saving power that comes through the gospel. I believe the Lord is calling on us to pray to Him to be empowered to share the gospel that He may save the lost. Allow me to borrow a few words shared by Ray Comfort and John McArthur, preachers I respect. First of all, Paul declares that the gospel is the power of God. <em>Dunamis</em> (power) is the Greek term from which our word <em>dynamite</em> is derived. <strong>The gospel carries with it the omnipotence of God, whose power alone is sufficient to save men from sin and give them eternal life</strong>.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>John 11</strong>, John reports to us that Lazarus had been dead and buried for four days. Jesus came to give life that no one else can give, and this was the message he had for Lazarus's sisters in <strong>John 11:25-26</strong> when he said <strong>“25 I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. 26 And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?” Only Christ in His sovereign power could give Lazarus life. It's this same power through the gospel that gives sinners life. </strong>If the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, how is it that there are people who can make professions of faith and not live it? Is it possible that the power of God actually never saved them in the first place? Ray Comfort in his message \"Hell's best kept secret\" shares this:\r\n\r\n<em>\"What it is is a sad admission of the amount of confidence we have in the power of our message and in the keeping power of God. If God has saved them, God will keep them. If they’re born of God, they’ll never die. If He’s begun a good work in them, He’ll complete it to that day (Philip. 1:6); if He’s the author of their faith, He’ll be the finisher of their faith (Heb. 12:2). He’s able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by Him (Heb. 7:25). He’s able to keep them from falling and present them faultless before the presence and glory with exceeding joy (Jude 24). Jesus said, “No one will pluck you from my father’s hand” (John 10:29). You see, saints, the problem is that Lazarus is four days dead (John 11). We can run in the tomb, we can pull him out, we can prop him up, we can open his eyes, but “he stinketh” (vs. 39). He needs to hear the voice of the Son of God. And the sinner is four days dead in his sins. We can run up and say, “Say this prayer.” Still, he needs to hear the voice of the Son of God, or there is no life in him; and the thing that primes the sinner’s ear to hear the voice of the Son of God is the law. It’s a schoolmaster to bring him to Christ that he might be justified through faith (Gal. 3:24)\"</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>John 11:38-39 says </strong>\"<strong>38</strong> <strong>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.</strong>” If Christ had the power to bring life, He also had the power to remove the stone. But He told them to take away the stone. Although it's the power of God that gave life to Lazarus, we as believers have 3 tasks in removing stones from the tomb of unbelievers by simply being <strong>Christ-like before them, interceding and witnessing to them</strong>. That's all we can do to reach our unsaved loved ones and friends. Remember that Lazarus's sister called on Christ, and He encouraged them, and eventually gave life.\r\n\r\nJohn McArthur comment on the salvation process says: <em><strong>\"Only the power of God is able to overcome man’s sinful nature and impart spiritual life</strong>. <strong>Romans 5:6, “For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly” Salvation through Christ is God’s powerful hand, as it were, that He has let down to lift men up</strong>. His salvation brings deliverance from the spiritual infection of “this perverse generation” (Acts 2:40), from lostness (Matt. 18:11), from sin (Matt. 1:21), and from the wrath of God (Rom. 5:9). It brings deliverance to men from their gross and willful spiritual ignorance (Hos. 4:6; 2 Thess. 1:8), from their evil self-indulgence (Luke 14:26), and from the darkness of false religion (Col. 1:13; 1 Pet. 2:9), but only for those who believe.”</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>When we LIVE, PRAY and WITNESS to the lost, the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit through the gospel will CONVINCE, CONVICT, CONVERT and CONTAIN.</strong> Blessings Ev.\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/26/the-power-of-the-gospel-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Power Of The Gospel, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/faith-flavors-we-favor-boaz-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Faith Flavors We Favor, Boaz Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/the-testimony-of-god-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Testimony Of God, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Luke 22:30-32, “31 And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.”</strong>\r\n\r\nA true worshiper of God constantly hungers to walk in His will. We often wrestle to know if we are acting in the flesh or led of the Spirit. We want to know who is standing on our way, God or Satan. We want to know who is in control. Many times we blame Satan, (give him too much credit) when things are not going right we read his mission, <strong>John 10:10, \"The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy...\" </strong>His mission is not news to us, but is he the main issue?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe more I walk with God the more I realize that what God has blessed can no man curse or change it, not even Satan. Believers ought to take comfort in God, the One in charge of their lives. Before salvation we were under another ruler. When I study Scriptures, those who were possessed by the devil and cast out were not believers, if anything they were potential converts. They were under Satan’s dominion. At the point of salvation, we came under a new government, under new ownership. <b>This is why I believe those who are of God can only be oppressed by Satan and his agents and not owned by him. God is in control of believers lives.</b>\r\n\r\nIn this passage<strong> Luke 22:30-32, </strong>we see the oppression of Satan taking effect, however Jesus is in control the whole time only allowing Satan as an agent to sift Peter for something bigger to come. Jesus prayed for Peter’s faith not to fail, in other words, submit to God in faith and resist Satan in areas he was not permitted to touch.<strong> “31 And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.”, Luke 22:30-32. </strong>\r\n\r\nThis story is similar to that of Paul in <strong>2Corinthians 12. </strong>Paul had been to heaven, he tells the story though he speaks of himself in the third person to stay humble, he says Vs. “<strong>7 And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. 8 Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me, 9 And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong”, 2Corinthians 12:7-10. </strong> Paul knowing God was in control and allowed an agent of Satan to oppress him in some way, Paul in prayer submitted to God, and God gave him grace to resist yielding to more than what was permitted.\r\n\r\nSo why was Satan allowed in Peter, Paul and even Job’s case? To quote Zac Poonen,<em> “Why didn't Jesus say, \"Simon I have prayed for you that you will not deny Me even once\"? We would like the Lord to say to us \"My son, my daughter, I have prayed for you that you will never fall and never fail.\" But interestingly enough, our Lord doesn't pray such a prayer for us. What did Jesus pray for Simon? <strong>That when Satan tempted him, his faith would not fail</strong>. He didn't pray that Peter should not fall in temptation, but that when he did fall, his faith in God's perfect love would not fail him so that even when Peter reached the bottom of the pit of failure, he would confess, \"God still loves me\". That is faith - and that is the confession we must always have on our lips and in our hearts - no matter how low we may have sunk or fallen - that God still loves us, JUST AS WE ARE,…<strong>The Lord uses Satan to remove the chaff from our lives to accomplish His purpose. Only through many experiences of failure do we finally reach a \"zero point\", where we're truly broken”</strong></em>\r\n\r\n<strong>1Peter 5:5-11, “5 …“God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.” 6 Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, 7 casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you. 8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 9 Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. 10 But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you. 11 To Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>The more we feel the oppression from Satan, the more we ought to submit to God in prayers for therein lies the strength to resist him. If God is in control, we know that God is working all things (including the oppression from Satan) together for our good, Romans 8:28. To stay in God’s will over Satan, we have to constantly submit to God first, then resist for him to flee, James 4:7.

              "<strong>Luke 5:17, “And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">and the power of the Lord was present to heal them”</span></strong>\r\n\r\nForces against the workings of the Lord come in many ways, in those opposing times, in faith the Lord arises to demonstrate His power.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIt was Jesus custom to teach and perform miracles. On one particular day reported in <strong>Luke 5:17,</strong> He was teaching those who were opened to hear the Word of God, and there came from a far Pharisees and doctors of the law. You would imagine that they were there to hear the Word of God, contrary. An important binary in the NT is the opposition between law and love. Accordingly, the NT presents the Pharisees as obsessed with man-made rules, traditions (especially concerning purity) whereas Jesus is more concerned with God’s love. The Pharisees scorn sinners whereas Jesus seeks them out. They were always opposing what Jesus was doing. In the presence of all the opposing sides, the bible says, \"...<b>them</b> <strong>power of the Lord was present to heal them\"</strong>, who are them? those whose hearts were opened to receive by faith despite who they were.\r\n\r\nWe now have to understand the power talked about here and it’s effectiveness before we can see if we need it. Nelson’s New Illustrated Bible Dictionary defines <em>power as the ability or strength to perform an activity or deed. Power is sometimes used with the word authority. If power suggests physical strength, authority suggests a moral right or privilege</em>. Those born of God require power in their lives to live for God. Many times we do things in our own strength unaccompanied by the power of God. No person at no time, now or then could ever do anything that would please God apart from God’s power. <strong>Ephesians 3:20, “Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">according to the power that works in us</span></strong>”. I have quoted this verse many times, but today it hits me from a different angle and that is the last part “<strong>according to the POWER that works within us</strong>”. <strong>God is able to do more in  believers because of the presence of His power in them</strong>. <strong>I am learning that this verse is irrelevant in my life if the power is not first present. The last part enables the first part to be effective in one’s life</strong>. <strong>Acts 1:8</strong> tells us what drives the power, <strong>“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses…,\"</strong> The disciples could not accomplish God’s work by their own strength, they needed power, not power for their own programs but power to fulfill the call of God in their lives for His glory.\r\n\r\nWhere there is power, there are opposing agents and we see it at the current situation with the Pharisees and the doctors of law when they appeared. Pharisees in this case are the discouraging agents and the doctors of the law represent facts closing every avenue of victories because they represent impossibilities. You and I have to learn that despite the Pharisees and the doctors of the law present, the power of the Lord is present to heal (not just physical). The power of the Lord was present before they arrived and their arrival did not change or minimize it, if anything, I say their presence intensified it. It was mighty to heal them; it was exerted and put forth to heal them, to heal their souls, to cure them of their spiritual diseases, and to give them a new life, a new nature.\r\n\r\nWe need to pray more that God will empower us with His Holy Sprit and then according to the power that works within us, we can be healed both spiritual and physical of whatever we are facing. You may have been trying to break a habit by yourself, God’s power is present to heal you of it. You may have opposing factors, may you be reminded they have no ability to terminate the power. It’s there for you and for me. A victorious life is not out of human strength. You cannot be saved without it and you cannot concur sin without it. Let’s call on God to increase His power in us, blessings Ev.\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/power-to-save-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Power To Save, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/who-is-in-control-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Who Is In Control?

              "<strong>Luke 24:31-32, “And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, ‘Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?’</strong>”\r\n\r\nWhat makes you burn inside and really come alive? What is that sporting event that you shout for your team? I can reference all the Yankee fans here in NYC that screams when the Yankees play and beat their rivals the Boston Red Sox. <!--more-->Would you come alive if you got that raise at work, or as lawyer won that case or perhaps you were a salesperson and made a big sale? Hiking, swimming, hobbies, computers, dating someone, etc… are some various things that bring life to people. Perhaps the thing that make you burn with enthusiasm and life was not on the list, but you know what that thing is that makes your heart race. In this passage the thing that made hearts burn, and really come alive was the words that Jesus spoke.\r\n\r\nThis is the passage of Scripture occurs between the resurrection and the ascension, in the 40-day span of time that Jesus has been raised from the dead, but not yet ascended to the right hand of the Father. The women go to visit the tomb that Jesus had been placed in and they find it vacant. They run and tell the disciples and Peter’s feet couldn’t move fast enough to get to the tomb and discover the truth of the women’s news. And they made their way back to where the rest of the disciples were reminiscing along the way as to their hearts burning while Jesus talked with them by the way (on the road) and when He opened the Scriptures to them. These had a zeal for the very words of Christ. I asked what makes you come alive; now let me ask you, do the Scriptures make you come alive? Is there a burn in your heart as God speaks to you through them, as you discover something new in that passage you’ve read many times before, and if not why not? The early Christians are not really so different from us. At one time it was tax collecting for Matthew, bringing in the big catch for the fisherman, and healing that last patient for Luke, that made these men burn with life. But now, I believe that those temporal things were superseded by the life of God’s Word, as their hearts burned at one time for the temporal, now they burned for the spiritual. Jesus said, <strong><em>“</em>My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work</strong>,” Because it was Jesus’ sustenance. Where is God’s will found, but in His word. Christian, where is your burning heart for God’s Word? If reading these devotions, and Sunday morning church, or mid-week Bible study is all your time in God’s Word, then it’s obvious that you’re not reading for yourself, only being spoon fed by others. I believe it was Charles Spurgeon who said, “<em>Some of you have so much dust on your Bible that you could write the word damnation with your finger</em>.”\r\n\r\nThink about it, the hearts of the disciples burned for His Word so much that we have four gospels to tell of the things they had seen and heard as reliable eyewitnesses of Jesus.\r\n\r\nWhy is there testimony not the testimony of believers today? I too get excited about some temporal things, but it does not compare with my excitement over spiritual things. Think of Jeremiah who said <strong>“I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay</strong>.” He tried to keep from preaching God’s Word but like trying to throw gasoline on a forest fire, the flames in his heart blazed out and he had to preach what was in him, because he couldn’t put a lid on it! God was the consuming fire with Moses on Mt. Sinai, “<strong>For our God is a consuming fire and a jealous God Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: (see Duet 4:24, Hebrews 12:28-29).”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: Are you consumed? Does your heart burn like Jeremiah, like the early church? Is your Bible your daily bread that you are enthused about? If so keep it up, if not I challenge you to read at least 15 min a day, record what God is saying to you, and obey what you read.

              "<strong>1Kings 19:1-10, “2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.” 3 And when he saw that, he arose and ran for his life, … 4 … <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">And he prayed that he might die, and said, “It is enough! Now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!”</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image11.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6412 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nOne area I have noticed that cripple believers is the area of depression, of course this is something that plagues mankind. I see many on medication to suppress or treat depression. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us have felt this way at one time or another for short or longer periods of time. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer. For this reason I think it is one major cause for suicide.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn <strong>1Kings 18</strong>, we see Elijah gain huge victory over the prophets of Baal when he called fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice he set before the Lord. He demonstrated to the people that there was(is) only one true God. He witnessed the prophets of Baal call on their false god who failed to answer them and Elijah had them killed. Ahab goes home and tells his mean, nasty wife of what Elijah had done. <strong>Vs. 2 “Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time”</strong>. Hearing such news would sadden you immediately especially from a person you know is capable making it happen. Jezebel declared Elijah a dead man. Instead of Elijah being bold representing the God of heaven as he did on mount Carmel, <strong>vs. 3 </strong>says<strong>, \"... he arose and ran for his life, and went to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there”. </strong>He forgot God who had given him victory and shifted his attention on what he heard from Jezebel. As he runs for his life, he abandons his servant to be by himself and have a pity party if you ask me. Depression will do this to you, isolate you from people causing you to want to be alone to cry out \"woe is me\".\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 4”… . And he (Elijah) prayed that he might die, and said, “It is enough! Now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!”. </strong>If this could happen to a prophet of God, you may face or are already facing this thing called depression. He became suicidal, desired death, lost hope, lost strength. He forgot his mission and all he could do is sit under a broom tree and wish for death.\r\n\r\nI love how the Lord dealt with his depression, <strong>vs. 5-8, “5 Then as he lay and slept under a broom tree, suddenly an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise and eat.” 6 Then he looked, and there by his head was a cake baked on coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and lay down again. 7 And the angel of the LORD came back the second time, and touched him, and said, “Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.” 8 So he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God”. </strong>Instead of the Lord giving him his wish, the Lord knew what he needed best and that was rest, rest in Him. That rest also needed to be fueled with food and water.\r\n\r\nThis is what we need in our depressing times, rest in the Lord, His Word as our food and His Spirit like water to our soul for the journey ahead is long.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> The Lord is not done with making much of Himself thorough the vessels He has raised to show Himself strong on behalf of those that </span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">trust in Him</span><b>. Psalm 37:7-8, “7 </b><strong>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass. 8 cease from anger, and forsake wrath; Do not fret—it only causes harm”. </strong>Have you been dealing with minor depressions because of the Jezebel’s threatening everything in your life causing you to flee? Where are you fleeing to? I run to the Lord and not from the Lord. When God revived Elijah with rest, food and water, it gave him enough strength to carry him through 40 days and 40 nights.

                  "The Depressed need to proclaim healing in stead of believing the lies of having a lifelong condition with the hopelessness of a stigmatic labeling diagnosis that more often than not, are treated with longstanding damaging medication treatments. The darkness of such trickery that feeds into the pharmaceutical greed does not come from a good place, nor is it a place of health of mind, body or spirit of a person that is in a personal relationship with Jesus. It is by His stripes that we can be and are ultimately healed. It is in standing on our faith in Him and Him alone, that the ultimate physician and Father God provides to those who believe. For to know the Lord is to know of His grace, love, mercy and the power of prayer or professing and standing on His word...not the word of man, and not dependent on man. \r\n\r\nFor the Word tells us in 2 Timothy 1:7 For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.\r\n\r\n2 Corinthians 5 Describes and affirms our belief in Father Son and Holy Spirit, whereas, it is in our alone times with the Lord, or as others claim it to be in Isolation or Depressed state of being....Perhaps those prone to depression are ultra sensitive to the Lord with burdened hearts as He hath provided them with. Who are any of us to project or determine what constitutes a difference between a longing for peace and rest in the Lord separate from the worldly opinions that are at times medically unsound doctrine that further harms ones body with poisonous toxic medications?\r\n\r\nShould we not then understand that we do not fight against flesh, but principalities and the oppressor who seeks to kill and destroy? Should we not see through the deception of what is known as conditions that humans get when not relying on the Lord?  2 Cor 5:13 For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; or if we are of sound mind, it is for you.\r\n  \r\nDo we question Jesus and His state of mind after he had accepted and obeyed His Father knowing of the death he would endure for humanity? Do we suggest that Jesus was depressed? Do we state He was suicidal? Do we judge Him for the wilderness, the alone time, and the fervent prayers, tears, or afflictions of the burdens that He so carried? Certainly, that would be such an incorrect assumption. To be alone and at rest with the Lord is meant to be an isolated occurrence, not seen by man, done in secret, where our prayers and supplications are made known to God and God alone in the name of Jesus. With or without depression, we are human and we have human emotion of our flesh. It is in the Spirit that we are overcomer's capable of receiving complete wholeness through the healing blood of Christ. It is our hearts that are transformed, and our lives that give testimony to the works He has done."

              "<strong>Luke 24:44-45, “44 He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” 45 Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures” (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat troubled me for a while was listening to a very learned person misunderstand scriptures. I mean someone with more degrees than a thermometer read a scripture passage and miss the whole point of the passage. They get everything else but the scripture despite the fact they have read it over and over again. How many times have we also read verses after verses and it was plain, then one day as we were reading it again, it became alive. <strong>Anyone can read the scriptures, only God can give understanding to His Word. </strong>The devil knows the scriptures, he tempted Jesus with it, the only thing he does not understand it.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Understanding is revelation only God gives to those whom He has opened their hearts.</strong> As I have said already, we can hear the word or even read it yet without understanding, it will not make sense or be of any benefit to us. Jesus shared with His disciples of the things that were to be fulfilled. They heard what He said but it did not make sense to them. They even forgot what He said. Then after it was all fulfilled, He reminded them again of what He had told them and the bible adds another verse to show us something profound,<strong> vs. 45 \"Then He opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures”</strong>\r\n\r\nI don’t want to read for the sake of reading, I want to read with understanding and understanding is revelation from God. Do you know “<strong>salvation is revelation”?</strong> It is revelation that comes about where God takes His spoken Word and makes it alive in a person He is saving so that they understand who they are as sinners and what He has done for them in Christ and they respond in repentance and faith. In <strong>Acts 8</strong>, we are told of how God sent Phillip the evangelist to meet an Ethiopian Eunuch whose heart was open to read God’s word. <strong>Acts 8:30-31, “30 So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Do you understand what you are reading?</span>” 31 And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him”.</strong> This man was reading with no understanding until God sent Phillip,<strong>vs. 35 “Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him</strong>”. Only God could give understanding of the scripture through Phillip to this man because God opened His heart.\r\n\r\nWe have another example in <strong>Acts 16:14, “Now a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The Lord opened her heart to heed</span> the things spoken by Paul”</strong>. Paul's preaching would have no bearing on Lydia unless the Lord opened her heart as He did. If God opened our hearts to heed to the gospel, are we continuing to pray that He opens our hearts to understand what we are reading? You could be reading the bible for the sake of reading it, are you praying for understanding (revelation)? That His word becomes alive in you. The word is ever alive, my question to us all, is it alive in US? <strong>1John 5:20, “And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">understanding, that we may know Him who is true</span>; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life”, blessings Ev</strong>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/power-to-save-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Power To Save, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/he-has-magnified-his-word-by-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">He Has Magnified His Word, by Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>1Samuel 15:1-23, \"...Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nMaking a promise you can't keep isn't advisable. People generally have a tendency to make promises they have no intention of keeping, or have the ability to keep. This problem is consistent even in ministry. Often, someone will say “I will be there” for particular event, but fail to show up without ample notice. If you had project lined up for them to do, making last minute preparations and adjustments for adequate cover becomes difficult and frustrating. <strong>Ecclesiastes 5:4-5 says “4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it; For He has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you have vowed 5. Better not to vow than to vow and not pay it\" <em></em></strong>Every good thing we do must be done to the glory of the Lord; therefore, anytime we make a vow, let's remember that we are doing it unto the Lord; better not to promise than fail to keep a promise.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhat I'm sharing here is in relations to aiming at a target with a gun, but failing to fire a bullet, or actually firing a bullet, but missing the target all together. Law enforcement personnel, such as soldiers and police officers are trained to hit targets precisely or they will not be of any use to their task force. Frustration is inevitable when firing hundreds of bullets results in nothing more than missed targets. Missing a target, both in practice, and in the line of duty, can cost lives. In <b>1Samuel</b>, God appointed Saul as the first King of Israel via Samuel's anointing oil. The Lord appointed him to lead the Israelites, but in <strong>chapter 15:3</strong>, Saul disobeyed specific instructions assigned to him in the special task God had commissioned. <strong>1Samuel 15:3</strong> says,<strong> “Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them. But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.” </strong>The instructions were clear and specific: destroy everything. The Amalekites had ambushed the Israelites; therefore, God's judgment was upon them. Could the Lord's instructions to Saul have been any clearer? I don't think they needed additional interpretation. Let's read a little further to find out what Saul did. Verse 4 and 5 of the same chapter says <strong>\"4 So Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah. 5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek...\" </strong>Saul accepted the assignment, and saw his target as the Lord had explained. He even gathered soldiers and moved towards his target, an indication that he was firing his bullet. Verse 7 says <strong>\"And Saul attacked the Amalekites.” </strong>From the surface, it sounds like Saul did exactly what God had asked him to do, but verse 9 says “<strong>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were unwilling to utterly destroy them. But everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.” </strong>Saul missed the target when he failed to destroy everyone and everything. Even if you are part of God's plan, failing to do what He asks is tragic. You've heard people say “he hit the bullseye,” a metaphor that refers to hitting the center of a target. In Saul's case, he missed the bullseye, because he only destroyed the people and things he rendered worthless. We are often guilty of disobedience when the Lord asks that we rid our lives of junk, we only eliminate the things that are worthless in our sight, and keep those we still consider dear to our hearts. I call this <strong>“the bullet that fired, but missed the target.” </strong>Missing the target is contrary to God's will. You can even be in ministry but be outside God’s will (target), living in disobedience.\r\n\r\nWhen confronted with truth, lies and cover-ups are the greatest disservice we can do to ourselves. A lie can only be covered for a certain period before it is exposed. Lying to God is one of the worst things we can do: remember, He knows our thoughts and sees our actions. Whatever is done in secret will be brought to light on the day of judgment. You can cover up your secrets and lies all you want, but at some point, you will have to come clean because He can convict you through your conscience. Saul thought that he had done God's will, but he had actually disobeyed Him.

              "<strong>1Samuel 15:1-23, \"...Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIn part one of this devotion, we looked at Saul, a man who fired the gun God gave him, but missed the target because he failed to complete his given task in its entirety. He did what he thought was best, hoping that God would be pleased with him. In the second part of this devotion, let's see how Saul tried to cover up his shortcoming.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. \"13 Then Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, \"Blessed are you of the Lord! I have performed the commandments of the Lord (1 Samuel 15:13).”</strong> Saul did not fear the Lord because he thought he could fool Samuel, the prophet who initially anointed him as King of Israel. There is a similar situation in the book of Acts where a couple told Peter that they had sold everything and given their earnings to the Lord, but in reality, they only presented part of it. Like Saul, they lied to the Holy Spirit, and completely missed the target. Their case was slightly different from Saul's in that their failure to honor their vow to the Lord cost them their lives. No one asked or forced them to make the vow; they did it out of their own volition. As for Saul, his instructions were clear as day; therefore, his disobedience was inexcusable. His first lie was claiming to have accomplished all that God had commanded. Vs. <strong>\"14 But Samuel said, \"What is then is the bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear (1 Samuel 15:14).”</strong>As they usually say, “busted!” Saul had been caught in his lie. To cover his first lie, Saul went on to say that he destroyed everyone, except a few people and items he spared as sacrifice to the Lord. As Samuel confronted him even further, he insisted that he had fulfilled the Lord's commandments. Later on, we discover that he had also spared king Agag, who he should have also destroyed.<strong>1John 1:8</strong> says <b>\"\"If w</b><strong>e say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.” </strong>This scripture sums up the whole nature of man as sinful, and no matter how much we try, we can never completely fulfill the Lord's requirements. The Bible also says, <strong>“Our righteousness is as filthy rugs,” </strong>not just our sins. With this understanding, we know that in men's eyes, even the best that we offer the Lord is not good enough because we are still sinful by nature. We have to openly approach God with all our failures, weaknesses, and the things we are holding on to we should have destroyed in the first place, and confess that we have sinned.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Psalms 139:23-24,</strong> David says <strong>\"Search me, O God and know my heart, Try me and know my thoughts. And see if there is any wicked way on me. And lead me in the way of everlasting.” </strong>David understood that what he didn't consider sin could actually be sin in God's eyes. What a way to come to the Lord and say<i> “it doesn't matter whether I feel holy today, search me and be the final Judge. I give you permission to perform surgery. Check what'sinsideof me, and if there be sin, cleanse me.”</i>\r\n\r\nSaul not only stood by his disobedient actions, he justified them, which ultimately brought about his downfall. Here is how he missed his target: <strong>1Samuel 15:22 says \"So Samuel said, \"Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings, As in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice.” </strong>In Saul's case, obedience was the target. Desiring to honor the Lord with sacrifices was notable, but disobeying what he had been clearly instructed to, and then attempting a cover-up was wrong (missed target). In vs. 23, Samuel defined his sin when he said <strong>“For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. And stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.” </strong>What a way to define disobedience. The children of Israel disobeyed God countless times, and so do we. The Bible says that stubbornness is as a spirit of witchcraft. To me, this shows that disobeying God, parents, and leaders is a terrible thing. It's not about what we want and what we consider good, It is obeying what we've been asked to do, as long as it's in line with God's word. What you are asked to do may sound stupid, ridiculous, and you may even have a better way of going about it, but obedience is pivotal. If you mess up, covering your mistakes, or blaming others for them is not the way to go about things: coming to God and crying out to Him shows repentance. <strong>1John 1:9,</strong><strong> \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” </strong>\r\n\r\nAim for the target God has set before you. Fire your bullet towards the target, be faithful in everything you do, and keep your promises. Blessings Ev.\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/when-the-bullet-misses-the-target-part-1of2-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">When The Bullet Misses The Target, Part 1of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/13/falling-back-on-dead-things-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Falling Back On Dead Things, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Luke 17:11-19, “And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn January 2009, a miracle was witnessed in New York where an airbus flight 1549 carrying 155 passengers crashed into Hudson river with the plane remaining intact. All the passengers lived making it one of the greatest miracles I have witnessed reported on media.<!--more--> I believe some people on board realized something was wrong with the plane and regardless of their beliefs took an opportunity to cry out to God for mercy. This reminded me of <strong>Luke 17</strong> where Jesus was on a journey to Jerusalem. His journey required Him to pass through Samaria and Galilee and <strong>vs. </strong>says, “<strong>12</strong> <strong>Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off. 13 And they lifted up their voices and said, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”. </strong>The timing strikes me, there had to be more than ten lepers in that city, these ten happen to be present at the time Jesus was passing by, It was their day of miracle. In their present situation, they lifted up their voices and pleaded for mercy. What did Jesus do, immediately,<strong> vs. 14, “…He said to them, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed”. </strong>It was like saying<strong>, </strong>I have heard your cry, I have provided a way, go and testify to the priest what happened. The plane that landed on the Hudson River, God had already prepared away regardless of what it was. <strong>This kind of plane may have never been designed to land on water; only God could make it work. Who do we thank?</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat amazes me about the lepers story is not so much the miracle but the action right after, the bible says, <strong>Luke 17:15, “And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks”. </strong> This verse indicates that out of the ten who were immediately healed, one turned around before even reaching the priest, came back and with a LOUD VOICE GLORIFIED GOD, fell down on his face at His feet, GIVING HIM THANKS”. What a heart of gratitude. He understood nothing just happens, he knew he did not deserve the healing he received, there were more lepers who missed that opportunity. What made him better than the rest? nothing and he knew that. He came back with sacrifices of praise. It could have been worse but God! Watching people being interviewed after the crash, I was a little disappointed because few came back to praise God for the miracle yet many sought for His help. And if not all on board prayed, someone in that plane prayed that they would ALL make it. <b>Much was said of what happened; little was said about God in the matter.</b> It would have been easy to blame God if something really went wrong and lives were lost, but what about now? Maybe there are some thanking God who never made it on TV but they, like the one leper came back to give thanks. Despite the people God used to make all go well, who is the Hero in the picture? I woke up that morning thanking God for the miracle, lives He spared. Unsaved people were on board who would have passed into eternity without Christ, children were on board, it would have been worse. He proved to us again that He is God and nothing is too difficult for Him. That He is the God of 11:59, when you think it’s over, He does something breath taking. Who do we thank?\r\n\r\nJesus paints to us a picture of how we can be ungrateful sometimes, He says, “<strong>17 “… “Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? 18 Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?</strong>” The other 9 took the miracle and moved on with their lives. Could it be possible that when Jesus said to all the ten to go and show themselves, He wanted to see if they would see a need to give thanks when they got healed? Only God knows. The rest went to live their lives as though nothing happened, maybe they thought they deserved the healing, one man new better, he deserved nothing but received something. As Ravi Zacharias says, “<em>while the kids thank Santa for putting candy in their socks, who do I thank for putting two feet in mine?”.</em>\r\n\r\nI am a firm believer that nothing just happens, there is always a reason. If I was to trace back my life and family from the age I can remember, I can completely see the hand of God in every stage. Even before I became a Christian, I knew the workings of the Lord. The Lord was gracious many times to hear my cry. Not too long ago while praying on Saturday morning, I began to recall how some of my family members escaped near death experiences and sickness that could not be detected by the doctors. Two of my brothers survived hot water burns at different times when they were young, one of my brothers who survived water burn almost drowned in his teenage years in a dam and recently survived ladder fall, my dad survived a street attack and stomach ulcers, I did too escape street attack and almost drowned twice, my mom, dad and brother got healed of diseases that could not be detected, another survived a fall and just this week, my brother Andrew survived a fall that nearly took his life, but God. Who do I thank for all these miracles? How about you, if you were to sit and begin to recall more detailed account of your life and family and how you’ve made it this far, who would you thank for making it this far? Have you thanked God for yesterday’s miracles? Oh it’s so good to give thanks unto the Lord.

              "<strong>John 9:1-38, “25 He answered and said, “Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.”</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat runs through your mind when you face something that appears to be a challenge or a struggle? The first thought possible and common question, “what did I do wrong”? We equate the challenge to be a punishment for something we may have done wrong. We begin to scan our memories of what it could be. <!--more-->We see it with the disciples when they encountered with a man who was born blind. <strong>John 9:2-3, “2 And His disciples asked Him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” and 3, “Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him\".</strong> To the disciples, there had to be a cause and that cause to their thinking had to do with sin. Jesus had a different response.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see how Jesus healed this man. Naaman was told to go and wash in river Jordan 7 times, he had a problem with that. As for this man in <strong>John 9</strong>, Jesus spat on the ground, made clay and anointed his eyes. Here is what got me, imagine a blind person who desires his eyes opened, you take something thick and you apply it in his eyes and then tell him to go and wash in the pool of Siloam? How can a blind man lead his way to the pool? Why is Jesus making it even tougher for him? Here is what I believe, in as much as this man needed the physical healing, Jesus wanted to demonstrate that He needed spiritual eyes to see things the natural eyes could never see. I believe the Spirit of God directed this man to the right pool. The Spirit was like that cane the blind use to find their way. It also shows that though Jesus gave him spiritual eyes, He cared about him to give also physical. <b>He dealt with the spiritual then physical.</b>\r\n\r\nThis man who we are not even given his name humbles himself, builds faith and moves as commanded. So he goes to the pool and washes, scales falls off his eyes and he comes back seeing. Here is another thing that got me, the bible says he was born blind, it is not recorded if he had ever been to that pool and even if he did, he would not know which way. But Jesus performed a miracle because we see him come back with his eyes opened and knows where to go. Does this show us that the same Spirit that led him to the pool blind is the same Spirit that led him back seeing? This shows that when we are touched and healed, it is not the end but the beginning. He came back rejoicing and became a voice and a testimony to many.\r\n\r\nThe testimony was so huge that they kept asking him how his eyes were opened and he kept on testifying how Jesus opened his eyes. The Pharisees kept on asking him many questions hoping that he would change his story but he would not.\r\n\r\nWith so much pressure on him, and Jesus having been called all sought of things, he stood firm and proclaimed his healing testimony, <strong>John 9:25, “He answered and said, “Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.</strong>” No one can take away what God has done in your life. The enemy might whisper in your ear that you are not healed and even try and convince you that Jesus did not do it, that it happened by chance or the doctors did it.<strong> Do you see that he did not even say the pool healed him? </strong>he knew Jesus did it, going to the pool was a demonstration of faith and obedience. I love his final strong testimony before they kicked him out of the temple,<strong> vs. 30-33, “30 The man answered and said to them, “Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes! 31Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him. 32, Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. 33 If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.\"</strong> He healed me, period, he delivered me!!! Nothing can talk me out of what He did and nothing can talk you out of what He did if you stand firm in your testimony. Let the enemy whisper all he wants, He can’t take what you don’t give him.

              "<strong>Genesis 22:1-19, “9 Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood”.</strong>\r\n\r\nWith the help of God through His Word, I would like to paint a picture of what I believe a young man’s honor to his father should be by looking at an episode where Isaac is led of his father to be sacrificed. The Bible does not give Isaac’s specific age when God asked Abraham to sacrifice him, but there are events surrounding Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac which gives us clues. Most scholars believe that Isaac was in his late teen’s or early twenties at the time of the offering.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTo show that Isaac may have not been a young child, we see him old enough to travel three days with Abraham without his mother. His conversation with Abraham is that of an older child or a young adult. Finally, Isaac is the one who carried the wood for the sacrifice up the mountain (<strong>Genesis 22:6</strong>). The latter is strong evidence that Isaac was no longer a small child and serves as the main reason that our best guess is that he was at least in his late teens or early 20′s.\r\n\r\nIf Isaac was in his late teens or early 20′s while his father was over 100 years old, we can conclude that Isaac was willing to obey his father even to the point of death. Mathew Henry paints a picture, “<em>Isaac, for aught that appears, is as willing as Abraham; we do not find that he raised any objection against it, that he petitioned for his life, that he attempted to make his escape, much less that he struggled with his aged father, or made any resistance: Abraham does it, God will have it done, and Isaac has learnt to submit to both, Abraham no doubt comforting him with the same hopes with which he himself by faith was comforted. Yet it is necessary that a sacrifice be bound. The great sacrifice, which in the fullness of time was to be offered up, must be bound, and therefore so must Isaac. But with what heart could tender Abraham tie those guiltless hands, which perhaps had often been lifted up to ask his blessing, and stretched out to embrace him, and were now the more straitly bound with the cords of love and duty! However, it must be done”</em>\r\n\r\nI can only imagine father and son sticking side by side encouraging each other. Abraham had already lost his first son Ishmael who was sent away with his mother, the Lord was fine with it. Here comes Isaac, the only promised son God required Abraham to, the son who he loved. At a young age where he could have driven his father to an early grave with his life, one episode tells it all, a willing son honoring his father. This is how best I could imagine Isaac speaking to his father, “I know that you honor God first more than anything else and I know that you love me regardless of what is asked of you, I am ready to glorify God by obeying as you fulfill the call of God through me, this is my HONOR TO YOU”.\r\n\r\nI believe Isaac was more of an encouragement to his father the most when he needed that encouragement, he looked like the victim but he wasn’t. Only God could give and could take way. The servants who came with them could have discouraged him from sacrificing his son but here is a young man who carries what is required for sacrifice only to discover he is the sacrifice and still be willing to go through it. This is a son a father is proud of, a son that God blesses. <strong>If there is a young man or young woman who claims to fear God and does not honor their father and mother, it’s nothing to God</strong>. The honor may not necessarily mean that they deserve it, parents fail like anyone else, the whole reason for honor is a means of glorifying God. God has placed parents in strategic places for a reason. Honor of Isaac has taught me a lot.

              "<strong>Hebrews 10:9, \"then He said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God.” He takes away the first that He may establish the second\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIt amazes me  how God does not do things according to the way we think. He always takes a different turn and just when you think you have figured Him out, He does something that blows your mind and you are back seeking to know more. Over and over again I see God raising the unexpected, the one that the blessing was not secured for by man's standards, is the one He raises. <!--more-->When You look at Cain and Abel, the blessing rests on Abel, looking at Esau and Jacob, the blessing rests on Jacob, the prodigal son and his older brother, the blessing rests on the unexpected. Abel, Jacob, and the prodigal son have one thing in common, they are second born and no one ever expected them to be blessed. Why is this important? simple, God is in the business of raising the second (the unexpected).\r\n\r\nThe first tends to be stubborn and unwilling to humble himself or bend therefore God always bypasses the first to establish the second. God bypassed Adam the first man created to send Jesus His Only begotten Son, the last Adam. What Adam messed up, Jesus came to fix it. Jesus came to undo what Adam did.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hebrews 10:9</strong>, the theme verse of my life starts by saying, <strong>\"He said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will\", </strong>Jesus came to do the will of the Father, the mark of obedience in the second. For God to build the second, the layer of the first has to come off that the tender heart of the second may be established. While the first may desire to do things his own way, the second is seeking ways to do the will of the Father. In the world we were like the first stubborn born and God had to bypass all that to bring out the inner child inside of us that receives Him by faith, that is our second birth. <strong>Mark 10:15, \"Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.” </strong>It's not the sophisticated, all knowing and good looking He raises, He raises the weak, the one who feels he is unable but yet available.\r\n\r\nThe word \"establish\" means to bring about, to place or settle. What's God word saying to us \"<strong>He takes away the first that He may establish the second\"</strong>. Are you glad that He has called you in spite of your weaknesses, failures, insecurities to establish you simply because you were willing to do His will? He bypassed everything you knew about yourself to build the inner child kind of faith He has placed there. What you placed second in your life is what He has come to establish. What you never thought He could use is what He is establishing. Our prayer today, Lord establish in our lives what we placed second, insignificant and unexpected. Bypass our pride, arrogance, stubborn and establish our faith, hope, confidence and humility to concur the first. As you establish us, establish all that you have brought in our lives. Establish our finances, marriages, children, jobs, ministries etc. as we yield to Your will. Bypassing the first to establish the second is a very humbling experience.

              "<strong>Ephesians 6:10-20, \"Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>To fight effectively in your spiritual battle, you must know Christ, obey His standards by submission, and be prepared to fight</strong>. Anyone in Christ is a target as Jesus was in the wilderness by Satan.\r\n\r\nPaul in his conclusion in writing to the Ephesians, begins in <strong>6:10</strong> by saying,<strong> \"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might\"</strong>. I find it very important to pay attention to the last words, they sum up everything that has already been said.<!--more-->He shares with them on how to be strong, <strong>“In the power of His might”, </strong>derived from I believe <strong>Zechariah 4:6, \"... Not by might, not by power but by My Spirit, says the Lord of hosts</strong>\". It's clear that by “His might” would mean by “His Spirit” because God empowers us through Him.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 11, \"Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil</strong>\". It will be beneficial to define armor to understand why we need to put it on.<strong> Armor is a defensive, as of metal, wood, or leather, worn to protect the body against weapons</strong>. So we can say that we have weapons formed against us always flying to destroy us, we need protection. To know that we are at war, let <strong>vs. 12</strong> bring it to light, \"<strong>For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places\".</strong> I don't want to concentrate so much on what we fight against, I want to dwell on how to get ready for it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs 14, \"Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth</strong>\", What really holds us together is the truth, the truth becomes the belt that holds what we know dearly. The truth tightens and chocks out every lie. \"<strong>Having put on the breast plate of righteousness</strong>\", this is like putting on the bullet proof vest to protect the most sensitive parts of the body. The bible says in <strong>Proverbs 4:23, \"Keep thy heart will diligence, for out of it are the issues of life</strong>\". That is where life begins for a Christian and that is a place that must be girded well, it defines who we are in Christ. <strong>vs. 15. \"Having shod your feet with the preparation of gospel of peace</strong>\", a soldier is someone who is ready to march into the battle field. His aim is to defeat the enemy, win and rescue those held captive in sin.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 16. \"Above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked one</strong>\". If you are going to win, you must have a shield, something to strengthen what you already have. The neat thing about the shield, it can be used to protect every part of the body not like the other gadgets that are used to protect a particular area. Faith defends the truth, the heart, the feet, etc. <strong>Hebrews 11:6, \"without faith, it is impossible to please Him...\" </strong>This means we can have everything but without the shield, we will not please Him the reason the bible says \"<strong>ABOVE ALL TAKE THE SHIELD OF FAITH</strong>\".\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 17. \"And take the helmet of salvation</strong>\", people who go riding horses, bikes, motorcycles are required to wear helmets. It has been proven that it can save lives and it has many times. When we have the helmet of salvation, we too are safe when we sometimes fall, yes we might have bruises and pains but we still know that we haven't lost our salvation. \"<strong>and the word of the Spirit, which is the word of God</strong>\". This is the only offensive weapon, the rest are defensive weapons. <strong>Hebrews 4:12, \" For the word of the Lord is living and powerful, sharper than any double edged sword, piercing even division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrows, and is a discerner of thoughts and the intents of the heart.\" </strong>The word does all the fighting with an aim to win. Different gadgets talked about here we need them, that is why Paul tells us to put on the WHOLE OF THE ARMOR.\r\n\r\nI sum up the entire process of dressing for the battle with <strong>Romans 13:14, \"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill it's lust thereof</strong>\".<strong> Putting on the Lord Jesus means putting on the Whole Armor of God</strong>. He is everything from the truth, <strong>John 14:6,</strong> He is righteous <strong>Romans 10:3,</strong> He is the reason for the gospel <strong>Isaiah 52:7</strong>, He is the shield of faith, <strong>Psalm 3:3</strong>, He is our salvation, <strong>Romans 10:13</strong>, He is the sword of the Spirit, <strong>John 1:1</strong>. <strong>You put on the Lord Jesus, you have all it takes to stand against the wiles of the devil</strong>. Put Him on.

              "<strong>Matthew 17:5-8, “5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. 6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. 7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. 8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn 1999 I had the privilege of going to visit the Holy Land. As we traveled around the places that Jesus had once stepped, I noticed that wherever Jesus did something significant, a church was built to commemorate the act.<!--more--> The famous Church of the Holy Sepulcher had four denominations claiming the church. This was separated by tiles, which the Greeks, Catholics, Ethiopian Orthodox, all lay claim to. There was so much building of religious structures, yet so many that obviously didn’t have Jesus.\r\n\r\nMany religious groups seem to claim allegiance to God through religious buildings, tradition, and religious acts. Has the story of the Transfiguration been somewhat of a mystery to you? Jesus was transfigured Jesus’ three closest disciples, Peter, James and John, and they were privy to see Moses and Elijah standing with Jesus. Peter had an idea to build three tabernacles, one for Moses, one for Elijah, and of course one for Jesus. Was this a bad idea? It was certainly typical, like many of the acclaimed religious building in Israel. God seemed to interrupt Peter as the voice spoke from the cloud saying, “<strong>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</strong>.” God’s emphasized His Son, and didn’t even mention His two faithful servants Moses and Elijah. The men fell on their faces and were sore afraid. Moses represented the Law, and Elijah represented the Prophets, Jesus of course was the fulfillment of the Law, and the One to which the Prophets spoke of. Truly with all our traditions in church, and all our attempts to be holy by trying to keep the Law, and all our prophesying (preaching), Jesus must shine. Jesus said, “<strong>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill”</strong>, <b>Matthew 5:17.</b> What is it that fulfills the Law and the Prophets? Think back to the teacher of the Law (a Pharisee) who was testing Jesus after they had heard he silenced the Sadducees with His words. The question was asked, “what is the great commandment in the Law”. Jesus answered, “ <strong>You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets”</strong>. Is this not the picture at the transfiguration. Everything the Law was saying and everything the Prophets spoke hangs upon Jesus Christ. The law of love, the prophetic word of love is what is often not seen. If we are to honor Christ, we must love God and love people, and stop making our emphasis on building tabernacles for Moses and Elijah. We don’t need a more elaborate Bible, we need to spend time hearing from God with Word of God. We don’t need a bigger building, a television ministry, a big revival meeting. We simply need to obey God to love Him and love people. We need to spend and be spent doing this, as this is what God Himself deemed to be paramount, and so much so it is a command. It is the Great Commandment, not the great idea, not the great suggestion, and not the great option. So Christian, do you spend your time loving God and loving people. If not, then you side with Peter and are perhaps well meaning in building tabernacles to Moses and Elijah, but not touching the very heartbeat of God. We need to get on our heart what is on the heart of the Father. In the end God, His Word, and the souls or spirits of people will be all that remains. If Moses and Elijah had their hand upon Jesus, and you have Jesus in your life, then where is the shinning of that love emanating from your life? Make it a point to keep the main thing, the main thing. Do it today!

                  "Even the so many times God had to declare that this Nazarene man was His beloved son, today we still find many people who do not accept that, and either ignore the Jew Jesus Christ totally, are they do the opposite and make a god out of him. They even go so far that they want to make the Messiah, who died into the God of heaven and earth (who is an eternal spirit which has no beginning and no end and so can not die.)\r\nInstead of loving their neighbours, many in the Christian community attack the others and they do prefer to worship in front of pictures and statues of that Nazarene man, which is contrary to one of the first commandments of God not to make pictures of the Only One God nor to pray in front of any picture or statue and to worship such things.\r\nThe love is gone out to the dogmatic teachings of a Trinity, but the essence of the salvation brought by a human person has totally gone lost."

              "<strong>Hebrews 6:9-19, “15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise”</strong>\r\n\r\nI have learnt that patience is not taught in a classroom, it is taught and mastered in the sea of life. A dangerous prayer one can pray, “God teach me patience”, it is a prayer for those who know the end result but do not know the process yet willing to stick it out. What happens when you are dealing with something that requires patience? for me many times I try to find alternatives. If driving on the road and there is traffic, I find it easy to try another road. <!--more-->The problem I found when avoiding what I should have dealt with is that I got lost. Some things looked familiar as I made that choice only to find I was going further and further away from my destination. In the long run “I wish I knew” runs through my head. When God is teaching us patience, it always comes as an open book test. To make it interesting, if you fail the test, you can take it over and over again. What does this tell us, God is also very patient with His children. Can you imagine a teacher giving an open book test, all the answers are there but the student keeps failing that test? After a while his or her patience will run out, but not with God. He was patient with the Israelites who complained and murmured. He was patient with Gideon who kept on asking for a sign. He was patient with David who was weak when it came to women. He was very patient with Peter who kept on messing things up. He who invented patience knows how to be patient. Point to make, faith goes with patience.\r\n\r\nThe writer of Hebrews recalls how Abraham had hope and patience to inherit the promise God made. He is encouraging us to do what some people like Abraham did before the promise was fulfilled, <strong>Hebrews 6:11&amp;12, “And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end, that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises</strong>”. Some of these people are the open books who have to teach us how to endure through faith till the promise comes. Their promises are the result of their faith and patience and we look at it and say if they did it, we too can do it by God’s grace. Everyone has a dream, promises, desires, some of them have come to pass but there are some that have not. In the valley of decision calls for action, <i>“should I stay on this road I already know of, and wait patiently to receive the promise or should I take a back road hoping to lead me there?</i>\" Abraham took the road God had set for him. There were a lot of traffic and he may have many times thought of taking the back roads as the traffic was not moving but faith kept him on that road. <strong>Hebrews 10:35&amp;36, “Cast not therefore your confidence with has great recompense of reward. For you are in need of patience that after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise</strong>”. The key to fulfilling the promise is sticking with the will of God in a situation till the end. Your confidence and my mine are in Christ our great reward because when we have confidence in someone that they can and will do it, regardless of when they do it, we will still patiently wait for them to do it. Patience is a must to every wise man. I don’t want it but I need it, it teaches me to be in the will of God gearing me to the promise. In the end when you look back you begin to see why patience was a must in your journey to the promise.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of decision though hard, I will stick to the road I started on based on His will. I will be tempted to take the back roads, however I will learn to stay on the main road. He is patient therefore He will help me be patient. If I fail, I can take the test again, I will utilize the open book in the valley of decision. After we have done the will of God… Blessings Evans\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/put-on-the-whole-armor-of-god-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Put On The Whole Armor Of God, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/lord-establish-the-unexpected-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Lord Establish The Unexpected, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/works-for-his-purpose-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Works For His Purpose, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Song of Solomon 7:1–9, \"How beautiful your sandaled feet, O prince’s daughter! Your graceful legs are like jewels, the work of a craftsman’s hands. Your navel is a rounded goblet that never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by lilies. <img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6020\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/law-and-grace.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Law-and-grace\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" />Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus <!--more-->. Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel. Your hair is like royal tapestry; the king is held captive by its tresses. How beautiful you are and how pleasing, O love, with your delights! Your stature is like that of the palm, and your breasts like clusters of fruit. I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like the clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples, and your mouth like the best wine.” </strong>\r\n\r\nSongs of Solomon or Song of Songs is perhaps one of the most controversial books in Scripture because of its erotic language use. One camp feels that the book describes ones relationship with the Lord, while the other sees Solomon is sharing his passionate feelings toward his wife, his lover. My personal perspective is that of the later one that this describes passionate, romantic, and erotic love shared between husband and wife.\r\n\r\n1. Start at the Bottom. Solomon praised his wife starting with her sandaled feet, and then moved to her legs. Wives enjoy when their husbands notice the little things about them even their feet and legs. Husbands remember that God brought those feet and legs at one time to you, and you are to keep those feet and legs with you in ONENESS with you. Praise your wife (not in an idolatrous way) for these features.\r\n\r\n2. Continue in the Middle. Solomon praised his wife’s navel, waist and breasts. Many men are drawn away by the mid features of other women, but God desires that our wives be the only source of satisfaction. Solomon writes is <strong>Proverbs 5:19–20, “A loving doe, a graceful deer- may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love. Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another man’s wife? Why not compliment your wife for her mid features today\"</strong>\r\n\r\n3. Don’t forget the top. Solomon praised his lover for her neck, hair, eyes, mouth, nose and breath. When you look at your wife what do you see. Are you captivated by her beauty? Are you drawn away by her unique features above her shoulders? Most men are drawn only to those features that are from the waist to the shoulders. Even Solomon mentioned his wife’s breasts three times. It seems like he had a thing going on! However, he shared his intimate words with his wife.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful you are and how pleasing, O love, with your delights. “…your breasts like clusters of fruit. I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit. He described his wife to her from the bottom to top. He was drawn away, captivated, enamored by her beauty that was for his pleasure and to her delight. What wife would not like to be complimented by her husband? Husbands let’s make sure that we are the ones complimenting our wives, because we don’t want someone else to do it for us. Our wives need to have our voices in their ears praising their beauty and, not another voice. Have you complimented your wife lately? Enjoy your wife and let her enjoy you as well. And perhaps both you and your wife have features that have aged a little. Remember DON’T TRY and pick another rose just because your petals don’t look like they used to. Your wife is the rose that God picked for you, so water, shine, and nurture her with your words. Do you date your wife? Why not take her out date, like when you first met. Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Isaiah 6:5, “So I said: “ Woe is me, for I am undone! …”</strong>\r\n\r\nGrowth is a challenge Christians face on a day to day basis. Not only in the life of a Christian but even in business, in the home, in church. No one wants to run a business that is not growing and healthy. A parent would get worried if their child was not showing signs of growth physically, mentally and the like. No one wants to be associated with something that is a stagnant, yet in the realm of our Christian walk, it’s easy at times to be stagnant and lukewarm. Some are stagnant by choice and others don’t allow things and people to challenge their walk that would cause them to grow<strong>. I believe growth takes place in an environment where there is a challenge.<!--more--> </strong>\r\n\r\nIsaiah had an experience that challenged his walk with the Lord and he had to reevaluate his stand. His experience with the Lord knocked him out of the normal, where he felt safe, where there was more to his life than being just a man who feared God. In the year king Uzziah died, Isaiah saw the Lord sitting on the throne (I believe by vision) and everything he thought he knew about God and what he would have thought as a sign of his arrival at the top was challenged by the holiness of God. This brought him back to ground zero, incomplete. I remember days I would bring my paperwork to the teacher because I thought it was complete and then the teacher would write on top of the paper, “incomplete”. How often do we stay normal, everything is normal, our Christian walk is normal. We don’t want the Lord to disrupt our lives because if He did we may hear “incomplete”. What is incomplete requires challenge, change and hard work and who wants change when everything seems ok. <strong>Why fix what is not broken?</strong> As long as you are a Christian, you are saved, you are going to heaven, you read the bible occasionally, you go to church, you are involved in some ministry, what more would the Lord require of you?\r\n\r\nThe bible says, in<strong> 2Corinthians 13:5</strong>, “<strong>Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you are disqualified”. </strong>Evaluate your Christian life and see if you are truly growing in your walk or if you are stagnant. The same verse says <strong>“Test yourselves</strong>”, in school, teachers test students to see if what they are learning is sinking in. Without the testing, how will you know whether you are growing or not. <strong>You must have a measuring bar that serves as the striving factor for your life</strong>. We are to be imitators of Christ. Now Christ was (is) Holy, we have not prayed, served like He did, and even reached people the way Christ did. Until we look at Him as our measuring, bar we will be stagnant in our growth in Christ. Isaiah’s experience showed him that he was not even close, he therefore cried, <strong>Isaiah 6:5, “Woe <em>is</em> me, for I am undone! …”. This is an interrupted life for a bigger purpose. </strong>In my early Christian life, the fact that I was saved and going to heaven was enough until God interrupted my life and I saw myself undone. The experience developed a thirst to be more like Jesus which served as a challenge to strive to be like Him. I wanted to pray more, reach the lost, grow more in holiness and the list goes on. God brought people my way who challenged my walk as they served as a reminder that there is more to Christ than just being saved and going to heaven. This still challenges my walk with Him as I examine myself daily to see if I am growing or stagnant. I have also challenged many to do the same as <strong>Acts 14:22</strong> encourages the same, “<strong>strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, “We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.”</strong>\r\n\r\nToday you may be the old Isaiah’s normal Godly life or you can examine yourself to see if you are stagnant in your walk and pray to God to give you an Isaiah’s experience that will entirely challenge and change your walk with the Lord. The race for growth and change is still on, make sure you are running the race with patience looking unto Jesus the Author and the finisher of our faith, He is the measuring standard.

              "<strong>Exodus 4:1-5, \"...So the Lord said to him, \"What is that in your hand?\" He said, \"A rod\"\"</strong>\r\n\r\nGod can use you because He has placed something in you to work with. You may not know what it is but it’s there. We all have different gifts and talents given by God. There is something about being together in unity that paves away for gifts and talents to be realized. God allows us to have different measures of gifts when shared, our growth increases. The bible says that we collectively are like a human body that has hands, legs, head etc. They are all working together and not able to function fully without the help of the other. The legs cannot tell the hands “I don't need you” neither can the mouth tell the eyes that it does not need it. They all have different functions but they all work together. <strong>Psalm 133:1, \"Behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.\"<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nGod calls Moses for a task to deliver the children of Israel out of bondage. He is scared to death and we know why, he had killed an Egyptian and ran away. He was safe and peaceful where he now was. In his prior life, Moses was a prince in the land of Egypt at one time and then later refused to be one when he discovered he was not an Egyptian. A once upon a time prince becomes a killer then a fugitive and here comes God sending him back to where he killed. I believe that at one point in life, God will send some people back to places they came from, not to be part of it again but to be a deliverer to them that perish. When God does send you back to deliver them, you will not go in your own strength or power but His.\r\n\r\nIt's not easy to go back to where you have come from when everyone there already knows your history especially if you messed up big time. You are not sure if they will listen to what you have to say or not, but when God sends you. How often do we talk to God about what we think is going to happen, how we will fail and yet He is telling us to just believe. God goes as far as demonstrating what he will do and the question He has for Moses,<strong> \"What is that in your hand?\" Moses’s response, \"A rod\".</strong> God is the <strong>source</strong> and He has chosen to use the things that we have as the <b>means</b> to get the job done (a rod). When there is something in your life that you do not think the Lord will use, that is exact thing He will use. Be it your voice, smile, words of encouragement, little help, giving, being there for someone who needs help, a touch, prayers. To you it maybe small and insignificant but to God it is something that He can use. Don't you ever lose the rod you have in your hand thinking it’s nothing. What you have can work wonders in someone's life. Let no one cause you to forfeit by telling you that it's not necessary, if it's working for you, you need to stick with what is working for you. In fact you ought to be the best in it. You may never know the impact you will be making as you use the rod in your hands. Moses delivered the children of Israel using the same rod which was considered the rod of a shepherd. Pharaoh had a mighty powerful army. God did not send Moses with a backing army, He sent him with a rod of a shepherd and His presence.\r\n\r\nIf you've been waiting for something bigger than what you have before being used, I have news for you, “<strong>What you have in your hand is what you need”</strong>, your faithfulness in small things will open new channels for greater things.

              "<strong>James 1:4, \"But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing\"</strong>\r\n\r\nTo walk with God, patience is a must or else you will not last long with God. <strong>As I walk with the Lord, I am learning that God is not in a hurry</strong>. If anything, He takes time to do things. Whatever He is doing is not just for today and tomorrow, He is doing it for days to come. He is building His people who will stand through time. I am amazed how some Christians want things yesterday. They get saved today, tomorrow they are dying to be on talk shows teaching everyone how to get saved. Many are anxious to be recognized and entrusted with positions and when it does not happen within their time frame, they get angry and leave. In church if their talents are not recognized, they change churches. Such people do not make it long with God. Such people want God to fit in their schedule and God is not going to. Either you are in His program or you are alone.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nGenesis dedicates roughly 12 chapters on the life of Joseph. It is a vital story that relates to the life of a believer. From the time Joseph receives a dream to the time the dream is fulfilled takes a great deal of process. <strong>We shout over the end results but forget that there is a process</strong>. When you understand that there is a process, you ready yourself for it. <strong>If you want to live a meaningful life, your goal should be large enough to serve as a challenge</strong>. <strong>Your greatest responsibility is however to do the will of God with patience in the circumstance in which He has placed you as His representative</strong>. Whatever you have to accomplish has to have a beginning. You cannot jump to the result without starting from somewhere. Someone said, \"<strong>a journey of a thousand miles begin with a step</strong>\". Joseph rejoiced over his end results, he even shared it with his family and we know how that did not go well. Almighty God in His own wisdom knew that this armature would need work to sustain that dream and develop a character to support it. <strong>I see that God's main thing in our lives is not so much to deliver us out of situations or give us what we desire, He is in the business of building characters</strong>. Character causes one to live in any kind of situations and still shine while in it. Their character will not change with time or positions, it will remain intact. <strong>Patience is an ingredient that should not miss in a believer's life</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>James 1:4, \"But let patience have its perfect work\". </strong>James (Jesus’ half-brother) tells us to \"Let patience do its thing\". We cannot dictate it, push it, work it up; It goes in its own pace. With patience expect obstacles, barriers, setbacks, walls, and delays. Let it perfect your character through each step, that is its job. Joseph had his shares of struggles, a lot of obstacles, barriers, setbacks etc. It was not even clear if the dream would ever come to pass due to turn of events, still he persevered. <strong>His responsibility was to persevere in every stage, patience was building his character and God was orchestrating His destiny. </strong>David and Job had different experiences that required a lot of patience, God built their characters. \"...<strong>that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing\". </strong>Perfecting something means taking time to work on it, at times things may not go as expected but you stick with it. This is what God is doing with His children, taking them through a process of perfection and completion leaving them lacking nothing. Joseph, David and Job took this class and we read about their later lives, they lacked nothing character wise.\r\n\r\nIf you are frustrated with God because of what He has not done, check to see if you growing in patience, see how your character is impacted by it. When God delays promises, it is not because the promise needed time to be made, it is because the person who He made the promise for was not ready for it. In short, <strong>the problem is not with God, the problem is with us</strong>. There are so many things that I have prayed to God for and now I see why they have not come, I do not have enough character to support the results yet. I am letting patience do its work, I do not want to mess the blessings God will send my way because I had no character. I am checking in with Dr. patience, I need work. I am a patient of patience, what about you?, Blessings Evans\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/an-interrupted-life-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">An Interrupted Life, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Matthew 6:3-4, “But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are like me, then perhaps you too have that little something inside of you that likes to be recognized by others for doing a good job or good deed. I enjoy blessing others, and I find myself sharing some of the ways in which I have blessed people with others. I don’t do it to brag as if to say, “Look what I did for the Lord,” but rather I see it as a way to express how God is using my life to bless other people. <!--more-->In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus speaks of being able to bless others through giving, but doing so in secret. He speaks of giving to the needy around us, specifically to fulfill a financial need. Jesus instructs His children not to be like some politicians, that announce their beneficial giving to society so that they can win votes with people, or as Christ said to receive “the glory of men”. Jesus focused on giving in secret, and that those secret blessings, would be revealed. Our Lord gives practical instructions of how to give in this unfamiliar way, the secret way:\r\n\r\n1. Don’t Keep Score. We are to give to the needs of men and women in such secrecy that we scarcely know what we have given. Jesus said “<strong>do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing</strong>.” Our giving should be prompted by the desire to obey God and with compassion to meet the needs of others. I believe men, much more then women, like to keep score on relationships. If I bless someone, does Christ want me to keep a mental score of what the one that received my blessing should do for my when I want or need something and expect them to deliver on it? Giving to get is not the heart of Christ, therefore it should not be the heart of those bearing His name. Jesus gave His very life to us, and we can never return that sacrificial expression of love to Him, but He did it for us anyway.\r\n\r\n2. Don’t Showboat. When someone is trying to purposefully impress others, they are showboating. This is precisely what Jesus is instructing us not to do, “toot one’s own horn.” If anyone had bragging rights, it was Jesus. However, can you picture Him speaking with His twelve in this manner: “I healed fifty people today, how many did you heal? 5,000 people attended my sermon and I fed them all, how many stayed for your sermon, and did you feed all of them?” By no means did Jesus pride- fully speak like this. Jesus blessed, and gave, and blessed, and gave, and then moved on to do it again. At times Jesus would bless someone and tell them to keep it a secret from everyone except the priest (<strong>Matthew 8:3-4</strong>).\r\n\r\n3. Recognize the Secret Blessings Revealed. I was blown away after preaching about <strong>Psalm 23</strong> in college to the men on my floor. Upon returning to my room, I found a book at my door called A Shepherd’s Look at the <strong>23rd Psalm</strong>, with a note reading, “Thank you for sharing with me what I needed to hear, sincerely, a fellow sheep.\" That person should have seen my excitement, and perhaps one of the guys walking by was secret blessing giver. I challenge you to unplug your scoreboard, cease the showboating, bless in secret, and watch secret blessings revealed.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Matthew 6:6, “But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIn part one of Secret Blessing Revealed, Jesus emphasized that one that gave in secret would be blessed openly. Now He shifts to speaking about secret prayer. Jesus assumes that His disciples would be men given to prayer, but He forbids the prayers of “hypocrites” which means to be an “actor,” placing a mask on one’s face in front of people but taking that mask off behind the scenes. <!--more-->In Jewish life, prayer had a prominent place that led to countless rabbinic decisions. Jesus is not forbidding public prayer, but rather he stresses the attitude in prayer, and true character is what you are in the dark when no one is looking. Jesus therefore gives us instruction of having our secret prayers from our prayer closet manifest in the blessings that God would reward us on.\r\n\r\n1. Practice your prayer life. Jesus assumes, and rightfully so, that His children would speak to Him. If Christians are followers of Christ, how can one follow if one fails to communicate with the One they are following? Although prayer is assumed here, how many Christians are consistent in prayer other then saying grace at a meal, or a quick bedtime prayer? Do you have daily time when you talk with your Savior and He speaks with you? Jesus spent hours in prayer and seconds performing miracles. His disciples saw this time and time again, but instead of asking Him, “teach us how to do miracles,” they asked Him, “Lord, teach us how to pray.” The one, prayer, affected then other, performing miracles. Hours in prayer equaled seconds performing miracles!\r\n\r\n2. Create a meeting place. In the life of Jesus, he regularly would separate himself from others, even His twelve at times, to seek a place of prayer where He could commune with His Father. Jesus would wake up early in the morning before anyone else and would find refuge in His prayer time. Jesus would find a place where he was not distracted, nor could not be disturbed in prayer. Jesus said, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head,” yet despite being without a home, he always managed to find a place to pray. Do you have a place where you meet with God? Do you go there often? Is that place a priority?\r\n\r\n3. Pray in private then in public. Again Jesus is not forbidding public prayer, but if one prays more in public, Jesus says that one seeks the praise of men over the praise of God. Go into your room (your place of private prayer), close the door (to keep free distractions), placing yourself on “lockdown” whereby you know that it is time to meet with God and no one or nothing else matters at that time. This is the most important time in your day! When you pray in private watch how God uses you then to pray in public, and how He can speak through you on behalf of others, because you are already doing that in private.\r\n\r\n4. The Father, rewards secret prayer. Remember that you are communing with your Heavenly Father, and He will make His children shine like Job, Daniel and his friends, etc…. Send your prayers up, and watch the blessings come down. Practice your prayer life, in a private meeting place with the Father who rewards your secret prayer.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Genesis 41:33, \"Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a discerning wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt”…And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in who is the Spirit of God?”…And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt”</strong>\r\n\r\nOne man was asked how he makes elephant sculptures off a tree trunk, his response, “I take the tree trunk, chop off out of it what does not look like an elephant and what I will be left with will be an elephant. Thereafter I refine that elephant to bring to a completion what I had in mind when I thought of making it”. I have read somewhere that “<strong>leaders are not born but are made”</strong>. <!--more-->One of our mission statement at church is to raise leaders. Leaders are few because we have so many followers. In as much as so many people don’t feel they are leaders or have the qualities of leadership in them, what they need is to have everything chopped off from them that does not make them look like a leader and what they will be left with is what they need to be.\r\n\r\nI believe that all of us have qualities of leadership. It may not be for a big corporation or group but a leader just over a person. What will take for that to happen is first determining who you are, where you are, where you want to go. Getting into conditions that will boost you to your destination. To bring a mental picture, look at an egg, if a chicken is expected out of that egg, then number one: it has to be put under a certain temperature which would lead to incubation and when it’s time is due, a chick will fight it’s way out of the shell. Remember that it had to be given the right conditions to develop from being an egg to being a chick. As long as it’s just a yolk, nothing will happen but when it matures into a chick, the shell is no longer it’s dwelling place. This mental picture shows we have the qualities of being leaders whether we know it or not, all that is needed is to be in a right incubator. It’s okay to be an egg but when you know that you have the ability to be more than an egg, you will not be comfortable being one. You will desire to fight your way through. Often times a word that lingers within our hearts and mind is “I CAN’T”, that’s good because you just passed the test and now you can be made one. Just because you can’t do it doesn’t mean it can’t be done. You have to believe in yourself, the people who believe in you and the Almighty God who will make it happen.\r\n\r\nJoseph was a leader developed, for a while he was in an incubator of life being developed to be a leader. When he was but a young man, he was to me like an egg, comfortable being one but when he dreamt twice, the dreams triggered and awakened something inside of him reminding him he wasn’t all the Father wanted him to be. From making the mistake of bragging about how his household will bow before him, to being sold into Egypt, to being in Potiphar’s house, to being in jail to finally rising to power, I can see every part of his leadership being developed. Joseph being developed to be a leader recognized the leadership of someone else above him and he yielded to that leadership, he was first under the leadership of Potiphar and then Pharaoh. He was a man in authority and under authority, through his struggle in life, God developed the humility in him, a quality of a leader.\r\n\r\nA servant’s heart is a required quality, this does not just come, it’s developed through a pattern of life. <strong>Mark 9:35, “And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, “If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all”. </strong>Being a leader is not about bossing people around, it is leading by example, this has to be developed. Jesus was not a bossy leader but one that led by example. Doing what many leaders of today would not do, being a servant of all. Joseph learnt servant hood through serving his brothers, Portiphar, the people in prison, the people of Egypt and his own. Wisdom was one of his leadership qualities, again we can see how foolish he was in the beginning. In due time, what was inside of him was developed to mature up. His interpretation of the dream to giving the advise on what was to be done was a God given developed quality the Egyptians needed. I wish I had time I would have talked more on Joseph’s leadership qualities.\r\n\r\nYou can see that it took time to develop his leadership skills however he was ready for it, he knew of his limitations, he did not limit God. He may have not understood the leadership class he was taking but I believe he appreciated it in life because God put him in an incubator. That egg, the thing that was delicate, that which could not move, that which could not function beyond, and that which was small had to be awakened to push it’s way out to become more than just an egg. Do you see yourself as more than an egg? it’s okay to be an egg but not bound to stay an egg forever. There are so many things in you that have not materialized yet, you need to be in an incubator. Ask God to show you what you could be as a leader and let that trigger something inside of you to desire to be one. Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>Psalm 40:1-4, “Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his Trust”, Hebrews 10:35&amp;36, “So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. 36You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised” (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nThis verse ties with the next few verses we will look at. <strong>Psalm 40:1, “I waited patiently for the Lord; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry”.</strong> The word wait has different meanings, sitting down waiting for someone or something is one meaning, the other means busy doing something for others (serving). Waiters wait on people in restaurants. I believe this is what the Psalmist is telling us that he patiently served the Lord (waiting) while petitioning his needs before Him. In his faithfulness in serving, the Lord was able to hear his cry and attend to Him. “...<strong>Cast not your confidence which has great recompense of reward” </strong>Not confidence in man or self, confidence in God who we cry out to.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nNot only did the Lord hear his cry and attend to him, in <strong>Psalm 40:2, “He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, And set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps</strong>”. While you are busy waiting (serving) the Lord, hell won’t be happy with you but keep serving. Remember Jesus' words in, <strong>John 16:33, “These things have I spoken unto you, that in me you might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world</strong>”. Tribulations are there, we are not to deal with them alone. How will you know what He can do if there is no challenge in your life He can use to display His power?. <strong>1John 4:4, “Ye are of God little children for you have over come them. For greater is He that is inside of you than he that is in the world”.</strong> Attacks will come, the good news, greater is He that is in us than he who is in the world.\r\n\r\nDon’t be surprised at times when you are in horrible pits or in a miry clay for He will pick you up and set your feet upon a rock. He is the Rock of Ages who stands for sure, <strong>Psalm 18:46, “The Lord lives; and blessed be my Rock; and let the Lord of My salvation be exalted</strong>”. He will set you on Himself, the Rock. The Lord heard his cry, attended to him, brought him up out of the pits, set his feet upon the rock and believe me, the Lord is still doing much more in his life. “...<strong>And established my steps</strong>”, the Lord establishes our steps, in other words recognizes our steps. Our steps could be into good ministries, good friends, dealing with issues, meeting deadlines, dealing with arrogant people, etc. In short, all that you have to deal with, He recognizes and establishes your step that you may walk worthy of his vocation. Walking with Him requires patience, back to Hebrews we looked at, “...<strong>For you are in need of patience</strong>”. <strong>Psalm 37:23, “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way”.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 40:3, “He has put a new song in my mouth – Praise to our God; Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord”</strong>. There is power in singing praises to God, it encourages you to overcome. It may not be very easy to pray in certain situations but you can singing a song. Singing helps you lift Him up and what did He say in <strong>John 12:32, “And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me”</strong>. You lift Him up, you will be part of the people who will be drawn. The neat thing about this verse is that He does not even ask you to look for a song, He puts one in your heart that you may praise Him. Certain songs that we sing out of our mouths, I wonder whether they praise Him? “<strong>Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord”</strong>, whenever the Lord is doing something in your life and mine, He has someone else in mind too. So everything He is doing in your life is for someone also to see the goodness of the Lord in your life and fear Him. The fear here is reverencing before God and they will say, “The God whom so and so serves is a true God” and trust Him. Sad enough, many Christians walk as though the God they serve is dead and the unbelievers have no one to set an example for them.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 40:4, “Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust”</strong>, there are so many things you will not understand about how God operates but trust Him. We are in situations right now where we don’t know what to expect but sure enough, we will wait on the Lord as we put our trust in Him to bring us through. He has heard our cry and attended to them, He has brought us up from the pits and miry clay, He has set our feet upon a rock, He has established our steps, He has put a song in our mouth, And He has set people to see what He has done in our lives. What else can I do but make Him my trust. <strong>Hebrews 10:36, “…after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise</strong>”. I am determined to do the will of God with gladness for one day if not soon, I will receive the promise.

              "“What the Church needs today is not more machinery or better, not new organizations or more and novel methods, but men whom the Holy Ghost can use—men of prayer, men mighty in prayer. The Holy Ghost does not flow through methods, but through men. He does not come on machinery, but on men. He does not anoint plans, but men—men of prayer.” —E.M. Bounds\r\n\r\nGospel ministry in America today has achieved a level of proficiency unprecedented in the history of the church. We have million dollar facilities with the latest technologies, marketing strategies that rival Madison Avenue, and unlimited number of programs to meet every conceivable need of the spiritual consumer.<!--more-->Sunday morning services are designed to dazzle by sight and sound. Colorful lights awash over stylish backdrops offer soothing ambiance as professional worship leaders inspire the crowd with musical brilliance. Anyone want some coffee, tea, juice or bagels? We’ve got plenty to make everyone feel welcome and right at home. We’ve become so proficient.\r\n\r\nAnd the preaching? It has never been so dynamic. Video clips, drama routines, and PowerPoint accentuate the modern pulpit. Preachers have become skillful orators that deliver cute, humorous, and motivational sermons in less than seventeen minutes without the slightest hint of offense or controversy. We’ve become so proficient.\r\n\r\nTo ensure oratory excellence, preachers today need not labor over—or struggle to write a good “talk.” There is an abundance of material right at our fingertips, our libraries are filled with commentaries and published homilies. Famous preachers offer sermons for sale on DVD and millions, if not billions of sermons are ready for download at the click of mouse or the swipe of an iPad.\r\n\r\nWe have become so proficient. We are strong in technology, strong in facility, strong in programs and strong in presentation. But I fear that what is our greatest strength is also our greatest weakness.\r\n\r\nR.T. Kendell wrote, “If the Holy Spirit were taken completely from the earth today, ninety percent of church work would go on as if nothing at all had happened.”\r\n\r\nMy fear is that we have become so proficient in our own ability that we no longer rely on the power of the Holy Spirit. We’ve become so proficient we can do it without Him. We no longer need Him, we no longer seek Him, we no longer pray.\r\n\r\nAny novice Bible student knows that the most important meeting of the New Testament church was the prayer meeting. Unfortunately, today, it’s also the least attended meeting.\r\n\r\nIt’s true. Today we have no problem filling the church for fellowships and social events, but where is the prayer? We have no problem gathering people for potlucks and chili cook-offs but where is the call to fast? In the words of David Wilkerson, “We love the supper room, but avoid the upper room.” And unfortunately, the church will never penetrate this godless culture and make true converts to Christ unless we fall in love again with prayer.\r\n\r\nWe may build a crowd with our motivational talks and free coffee, but will we make disciples? Will the power of the Holy Spirit be so strong upon our services, our worship, our preaching that sinners realize their need to repent, be converted and surrender to the Lordship of Christ? Will the anointing of God be so heavy that lives are transformed, addicts are set free, marriages are restored, bodies are healed and young people are called to ministry? Not without prayer. Tragically, hell will be filled with people who’ve learned from prayerless, un-anointed preachers how to be happy and achieve success. If there is one thing we need today, it’s pastors who pray, preachers who pray, men of God who mount the pulpit with a fire in their bones acquired through prayer, fasting and a hunger for God.\r\n\r\nMore than a century ago, Andrew Murray said, “The man who mobilizes the Christian church to pray will make the greatest contribution in history to world evangelization.” Likewise, Leonard Ravenhill declared, “The man who can get believers to praying would, under God, usher in the greatest revival that the world has ever known.” In the early 20th century, Dr. R. A. Torrey wrote, “The devil is perfectly willing that the Church should multiply its organizations and its deftly contrived machinery for the conquest of the world for Christ, if it will only give up praying.” Torrey further wrote, “Satan laughs as he looks at the church of today, and says: ‘You can have your Sunday schools, and your children’s programs and your Men’s Clubs, and your choirs, and your music, and your preachers, and even your revival efforts even—if you do not bring into them the power of Almighty God, sought and obtained by earnest, persistent, believing, mighty prayer.’”\r\n\r\nBut how does a church become a praying church? How do a people become a praying people? The answer is found in three simple words: A PRAYING LEADER!”\r\n\r\nThe next few blogs I will write will have one goal: to inspire leaders to pray! What good are facilities if not a house of prayer? What good is music if not soaked in prayer? What good are our eloquent homilies and colorful PowerPoint sermons if not bathed in prayer? We may reach the minds of men; but if we do not transform them from spiritual death to life through repentance, all of it is nothing more than a show of vanity to entertain the flesh.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/02/pastors-who-dont-pray.html\">http://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/02/pastors-who-dont-pray.html</a>"

              "<strong>John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</strong>\r\n\r\nI would like to share with you this morning about the word ‘believes.’ I pray you will read with an open heart, I pray a desire and hunger will be awakened within someone this morning for more of God, to go on to the fullness prepared for each of us in Christ as we walk by faith.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe word “believe” signifies a belief that is alive and vibrant, that is continually growing. In its Greek definition, to believe is to think something to be true, to be persuaded of, and to place confidence in someone, to have faith. It means to entrust one’s spiritual well being to Christ. In its usage in the text here, it represents as I said, a belief that is ongoing, that is growing day by day. It is he that goes on believing that shall not perish, for he that ceases to believe ceases to live spiritually, the same way that the man who ceases to breathe ceases to live. This is the essence of faith, it is ongoing and active, the just shall <strong>live</strong> by faith<strong> Habakkuk 2:4 </strong>says. We <strong>walk</strong> by faith Paul says( <strong>2Corinthians 5:7).</strong>\r\n\r\nTo believe is to continually entrust my life to Jesus, to surrender myself completely to Him each and every day, walking in obedience to His word, it is to give up everything for Him. In John 15 Jesus speaks to us of abiding, and that this is our responsibility. If we abide in Him, v.5 tells us that we bear much fruit, and by this the Father is glorified. If we cease to abide in Him, v.6 says we are cast out and thrown into the fire.\r\n\r\nDear friends, we must be sure of our profession. Paul tells us to test ourselves to see if we are in the faith, to be sure that we have truly believed, and that we daily continue to believe, seeking to love the Lord with all our hearts. our surrender to God must be perfect, simply meaning complete, all of our heart given to God, encompassing all of our life, all of our ambitions and dreams, all of ourselves. We will not be able to hide behind a doctrine, or our own reasoning, we must bring our lives into complete conformity to God’s word, being enabled by His grace. Have I truly believed? Am I continuing to believe? Am I closer to the Lord today than I was yesterday, last week, or last year? If not, something is wrong. Let us do the first works again, repent and turn to Jesus with all your heart. I close with the words of the Savior to the church at Smyrna in <strong>Revelation 3:11- “Behold I am coming quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.” Believe and hold fast dear friends, believe and go on believing. </strong>\r\n\r\nIn Christ’s love, Brother Benjamen\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/experiencing-god-benjamen-leahey/\" target=\"_blank\">Experiencing God, Benjamen Leahey</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/20/the-life-of-faith-living-by-faith-benjamen-leahey/\" target=\"_blank\">The Life of Faith: Living by Faith, Benjamen Leahey</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Judges 6:16, \"And the Lord said to him, “Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man.”</strong>\r\n\r\nI had a journal called <strong>Big Time Prayers for a Big time God</strong>. The title is so fitting for the character of God, yet it is not a character trait that most use to describe God, <strong>BIG</strong>. A little boy is told that the heater bars on a stove are hot and will burn his hand. He believes his parents cognitively. One day while mom is cooking, the little boy is enameled by the glowing colors of the stoves heater bars and reaches out to touch them, as something most little boys have done before. As soon as he touches the heater bars he no longer believes they are hot, HE now KNOWS they are hot. <strong>His experience brought him from the realm of cognitive belief, into experiential knowledge</strong>. With the pain of the burn, and the smell of his little burnt finger, this boy heard the echo of his parents loud and clear.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThat's what happened to Gideon in <strong>Judges 6</strong>. Gideon is called by God while he is threshing wheat in the wine press in order to save it from the Midianites. As Gideon is doing this, he receives the call of God upon his life as God calls him \"<strong>Mighty Warrior</strong>.\" What a thing to be called by God. What an ironic title for a man with such a timid record. Gideon himself even challenged the validity of such words of himself. Gideon proclaimed that he was from the weakest family, and that he himself was the weakest one of his own family. He felt least qualified for the job. But it is just like our BIG GOD, to use the weak things of this world. God assures Gideon, \"<strong>I will be with you, and you will strike down ALL the Midianites together</strong>.\" WOW, He hadn't really done anything for God yet, but God saw Gideon threshing the Midianites, the way he was threshing the wheat.\r\n\r\nGod tells Gideon to break down the altar of the false god of Baal, his father’s altar. Gideon is going to go against his earthly father, the king? Yes, he did for the purposes of his Heavenly Father, The KING of kings!\r\n\r\nGideon builds the altar and proclaims at the altar, <strong>Jehovah Shalom, \"The Lord is my Peace</strong>.\" Why, because experientially he saw the angel of God face to face and did not die, but rather peace was the fruit that resulted. <strong>Gideon had an EXPERIENCE with our BIG GOD</strong>!\r\n\r\nThen Gideon does his tests of the Lord's will with the fleeces, and then after all that God goes and cuts his army from 32,000 men, to 10,000 and then to only 300! Why, because God was going to show <strong>Himself BIG</strong>! The story goes, Gideon with 300 gained <strong>a BIG victory</strong>, because he had <strong>a BIG GOD</strong>, <strong>our GOD as His commanding officer. </strong>\r\n\r\nWhat can you point to experientially lately, that you can perhaps appreciate as an attribute of God? BIG perhaps sounds too common for our great God, but yet BIG is so fitting for Him simultaneously. Gideon was called \"<strong>Mighty Warrior</strong>,\" what is God calling you experientially lately? God used Gideon to defeat the Midianites, after Gideon's perception of himself was defeated, what is God calling you to defeat, or gain victory in that He is waiting for you to go in His power and take the land? <strong>How BIG is God to you!?!? </strong>Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/i-will-be-with-you-says-the-lord-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">I Will Be With You Says The Lord, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Judges 7:2, \"The LORD said to Gideon, \"You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her,\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you are facing a difficult battle ahead does it make sense to decrease your weapons? Gideon was the leader of Israel's army, and God would decrease the size of Gideon's army with a battle just on the horizon. The Lord's instructions probably came as a complete shock to Gideon. I can imagine the he was confused upon hearing, <strong>\"You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands</strong>.\" That doesn't sound very sensible to me; decrease your army size, because there are too many men for battle. Gideon's army was already outnumbered four to one.<!--more--> When I was trying out for sports teams growing up, if one didn't qualify for the team they were cut from the team, so that only the best players were left to produce a winning team. There were usually two cuts that took place. This is what God did when he sifted Gideon's army. God cut the first wave of people from the team by having Gideon announce, \"<strong>Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead</strong>.\" The result was that <strong>\"twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained</strong>.\" The first cut allowed the cowards to disqualify themselves and go back home to mommy. Now God would have second cuts, and reduce Gideon's army even further. A special examination or screening was set up based on the manner of water drinking among the 10,000 remaining soldiers. There the LORD told him, \"<strong>Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink.\" (7:4) Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink</strong>.\" Those that kneeled down to drink were cut, and those that apparently crouched down to scoop up water by using their hands as a dog uses its tongue remained. The LORD said to Gideon, \"<strong>With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands</strong>.\" The size of the army went from 32,000 to 10,000 to a mere 300 men to fight. Why would God do such a thing?\r\n\r\n1. God can do a lot with a little. God can bring a victory with a few as easily as he could with a large army. Israel would not be able to boast about their victory, as the Lord removed all ground for boasting. Sometimes God reduces you in order to prepare you to move forward, and increase you. John the Baptist said, \"<strong>He must Increase, I must decrease (John 3:30)</strong>.\" But this is not all.\r\n\r\n2. God decreases us to show Himself strong. God said<strong>, \"...for my power is made perfect in weakness.\"</strong> [Paul replied] <strong>Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me</strong>.\" The world needs to see God's power through your weakness. Are you shining brightly, or dimly?\r\n\r\n3. God Knows those that are willing to take risks for Him. Not everyone is willing to obey God when things seem illogical on the surface. Sifting Gideon's army for battle is not good military strategy in the natural, but in the supernatural it was just what the Master ordered, and Gideon obeyed. What would you have done?\r\n\r\nGod can do a lot with very little to show Himself strong, and He knows those that are willing to take risks for Him even when \"reason\" says otherwise. I, you, we serve a victorious God. What is He asking you to do without to accomplish His will? Are you willing to take that risk?\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/how-big-is-your-god-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">How Big is Your God?

              "<strong>Judges 7: 9 - 11, \"During that night the LORD said to Gideon, \"Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands. If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp.\" So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.”\r\n</strong>\r\nGideon's army was less than 1 percent of its original size after the shifting took place, when God cut the majority of troops from the team through the leadership of Gideon. Gideon is resting at night, and God interrupts his rest with urgent orders to respond to divinely urgent news. Gideon is commanded to get up because God was going to give him victory if he would attack immediately. <!--more-->Knowing Gideon's heart, God sees Gideon's fear, and responds to it with encouragement. Although faith is the opposite of fear at times we need to be navigated from one point to the other on the vehicle of encouragement. God told Gideon if you are too afraid to attack right now then spy on your enemies and eavesdrop on their conversation, you will be encouraged by what you hear. What could they possible hear from the enemy that would give them encouragement?\r\n\r\nIn sports competition I would love it if the opposing team would begin to fight against themselves, or when they would somehow lose heart. A divided team can't stand, and a team that has no heart because it is gripped by fear has crippled themselves before engaging in the battle. At this point both armies were fearful of one another, but God was about to rip the fear from Gideon's heart and encourage him, thus replacing fear with faith. Gideon and Purah (most likely his armor-bearer) eavesdrop on the enemies camp and, \"<strong>Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. \"I had a dream,\" he was saying. \"A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.\"</strong> His friend responded, \"<strong>This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands</strong>.\" No doubt this dream came from God to their enemies, as the fear of Gideon's sword ransacked their minds, gripping them with fear, discouragement, and defeat, before the battle was even engaged. I believe it was at this point that Gideon finally believed God. There are some great truth here for God's present day soldiers, you and me.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>God's Word is timely</strong>. We are bound by the realm of time, and God is not. God told Gideon to go now to either battle or eavesdrop and Gideon obeyed. Our enemies are defeated already, but we need to listen to God's Word to be reminded of that truth. Jesus said in <strong>John 8:31 - 32, \"If you...continue in my Lord...the truth will set you free.</strong>\" God's Word brings freedom if we apply it. Are you a hearer of God's Word and a doer of God's Word?\r\n\r\n2. <strong>God's Word is encouraging</strong>. We've all been discouraged. Gideon's army was decreased yet the battle was still on the horizon. Both armies were gripped with fear, but God cares for his people, and meets our discouragement with encouragement, fighting fear with faith. Are you discouraged today, I've been there many times, go to God's Word but you need not go alone.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>God's Word brings partnership.</strong> Gideon was commanded to go with Purah, his confidant, his close trustworthy partner. I can picture them smiling with huge grins at each other and being able to encourage one another. Now there were two people bringing encouragement back to the camp together. We need a close partner, who is yours? Do you encourage each other? Battles are here, more are coming, but God's Word is timely, encouraging, and brings partnership. God is victorious, let us act by faith upon his Word by being obedient to Him, regardless of the fear that grips our hearts. Go to God's Word and allow it to silence the fear that grips you.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Matthew 5:6, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled</strong>”\r\n\r\nThe times I step out to witness to the lost, I usually learn a thing or two about the lost. One thing I have learnt in my encounter with the unsaved is that 99% of the ones I have talked to were not searching. They were comfortable where they were (sinful life) and they hoped that God will weigh their good and bad deeds. If they are good as many tell me, God will overlook their bad and let them into heaven. If we, the soundly saved Christians wait untill they come to church to hear the gospel before they get saved, very few will and many will continue to have false assurance.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Acts 16</strong>, Paul and Silas were jailed, at midnight as they were praying, singing praises and worship to God, vs. <strong>\"26 Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were loosed. 27 And the keeper of the prison, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself. 28 But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, “Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.” 29 Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. 30 And he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” </strong>\r\n\r\nHow many of the unsaved do you ever hear cry, “<strong>what must I do to be saved?\" </strong>They are comfortable where they are. The bible says in <strong>Matthew 5:6, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled”</strong> and how many of the unsaved do you hear hunger and thirst for righteousness? By righteousness I mean the hunger to be made right. It is the righteousness of God through Christ that saves. We will enter into heaven not because we are good people but because we are bad people (wretched) who Christ has made right in His righteousness. And those who do not think they are hungry will not thirst to be filled.\r\n\r\nIf the unsaved are not hungry to be made right, what will create the kind of hunger we read of the prison keeper who said, “<strong>sirs, what must I do to be saved?\" </strong>The key is in <strong>Matthew 5:13,</strong> where Jesus said, “<strong>You are the salt of the earth; …</strong>”, but what does that mean? Salt does a lot of things and one of the things it does, IT CREATES THIRST. When we share with the lost about sin, judgment, God’s righteousness, His holiness, hell, heaven, all we are doing is sharing God’s word that creates hunger and thirst, and the more we share the more they become thirsty. The word drives away false hope leaving them hungry and thirsty for righteousness, and with an cry they say, “then what must I do to be filled (saved)” and Jesus like in <strong>John 4 </strong>who gives the water of salvation to satisfy the thirst the law demands (righteousness) and the unsaved never thirst again to be made right because the thirst has been satisfied through the righteousness of God in Christ.\r\n\r\nAs salt, we must go out on the highway and the byways and speak to the lost, give them something to make them hunger and thirst for righteousness and when they cry “<strong>what then must we do to be saved”</strong>, we then give them God’s means of salvation, Jesus Christ. I have seen that they are not coming, so I am going after them because Jesus said so.

              "<strong>Proverbs 31:10-30, “Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThese three part series is an encouragement to godly women and learning experience to godly men about godly women. I have learnt a lot watching my wife, the women in my ministry, my mom, some of the ladies I discipled back in the days. My learning enables me to treat and pray for them effectively. The intercessory prayer ministry my wife and I were involved with, 95% were ladies.<!--more--> I have respect for ladies may be one of the reasons is how my salvation came about. My special mom prayed me into the Kingdom, of course dad always prayed for me but when mom stepped it to join forces with him, the Lord saved me. I was discipled by a lady. It's not easy nowadays see men treat ladies the way they should be treated. I also don’t understand why many women get attracted to men who mistreat them.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I have come across women who referred to themselves as <strong>Proverbs 31</strong> women, this led me to read and study the chapter for myself. It says, <strong>vs. \"10 who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubbies\".</strong> Let's start by defining the word<strong> \"virtuous\", this is having or characterized by moral virtue (goodness) and righteousness</strong>. From experience, I have come to learn that when a woman is of good character, however bad the husband might be, she has a way of neutralizing the bad side of her husband, a good example is that of Abigail, Naabal’s wife. But when a woman is bad she destroys the house, for example Jezebel, Ahab’s wife. This makes me believe that depending on the character of the woman, she will either make or break her home.\r\n\r\nWith that said let’s look at our first point, <strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of kindness, Proverbs 31:20, \"She extends her hand to the poor, Yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy\", </strong>a great example is of the Shunammite woman in <strong>2Kings 4:8,</strong> which reads <strong>\"Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a great woman (virtuous), and she persuaded him to eat some food\". </strong>Note the way the bible calls her “<strong>a great woman”. </strong>She was no ordinary woman, her kindness is highlighted, going far and beyond, her hospitality made her special. Her kindness is continuously highlighted when she lovingly consulted her husband about going above and beyond what she had already done,<strong> 2Kings 4:10, \"Please, let us make a small upper room on the wall…so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there\". </strong>Because he passed by many times, she asked her husband if she could set a room and food, whenever he was around, he would need food to strengthen him and there she was doing what was right.\r\n\r\nEven in the midst of something missing in her life, a child, it did not change who she was. <strong>Galatians 6:9,” And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart</strong>”. A virtuous woman will see a need and put other people's needs ahead of hers. She does not do what is left, she does what is right. She will not do it to be seen but because it is the right thing to do. To continue, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Proverbs 31:10-30, “Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of Obedience, Proverbs 31:11&amp;12, \"The heart of her husband safely trust her; so he will have no lack again, she does him good and not evil all the days of her life.\"</strong> There is a proverb that says<strong> obedience is better than sacrifice </strong>and we see this in the life of Ruth. She left her home where she worshiped pagan gods and followed Naomi who was her mother in law before she lost her son (husband to Ruth). <!--more-->Even though Ruth knew there was nothing to keep her close to Naomi, they remained friends. One thing about Ruth is that she is a faithful follower, has a teachable spirit and never complained. <strong>Ruth 2:11&amp;12, \"And Boaz said unto her, \"it has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother in law since the death of your husband... and you have come to a people you did not know before, The Lord repay your work, and a full reward be given you by the Lord God of Israel.\",</strong> If you read the entire book of Ruth, you will see how Ruth looked up to Naomi as a mentor and was careful to follow her instructions, Naomi instructs her to do. <strong>Ruth 3:5, \"And she said to her (Naomi), \"All that you say to me, I will do\". </strong>According to the proverbs, she can be trusted and Naomi knows that Ruth will do her good and not evil all the days of her life. Her character was instrumental to Boaz in choosing a wife for himself. God rewarded her obedience\r\n\r\n<strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of faith. Proverbs 31:21, \"She is not afraid of snow for her household</strong>\". She is the type of woman who is not living in the natural but in the supernatural for she knows that her help is in the name of the Lord, <strong>Psalm 124:8, “Our help is in the name of the Lord”.</strong> To go back to the Shunammite woman, not only was kindness her strength, she was also a woman of faith. <strong>2Kings 4:26, \"Run now, I pray thee to meet her, and say unto her, is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? and she answered it is well.\" </strong>It's easy to say it is well when everything is going well however, when you read the story of this woman, it wasn't okay at the time she said it was, she had just lost a son. The son was in the field working with his father and he fell sick, the father brought the son to his mother and he died on her lap. <strong>A woman of faith knows something has to be done, she rises up to act by faith in the midst of fear and confusion for she is operating by faith. She will speak life in her situation regardless of the circumstance; she will strengthen herself and put her faith into action.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of prayer, Proverbs 31:17, \"She girdeth her loins with strength and strengthens her arms\". </strong>There is something about a praying woman; she knows how to stand before her Master. If you go to churches now you will find that majority of prayer warriors are women. Hannah was a praying woman for that which she desired came through prayers. <strong>1Samuel 1:10, \"…and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto then Lord, and wept sore.\" </strong>Here is a woman battling in the Spirit doing intensive intercession for something she believes God is able to do. Her intercession is not for selfish reasons but desiring to be blessed that many may also be blessed through her prayers. She prayed for a son (Samuel), God gave her a prophet for her prayers were diligent, earnest, powerful, and effective. <strong>Samuel 1:15, \"...but I have neither drank wine or strong drink, but have poured my soul before the Lord,\" </strong>she was not afraid of pouring her heart to the Lord holding nothing back. She lingered longer in the presence of the Lord. A virtuous woman <strong> knows that her strength lies in her prayers and therefore she girds herself with it even though her husband may not be there to support and encourage her, that was Hannah’s strength. </strong>To continue Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/proverbs-thirty-one-woman-part-1of3-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Proverbs Thirty One Woman, Part 1of3, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Proverbs 31:10-30, “Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of destiny, Proverbs 31:25, \"Strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come\". </strong>Everything she is doing is to bringing her strength and honor and it's not because she is trying to build herself a name but because her character has placed her in a position where people honor and respect her, and therefore she has a destiny that will cause her to rejoice. Mary the mother of Jesus becomes a woman of destiny for she is favored among women to carry a precious seed that will one day save the entire world.<!--more--> <strong>Luke 1:42, \"and she spake out with a loud voice, and said, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,” Luke 1:44, \"Lo and blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of these things which were told of her from the Lord.\"</strong> A woman of destiny does consecrate herself, she sets herself apart from many things that might try and abort her destiny. She even knows who to hang out with and as for Mary; she was hanging out with Elizabeth the mother of John who at that time was also pregnant. Both women knew how to encourage and build each other up. She has no time to fool around when she knows someone's life depends on her destiny.\r\n\r\nTime fails me for I would have talked about a <strong>persistent virtuous woman</strong> (the woman with the issue of blood), Leadership (Esther). <strong>Proverbs 31</strong> talks about all these characters. I have mentioned these qualities in different women, but the writer believed that a woman was capable of having all these characters. None of these things were inherited or just came about, someone had to work hard to achieve them. I love the way it starts in <strong>Proverbs 31:10, \"who can find a virtuous wife (woman), for her worth is far above rubies,\"</strong> I believe God is raising Virtuous, precious, powerful women who will be movers and shakers because of their character. \"<strong>Women who perceives that their merchandise is good, and their lamp does not go out by night,” Proverbs 31:18</strong> meaning she knows who she is and she knows that her character is good and because of that she keeps her inner beauty and the outer beauty shinning 24, 7, her character is not seasonal.<strong> Proverbs 31:29, \"Many daughters have done well, but you excel them all.\" I have heard it said, Charisma will put anyone on top, but only character will keep them there. Proverbs 31:10-30, \"Favor (charm) is deceitful, and beauty is vain (passing), but a woman that feareth the Lord, shall be praised.</strong>\" The fear of the Lord is the key to these qualities. It shows who you are abiding in.\r\n\r\nMay the Lord cultivate the spirit of the Shunammite woman (kindness and faith), the Spirit of Ruth (Obedience), Spirit of Mary (Destiny), Spirit of Hannah (praying) in the lives of our women. A woman who fears the Lord shall be praised.

              "<p><strong>1Corinthians 3:1-23, vs. \"11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ\" NIV</strong></p><p>Foundation is the defining moment if anything is expected to succeed. The process and the outcome is traced back to the foundation. How the foundation is laid will determine the basis on which things will stand. <strong>Foundation defines what we are made off.</strong> Parents try to lay a foundation for their children; husbands and wives try to establish a foundation for their marriage; and are churches, corporations, schools etc. If the foundation is wrong, anything built on it may be crooked, may not survive for long and is very dangerous. This is the whole reason builders take time to lay strong proper foundation. From looking at how foundations are laid especially in buildings, it has to go down first before it comes up.<!--more--></p><p>Paul addressed Christians at Corinth not as spirited men, those who he believed to have matured. He found that the people who should have been growing were not because they were trying to define again the foundation already laid. Instead of building on what was already laid, they were still dealing with petty issues such as jealousies, quarrelling and divisions. Fighting over who to follow Paul or Apollos. I see this same problem even today where people are disputing on whose teaching to go by, who to follow, causing the same problems Paul found at Corinth. If you don't know and understand the foundation, then like the Corinthians you will try to establish a foundation laid by men. The problem is, men fail everyday and twice on Sunday. What happens when your favorite preacher stumbles and falls, would you fall too if your foundation is laid on him? What will your destiny be based on? What about your mentor, your spiritual leader?</p><p><strong>1Corinthians 3:5, “What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task (NIV). </strong>It is interesting to note the \"WHAT\" used in this verse rather than \"WHO\". \"WHAT\" addressed their laboring service as opposed to \"WHO\" that addressed their personalities. Those who followed Paul might have chosen him because of his personality and style of doing things and so were those who followed Apollos. He reminds them that he and Apollos were channels through which they believed. Their teaching was not for people to believe in them but the message they brought to them as assigned by God. Here is how he ties himself to Apollos, vs. <strong>6-7, “6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. 7,So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow\". </strong>Paul and Apollos were both laborers, the controlling factor in what they were doing was LABORING and not SUCCESS. Now I can understand why Apollos’ ministry was not a threat to Paul's, they both understood they were co laborers.</p><p>Yes they were different in their ministries but they were building on a foundation already laid. Today we see competition and insecurities among preachers, pastors, leaders driven by who is more successful. And majority want to find out how they succeeded and duplicate that pattern in their ministries hoping it works. This would affect the business, size of congregation, size of budget, facilities. How easily believers get sucked in all these and follow men's teaching and principles rather than God's. The key factor in this chapter is God who <strong>MADE IT GROW</strong>. The planting by Paul and the watering by Apollos was nothing if God did not make it grow. This establishes this fact, \"<strong>The creation and fostering of faith is God's work alone\". </strong>If a spiritual leader's message and style is your foundation then you are trading on a very dangerous foundation. <strong>Christ is the solid rock on which we stand, all other grounds are sinking sand</strong>. They can reveal the foundation already laid, the question is, whose foundation?.

              "<p><strong>1Corinthians 3:1-23, vs. \"11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ\" NIV</strong></p><p>We defined foundation and looked at how possible it is to look at men’s foundation rather than God’s foundation. At Corinth, Paul had laid a good foundation \"<strong>Jesus Christ and Him crucified</strong>\", instead of them building on THIS foundation, they started trying to redefine it which moved them from the spiritual growth to become carnal minded. Thank God that Paul came back to correct their understanding and thank God He is correcting the understanding of those who missed it.<!--more--></p><p>Paul laid a foundation, but he was not the foundation. Paul and Apollos were nothing, God was ALL. Without God, their labor was in vain. He says, <strong> vs. 11, “For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ\". </strong>God has already laid His foundation on His Word, the bible. No one can go around and lay another foundation. Many Religions have tried over and over again to lay another foundation instead of building on THIS one laid. I refuse to be called a religious person simply because being born of God is not about religion but RELATIONSHIP. Many religion teach that you have to find your way to God by doing the so called “good works”. Christianity based on the word of God teaches that it's only by grace through faith are we saved (<strong>Ephesians 2:8&amp;9).</strong> Grace lays the foundation we could never lay and there can be no other foundation again thereafter. Jesus said in <strong>John 14:6, \"I am THE way and THE truth and THE life. No one comes to the Father except through me\". </strong>\"THE\" tells us that it's only by Him.</p><p><strong>1Corinthians 3:10, \"By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert (master) builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds.\" </strong>The main work of a master builder is <strong>contribute knowledge rather than labor</strong>. If Paul had laid a foundation <strong>\"Jesus Christ and Him crucified</strong>\", he is now giving the knowledge that they will need for building themselves while others rallied around them to help. He also warned them to be careful of how they build on this foundation. How we each build matters, Paul writes, <strong>vs. 12-15</strong>, “<strong>12 If any man builds on THIS foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, 13 his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work. 14 If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. 15 If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames”</strong>. These verses challenge me because I understand that to build on THIS foundation, it's not about happiness as many teach, it's about something bigger than that, <strong>Romans 14:17-18</strong> tells <strong>\"17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.\"</strong></p><p>You can see that happiness is not a material towards building an everlasting building; <strong>righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit are THE KEY materials</strong>. Happiness comes and goes. The rest of good things are benefits for serving. So let us build on THIS foundation with the KEYS that will survive the fire rather than benefits that will not. The KEY materials are the pillars that hold the building. So who is our sure foundation \"<strong>Jesus Christ and Him Crucified</strong>\", therefore let's be careful that we do not blindly exalt one who lays a foundation. Let us also be careful that the master builder gives us the right knowledge for building. Let us careful about how we build.

              "<strong>2Chronicles 20:1-25, \"vs. 12...For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.” </strong>\r\n\r\nHave you ever had some of those days you feel you do not have enough to accomplish a task? Looking at what you need to do, then sizing it with what you have leads you to believe that unless a miracle happens, there is no way you can have it done. <strong>2Chronicles</strong> tells us of king Jehoshaphat who did that which was right before God. He followed the footsteps of David. As king, he had his own battling troops no doubt, yet in one occasion he was faced with a fierce battle. Instead of one army’s threat, he had several to face. He was to fight the Moabites, Ammonites among others. He looked at what he had, what he was to face and what he needed and saw how short he was in succeeding unless he had back up.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThis king had no problem admitting he was not able, the world might say he was weak, I would call that humility. Believers should not be afraid to admit they are unable. Sometimes I hear preachers say do not confess you are defeated, sounds like bad luck if you do. I believe most people God has raised are people who admitted their lack of ability and were vulnerable to admit it. King Jehoshaphat says, <strong>2Chronicles 20, \"...we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us.” </strong>In rare cases do you hear leaders confess they are unable. Unless you declare bankrupt, you are not ready for God. <strong>Your strength does not lie in your position</strong>, <strong>your strength lies on Who is able</strong>. He admitted they had no power, second he admitted that they did not know what to do and third he confessed that their eyes were upon God. Over the years I have learnt that God loves to demonstrate His power before and for His children. David says, in <strong>Psalm 68:1, \"Let God arise, Let His enemies be scattered\". </strong>\r\n\r\nWatch this, after king Jehoshaphat and his people prayed to God, the word from God through Jahaziel came to Jehoshaphat in <strong>vs. 15,</strong> saying<strong>, \"...Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the LORD to you: \"Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God's</strong>\". <strong>The Lord encouraged them without changing their situation</strong>. He says, \"<strong>do not be afraid</strong>\", how many times do we hear God encouraging His people through His word not to be afraid? Fear and doubt are the enemies of faith. <strong>Before God does anything, He first deals with our fears because fear has a way of messing things up</strong>. Then He tells them not to be dismayed meaning not to lose courage. Joshua was told to fear not but be courageous for the Lord was with Him. If the battle is the Lord's, then that means I do not need to be in the battle field right? I cannot be afraid when I know I do not have to be there. Not only are they told not to be afraid nor dismayed, they are told\". <strong>\"Tomorrow go down against them</strong>...\", <strong>2Chronicles 20:16</strong>. “Lord, You said the battle is Yours, how come You are telling me to go against them? How is it Yours if I have to face what I want Your help me with?” <strong>This is not about what you can do in the battleground, this is about taking God at His word by faith</strong>. We have battles facing me and my wife as I believe you too. It could be financial battles, marriage battles, dealing with children battles, change of jobs or career battles and like this king, you just do not know what to do. Do not be afraid to admit you need help and call on God. We are encouraged not to be afraid nor dismayed, the battle is His however we still need to report to the battlefield. Let us move and face it head on at His word because He has a plan we do not know. Just because the battle is His does not mean you will be absent from the battlefield. To continue.

              "<strong>2Chronicles 20:1-25, \"vs. 12...For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIf our strength is not in our position and if God tells us that we still have to go against what we called on Him for, let us see where we fit in His plan of fighting for us. Twice the king and his people were told to go against their enemies. In the last message I wrote that you and I are still required to report to the battlefield.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>2Chronicles 20:16&amp;17, \"Tomorrow go down against them .... 17, \"You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the LORD, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!' Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, for the LORD is with you.\"</strong> If you go to a battle field, the enemy knows you are there to battle, here the Lord says, <strong>\"you don't need to fight</strong>\". No one goes to a battlefield with no battle plan, the enemy will not stop attacking you simply because you are not there to fight. Why is it that we have the tendency of feeling that we must fight, try and resolve issues, have answers for everything? I believe Jehoshaphat and his people were sent to the field to see God move. God did not need their help, we feel at times that unless we help God it cannot be done. When God brings you to the battlefield you've been avoiding, it is not because He wants your help or see if you had good strategy of facing it, He wants to show you of what He is capable of. He has brought you to a place where He can boost your faith. He is there to remind you that your strength is not in your position, leadership, money, notoriety, or fame, your strength is in Him. David refers to Him as \"<strong>MY Strength</strong>\". Now we can tell the reason David was more concerned about the presence of God and not like Saul who cared about position. Moses had a great position yet he would not go back to Egypt alone without the presence of God accompanying Him. What can we say then, as long as the presence of God is going with us, we can face any battle, situation, or circumstances, <strong>Romans 8:31 says, \"...If God be for us, who can be against us?” (KJV).</strong>\r\n\r\nNow that the king knew his strength was not in his position, he positioned all the people in readiness to go to the battlefield. He went strong in the Lord with his people encouraged, <strong>vs. “20, ...Jehoshaphat stood and said, \"Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in the LORD your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.\" </strong>He knew he was going to the battlefield where the Lord had control of the situation. He also felt that being there to watch the Lord fight was not good enough, he therefore gathered singers and musicians to praise the Lord. It is easy to pray and then sit and do nothing waiting for God to move, these people saw an opportunity to praise God<strong>, they</strong> <strong>turned their fears into praise</strong>. <strong>They could not fight, but they could praise God</strong>. Worship was not about what they could do but what God was going to do. They were not doing sorry, low, dull numbers, they lifted their voices to praise Him. <strong>vs. 22, \"Now when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated</strong>\".

              "<a><strong>Psalm 55:1-23, \"... So I said, \"Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest\"</strong></a>\r\n\r\nWe are facing tough times especially economic crisis. Everyone is affected in these tough times. The magnitude may be small or great but the fact remains life is tough. We as believers many times have promised the world that if they come to Jesus, all their troubles will disappear. Many have responded to the call expecting comfort and good life. When everything did not go as they expected, they abandoned their faith. You and I have to address this early in our Christ walk this question, “Why do we serve Christ?” It’s been said, “life is not fair but God is good”, situations and circumstances will not make Him less of Himself, He is the same forever. So understanding that we will always be faced with situations leads us to address them.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWould our prayers be something like this, <strong>\"Father, please get me out of this\",</strong> and if the situation does not change in a day or two, we come back to God and pray<strong>, \"Father, when I'm I getting out of this?\" </strong>or should we be praying<strong>, \"FATHER, WHAT SHOULD I GET OUT OF THIS?\" </strong>David found himself in this kind of dilemma as he records in <strong>Psalm 55</strong>. He was going through overwhelming situations. This might have been the times he was constantly running for his life from Saul. With the trials, temptations, exhaustion, confusion, frustration, brokenness, spent, troubled and the list continues, the word “enough is enough” must have come to his mind and so his faith was replaced with <strong>“I wish</strong>”. <strong>\"So I said, \"Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest\". </strong>I have wished this many times when everything was out of control.\r\n\r\nI love doves, they are very pretty birds. Doves are symbol of peace, the Spirit of God descended on Jesus as a dove, and who would not love doves? the bible says that, <strong>\"be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves\", Matthew 10:16. </strong>David desired wings of a dove to fly far away from his problems. Doves flap their wings fast to get out of situations at any given time. But with God, flying away from situations is not His plan, <strong>Romans 5:3-5, “3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.” Situations are learning and growing opportunities.</strong> I do not want to have wings of a dove to escape and miss the opportunities to learn something in the current situation. It was also David who said in <strong>Psalm 119:71, \"It's good for me to have been afflicted that I may learn Your statutes”. </strong>If it is not the wings of a dove I need. What kind of wings do I need?\r\n\r\n<strong>Isaiah 40:31, \"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings as the eagles\". </strong>These are the wings we need. Look at the way the wings are given to us, as we wait on God meaning serving God without complaining about what we are dealing with or facing.  Our strength will be renewed in tough situations, and through the renewing of our strengths, we will be mounted with wings like eagles. Eagles do not struggle to fly, they stretch their wings and the wind carries them through. Rarely will you see eagles flap their wings. When it's in the air flying, it could be up there for hours while doves fly then gets some rest before they continue with their journey. The eagles fly above and so should a Christian fly above situations rather than run away from them. While flying above, the Spirit will blow us (direct us) in the direction He wants to lead us, just like the wind will move the eagle to different directions. To add, eagles can see far as to what they need. May the Lord cause us to see far and wide what He is working all things together for our good. <strong>If you fly away like a dove, you will miss the opportunities present to see God in your situation</strong>.\r\n\r\nDavid's desire to have wings like dove and fly away would not even make his problems go away as they would have caught up with him eventually. <strong>What you do not deal with in the night will catch up with you in the mornin</strong>g. David takes comfort in <strong>vs.22 \"Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous fall” (NIV). I pray that God will give us all the wings of eagles if we ever need wings.

              "The term today for effective, state of the art, fashionable ministry is “cutting edge.” It describes the up-to-the-minute modern media we use to penetrate cultural resistance and communicate the gospel in a way that connects to the sensory paradigms of sight, sound and emotion. In a world where visual imagery is king and attention spans are declining, cutting edge ministry can be anything from music and drama to video and fancy lights creating the right feel of a room.<!--more--> While these may certainly be effective modes of outreach and relevant tools of communication, they should in no way be misconstrued as ministry’s “cutting edge.” There is only one cutting edge of ministry that penetrates cultures, pierces paradigms and converts resistant people. Prayer is our “cutting edge.” Scripture tells us, “If the ax is dull, and one does not sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength.\" (Eccl. 10:10) Have you ever tried to chop wood with a dull ax blade? Every swing requires more and more effort and yields smaller and smaller results. You must rely more on brute, physical strength to force the ax through the wood. How different it is when the blade has been sharpened in advance—prepared for its task on the sharpening stone. It almost glides through the tree without exerting any physical effort. It is prayer that makes ministry sharp, living and powerful—like a two edged sword piercing the soul and discerning the intents of the heart. Without prayer, gospel ministry is reduced to mere entertainment competing with the world for carnal attention. Each “show” must be more dynamic and amusing then the last if the masses are to return for more. Pastors lacking in prayer may have the look of effective ministry, but there are much deeper, more essential dynamics that will be lacking. There may be crowds, but there won’t be converts. There may be hype, but there won’t be holiness. There may be entertainment, but there won’t be an anointing that breaks the yoke and sets souls free. As Paul warned Timothy, there may be the appearance of godliness, but it will definitely lack the power. http://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/02/pastors-who-dont-pray-lack-the-cutting-edge.html"

Why is it that we live in a world that shows less or no kindness? Husbands show no kindness to their wives and vise versa, kids are not kind to each other, parents are not kind to their kids, people are not kind to other people. We have murders, abortions, rapes, robbery etc because people are not kind. If everyone was kind as the bible puts it, we wouldn't have any of these issues to deal with, we would all live in peace and harmony.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nKind is the state of friendly, generous or warm hearted nature. A state of showing sympathy, understanding, charitable and considerate. Treating the way you would want to be treated. The bible says in <strong>Proverbs 19:22, \"What is desired in a man is kindness...\" </strong>How true is this, something that God would want in every man and woman. We know that kindness warms the heart, it brings a smile. It gives a sense of value and belonging. Who wouldn't want to be shown kindness? Everyone desires for someone to treat them nicely and say nice things about t<span id=\"__mceDel\"><span id=\"__mceDel\">hem. We all want to be affirmed, someone to believe in us and speak it out. There is power in words spoken therefore you never know what you speak today could impact an individual's life for a long time.

We have to learn to be sensitive to each other's needs and not blinded by our own.</span></span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Ephesians 4:32, \"And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.\" </strong>Paul in writing to the Ephesians told them to replace all bitterness, anger, clamor and evil speaking by being kind to another, having a soft sport of forgiveness. Being the one to step out and do something that is not always seen or experienced in situations that fight kindness. We can affirm our spouses, appreciating them for who they are, what they mean to our lives instead of looking for things of that bring strife. We can encourage our kids in their day to day walk, believing in them and speaking it into their lives. The power of words can begin a process of greatness in young lives. We can also teach them kindness by demonstration between mom and dad on how they treat each other. We all have point of references, something to fall back to. If we all understand that what is desired of us is kindness, we will show more of it on a day to day basis in our homes, in church, community, in our jobs, wherever we go. Are you aware of what is desired of you? Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 11:29, \"For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable\"</strong>\r\n\r\nCar manufacturers fascinate me. Each of them have built different types of cars, some customized to suit the buyers. For instant, Mercedes Benz can have one of their built cars, look alike but different classes eg. C and S class series. You may find two cars look the same however they cost different. The difference in cost is driven by different factors such as performance, upgrades (sunroof, navigation system, more power etc) that make one more expensive than the other. <!--more-->Everyone has a reason for going for different type of cars depending on what they are looking for in a car and what they can afford. Cars can be upgraded and customized. Here is the reason for bringing this up, just because a car has been made does not mean there is no more room to either upgrade or customize it. For us humans we have God our maker who made us and still is willing to upgrade us with gifts and talents.\r\n\r\nLet's explore what talents are. According to the dictionary, talents are marked innate ability, as for artistic accomplishments. It's natural endowment. We are different in order to maintain our individuality. With the uniqueness of each of us, we have talents and abilities. I was watching something on TV not too long ago, and they brought these young kids of about 10 years and under. They all had different talents and abilities. One at the age of 4 could sing and dance Elvis songs; there was also a 4 year old girl who had such knowledge of the government and politics. Talents is what you have that very few people have. Talent in singing, writing poetry, dancing, public speaking. At my house I have brothers talented in drawing portraits, another in poetry and another in playing drums, different talents but fitting in one household. I believe God allows us to have talents to enjoy and trade with them to reach His people.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mathew 25:14-15, \"14 For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them. 15, \"And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey\"</strong>. We don't know what they might have been given to do but it's clear they were asked to do was according to their own abilities. The Master knew what they were capable of; he bestowed goods and talents to them. He expected them to do something with the talents to the maximum. Are you using your God given talents to the maximum? Each of them doubled their goods through their talents except the last man who buried his because he only had one. The rest were rewarded according to the way they used their talent, the last one was denied and even that which he had was taken away.<span id=\"__mceDel\"><span id=\"__mceDel\"><span id=\"__mceDel\"><span id=\"__mceDel\"><span id=\"__mceDel\">When we come back to talking about gifts, we understand that gifts are not things worked for but bestowed without any plan for compensation. Anytime you pay for a gift, it wouldn't be considered as a gift anymore. The good God of mercy has taken the liberty to bestow gifts in us for a </span></span></span></span></span><span id=\"__mceDel\"><span id=\"__mceDel\">reason. The gifts are to be used to edify the body of Christ. All the gifts of the saints fall back to the Holy Spirit who empowers men to do what they would not do on their own. Once again, each of us have different gifts, <strong>Romans 12:6, \"Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them\"</strong>. The gifts we have also differs because of the measure of grace and faith and has to be put to work. Regardless of what we have, God requires us to use them. What are some of the spiritual gifts, prophesy, ministry, teaching, leadership,mercy, exhortation. All these gifts and many more originate from the same Spirit and are to be used to benefit the body. I have my own and I can also tap from someone who has the gift I don't have. This is the part where we need each other for the gifts we have to benefit each other. <strong>1Corinthians 12:7, \"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all</strong>\", <strong>Romans 12 and 1Corinthians 12 talks </strong>about spiritual gifts and what they are for. Before men, gifts are for self while with God, gifts are to benefit the entire body of Christ. If God has given you a gift and talents you are not using in your local church, you are missing the opportunity to maximize that gift. The body has different parts, the hands, legs, eyes, ears to mention a few. All have different functions but depend on each other. It's like saying the hands have the gift to handle, touch, build; meanwhile the legs have the gift to carry, move, and help escape danger. Different functions but depend on each other. The hands needs the legs, ears, eyes etc for it to be complete and so is the gifting we have that other people don't and what they have that we don't have. We need our gifts and their gifts and vice versa. <strong>Romans 11:29, \"For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable\"</strong>, interesting to know that His gifts are irreversible, in other words, they are final. I believe God will not take away what he has bestowed upon us, but if we are not using them, it will not be rewarding to us or people around us. We all have gifts and talents on board, let's maximize them to build and further His kingdom. The more you use them, the more you allow room for gifts upgrade. The more you empty yourself with what you have, the more gifts will be bestowed upon you. Blessings Ev</span></span>"

              "<strong>Acts 23:12, “And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.” </strong>\r\n\r\nPaul was known by many as a troublemaker against the kingdom of darkness. I don’t know who these Jews made their vow to, and who it was that would curse them, but they were not going to kill Paul, because God would not allow His servant to die at this time. The thinking of these Jews was so warped because they were willing to come under a curse to kill Paul; however they failed to realize that they were already under a curse, the curse of sin. <strong>Deuteronomy 28:15 – 68</strong> and <strong>Psalm 1</strong> show this very clearly.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhy did these men desire to kill Paul? Paul was boldly preaching Jesus Christ. When we speak boldly and unashamed speak about Jesus, people that are resistant may get very upset, in this case they had murder in their hearts. The truth is painful for those living under a curse, and resistant to it.\r\n\r\nPicture with me a time when you may have been sleeping, and you wake up because someone has been loud and turned the light on. Although no one poked you in the eye, you feel pain, your eyes actually hurt. The light caused pain because your eyes have adjusted to the darkness during the night. Whoever turned on the light is usually someone that you may want to “send to heaven immediately” or at least you may want to throw something at them.\r\n\r\nThese desiring to kill Paul lived in darkness, their hearts were so adjusted to darkness, and they desired to love under a curse until they murdered this Jewish preacher that proclaimed the Jewish Messiah, Jesus Christ. The light of Jesus Christ emanated from Paul and it hurt the darkness of their hearts and they were literally on a manhunt to murder Paul. “<strong>And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil” (John 3:19)</strong>. Realize that when you as a Christian shine the light of Jesus into the dark heart of the sinner, it will hurt and they may hate you for it, curse you, and even persecute you. If this happens at times, don’t be surprised. Jesus said in <strong>John 15:18-19</strong> “<strong>18 If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. 19 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you</strong>.”\r\n\r\n<strong>John 15:20-21</strong>, <strong>“Remember the words I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. 21 They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 5:10-12,</strong> “<strong>10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. “11 Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>“In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven” (Matthew 5:16).</strong> Now go out and shine today, whether at work, school, or in the market place, SHINE!\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>John 12:9-11, “9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus” </strong>\r\n\r\nA pastor saw a young lady in his church after a summer time of her being away. Upon coming back from her vacation, the pastor noticed that her stomach was quite large. He thought that her and her husband were obviously going to have a baby and therefore said, “You’re starting to show.” However she replied, “I’m not pregnant”. Needless to say the woman was very offended, in which time that the Pastor said, “I’m sorry, I’ll perhaps need you to forgive me seventy times seven for that one insensitive comment.”<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHave you ever offended someone, either purposefully or accidentally? Perhaps you have a humorous story as well. However, have you ever offended someone, because you were living for Christ? When Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, not everyone was happy about this public miracle. Jesus was in Bethany, with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, and “<strong>9</strong> <strong>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus</strong>.”\r\n\r\nNow that Lazarus is a walking miracle, raised to newness of life, his very life was offensive to many, and they wanted to kill not only Christ, but Lazarus as well. If Christ has raised your life from being dead in your sins and transgressions when you repented and put your trust in Jesus Christ, then should your life not offend? How many get offended as you speak and live for Christ? There should be those that absolutely despise you for the cause of Christ. You were just like Lazarus, dead in your sins and trespasses, and also broke God’s Moral Law (The Ten Commandments). Christ called you by name, “come forth” and at which time you repented and put your trust in Christ. Others took the grave clothes off you by discipling you in the faith that you might walk closer to Him, and become more like Jesus. Lazarus represented Christ, and therefore his life was on the line, he was despised, he was hated, his enemies called for his blood. It is kind of humorous, as Ravi Zaccharias said, “<em>what are the Jews going to threaten Lazarus with, death? How can someone like Lazarus actually be threatened by death, he already has been there and done that?” </em>\r\n\r\nChristian, if you are truly living your life for Christ, then where are your accusers, where are those that hate you and want you dead because your life is so offensive and repugnant to those in the world? We don’t desire to offend others with the gospel, that is not our goal, nor should it be, however, the gospel is offensive. Paul wrote, “<strong>18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God…For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; 24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.” 1Corinthians 1:18-24.</strong>\r\n\r\nRay Comfort <em>writes “The undertaker’s nightmare”. The Son of God created havoc for undertakers by speaking to their frigid merchandise. His voice was supernatural. A mere “Lazarus, come forth,” spoken to a corpse meant a nightmarish dilemma for the Bethany funeral director, because he was left with no body to deal with. Up until that moment, his business was mortally secure. Four days after the death, he had everything wrapped up, when suddenly, three words unraveled his inanimate toil. Reimbursement of all funeral expenses was just the beginning of the bad dream. Death was his living, and if this stranger from Nazareth continued to speak around graves, his business itself would soon be terminal. Jesus Christ was the undertaker’s nightmare because death bowed its vile knee to His voice, and the day is promised when all undertakers will hit the unemployment line! The raising of Lazarus snatched the profit from the undertaker; but the incident happened for the inestimable profit of humanity. It was the long-awaited fulfillment of what was spoken of by the prophets of old. It was a beam of wondrous and glistening light in the most hopeless and darkest of all caves.</em>”\r\n\r\nPerhaps if you never offend anyone, perhaps you should check to see if you are walking with Christ. Share your faith with three people a day, and at the end of the week, see how many were receptive and how many were offended. Speak boldly and with compassion, for the lost need to hear the truth about Jesus from one he has raised from being dead in their sins, therefore you make a good candidate. Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/hated-for-the-light-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">Hated For The Light, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/what-makes-you-burn-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">What Makes You Burn?

              "<strong>John 12:24, \"...unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain\"</strong>\r\n\r\nMan in general is a selfish being, from Genesis all the way you will see in different instances where man shows how selfish he is. Well we could say that happened in the bible days but let's look at the world today, we see it again. I would expect that the believers would be exempt, that is not the case, maybe we are all not aspiring to get up there but still we are very selfish in certain areas.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nSomeone might say those are very harsh words. Think of a number who church to them is about what they can gain out of it, it's about what God can do for us and always desiring to hear, receive and be ministered to and not ready to give. I'm not talking about finances but give time, help that is needed and more so bring people to the Kingdom who need the same things we desire. We always come for us, I have seen this even with small ministries, folks are trying to find out who is going to be there and what to expect and receive instead of what can I give or what can I do to make this ministry successful. How about worship, many don't want to because they are waiting for God to give them a spirit of worship. We are the ones who need to worship God, that's our duty to give Him all the praises and not do it when we feel like.\r\n\r\nJesus shows us what service is before He is betrayed. The bible says that He knew who will betray Him, reject Him but still He served them. He knew that He did not come to receive but came to give and one of his last teachings was \"give\". He girded Himself with a towel, went down on His knees and washed His disciples feet regardless of who they were and what He knew of them, read it in <strong>John 13</strong>.\r\n\r\nWe have been called to service, we are being raised for a time like this not just to be receivers but givers too. In the text referenced we are told that \"<strong>unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain</strong>\". Already we are seeing the beginning point and that is death as there can be no resurrection without death. The grain of wheat is very small however we are told of it's significant role when something is done with it. We too as believers yes may be very small in the church and might not be known but the truth of the matter is, we are very significant. Your prayers, presence, support does make a difference because you are significant in the body of Christ. Look at the verse closely, it says unless the grain of wheat referring to only one grain (individual), God calls His people as individuals, He does not call them as a group. We are called to die to self as the grain does need to fall on the dirt and dies. I have learnt that no one can go up unless they go down first simply because those who went to the top without going down tend to be arrogant and prideful in their walks but if you went down and the Lord brought you up, you have every reason to give thanks to Him and cherish the position He has entrusted you with. One has to fall on the ground and die, it's because when anything falls into the ground, the outward appearance is consumed by the ground and real seed which is on the inside begins to show forth. We have to be stripped of self righteousness and feeling that we are a little bit better and are brought to a place where the ground consumes what we perceive of ourselves and we allow the Lord to transform the inside as what is on the inside is the real deal. This might not happen overnight as when it falls on the ground it remains by itself for a season awaiting to begin to shoot forth from the ground and later produce much grain. I don't know about you but for me, preparation takes place in the closet and like the seed which is not seen when it begins to go <span id=\"__mceDel\">through the process, results is what people see.</span>\r\n\r\nMany cannot be effective in reaching others because they are not willing to die to self, they are not willing to sacrifice or give their time, money, talents. I was never anointed to sit on it but utilize it. In fact it's not for me but for those who are in need. In <strong>Luke 6:38, \"Give and it shall be given unto you, good measure press down shaken together running over...\", Acts 20:35, \"...it's more blessed to give than receive</strong>\". I desire to witness to the lost, encourage, inspire, pray and reach them that need gospel. With our jobs let's also have the same attitude and not just see what my job will offer me but what I can offer to my job. Let's have the attitude that we all came to make a difference wherever the Lord places us.\r\n\r\nWhat do you have and what can you give, are you always on the verge of receiving and never give? Pray today that God will teach you how to fall on the ground like the grain seed and also teach you how to die to things that might hinder your step to give. Give your time, talents, gifts, energy, experiences, knowledge, wisdom, love, patience, understanding and the list goes on. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 10:17, \"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God\"</strong>\r\n\r\nCommercials are one of the greatest tools the manufacturers use to convey messages of their new products. Millions of dollars are poured into commercials to create awareness of the latest products. The commercials are supposed to be catchy and sometimes funny, some with twisted humor. Why do people go for things they go for? either someone told them about it and were convinced it works or saw it on TV, heard it on radio, billboards, newspapers. The product will not do them good if they don't try it. For a fact, most commercials exaggerate what their products can do only to discover its ability to work for a short time and its effectiveness is gone.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe have talked about faith so many times but let this help build your faith. <strong>Faith is the confident belief in the truth, value, and worthiness of a person, idea or a thing. It's being loyal to a person or a thing</strong>. If you were to tell me your name, I must have faith to believe you told me the truth. If I said, \"I don't believe you\", chances are, you will be offended because I am insinuating you are deceiving me, the same way if you told me where you live and I told you I doubt it, you will not take it kindly. <strong>Hebrews 11:6, says \"For without faith it is impossible to please God...\". </strong>You want to please God, you have to have faith, believing what He has said without doubting. Doubt is an indication of mistrust, and what an insult it is to God. He has displayed his products to us inform of creation, life, blessings again and again therefore He is God who can be trusted, have faith in Him.\r\n\r\n<strong>Faith is commitment</strong>. When the bible talks about FAITHFUL servant, it refers to one who is committed to a task because he has believed the one who authored the task. It is a way to build more faith because the person whom you hang around for long, their character is displayed, you have a better way of dealing with them when it comes to faith. It is evident that you have no faith in some people, you cannot trust them with things like information or finances, they have no character to support that trust. Thanks be to God who is faithful, He never leaks your information to someone else, and does not mess with what you have trusted Him with. The children of God are people of faith, committed to this walk of life with Christ, <strong>2Corinthians 5:7, \"For we walk by faith and not by sight</strong>\". It is a tough one but we are determined to ride it out because we want to please Him.\r\n\r\nHe that uses the product must first believe that it works and what is the testimony? I don't think faith just appears from nowhere and we believe it. It comes by hearing, hearing someone's testimony that God can, hearing the word that drills through the nutshell of doubt and unbelief. The continuous word spoken goes around that shell and melts it down allowing it to have a new master <strong>F.A.I.T.H</strong> (<strong>F</strong>orever <strong>A</strong>ll <strong>I</strong>n <strong>T</strong>hy <strong>H</strong>and). You can only come to someone because you know they have it, Christ does have it forever in His hands. Doubt is the enemy of faith and it comes easily, but faith needs a lot of force to occupy. Faith is gradual concurring one step at a time depending on what it is given to feed on. We have established what faith comes by, \"<strong>Hearing</strong>\", this presents a little problem because you could hear things but wrong things and for sure those can also build faith but only towards the wrong things. \"<strong>It comes by hearing by the word of God</strong>\". God's word is like the commercial that we see out there, the only difference is that <strong>His word is not exaggerated, nothing can be added to it and nothing can be taken away from it. It presents itself, defends itself and also proves itself. It never fails, it does not work for a season, it works always</strong>. <strong>It does not fall short of anything and it does not return void. What it starts, it will accomplish. It is committed through the author to accomplish what it is meant for</strong>.<strong> Do not forget that faith draws a man to God</strong>. Having faith in someone whom you know cannot do it is being unwise. There is nothing impossible with Him, He is the <strong>\"…author and the finisher of our faith...\" Hebrews 12:2,</strong> for, <strong>Hebrews 11:6,\"...He that comes to God must first believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him</strong>\". Let your faith be boosted because you have heard the word of God.

              "<strong>1Samuel 1:11, \"O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget think handmaid, but wilt give unto think handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</strong>\"\r\n\r\nWOW, what a whooper of a desperate prayer. Hannah just in one chapter shares her deepest heart chamber with God, because it seemed that only He would understand. She was a woman who was misunderstood by those around her. The Lord had closed her womb which in OT times was viewed as a curse by. <!--more-->She was provoked severely by Peninnah, Elkanah's other wife, for it and her heart was deeply grieved. She would only weep and not even eat, and bitterness of soul built up within her. Not even her own husband nor Eli the priest (the spiritual one) understood her sorrowful spirit. So what did she do? Did she set out to kill her husband or the other wife, because she couldn't conceive a child? Did she verbally try and abuse the other wife or try and defend her situation? Did she verbally attack Eli the priest, for not being able at first to understand her condition, for even he thought her to be drunk as she prayed her prayer. No, she did none of these things that were possible reactions by any other in her situation. What would you have done?\r\n\r\nHow did Hannah finally respond to her sorrowful situation, of no one understanding her, and being labeled as cursed by God Himself? She prayed a prayer. What, that's it, she didn't take up arms and go postal, run away, or even take her own life? No, she prayed a powerful, real, heartfelt, from the guts of her desperation, prayer.\r\n\r\nJust then, the Lord remembered (not that He ever forgot) her, answering her prayer. And granted her a son, the prophet Samuel. God has answered her prayer, bigger and greater than she could have ever imagined. But isn't God like that, we ask for something in His will, and He goes above and beyond what we had seen through our, many times, lack of faith. Even recently the Lord blessed me with a vehicle beyond what I dreamed in prayer for. Praise God!\r\n\r\nShe responds to God in a way that we need to when God blesses us, in worship and thanksgiving, lest we worship the blessing, and not the Blesser! \"<strong>For this child I have prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of Him: Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshiped the Lord there.\"\r\n</strong>\r\n*This child - Samuel\r\n*I have prayed - she labored in prayer\r\n*The Lord hath given me - she acknowledges that God alone blessed her\r\n*I have lent him to the Lord - she, and no one else, gave him back to God unconditionally in dedication to the Lord's work. She was a mom of faith. She didn't't give up something for lent (40 days give it to God then take it back), she gave completely open handed to God.\r\n\r\nØ What about you are you in a desperate situation, then pray, He hears as He remembered Hannah, He will remember you.\r\nØ When God blesses you, in His way, will you give back to Him open handed?\r\nØ Self check - The USA chokes on the blessings of God greatly. Is there anything God gave you that you are worshiping, instead of giving back to Him? One must be painfully honest to break free from any idolatry.\r\nØ Remember - God loves us to give back to Him what He has given up, but He most desires us to lend Him a life, our life, and lead others to Him that they might lend their lives to the Lord as well.

              "<strong>Colossians 3:23, \"And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men\"</strong>\r\n\r\nLet me select a few people in the bible who knew God and acted on what they believed to have been God’s will.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>1Samuel 17</strong> tells us of the story of David and Goliath. We all know this story. David comes to the field and his main and only job in the field is to check on his brothers and bring them food. Watch how the Lord opens a door to glorify His name through this young man. The Philistines threatened Israelites by a reason of a giant in their team. No one in Israel could face this giant; they had forgotten that God was their giant. David shows up to find Goliath threatening and defying the armies of God, he then says vs. 26,<strong> \"...who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?\", vs. 37, \"Moreover David said, \"The LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\"</strong> David could only speak with boldness because he knew who God was (is). He knew what God was capable of doing, he delighted himself in the Lord and he knew the Lord would be pleased with the move. God had opened a door for him and all he needed to do was walk through it. He was in God's will and we know what happened.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Hannah in <strong>1Samuel 1</strong>, God had something in store for her, instead of speaking it directly to her, He allowed Penninah, her husband's other wife to provoke her. It built such a great desire in her heart for a son. I don't know how much she knew the Lord because year after year she prayed that God would bless her and the Lord did not. I like her spirit, she knew that having a child was acceptable therefore she couldn't quit. The more she spent time in the presence of God, the more she learned to know Him and His ways, and the more her selfish desires for a child melted a way. This was her prayer that opened doors for her blessing,<strong> 1Samuel 1:11, \"Then she made a vow and said, \"O LORD of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, ...\".</strong> God showed her something and that became the desire of her heart and we know that the male child Samuel was God's anointed prophet. God was glorified in Samuel's work.\r\n\r\nThen here comes Esther a slave girl. An opportunity arose and she was encouraged to step in and fill in a position for a new queen. God opened a door for her to make a difference without her even knowing. The Jews were being mistreated and something had to happen for this to stop. At one point it was about herself but listen to what her uncle tells her,<strong> Esther 4:14, \"For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?\"</strong> Esther had an opportunity to glorify God using her position to deliver her people the Jews. Isn't it amazing that when you know God, you become sensitive to the things He is doing? I heard of a song, \"<i>God has given me a window and I can finally see the light</i>\". I now know when God is giving me a window, it becomes clear and clearer as you get to know Him more and more.\r\n\r\nHow about Peter in <strong>Matthew 14</strong>, the man who walked on water besides Jesus. He saw Jesus walking on water, he had walked with Jesus to know what was acceptable. Jesus had said, greater works than these shall you do more so in reference to preaching, so why not do what Jesus was doing, walk on water? Peter saw an opportunity to strengthen his faith and the faith of those who were in the boat with him, he therefore said<strong> vs. 28, \"..., \"Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.\" 29 So He said, \"Come.\" And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus\".</strong>\r\n\r\nTime fails me to talk about others in the bible who over and over again God commends them for their initiative acts for His glory. God said, <b>\"I</b><strong> will write my laws in their hearts and they will know what to do without me even telling them\" (paraphrased</strong>). Yes there are some that you have to clearly hear the Lord but there are some that He shows you, opens the doors and you do your part. What did the people I just shared have in common, they did it with all their heart not for themselves but unto God,<strong> Colossians 3:23, \"And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men\".</strong> And because of their humility God exalted them in due season. Their aim was to please the Lord in all that they did. They had known what He would require and God reached them with blessings, <strong>James 4:10, \"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up\".</strong> I have applied these principles in my walk with God and God has been glorified in each step and He has lifted me up in due time. I sought for opportunities, walked through the doors God opened, did everything heartily without complaining and my motivation was to Glorify Him, He is still opening more doors to glorify Himself.

              "<b>2Kings 7:1-20, \"And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?\"</b>\r\n\r\nThere was such a great famine in the land of Samaria that everything was valued and expensive. The bible says that even the dung of a dove was considered precious and rare commodity highly priced. This alone gives me a picture that there was such a great famine in this land. Knowing the situation in Samaria, let’s look at four men again in vs. 3 who we are not even given their names.<!--more--> These were men we would consider less fortunate in the society for no. 1 <strong>they were lepers</strong>. Anyone who had leprosy in the olden times was cast out of the city. They lived in caves, mountains or right out of the city. The lepers were always required to chant \"unclean, unclean\". Situation number one looked severe then topped with situation number 2. <strong>Which is as lethal as number one and that is famine.</strong> Sick and no food, How much can a man take?\r\n\r\nThey were aware of their situation as outcasts and they knew sooner or later one of these situations would kill them first, sickness or starvation or both. I love how they reasoned with themselves, <strong>vs. 3&amp;4\"...and they said one to another, why sit here until we die? if we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also\"</strong>. I thank God that in some tough times He still allows us to think and reason. Though we may feel handicapped in some areas, we are reminded that there are things deposited in us that are alive and functioning. I do not want to throw everything out of the window simply because there is part me that is not functioning like it should. I may be struggling in some areas and that could be my leprosy, and I might be going without the spiritual food for some unknown reason. One thing I know, that I am not dead yet so devil don't bring me no casket for burial, God is showing me the part my life that is still living and He is giving me grace to activate them. The other part of me is a means to bring life to the rest of my being. I see many beat themselves because what was working for them at one point stopped. I believe there are <strong>TANKS</strong> God reserved for a time like this. You might have not known that you had a filled tank and just when you thought you had exhausted everything and left hopeless, He comes to open this tank He put in reserve. This is the time you see that you could do more with less. The four lepers lost friends, food, health, family but thank God they did not lose their senses, the ability to reason. I believe God reserved this tank of reasoning for a time like this and it was a matter of time before He would pop it up for their use. Yes they were limited but that did not stop them from thinking of the next move, it was a risky move, still they put everything on the line for whatever happens.\r\n\r\nFour feeble men decided to march to the enemies’ camp in <strong>vs. 5, \"And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians\"</strong>. They had no weapons, they were sick but still pushed themselves as they marched to the enemies camp. I know that there are times when God requires us to do the ridiculous things that He may show Himself as God in tough situations. There are things He will not accomplish until we respond to the move. It is until we demonstrate how badly we want it that we do something about it (pray, fast, seek, knock, ask).\r\n\r\nThere are times when I feel that I have lost so much to function effectively, but those are the times I am reminded that I am not dead yet, God put a tank on reserve for a time like this, therefore I will rise up again, take a step of faith and move as I say, “Be glorified in me”.<strong> Philippians 4:6, \"Be careful for nothing....\".

              "<strong>2Kings 7:1-20, \"And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAnd the four leprous men reasoned and moved, <strong>vs. 5-6\"And when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there. For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of Chariots, even the noise of horses, even the noise of great host: and they said one to another, Lo, King if Israel has hired against us the kings of Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us\"</strong>. When these men moved, <strong>God took over.<!--more--></strong> Think of the things you see yourself doing which are acceptable according to God’s word, then think of your limitations that have paralyzed you. Here is something to chew on, <strong>the world</strong> <strong>crowns success, God crowns faithfulness. </strong>You may not be successful but you can be faithful and that could be a great strength an employer could be looking for in a job situation. In God's eyes we are not dealt with by who we are and what we have accomplished but by what He accomplishes through us. It is good to have the qualifications, it is a greater blessing when you see the Lord fight for you where you do not have all that it takes, I’m speaking from experience. Somewhere in <strong>Romans it says, “them that He called, He justified and them that He justified, He also glorified”</strong>. This is what faith is all about, hoping for those things which are not seen and yet believing that they can happen. <strong>2Corinthians 12:10, \"Therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities, in reproaches and necessities, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong\". </strong>May I use this verse in a different way<strong>, “when you are not that's when you are for Christ’s’ sake</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe four lepers moved, the Lord multiplied the sound of their feet and they sounded like a mighty army. Take a closer look at what God did, <strong>God did not change their condition for the sake of the enemy, He changed the way the enemy perceived of them</strong>. God may not change your situation or circumstances, He may allow someone else see you as an asset<strong>. God may allow someone else to see more potential in you than you could see by yourself and that is because He has reserved a tank for His glory for such a time as this. </strong>They were weak almost dying, they did not have war gear and to make it worse, they were just four heading to the enemy’s camp to surrender and that is when the Lord made their feet sound like a mighty army. Of course their walk was no different and they did not even know what happened; only God knew. I do not know how God does it but it works. I may never understand how He operates but I love to be part of His operations.\r\n\r\nThe enemy did not care to check if these were true warriors coming after them, they fled leaving their tents, their horses and everything for the sake of their lives. “<strong>Greater is He that lives in side of us than He that is in the world”, 1John 4:4 tells us</strong>. Read the rest of the story and you will see how they ate and drunk and had a good time, God favored them. They came and mentioned it to the king of Israel of what happened. The king of Israel thought the Syrians were playing a trick on them and the Syrians thought Israel came to attack them, God was in control of the destiny of these four men. All my life I never got what I deserved or qualified, all I have known is how best God can be glorified in my life through what He does therefore when I moved, God stepped in and made the sound of my feet sound like a mighty army. Instead of being judged by what I had, I was judged by what God could do through me. So the things I have not yet accomplished will not cause my dreams and desire to die. Though it looks like nothing is happening and the conditions are getting tougher, part of me maybe affected and not function effectively, I am reminded God is in control. Even in the midst of it, I will not let them hinder me from rising up and moving. I may be feeble and I may not walk well but that is a good sign that <strong>I am not dead yet</strong>. <strong>Psalm 118:17, \"I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord\". God has a reserved tank for a time like this. </strong>My life in Christ is a book yet to be written, a song yet to be sung, a testimony yet to be testified, a desire yet to be fulfilled to the glory of God. I cannot go under just because I have leprosy in my life. I encourage you too not to go down, though something in you is draining life out of you and at times you feel like this is it and can’t do it anymore. <strong>It is not over, until God says it is over, </strong>so ask the Lord to show you the other tanks He put on reserve , rise up and use what is in that tank and give God all the glory as a sign you are not dead yet. Dead things have no voice.

              "One day, as an artist was down on his knees pounding with chisel and mallet at the base of his sculpture, a preacher approached and said, \"I wish I could deal such changing blows to the hearts of men.\" The sculptor looked up at him, and with a steadfast gaze replied, \"Maybe you could if you worked like me…down on your knees.\"<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJesus never taught His disciples to preach. Instead, He taught them to pray. EM Bounds said, “All ability to talk to men is measure by the ability with which a preacher can talk to God (about) men.” These were the leaders who would spread the message He died for through preaching and teaching, yet Jesus taught them more about praying than He did about public speaking. Prayer was the decisive factor in spreading the gospel; prayer was the primary ministry they were called to; prayer was the guarantee they would succeed.\r\n\r\nCharles Spurgeon once cried, \"We need red-hot, white-hot men who glow with intense heat; whom you cannot approach without feeling that your heart is getting warmer; who burn their way in all positions straight on to the desired work; men like thunderbolts flung from Jehovah's hand, crashing through every opposing thing, till they have reached the target aimed at; men impelled by Omnipotence.\" Such a fervent condition can only be obtained through prayer. It cannot be learned in school, although school is good. It cannot be gotten by books, although reading is good. Prayer is what soaks a preacher’s soul in the burden of God and empowers him to ignite others.\r\n\r\nIn Acts 4:13, the religious leaders marveled at the apostles. They knew these men were “uneducated and untrained,” and yet “they marveled…and realized they had been with Jesus.” And more, they saw “the man who had been healed standing with them (and) could say nothing against it.” Peter and John had no silver and they had no gold. They had no earthly resources or human ability to rely on. All they had was what had been obtained in prayer: Holy Ghost unction. With that, they healed a cripple man, confounded the religious elite and ushered in a revival that would turn the world upside down.\r\n\r\nToday, however, we have plenty of silver and gold. Today, we have the most intelligent and intellectual preachers that seminaries can produce—but how many of them have truly been with Jesus. How many can persevere in prayer long enough to make any lasting difference in a culture that is rapidly going to hell.\r\n\r\nWithout prayer, we may be able to attract a crowd but we'll never convert them into disciples. Without prayer, we may be able to build large churches with with attractive programs, but there will be no encounter with the presence of God that melts hardened hearts, transform lives and produce men and women who are on fire for God ready to ignite the world for Jesus Christ.

Johnson\r\nhttp://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/02/pastors-who-dont-pray-have-little-influence-over-men.html\"\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/pastors-who-dont-pray-pastor-gregg-t-johnson/\" target=\"_blank\">PASTORS WHO DON'T PRAY, Pastor Gregg T.

              "<strong>1Corinthians 2:1-5, “1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. 2 For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. 3 I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling. 4 And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 5 that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God\"</strong>\r\n\r\nToday marks our 11th Year Anniversary of writing devotionals, glory be to God for great things He has done and this far He has brought us. When I think about His faithfulness, all I do is humble myself because He has shown Himself so strong on behalf of those who put their confidence in Him. He uses the weak, the despised, the rejected to get His work done so that He gets all the glory for working in such a life. As Paris Reidhead in 1963 preached this message, “THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY THAT JESUS CHRIST WILL GET GLORY OUT OF A LIFE THAT HE'S REDEEMED WITH HIS PRECIOUS BLOOD IS WHEN HE CAN FILL THAT LIFE WITH HIS PRESENCE AND LIVE THROUGH IT HIS OWN LIFE.”, so on this truth do I stand.\r\n\r\nThese 11 years have been a true great experience of learning about our amazing God through the pages of the bible and sharing it with the world. The writings have been a great tool the Lord has used to open my eyes and I give Him all the praise. He has brought brethren to minister along side of me especially Pastor Phil Sessa, and I can honestly say, the Lord is not a respecter of any man. I have learnt that God is not looking for those with abilities to use, He is looking for those available to use.\r\n\r\nOver the years, hundreds of messages have gone out and hundreds of testimonies have been received of how the Lord has used these messages to impact lives. Today I hope you join us in celebrating what the Lord has done.\r\n\r\nBlessings\r\n\r\nEvans Olang"

              "<strong>Mark 16:16-18,\" ... And these signs shall follow them that believe...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe as believers have been privileged to be part of things the Lord is doing partially because we are His children and He desires to let us in on what He is doing. He may never explain the process but definitely we will know the outcome. Because He is the reason for the outcome, we understand that He is not a man that He should lie neither is He a son of man that He should repent, if He has said it, surely enough, He will do it.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTalking about signs is interesting as signs are to show us directions and give us the condition of a place. There are signs that tell us to slow down, sharp bends, animals around, steep slope, no change of lane, lanes reduced or increased etc. As you can see all these does show us certain things a head of time. This is how the world in the natural operates and at times when we come to God, many times we desire the same; we want to see first before we can follow. We want to be sure of what is a head of us and the signs are a means to build confidence of what to expect, however with God it's different. If you do not have the signs a head of time, fear may grip you hence affecting even your speed.\r\n\r\nJesus said\"…<strong>And these signs shall follow them that believe</strong>\". Jesus knew that for every believer to operate under His power and on a higher level, the believer has to be brought out of the natural into the supernatural. On the supernatural you do not know how to operate in that setting, God is all you need . This is where if God does not come through for you, there can be nothing good that can happen. If you look at what faith is all about, it's not about feeling, it's about trusting. It is also not about knowing but believing. I may not know the way but because, \"<strong>I know whom I have believed, … I am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day\", 2Timothy 1:12</strong>. I may not need to see the signs because I might be tempted to follow the signs by myself without God. If I do not know, He will direct me all the way. Something to keep in mind, we don’t settle for signs, you don’t see a sign and then camp around it because you have seen it. Signs point to something bigger, signs are to lead you to a destiny. In this case, signs are to point us to Jesus, they are a means to an end. Remember the wise men who were led by the stars, the stars were the signs. But they did not look at the signs to be fascinated by them or even worship them, the signs were to lead them to this new born baby Jesus, the Messiah. Many are out of line because they run after signs and wonders, running from one meeting to another expecting a zap of some kind. “<strong>Signs follow them that believe</strong>” , a means to a bigger picture, Jesus Christ. For safety, I would put signs at the bottom, God’s word should be right on top.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalms 23:6,</strong> \"<strong>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord\"</strong>. I believe that there are things we need not to fight or even try to fix them as long as we are doing what the Lord requires of us, because good things will follow us if they are in God’s will for our lives. Remember it does not say we shall follow goodness and mercy but they shall follow us. Isn't it amazing that we will not only hear what the Lord is doing and can do but be part of what He is going in our lives? Then we need to take away our signs that cause us to walk carefully according to the worlds’ ways and desire to see God do greater things that will blow the mind and the mentality of men. After all, He is able to make away where their seems to be no way and the crooked paths straight. Only believe, all things are possible with God, the signs point to Him.

              "<strong>Mark 14:3, \"As He sat at the table, a woman came to him having an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John give as different accounts of events. Matthew and John were with Jesus as His disciples. Mark and Luke were not disciples however many scholars and theologians believe Mark’s account were provided to him by Apostle Peter. The four were impacted in different ways and you will see how they were each impacted by the account of their story. Though they all may have seen the same thing in reality or by narration, they did not report exactly the same way. Yes there are different accounts each of them give of certain incidents but there are some incidents that all of them did not report. Here is a classic case involving a woman who came to Jesus with an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nMatthew reports this incident in <strong>Matthew 26</strong>; Mark in <strong>Mark 14</strong>; Luke in <strong>Luke 7;</strong> John in <strong>John 12</strong>. Reading all the four accounts, the story is the same however each of them takes the time to address certain things that others did not report.\r\n\r\nWhy would each record the same differently with some leaving things out and add some stuff in? Here is my thinking, everyone was impacted and touched differently and that is what they reported. <strong>What captures your heart is what you are most likely to report</strong>. What you respond to the most is what you will work towards. How you are really impacted may not be the way I will be but we still report about the same story. I would like to address each of their accounts and we will arrive at the common denominator.\r\n\r\nMatthew says, they were all in the Bethany in the house of Simon the leper. He first identified where they were and whose house they were in. He also tells us the condition of the owner. He doesn't take time to tell us who Simon the leper's background was, his tribe, the condition of his heart. Mark comes along and reports the same as Matthew reports in his first line. Luke comes along and does not give us the man's name but tells us that he was a Pharisee. Matthew and Mark were touched by the fact that Jesus was hanging out with the sick. As for Luke, he was touched by the fact that Jesus was in the house of a Pharisee, the people who opposed Jesus. What does John have to say? John starts by talking about the presence of Lazarus who had died and had been raised from the dead by Jesus, he was impacted by the fact that a man who was once dead was alive seating with them at the table for Passover. Four same first accounts but different beginnings.\r\n\r\nTheir report is on a woman who came in with an alabaster flask of. Whether she was invited or not we are yet to find out. As she comes in, I don't believe she is noticed until she does something that takes away everyone's breathe. Matthew, Luke and Mark just refers to her as the woman, a sinful woman. John utilizes an interview approach in my judgment to find out who she is. I can imagine him asking \"please give me her name, he discovers that the woman's name was Mary. Different accounts and different stories and how they have been reported give us a better understanding of what really happened. Putting those pieces together gives us a full picture of where they were, whom they encountered with, their names, the incidents etc. Is it possible not to always rely on one side of the story? You figure it out.\r\n\r\nMy first point as I finish part one is, what you have seen and experienced and that has impacted your heart. We are not the same, God has given us individualities that each of us has a way to be impacted and impact others by our stories of life and how He has brought us this far. To be continued.

              "<strong>Matthew 26:7, \"A woman came to Him having a lambasted flask of very costly fragrant oil...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe act of this woman was not rehearsed, practiced, or scripted worship, this was a decision made, action taken to worship Him holding nothing back.\r\n\r\nLet us address a problem that arose while she worshiped. Matthew is very lenient, he brings all the disciples to the same level without pin pointing one person. Read what he says, <strong>\"8 But His disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, \"Why waste? 9, \"For this fragrant oil might have been sold for much and given to the poor\", Matthew 26:8-9.</strong> <!--more-->People’s reaction indicated Jesus was not worthy of this kind of worship. He did not deserve an expensive worship. The truth of the matter is, worshipping Christ will cost you something. That is why we sing, “<strong>We bring the sacrifice of praise</strong>”. Sacrifice goes with surrender. David was given a piece of land to offer sacrifice to the Lord, he refused to take it for free and offered money to buy it. Listen to what he said when offered a land for free<strong>, “Then the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will surely buy it from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God with that which costs me nothing</strong>”, <strong>2Samuel 24:24.</strong> Worshipping the Lord is costly.\r\n\r\nLuke is different, he gets into more details,<strong> \"Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, \"This Man, if He were a prophet, would know what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner\", Luke 7:39. </strong>The moment she walked in, she had already been labeled and despised therefore anything good that she was going to do from then forward was not going to be considered at all. By listening to the Pharisee speak, to him Jesus being in his house gave him an idea that he was a good righteous man. Paul tells us in <strong>Romans 7:18, \"For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh...\"</strong> This sums up the life of human beings that nothing good dwells in the life of man except Christ. To say more, the Pharisee changed his mind about Christ when he said “<strong>This Man, if He were a prophet…” </strong>To him being a prophet suggested handling only a certain class of people. He also had a wrong perception of Jesus, Jesus was more than a prophet.\r\n\r\nTo talk more about the Pharisee, he no longer referred to him as Jesus but this Man. It was no longer Christ but some questioned prophet who could not discern or create boundaries as to who He should be in contact with. Mark responds to people's action differently, he does not mention the Pharisee neither does he mention the disciples, all he says is that some people questioned it. He goes ahead and even talks about the price of the oil to show how expensive it was. He continues to say that they criticized her sharply.\r\n\r\nJohn on the other hand says something about people's reaction; remember John is specific. At first, he identified the woman, and then identifies someone else who questioned the act of this woman. <strong>John 12:4-5, \"4 But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot....said, 5, \"Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?\"</strong> This is having people tell you what you should and shouldn't do when it comes to worshipping the Lord. Judas did not consider Jesus worthy of this worship.\r\n\r\nThis woman Mary had counted the cost of worshipping, she knew it was an expensive worship. She was sacrificing something precious to her, having learnt like David that she will not offer to the Lord what costs her nothing. No one could define how she needed to worship, it was not about the people but Jesus. With that said, who defines how you worship Him? When you worship, is it costing you? Are you giving the Lord what is LEFT (remaining) or what is RIGHT (just)? To finish Be blessed Evans\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/i-reported-what-impacted-me-part-1of4-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">I Reported What Impacted Me, Part 1of4, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/a-true-worshiper-of-god-part-1of2-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">A True Worshiper Of God, Part 1of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/i-must-exalt-christ-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">I Must Exalt Christ, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Matthew 26:7, \"A woman came to Him having a lambasted flask of very costly fragrant oil...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, John tells us exactly who asked the question. <strong>John 12:4-5, \"4 But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot....said, 5 \"Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor</strong>?\" If you know the story of Judas, he was the man who betrayed Jesus. Jesus knew him all along but still allowed him in. He knew that he was a thief yet the money collection bag was entrusted in his hands. Question, did he really care for the poor? John says that he did not and it is also a clear indication that He did not care about Jesus receiving this kind of worship. Something to ponder on, didn’t Jesus know everything that was in the hearts of the people in that room? It was just a matter of time before the hidden would be revealed. <strong>True worship will always reveal what is inside</strong> and when revealed, either you deal with it or cover it up. <!--more-->Remember that everything was fine until the woman showed up and began to worship, then real hearts, agendas and desires were revealed in that little time. Before Abel won the attention and the affection of God, Cain was all right. The moment Abel did that which was pleasing to Lord, Cain had an attitude which led him to kill his own brother. David was a man after God's own heart, the favor of the Lord was upon him, that created a problem for Saul. As you know, Saul constantly tried to find ways to kill David. This is how real worship will reveal what is in your heart and the heart of the people around. David danced and worshiped the Lord and suddenly Michal, Saul's daughter despised him when he worshipped.\r\n\r\nBesides the woman’s worship creating a problem, there was another thing the people had problem with<strong>, Luke 7:48-49, \"48 Then He said to her, \"your sins are forgiven 49 \"and those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, \"Who is this who even forgives sins?\".</strong> Where were these people when John the Baptist said, <strong>\"Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world</strong>\"? Jesus also said, \"<strong>The Son of Man has the power to forgive sins\". </strong>We must get to know Him before we can love Him, and we must love Him before we can desire to obey Him something these people lacked.\r\n\r\nIn the whole story reported by the four gospels there is one common denominator, the star of the show to which none of them strayed away from in the story is JESUS the one whom we worship. Everything told in the story centered on Him. He is the reason why what was in the hearts of men revealed. He knew everyone in that room and what was in their hearts. We don't hear Him in the story asking to be worshiped or demanding, but when one of His own come in and did it, He was moved. She lifted Him from the earth. <strong>John 12:32, \"And I, if I be lifted from the earth, will draw all men unto me\".</strong> I don't know who might have been impacted, challenged, convicted, and inspired by what happened in that house. Jesus said that what the woman did would be preached on forever.\r\n\r\nI am blessed to know that someone reported something that did not only impact them, it has also made an impact in my life. Just when I would think I finally got it, He reveals to me that I am not there yet. Your testimony can be an impact, your worship can do the same, and your service. Remember that He is the common denominator in your story. What you do for the Lord may sound silly and foolish but before His eyes, it's very significant. To close, <strong>your life in Christ is a story being recorded to be reported, the question is, who gets the credit? I hope Jesus does, blessings Ev</strong>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/i-reported-what-impacted-me-part-1of4-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">I Reported What Impacted Me, Part 1of4, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/a-true-worshiper-of-god-part-1of2-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">A True Worshiper Of God, Part 1of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/the-lord-magnifies-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lord Magnifies..., Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Matthew 26:7, \"A woman came to Him having alabaster flask of very costly fragrant oil...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAll the four gospels say the woman came in with an alabaster flask of very costly spikenard. Mark adds, \"…<strong>Then she broke the flask</strong>...\", <strong>Mark 14:3</strong>. This woman who John tells us is Mary teaches us what worship is all about. The fact that she broke the flask has a lot to say about worship. In church it is easy to be cool, calm, and collected, and by that I mean, it’s easy to control how you worship. That is like opening a flask and pouring the amount of oil you want to pour out and closing it back. You have the power to control what comes out. A broken person is like the flask (jar) with no time to control. <!--more-->You break a jar with liquid in it, it's impossible to control the flow, you cannot even collect what has been poured out however hard you may try. You cannot save what you have broken but He can. If you open it then I assure you that you can save it. Anything you carefully open may be something you are not ready to lose. What comes out of something broken does not stay in one place, it spreads out finding paths to flow in. Is this not the case with worship, it flows freely from a broken heart, <strong>Psalm 34:18, “The LORD is near to those who have a broken heart, And saves such as have a contrite spirit”</strong>. They are not ashamed to look foolish worshipping the Lord, they do not care about who sees them and what they say about their style of worship. They are just glad that Jesus saved them when they were a wretched sinners and this is their way of showing gratitude to the One who deserves all worship.\r\n\r\nHere comes Luke telling us more of what she did. Of all the people that were in that house, Jesus was the one who deserved to be worshipped. Instead of the rest learning and joining the woman in worshipping, they got caught up in what she was doing. <strong>Luke 7:38, \"and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with her tears, and wiped them with her hair and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil\"</strong>. Doesn't sound like a woman who is cool, calm and collected, sounds like a woman who is ready to do whatever it took to glorify the Son of God regardless of those around her. We tend to be cautious of those around us when we worship, we may even be tempted to stop someone who is pouring him or herself to the Lord because we are uncomfortable with the way they worship. Everyone wanted to stop this woman from what she is doing, however Jesus did not kick her away or ordered for her to be taken away because He loved the worship. She gave all she had and then some when no one else could. What more does John tell us to impact us, <strong> \"...And the house was filled with fragrance of the oil</strong>\", <strong>John 12:3</strong>. Her act changed the atmosphere of the house, her worship drew everyone's attention to herself but to Jesus because I believe many saw how they had walked with Jesus they never worshipped the way He should be worshipped.\r\n\r\nWhat does this very simple woman have to teach us about worship? <strong>Brokenness leads you to give all.</strong> Anyone around you shouldn't define how you worship. Only Jesus deserves worship. What you give could be a fragrance that would fill the room affecting everyone and impacting everyone. To continue.

              "<strong>Mark 5:21-43, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn school, sentence punctuation was huge. A sentence can have same wordings, how you punctuate it can change its meaning. I have been misunderstood through emails by the way I punctuated my sentences to an extent that what I meant was not how it was received. With this in mind, God has given us His word, how we punctuate His word will make it sound how we want it to or we choose to stick with what the Author intended for it to be punctuated. Do not put a question mark where God puts a period, and do not put a period where God puts a comma. If there is a period, it is a done deal we can move on to the next thing. If He puts a comma, there is a short pause for there is more to come.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJesus was doing good as always. He came to seek and to save the lost, on the other hand, He was teaching, providing for His followers and healing those who were sick. On one particular day, He had just healed a demon possessed man and before long there came a man to Him a ruler of synagogue by the name of Jairus. He was a Jew, and if you read different passages, Jesus being a Jew was rejected by His own people for the bible says, \"<strong>He came to His own but His own received Him not\"</strong>. Another passage says, <strong>\"a prophet is not honored and welcomed in His own town\", </strong>referring to His people the Jews. What really prompted this man, a ruler to come to Jesus against all odds? We will find out. <strong>Mark 5:22-23, \"... And when He saw Him, he fell at His feet and begged Him earnestly, saying, \"My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay hands on her, that she may be healed</strong>\". We see he had a serious emergency, a life at stake, almost lost. Why not ran the girl first to seek treatment elsewhere? Did he not forget that his people always had a problem with Jesus? what would people say if he went to Him? when you are in need, no matter what people think or how you have always been perceived by other people, you will lay a side your pride and ego and look for help. When you know your help can be through a church, what people think will not stop you from getting help there.\r\n\r\nWhen the Master received the message, He started a journey to meet this girl because this man had faith in Jesus to heal his daughter. Now Jesus had a great multitude after Him, even with that He left to rescue. <strong>Mark 5:24, \"So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him\". It was like Jairus had called 911 and help was on the way.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe first 4 verses talks about Jesus encountering with Jairus, everything seemed to be going as planned, Jairus must have been excited because the Lord was willing to come, however in vs. 25, the story takes a different turn and begins to focus on someone else referred to as the woman with the issue of blood. She had heard about Jesus, she knew her condition, she was not worthy to be around anyone for she was considered unclean. She had been in her condition for 12 years, she had spent much on worthless physicians and here she hears about the greatest healer and she believed she could be healed too. She reaches out and touches the hem of His garments as she had faith that just touching His attire was enough to get her healed. At that point Jesus stops to find out who touched Him. What do you think must have gone through Jairus mind? what do you think his reaction towards the woman who had stopped Jesus from reaching his daughter in bed dying? What would your reaction be if you called 911 and as the paramedics were coming to your rescue, they stopped somewhere else to help someone? <strong>This is an interruption that causes delay that opens doors to frustrations that test your faith as you learn patience and trust. </strong>Hope this sentence makes sense to you as it does to me. Think about this situation and connect it with yours as I continue in part 2.

              "<strong>Mark 5:21-43, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe first 4 verses from vs. 21 concentrated on the man with a sick daughter, the next 10 verses takes a turn to concentrate on this woman with the issue of blood. In reading the story, we can conclude that it wasn’t a quick stop, in vs. 35, <strong>\"While He was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue's house who said, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?” </strong>This is not news this father wanted to hear despite knowing how close his daughter was to dying. Who is to blame for the death of the little girl? Some would blame the woman with the issue of blood, she delayed Jesus from reaching the sick girl. Some would blame Jesus, they would argue that He should have set His priorities straight. The bible says in<strong> Isaiah 55:8, \"for My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, \" says the Lord\". To you He may have delayed, to Him, He is always on time.</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHow we perceive and look at things may not be the same way God looks at them. Instead of praying, \"<strong>Lord see it the way I see it</strong>\", we ought to pray, \"<strong>Lord let me see it Your way</strong>\"<strong>. </strong>Stick with the Master through it all. This man had hopes when the situation was still bearable until he learnt that his child was no more. People also discouraged him from bothering the Teacher because it was too late according to them. <strong>What we call over and finished may not be what God calls it</strong>. Here are people who had changed God's word by putting a period where the Lord was putting a coma. You may have thoughts that He has limited abilities based on what you have heard, you might think this is beyond His league.\r\n\r\nCould it be possible that Jesus decided to delay because He wanted to perform a greater miracle beyond just healing? <strong>The bigger the miracle, the greater faith. </strong>The bible says, <strong>\"whatever is impossible with man, is possible with God</strong>\". Can we say He forgot? A person who is all knowing can never forget. Can we get to that level where we see God as He is and not as we perceive Him to be? Jairus might have only seen Jesus as a healer (where he placed a period) and so were the people who came from his house, however the bible says in <strong>John 14:6, \"Jesus said to him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life”</strong>. In <strong>John 1:4, \"In Him was life, and the life was the light of men</strong>\". I look at life as the ultimate thing that no man can create. God has allowed man to do wonderful things, to create life (and salvation) or restore life from the dead is His job. If Jesus has power to give life, shouldn't that be an indication to us all that there is nothing impossible with Him? Someone is frustrated because they called on God when their situation was still bearable but nothing happened. Please understand that God is still able, more than able for His ways and His thoughts are not our ways and thoughts. If you have something you trusted Him with but died before He reached them, Remember, <strong>it's not over until He says so</strong>.\r\n\r\nTo someone it may be over, to God it is just a beginning of greater things. Jesus therefore said, <strong>Mark 5:36, \"...Do not be afraid; only believe</strong>\". Jesus took Jairus back to the faith he had when he first approached Him. <strong>It is faith that activates the power to do the impossible</strong>. God will do His part but you and I have to do our part, have faith. No need to be frustrated with someone else because they received their blessings before you even though you asked of Jesus first. No need to be frustrated with Jesus because He did not come when you called on Him, the bible says, \"<strong>He has made all things beautiful in His time</strong>\". Beautiful things are not disappointing things but joy giving things. Just be glad He has not said it is over and left. Don’t put a period where Jesus put’s a comma. To finish!! Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/01/not-over-until-he-says-so-part-1of2-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Not Over Until He Says So, Part 1of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/what-are-signs-for-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">What Are Signs For?

              "<strong>Mark 5:21-43, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”</strong>\r\n\r\nIf the Lord had not been on my side, I would have been consumed. His presence always assures me that everything will be fine even if I don't see it. I don't have to understand it, all I have to do is only believe, All things are possible with God. My faith is not so much grounded on “He will”, may faith is grounded on “He can”. It does no matter whether He did not appear when I really needed Him, all that matters is that He is here now and nothing is too difficult for Him. Instead of accusing Him for not coming in time, we should say, \"<i>Lord we are glad You are here\"</i>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mark 5:38, \"Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who wept loudly\". </strong>Do not act like you don’t have no problem. Admit that you have a problem but confess that there is a way<!--more--> out. I believe that wherever there is an entrance, there will be an outlet, all we need to do is find it. <strong>Admitting is recognizing there is a will to change</strong>. Now Jesus did not come to have a funeral service, He came to do the impossible. <strong>Mark 5:39, \"When He came in, He said to them, Why make this commotion and weep? the child is not dead, but sleeping\". </strong> Was Jesus naïve to really see that this child was dead? If Jesus is life, this was no match to Him, He compares it to sleeping. The mourners were looking at the natural, they were not seeing that the One who conquered death and had power over the situation. It was as if to say to them, \"I <i>wish you would see what I see, you see it as dead, I'm seeing it as an opportunity to perform a miracle\".</i> May the Lord give us the eyes (faith in God) to see things as He sees them.\r\n\r\nThe problem today is that we hang out with people who don't believe and they speak discouragements in us saying, \"<i>there is no way it will happen</i>\", sooner or later we believe a lie. Jesus had the same people surround Him and He knew them. He closed out everyone who made fun of the miracle to be done and only brought to the inner circles those who had faith to believe. <strong>Mark 5:40, \"And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with Him, and entered where the child was lying\". </strong>Surround yourself with people who will boost your faith over your need. Share with them what your need is, let them assist you pray over it by faith.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mark 5:41, \"Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, \"Talitha cumi,\" which is translated, \"Little girl, I say to you, arise\". </strong>Two wonderful things I picked from this line, Jesus not only wants to do something in our lives, He wants to touch us too. His touch brings warmth and assurance. Go to the hospitals, you will see that most patients just need someone to either hold their hands or just hold them. The second thing from this line, He did not speak about the girl, but He spoke to the girl. I don't know who can speak to a dead thing and it hears him, only Jesus can. However dead the situation is, if He speaks, the dead thing will hear His voice. We speak to people and animals that can hear us and they do what we say sometimes, Jesus speaks to that which does not exist or if it exists, no matter if it's alive or dead and has ears or no ears they will still hear His voice. He is so awesome. I will not even share the outcome of the story, there is nothing impossible with Him.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm I saying as I conclude, It's not over until God says so. He is the God who keeps time, strive to see things the way He sees them, and know that there is nothing impossible with Him.

              "<strong>Daniel 1:6-7, “6 Among these were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 7 The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego”</strong>\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare wrote, “A rose by any other name is still a rose.” When it’s all said and done weather it’s a Hybrid Tea, a Grandiflora, a Floribunda, a Landscape rose, a Climbing rose, a Miniature rose, a Standard Tree Rose, a Patio Tree Roses, a Miniature Tree Rose, or an English rose, “A rose by any other name is still a rose.” Shakespeare’s words ring true in light of trying to change a name, does not equate to an identity change. <!--more-->When Daniel and his friends were exiled into the ungodly land of Babylon the Prince of the eunuchs whom God would bring Daniel into favor with tried to really make the young Hebrew men adjust to their new pagan surroundings. The Hebrews had to adapt and learn a different language, a different culture, different literature (stories/heroes), a different dress (clothing / outerwear), and now they were even being given different names. Weather knowingly or unknowingly I believe this was an attempt to tamper with the very nature and identity of these young men. After all as the old saying goes, “when in Rome do as the Romans do.” Well it seems this is precisely what those overseeing the Hebrews were trying to do; when in Babylon, do as the Babylonians do.” These Hebrews came in with Hebrew names, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, but The chief official gave them new names….” It seems apparent that this name change was not one whereby the Hebrew men were consulted. Consider the Hebrew name they had and what it meant as opposed to the Babylonian name that was pronounced upon them, and the meaning it held.\r\n\r\nDaniel means “<strong>God is my judge</strong>” and his name was changed to Belteshazzar, which means may Bel (an Assyrian god) protect him. Hananiah translates to “<strong>Yahweh has shown grace</strong>,” or “Whom Jehovah hath favor,” yet his Babylonian name change was Shadrach, “a Sumerian or Elimite moon-god”. Mishael is interpreted as “<strong>Who is what God is</strong>,” and he was given the name Meshach, which “ironically” stands for “Who is what Aku (a pagan god) is”. Lastly Azariah is equivalent to “Yahweh has helped, yet his alias became Abednego “servant of Nego (a pagan god)”. These men were Yahweh followers to the core, even though their names were altered. The Babylonians may have changed everything outside about them, but nothing on the inside could be tainted. Remember the key verse from <strong>Daniel 1:8,</strong> <strong>“But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself…</strong>,”was the desire within not to be defiled and that desire was lived out the entire time they were on ungodly terrain. <strong>Romans 12:2</strong> tells us, “<strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”</strong>\r\n\r\nBabylon (a type of the world) will try and change you and make you one of its disciples, conformed to its ungodly image. No matter what this world calls you, and how it identifies you, remember your name, Christian, follower of Christ. That name doesn’t hold much weight with the world, but that’s fine, because who are you trying to please anyway. These young men had the help and favor of God who their judge. They served the matchless, unchanging God whose name is Yahweh, Jehovah, the Ancient of Days. Know who you are in Christ, a saint, NOT a sinner; a holy child of God, not an unholy worthless life. Many Christians don’t recognize their name, their nature, their identity in Christ, and that works against them. Today know who you are in Christ.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: No matter what the world calls you, remember that God calls you His child. Now live unashamedly for Christ that purchased you by His own blood.

              "<strong>2Kings 6:17, “And Elisha prayed, \"O LORD, open his eyes so he may see.” Then the LORD opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha”</strong>\r\n\r\nRemember driving down the road on a hot day and seeing the illusion of water on the road created by the heat? Many times our eyes are not actually the reality of truth and if we can be fooled physically, how much more can we be fooled in our spiritual eyesight? Read <strong>2Kings 6:8-18</strong> for the full picture.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>The first component to having eyesight like Elisha is to have a reputation of having godly insight. (see v. 11-12) </strong>Elisha had a reputation of godly insight among both the godly (King of Israel) &amp; the ungodly (the servant of the Aramean king). How did Elisha gain this reputation? It wasn’t through bragging about his spirituality but through spending time with God as prophets had to do if they were to prophesy God’s word. The only way to obtain a reputation of having godly insight is by spending time with God. Look at how our thoughts (mindset) lead to our destinies: “<strong><em>Whoever sows a thought, reaps an action; Whoever sows an action; reaps a habit;, Whoever sows a habit; reaps a lifestyle; Whoever sows a lifestyle; reaps a destiny</em></strong><em>.</em>” If the prophet was not 100% accurate he would be stoned to death as a false prophet. We cannot cease spending time with God and expect to have a true godly &amp; spiritual reputation.\r\n\r\n<strong>The second component to having eyesight like Elisha is to not to have fear and unbelief, but trust and have faith in the Lord (see v. 14-16)</strong> The Armean king sent an army to capture Elisha by a surprise NIGHT ATTACK! However, Elisha received revelation from God about the attack. You see the eyesight of the ungodly is warped, because they can never see as God sees and what He shows to His servants. Elisha’s servant was nervous as he saw the city surrounded by army of horses and chariots, and therefore asked, “<strong>What shall we do?”</strong> The situation did not look promising and the young disciple I can imagine had “I’m gonna die” in his head. Elisha’s responded by saying “<strong>Do not fear…,”</strong> because Elisha could see the fear pent up inside his disciple. Elisha was saying you’re not to respond to the great army outside in fear.\r\n\r\n<strong>1Timothy 1:7 “For God hath not given us a spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.”, </strong>KJV. Fear is cousins with unbelief, it is the manifestation of unbelief. Many times because WE magnify our situation or problem that it looks bigger than God. Yes the army (problem) was big but the angelic host (God) was bigger!\r\n\r\n<strong>The third component to having eyesight like Elisha is seek the Lord in prayer to gain God’s perspective (v. 16). </strong>Elisha saw God’s revelation, but his young disciple didn’t see it. Elisha interceded that his disciple might see. His prayer was short, specific, and in faith. Elisha saw the angelic host of horses and chariots of fire that his disciple didn’t see, yet it was certainly there! Through prayer, the young disciple gained Elisha’s perspective on things and turned to God’s perspective. The Lord opened his eyes, and he saw the angelic army surrounding them. He saw what Elisha had said, …<strong>those that are who are with us are more than those who are with them</strong>.” As the Scripture says, “<strong>If God is for us who can be against us,” therefore “walk by faith and not by sight.” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Application:</strong>\r\n\r\nMaybe you realize you don’t have a reputation of spiritual insight because you’ve not been spending time in God’s presence. Or perhaps you have been spending time with the Lord, but fear and unbelief have been shrouding your vision and you desire to trust and have faith in the Lord’s provision and protection to gain God’s perspective. Spend time with the Lord as He is the truth, a refuge, and a mighty warrior.

              "<p><strong>1Corinthians 16:13-14, “13 Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. 14 Let all that you do be done in love” </strong></p><p>Society is ever so confused about the identity and the role of men in this day and age. At one time it would seem, they were to only provide for the family, and be strong and rugged individuals. Women were to be at home and submissive to their husbands. Now society seems to want to reverse the roles and identities of the two genders, and desires men to be more feminine, and women to be more masculine with the ungodly women’s liberation movement. In order to look at this issue through the lens of truth, one cannot look through the ever changing winds of this confused society, but rather to the unchanging truth of God’s Word. With that said look at the final instructions Paul wrote to the Corinthian church in his first letter to them.<!--more--></p><p>When looking at the Church in Corinth, “Even by the pagan standards of its own culture, Corinth became so morally corrupt that its very name became synonymous with debauchery and moral depravity. To “Corinthianize” came to represent gross immorality and drunken debauchery.” In Corinth there were men involved with incest (5:1), and the moral depravity was rancid. Paul gives five commands to the Church which includes: be alert (watchful), firm, mature, strong, and loving.</p><p><strong>Be watchful</strong>: Why would Paul instruct them to be watchful and furthermore, watchful of what? Paul used the word <em>gregoreo</em>, which means to stay awake, to be in continuous readiness and alertness to learn—‘to be alert, to be watchful, to be vigilant. If you recall the watchmen on the wall in Ezekiel, the watchmen were supposed to exemplify the tenants of the previous definition and warn the people of an enemy attack so they could be prepared for battle and thus save their lives. However, if the watchman was asleep or failed to do his duty, God would hold the watchman accountable for the blood of His people. How do men stay alert, by staying in prayer and in the Word of God. The Psalmist gives instruction to young men in <strong>Psalm 119:9-11, “9 How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word. 10 With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments! 11 I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.”</strong></p><p>Men cannot be confused on their responsibilities. Men will spend hours watching sports games on television, at the stadiums for these events, but where are the men of God that will say like Paul I count all things as loss as compared to the treasure of Christ. Do you watch so you can keep your life pure? Do you look to God’s Word for strength and direction on how to stay alert? Do you memorize Scripture and quote the Word of God when you are tempted with lust, pride, and envy just as Jesus did (<strong>Luke 4, Matthew 4</strong>)? An average movie is about 2 hours long, and in that amount of time one can read the entire book of John. Yet men make excuse after excuse as to not having time to read their Bibles. Men make time for that which is important to them. Be watchful! Be like Job who said, <strong>“ I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food,\" (Job 23:12).” </strong>Put your Bible before your belly or to say in the vernacular no read no feed!</p><p><strong>Stand firm in the faith:</strong> Continuous holding ground, or hold ground and keep holding ground. Paul again writes from jail, “<strong>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil” Ephesians 6:11.</strong> Men in war must stand their post, fight the battle, and stand against the enemy. Sir, do you stand firm in the faith of Christ? Men get into God’s Word daily, consistently and obey what you read.</p><p><strong>Act like men</strong>: (Gk. <em>andrizomai</em>) is a frequent command in the Septuagint and is used in contexts encouraging people (esp. soldiers) to act with courage and strength in obedience to the Lord and with confidence in His power (<strong>see Deuteronomy 31:6–7, 23; Joshua 1:6–7, 9; 10:25; 1 Chronicles 28:20; Psalm 27:14)</strong>. One might say, MAN UP! Men often choose movies where the man risks his life for a cause greater than himself. Men, risk your life, living dangerously for Christ counting your life as worth nothing compared to living for Him. Paul penned these words from JAIL, “<strong><em>Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord</em></strong> (Philippians 3:8). Sir I ask you, is your heart set more on who is going to win the a national sports events or that you exemplify Christ in your life. You must treasure Christ above all things in your life. If someone were to ask you what the greatest treasure in your life is, would your answer be “CHRIST”? Would those closest to you say that of you?</p><p><strong>Let all you do be done in love</strong>: Love is HARD WORK! The American concept of love is totally backwards, and has more to do with emotions alone than true biblical love. Look at what Jesus said in <strong>John 15:13, “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends” (KJV).</strong> Men would you lay your life down for your wife, your children, your Lord? Become more like Christ by digging in to the Word of God. Read and study God’s Word, and apply it to your life. If you are too busy to spend time with God then He is not your Lord and if so read <strong>Matthew 7:21 – 23</strong>. Love the Lord, love your family, love the lost (your enemies) that they might come to Christ. Preach the Gospel and never be ashamed of it (<strong>Romans 1:16),</strong> stand on it, and stand your ground. I ask, if not now, when and if not here, where? <strong>Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. Let all that you do be done in love</strong>.</p><p>Until the nets are filled…Phil, “The Evangelist”</p><h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6><ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\"><li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/daniel-name-change-not-nature-change-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel: Name Change Not Nature Change, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li></ul>"

              "<p><strong>2Samuel 10:11-12, “11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: may the Lord do what seems good to Him (KJV and ESV combined)”</strong></p><p>When you look at most men on TV sitcoms, the men are portrayed as a bumbling fool, unfit household leader, the brunt of the family jokes, the one most highly dishonored, one that has no influence over his children, and subservient to his wife. Then the guys in the movies are hard, indestructible, and the one that gets a different girl with every sequel of the movie.<!--more--> Hollywood is definitely confused about men and is certainly influential over our society. Ray Comfort shares in What Hollywood Believes, “<em>It is a sad irony that when legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMiller (director of the epc movie the Ten Commandments) first came to California in the early 1900s, he settled in a small town that was giving away free land to anyone willing to build a place of worship. The town, said to be a ‘Christian’ settlement, had a picturesque name – Hollywood. Yet through the years the famous town has come to bear little resemblance to middle America”</em> Just as Hollywood has come far from their Christian heritage, men today that profess to be Christian seem so far from what a biblical man should be. Right off the bat, let me state, that I am not saying one needs to be Christ (the perfect man) that is impossible, nor is the expectation to be Paul, John, Luke, etc…you and I are not them, but our identity should be in Christ.</p><p><strong>Men of trustworthiness – </strong>Although this point deals with a previous verse from the text at hand, it is necessary to bring this into this message because it set the tenor for why Joab was sent to battle. The writer of Proverbs states, “<strong>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble Is like a bad tooth and a foot out of joint (Proverbs 25:19).”</strong> I get frustrated by the lack of faithful men that profess to be Christians. I have found that so many are unreliable when you need them, many don’t stick to their word when they give it. Men that are simply to show up for prayer, evangelism, church service, discipleship, work, etc… when push comes to shove they are not faithful. At one time in American history there was a saying that a man’s word was his bond, how much more should our “yes be yes” and our “no be no?” Men, keep your word, with your family, with your church, with your friends, do what you said you were going to do. When you say you are going to show up, then show up, be there when you say. Look how many women have stepped up in leadership because the men have not been faithful, they have allowed this growing trend. David was able to look to Joab and “<strong>he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men (2Samuel 10:7).</strong> Can your pastor look to you and trust you will step up to serve? Can another mature believer look to you to follow through, to use your area of influence, to use your gifts/abilities to serve when called upon, or perhaps you would even go so far as to volunteer?</p><p>I have heard it said there are five stages in manhood which are: male-hood, boyhood, manhood, fatherhood, and husband-hood. The Apostle John focused on this reality of spiritual maturity when he writes <strong>1John 2:12-15.</strong> He is not actually writing to children, young men, and fathers in the physical sense, but in the spiritual maturity sense. He writes the following: “<strong>12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father. 14 I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one”. </strong></p><p>Many men are still boys (little children) spiritually. Jesus called us to have faith like a child, but not the maturity of a child. Paul gave the Corinthian church a tongue lashing for still being spiritual babies. He wrote, “1 <strong>But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. 2 I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, 3 for you are still of the flesh (1 Colossians 3:1–3).”</strong> There comes a time to GROW UP! Now I recognize in all fairness that people grow at different rates spiritually, similar to physical growth. Some have growth spurts, others have slow steady growth, but all Christians, if they are Christians WILL GROW, and this is inevitable. If a Christian never grows, you can bet that they are not abiding in the vine (<strong>John 15:7</strong>). In moving from boyhood to manhood, I heard it said that taking responsibility is what separates the men from the boys. In our secular culture the man is the one that “gets the most girls,” but God is looking for men that are faithful to Him, their wives, their families, and their churches. <strong>Job</strong> is described in the following manner, “<strong>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil</strong> (1:1).” Do you think he was faithful?, you bet, just read the book and how he was faithful even when his wife told him to curse God and die. I will touch specifically on Job at a later time, as he was truly a man God used.</p><p>You have to begin to be faithful in the little things, so you can be entrusted with more. Glorify God in the little things, and He will allow you to glorify Him with more. The man given one talent was UNFAITHFUL and even what he had was stripped from him and given to another, another that had been faithful with their talents. God has commanded you to daily pray, but do you?; He has commanded you to daily read the Word, but do you?; to share the Gospel, but are you?; to serve, but are you a servant? There are those that want to preach, but has He called you to lead in that capacity? A young Bible college student wanted to preach to crowds on the spectrum of a Billy Graham. I invited him to come to NYC and evangelize on the streets with me and said, let’s see how you do sharing the Gospel with one person first. The guy never even showed up. Whenever I disciple people, I see if they are faithful with the little things, and if not it saves me a lot of time knowing that I will not invest greatly in lives that are not willing to at least be faithful in the little things. If someone shares that they want to learn the Bible, I give a verse to memorize. If they are faithful we move on, if they are unfaithful it displays that their heart doesn’t have the desire that the mouth professes and it is simply lip service. We have too many professing men that are just lip service men. Recall what Jesus said in <strong>Matthew 15:7,8</strong>, <strong>“7 You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: 8“ ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; 9 in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men</strong>.’ ”</p><p>Why did these give lip service, because that is truly what they believed! What you truly believe will come out when the heat is on. Recall the 3 Hebrew boys in <strong>Daniel 3</strong>, that refused to bow, and not knowing the outcome of their commitment. They obeyed God and left all the consequences to him. I preached to a man that threatened to cut me while holding a blade in his hand. Yet I shoved the sword of the spirit into his heart and he walked away convicted having put his blade away. He was cut to the heart by the Word of God.</p><p>Look into God’s Word and read about faithful men, and then examine if you are faithful. Ask those closest to you (wife, children, boss, co-worker), to be Judgment honest with you, and ask if they believe you to be faithful. Ask a faithful, mature Christian to examine your faithfulness. Do you show up at work on time, and then leave when the day is over? Do you cut corners, or do what expected of you, dare I see above and beyond what is expected of you? Do you raise your kids, or are they raising you? Are you the pastor of your home, or is have you shirked your responsibility and allowed your wife the pastor of your home?</p><p>Where are the “Joabs” to call upon now? Men be faithful, be trustworthy, and if need be, grow up. To be continued…</p><p>Until the nets are filled….Blessing Phil, The Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>"

              "<strong>2Samuel 10:11-12, “11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: may the Lord do what seems good to him” (KJV and ESV combined).</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen David heard of the ensuing battle this he sent Joab and all the mighty men against the Ammonites. John Piper shares, “<em>As it developed, the Ammonites were arrayed at the walled city to protect it, the Syrians were gathered in the open field, and Joab, with the Israelites, were sandwiched in the middle. So Joab took charge of one group of men and set himself against the Syrians, and the rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai, his brother, and set them against the Ammonites. In verses 11 and 12 Joab gives this great word of challenge and faith to Abishai…If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you. Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people and for the cities of our God, and may the Lord do what seems good to Him”<!--more--></em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Brother’s Keeper: </strong>I wrote a message years ago, and one which Evans had shared called <em>Brother’s Keeper or Brother’s Killer </em>concerning the question that Cain posed to the Lord (after he killed his brother Abel) when he asked<strong>, “Am I my brother’s keeper\". </strong>The answer to that question should have been answered by Cain himself, and the answer should have been a resounding, yes. However the question was asked as a harsh challenge and I imagine in a sarcastic tone. Men cannot live as islands unto themselves. The writer of Proverbs wrote<strong>, “as iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another man (27:17).” As the proper tool shapes and sharpens iron for its desired use, so a man benefit intellectually and theological through being sharpened by a keener mind and encourages improvement of good character which the face will reveal by their personal friendship. Men need to live the Christian life, and need the kind of conversion mentioned. </strong>Furthermore, men need other men in battle; they do need to be one another’s keeper. Joab was there to help his brother in battle. Israel was in the middle between two armies that desired to destroy them<strong>. </strong>Abishai was sent against the Ammonites; Joab went against the Syrians. Piper shares again saying <em>“It is wise battle strategy, when the enemy is widespread and diverse, that we not engage all the troops in one place. It is also wise to have everyone doing most of the time what they are best at.”</em>\r\n\r\nMen you have perspective, gifts, and talents, etc…, that you add to the battle against the enemy. You need to humbly ask another brother at times to battle alongside you. The enemy has sent attacks on men, and men must band together to fight. It takes humility to ask for another’s help. Many will perhaps pray and ask God for help, but often His body (the church) is the help that He supplies by His good hand. Men fight together, and are to hold one another accountable by and to the Word of God. Men seem to be ferocious in sports (which is temporal), and timid about the things of God (which is eternal). Men can scream at a sports event and this is seen as commendable, but when men get serious about the Lord, then they are deemed a fanatic. Why oh man do you allow the world to set the rules to govern your life? We are far too influenced by our culture and it’s dictates. Yet John write, “1<strong>5 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. 17 And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever”, 1John 2:15-17.</strong> The three temptations listed are the same three that the first man (Adam, <strong>Genesis 3</strong>) disobeyed God concerning, and these same three were the three that the second Adam (Christ, <strong>Matthew 4, Luke 4</strong>) would not fall victim. The temptations never changed, neither did the Word of God, but only one of them held to the Word of God and defeated the enemy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Let US play the men</strong>. The ESV states “<strong>let us be courageous for our people</strong>”. I love the term “US”. There are many that try to be what Tony Miano calls Nomad Christians. These men try to live the Christian life alone; they try to be lone ranger pastors, or nomad evangelists. However, even the Lone Ranger had a sidekick. No Christian is an island, even Christ (not that He had a need) traveled with His disciples. There are so many verses that deal with such terms as “us”, “one another”, etc… how can one possibly be a man of God alone? One cannot obey the Bible apart from the one another verses. The writer of Hebrews commands, <strong>Hebrews 10:24-25</strong> “<strong>24 And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.”</strong> Many Christians assemble (similar to all the pieces in a puzzle box) but they never assemble (putting each piece in its strategically designed location). Men are to play the man at home by taking the lead role as the Bible commands, and loving their wives as Christ loved the church (<strong>Ephesians 5</strong>). Men must train, nurture and discipline their children (<strong>Proverbs 22:6</strong>). As shared previously, as men of God we need to biblically man up!\r\n\r\nExamine yourself; ask others to examine you, especially those close to you like your wife. Then make the necessary changes all for His glory!\r\n\r\nTo be continued…\r\n\r\nBlessings Until the nets are filled…Phil, The Evangelist\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/biblical-manhood-part-2of4-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">Biblical Manhood, Part 2of4, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/biblical-manhood-part-1of4-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">Biblical Manhood, Part 1of4, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

The battles ultimately rested on the shoulders of the Lord, and not on the shoulders of Joab and Abishai. I imagine they fought as if the battle depended upon them, but knowing that <em>the outcome was not really in their ultimate control</em>. Joab urged the army to “be strong” and recognized that the outcome of the battle depended ultimately upon the Lord (cf. 15:26) (John MacArthur).<!--more--> If we believe it, we will proclaim it, and it would seem that the opposite is true as well (<strong>Romans 10:9,10</strong>)! Joab, I imagine was a leader who exemplified faith, and I further imagine that his faith inspired others to have faith (not in him, but in the One who he placed his faith in. As men are we ok with that or must we control every situation? Can we rest assure as has often been said by Charles Stanley, “<em>Obey God and leave ALL the consequences to Him</em>!” Can you surrender to God’s sovereign hand?</p><p>Recall Ezekiel when the Lord asked him, “<strong>And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord God, you know</strong>.” God asks the question, and Ezekiel states, that God knows the answer to the question. He trusted in the Lord’s answer, because God ultimately knew the answer.</p><p>Remember Job, who stood in the midst of pain and opposition and yet spoke the words to his “friends” when he said, “<strong>Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him</strong>(13:14)” Job assured his accusers that his convictions were not self-serving, because he was ready to die trusting God. But still he would defend his innocence before God, and was confident that he was truly saved and not a hypocrite (v. 16). Despite all that he lost, despite all that he experienced personally, and the fact that his so – called friends pounded their advice on him, he rejected their advice, and being in the midst of his situation, made such a resounded trust statement that spewed from the depths of a desperate heart that trusted the Lord.</p><p>By life's end, a 19th century pastor named George Mueller had built five large orphan houses and cared for 10,024 orphans. The entire time, he depended on God's response to his prayer of faith to supply the needs of the orphans in his care. He believed that a man that is happy (satisfied) in the Lord is a man that can trust in the Lord that he finds his happiness in.

Men simply must fix their eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Look at <strong>Ephesians 6</strong> which speaks of the armor of God. Remember Paul wrote that letter from prison and described the armor as he looked upon a Roman soldier and the way they were dressed for battle, in times of peace or war. However, unlike a Roman soldier, many of us will never see live physical military combat, but if you are a man of God you will fight many battles on your knees in prayer. You will fight many battles in your mind when tempted by pride, lust, greed, rebellion against God, anger, rage, etc, as you become conformed more and more into the image and character of Jesus Christ (<strong>Philippians 2:5; 4:8, Romans 8:29).</strong></p><p>How much does Scripture implore us to trust the Lord? I am glad that you asked. I trust in God (Psalm 25:2; Psalm 31:6; Psalm 31:14; Psalm 55:23; Acts 27:25); in God I put my trust (Psalm 56:4; Psalm 56:11); my God, in whom I trust (Psalm 91:2); my eyes are toward you (Psalm 141:8); I have trusted in the Lord (Psalm 26:1); you are my trust from my youth (Psalm 71:5); I trust in the loving-kindness of God for ever (Psalm 52:8); I trust in you (Psalm 143:8); I trust in your loving-kindness (Psalm 13:5); my heart trusts in him (Psalm 28:7); we trust in the Lord (2Kings. 18:22); we trust in his holy name (Psalm 33:21); we are relying on the Lord (Isaiah 36:7); we rely on you (2 Chronicles. 14:11); so that we might trust in God (2Corinthians 1:9); to you I lift up my soul (Psalm 25:1); save your servant who trusts in you (Psalm 86:2); I will trust and not be afraid (Isaiah 12:2); I know whom I have believed (2 Tim. 1:12); God, our eyes are on you (2 Chronicles. 20:12); I will put my trust in him (Hebrews 2:13); we know and believe the love God has for us (1John 4:16); though he slay me I will trust him (Job 13:15); though war arise, yet will I be confident (Psalm 27:3); I believed, even when afflicted (Psalm 116:10); when I am afraid I will put my trust in you (Psalm 56:3). Look to Scripture, and trust in God’s Word doing what it says to increase your faith in Him by His Word.</p><p>Where is the Joab of today?

              "<strong>1Samuel 17:1-58, \"Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself give smooth stones from the brook...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe often run into people with hidden potentials yet to be discovered. In the entertainment industry, people continue to be discovered because of their talents. I have come across stories of people sharing their humble beginnings. Often times you hear about a struggle involving rejections, written off, words spoken that they were not good enough but later they broke through.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nEveryone desires a chance to show what they have within, their talents, abilities, skills, performance, products. A chance to be a boss, husband, wife, teacher, worker etc. People will always cry, \"give me a chance to show what I can do\". Don't we see this in the work force? people see new positions they may not have all the qualifications needed for but they believe in themselves that given a chance, they can do it. <strong>A belief that you can offer something and make a difference can push you to desire a chance</strong>. Our chance as believers is not to show off, but make God look big in the eyes of men. He is already big let's not forget that, this is for the people in the world, we need to show them how Big Our God is.<strong> 2Chronicles 16:9, \"For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself so strong on behalf of those whose hearts are loyal to Him\". </strong>He has given us a chance to show Him so strong.\r\n\r\n<strong>There is a big difference between knowing what to do...and doing what you know</strong>. Most people know what to do but they cannot propel and believe in God in them to do what they could not do themselves. They have potentials hidden. David and Goliath is a story that reveals some things that are vital in our lives. We know David's position, he was a shepherd boy who took care of sheep and smelled like one. Though young, he was good at what he did, faithful in his job. An opportunity arose when his father sent him to the battlefield to bring food to his brothers. We see his obedience in obeying his father by doing what he asked him. It’s not indicated if he loved to take care of the sheep when his brothers were soldiers in the army, all we know is that he knew his job pretty well. He was faithful and obedient in doing so. You may not like what you do, but can you be still good at it, faithful and obedient while trusting God to elevate you in due time? I believe God sees our attitude in what we do and if we cannot be content first with where we are, we will not be content when we move to.\r\n\r\n<strong>1Samuel 17:20, \"So David rose in early in the morning... and took the things and went as Jesse (his father) had commanded him\". </strong>God was orchestrating David’s ways. He did not know what awaited him. He may have never seen himself beyond being a shepherd boy but his obedient led him to serve his superiors (his brothers) without murmuring or complaining.\r\n\r\nWhen He came to the battle field, he found the battle was a stand still, he left what he brought with the supply keeper, ran to the battle ground to greet his brothers. While there, he hears Goliath sending threats to the Israelites. David had just learnt that no one including the king had the capability of facing this giant. David seeing an opportunity inquired and they rehearsed to him what will happen to any man who can kill Goliath. It's like hearing, a job description and the benefits. The job is to kill Goliath, benefits are great riches, a hand of king's daughter in marriage and exemption from taxes. What an opportunity but who is he? what chance does he have? And who will be the hero in the story?

              "<strong>1Samuel 17:1-58, \"Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe bible is interesting in the sense that it could take time and dwell on something, fully describing it. Here is an example, <strong>1Samuel 17:4, \"And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath from Gath, whose height was six cubits and spans\" </strong>through vs. 7 the bible describes nothing but how the giant was dressed for battle. The bible wants us to see something about this man. Just reading how equipped he was, I can see why the Israelites were afraid of him. This is no ordinary sizable man. I wondered why the bible wouldn't just say he was a giant and a champion. I believe the Lord wants us to know that our enemy is not a wimp as many may think. He is prepared for you and I at any given moment. Goliath was more qualified, trained, prepared, ready, equipped, eloquent, developed, sophisticated, protected, confident, threatening and a fighter, what chance did David have? All the trained men, who have all that it takes to battle could not face the giant. I even wondered why the bible did not even take time to describe how Saul was dressed for the battle.<!--more--> The Lord would have us know that no matter how big, strong and well prepared the enemy might be, our stand is in <strong>1John 4:4, \"ye are of God, little children for you have overcome them: because for greater is He that is in you, that he that is in the world\". </strong>You might stand at a place looking at the position God called you too and you see how it is prepared with its requirements. What you see may scare you because you don’t see yourself matching it. If you know who you are in Christ and Christ brings you to see what you did not even ask for, that is a sign that He will qualify you to overcome it. I have seen this work in my life, God brought me to something that I wasn't even qualified, the description showed me how my Goliath was dressed but <strong>\"God is not a respecter of persons, He is a respecter of principles</strong>\". If God brought you to this point, believe that He will take you to that point, <strong>Philippians 1:6, \"Being confident of this very thing, that He which has began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is the concept David learnt when the rest could not, and with that in mind he set himself to fight the giant and the first obstacle was his brothers. <strong>1Samuel 17:28, \"Now Eliab his older brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was aroused against David..\" </strong>Sounds familiar? not everyone is ready for your progress, some may say, \"there is no way you can make it\", \"there is no way you can have that position\", \"there is no way you can change that department\", \"you have nothing it takes to make a change, look at us who are more qualified and should do it but we are not because we are unable\". To make the matters even worse, the brother accused him of coming to watch the war, accused him of pride. He was reminded of where he belonged, in the wilderness with the sheep. What would you do if you have believed in God to make it then you have someone in the church, in the home, a friend discourage you? they speak death into you saying, \"there is no way you can make it?\". David would have said, \"well you are right, I will pack up my stuff and go home\". This was not his attitude, if he went back home, that would mean he couldn't trust God enough. Already he knew that he did not come to the battle ground to watch yet he was accused of it, he then begins to see that God set him up for something he was not aspiring for. He knew he had a chance to show God so strong among His people.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself this question, maybe you were not looking to be somewhere but God graciously brought you to that place. You know your limitations, you have things and people trying to discourage you from doing what is right, something that will bring honor to His name. You have a chance to make a difference, you know who is in you, what will you do about it? Is your desire to have a chance?

              "<strong>1Samuel 17:1-58, \"Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nHere was a man with one cry, “give me a chance”, <strong>1Samuel 17:32, \"Then David said to Saul, \"Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with the Philistine</strong>\". David made up his mind to please the Father. Everyone including the king did not feel David was ready for he was young, inexperienced, no training on war, but God readied him for this battle. Him and God were majority.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 38, \"So Saul clothed David with his armor...\". </strong>You can't fight in someone else armor, <strong>BE YOURSELF, </strong>use what you know works for you because you have tested and proven them. Saul thought that since Goliath was equipped and ready, trying to dress David in his armor would do the same. All David needed was his point of reference (what God had done in his life) and what God was going to do if he remained himself in the Lord. David could not fight with what he had not proven neither can we.\r\n\r\n<strong>1Samuel 17:40, \"Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook...\". </strong>This is the core message. David took his staff, not any ones and went to the brook and picked out five smooth stones. There is a great significance in what he did, the <strong>stones represent good skills to win a battle</strong>. He picked them from a brook. The bible says,<strong> \"you shall be like a tree planted by the waters”</strong>, Elijah was brought to a brook, The bible says, \"<strong>Jesus is the living water</strong>\", \"<strong>out of your belly shall flow rivers of life\".</strong> This shows that David was picking what he needed from a place that represents going to the Lord. The stones he picked were smooth and polished, well selected. Have you and I picked the smooth stones from the brook of God to overcome? These are talents, abilities, strengths. On your job resume, you talk about your abilities and strengths. The employers tend to look at some of these because they become an advantage to what they are looking for. If you have smooth stones of meeting deadlines, honest, dependable, adaptable and the like, this would add to your qualifications. <strong>You have to pick out your smooth stones to get you anywhere</strong>. What are your smooth stones? David picked his from the brook. Where do you get yours from?\r\n\r\n<strong>1Samuel 17:45, \"...You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, ...\". </strong>Many believe that the stone brought Goliath down. I doubt it, I believe what David spoke to the giant melted his heart when he showed how God was strong on his behalf. All Goliath now saw was not David but God in David and the stone merely finished the job started. Your smooth stone will only finish the job started by involving God in your affairs. Your confession that you are able through God's help will help you begin the work of overcoming. Your abilities and strengths accomplishes what was began. <strong>We pray give us a chance as long as we know we can truly depend on God to see us through</strong>. David might have not had what was required for the battle in the natural sense but in the spiritual sense he did. Our cry, “Give us a chance and we will show Him So strong before men”.

              "<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”.</strong>\r\n\r\nIts been said that 80-90% of the people who make a profession of faith fall away, I witnessed this first hand when I evangelized. Some never made it to church and some did for a short time. Do you know of souls you witnessed to, led them through sinner’s prayer but still did not see the fruit of salvation in their lives? Well you might say that at least a seed was planted however there is something seriously wrong somewhere we all need to be concerned about and address. I have rejoiced over the ones who stood, I praise God for them but my heart has been troubled over the ones who did not stand and I had to go before God in prayers to find out why. As I began to attentively study the book of <strong>Romans chapter 1-7, 2Samuel 24</strong> and <strong>Isaiah 6</strong>, it became very clear to me why. God was gracious enough to teach me some things. My eyes have been so much opened that I must share with you what I have learnt in the last few years. I came across some of the preachers in the 19th, 20th, and 21st century whose preaching’s God has used to enlighten me. I pray that you will learn something from this series.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTo get us started, it will be beneficial to look at the first line of the scripture <strong>Romans 10:3, “for they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness”. </strong>What causes a person to be ignorant of God’s righteousness? When he does not truly know God. The world has their own perception of who they think God is. They have gone even to the extent of creating their own god to suit themselves. Haven’t you heard something like this, “My god would never do that?” I agree, their god would never do that because he is not the God of heaven as described in the bible. Knowing the God of heaven is knowing His TRUE NATURE which is revealed to us through the ten commandments (law). <strong>He reveals Himself in the spirituality of His law</strong>. <strong>That is where His righteousness and perfect purity of character are revealed for men to learn it there</strong>. To be honest, I don’t see the Ten Commandments as laws imposed on mankind to learn and follow, I believe it’s primary work is to reveal to us who God is. You will agree with me that many who are not saved or soundly saved are ignorant of God’s righteousness and with that, they have created a god to suit themselves, a god they are comfortable with. <strong>Proverbs 16:2, “All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the heart”.</strong> I see this a lot when I talk with the unsaved<strong>. </strong>\r\n\r\nAgain, men are ignorant of God’s righteousness when they do not understand His method of making sinners righteous. For someone to be made righteous, they must be living in sin. Sin is the opposite of righteousness. So what is sin? <strong>1John 3:4, “Sin is transgression of the law”.</strong> In other words, it’s an offense against religious or moral law. If we have this definition, then we can say that without the law, there can be no sin. If one breaks the law of God, it causes one to be a sinner. What does the law have to do with what we will be sharing on? because men are ignorant of the righteousness of God when they do not know and understand the laws of God which reveals what sin is. The bible says, <strong>Romans 3:20, “By the law is the knowledge of sin</strong>”. Paul says to us in <strong>Romans 7:7, “…I would have not known sin except through the law”</strong>. Paul tells us that he did not know what sin was until the law of God told him. <strong>So the law tells us what sin is because it reveals who God is</strong>. If I was to use SIN as an acronym, <strong>S</strong>avior <strong>I</strong>s <strong>N</strong>eeded. How can a person be truly saved when they do not really know what sin is?\r\n\r\nOften times we hear the messages of God’s love and mercy. They are powerful messages we all embrace, without them we have nothing at all. At times we hear God’s justice yet we don’t see God’s justice simply because we have never understood what it is, who it applies to and when it ought to be applied. Some feel that God is love and therefore cannot serve justice, that will make Him unjust. The bible says, <strong>Psalm 89:14</strong>, <strong>“Righteousness and Justice are the foundations of His throne</strong>”. He is the God of faithfulness, without injustice, good and upright He is. Lawlessness would not require justice and there can be no government without the laws governing their country. <strong>The law is the primary reason why we have justice</strong>. If there is no law, what shall justice be based on?

              "<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the early chapters of the book of Isaiah, we have some things shown to us. I believe Isaiah was a good man according to men’s standards and with that he would have justified himself. Comparing to other people, you can tell that he was reasonably clean however this is a horizontal standard. If anything we all should look at the vertical standard (God’s) of being good. Being good means being perfect and being perfect would mean you have kept the Ten Commandments perfectly from the time you were born till now. Perfection means it has no crack even a little bit. If you were going to buy a vase or a mirror, one little crack shatters it’s perfection and thus if you kept all the commandments and broke even one at any point, then you become guilty of all for, you have shattered it’s perfection and <strong>James 2:10 says “Whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend it at one point is guilty of all”</strong>. <strong>Psalms 19:7, “The law of the Lord is perfect...”</strong> <!--more-->The Author of the law is perfect therefore when we break the law, it’s not against men but God. Many see their sin as done unto men and it doesn’t look that bad in comparison to men, but look at it from God’s point of view and see how serious it is. For instance, if lying (the 9th commandment) to a child may not sound that serious; if I lied to my wife, I’m in trouble; if I lied to my boss, I could lose my job; if I lied to the government, I could go to jail; if I lied to God… It’s who you lie to that determines how big or small the punishment.\r\n\r\nWhat Isaiah saw in Isaiah 6 was not a bunch of laws being imposed on him but God displaying His righteousness before him. <strong>Romans 14:17, “For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost” </strong>Something had to die in Isaiah’s case and all he was left with was to see God in His glory, holiness and righteousness. The light of His righteousness exposed the deep sin that was in his life hence he could not justify himself in God’s presence. <strong>Until people see the righteousness of God, they will never see their sin in its true state because they will be ignorant of it</strong>. The righteousness of God is what plows the hard heart, turning the soil of the heart and softening it for the gospel. What triggers men to see the righteousness of God? <strong>When the law of God is read to them</strong>. When it’s read, it takes away the ignorance men always had and either it accuses or excuses them. Charles Spurgeon, the prince of preachers said, “<em>The law, when it comes into the heart, it shows us how very black we are. Some of us see that we are sinners. It’s very easy to say it. The word “sinner” hath only two syllables in it, and many there be who frequently have it on their lips, but who do not understand it. They see their sin, but it does not appear exceedingly sinful till the law comes. We think there is something sinful in it; but when the law comes, we detect its abomination. Has God’s holy light ever shone into your souls? Have you had the fountains of your great depravity and evil broken up, and been wakened up sufficiently to say, “O God! I have sinned?”, Now, if you have your hearts broken up by the law, you will find the heart is more deceitful than the devil”</em><strong>. </strong>What Spurgeon is saying is that the law has to break the heart that the holy light of God’s righteousness may expose the sin inside. The laws draws the curtains of the holy of holies and all that you thought was not there or you thought you took care of is revealed. To use Ray Comfort’s analogy, You are wiping your coffee table in the morning, the table looks nice and clean. When you draw the curtains for the early sunrise to come in, what will you see in the air, dust; on the table you cleaned, dust. Did the light create the dust? Not really, it merely exposed what you and I could not see with our naked eyes. It’s by the help of the light that we saw that the table needed thorough cleaning and so is with the light of God’s righteousness exposing our sinful state, the hidden stuff. <strong>The law does not create sin, it merely exposes</strong> what we might have not thought was sin, what is hidden deep within and shows the seriousness of breaking the law.\r\n\r\nIt’s safe to say that a person knows he or she is a sinner and yes he or she might confess that he or she is a sinner but he or she will not see his or her sin as exceedingly sinful then desiring to be made right until the curtains are drawn back and His light of the law shines through<strong>. </strong>Listen to what Paul is saying in<strong> Romans 7:8, “… apart from the law sin was dead, but when commandment came, sin revived and I died”. </strong>If he had no law, he was righteous but when the law revealed to him his true state, he died cause the law killed his self-righteousness. <strong>It wasn’t grace that showed Isaiah his sin, it’s was the righteousness of God through the law that did.</strong> To continue, blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-1of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 1of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/what-creates-thirst-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">What Creates Thirst, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/the-sure-foundation-is-christ-part-2of2-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sure Foundation Is Christ, Part 2of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>\r\n\r\nGod upholds his laws, <strong>Psalms 19:7, “The law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul</strong>”. Charles Finney said, <strong>“</strong><em>God’s righteousness and perfect purity of character are revealed in His law”. The law was designed to call to attention the state of the heart which is the real value in God’s sight</em>” No one is saved by the law, the bible says, <strong>Romans 3:20</strong> “<strong>By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified</strong>”, the law is just the mirror. I have never seen a mirror clean anyone. Charles Finney also said, “<em>Ever more the Law must prepare the way for the Gospel. To overlook this in instructing souls is almost certain to result in false hope, the introduction of a false standard of Christian experience, and to fill the church with false converts…Time will make this plain</em><strong>.\"</strong> And the bible continues to highlight the purpose of the law, <strong>Galatians 3:24, “Wherefore the LAW was our school master to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith”. </strong>To quote CharlesSpurgeon,<strong> “</strong><em>The law cuts into the core of the evil, it reveals the seat of the malady, and informs us that the leprosy lies deep within. Oh how the man abhors himself when he sees all his rivers of water turned blood, and loathsomeness creeping over all his being”</em><strong>. <!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nThis was not a smiling case for Isaiah because never has the law ever painted a good picture. It condemns, leaving you helpless in need of a Savior; it does not justify, all it does is leave you guilty. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE LAW. DL Moody said, “<em>The law can only chase you to the cross, no further</em>”. To further quote Charles Spurgeon, “<em>Having thus removed the mask and shown the desperate case of the sinner, the relentless law causes the offence to abound yet more by bringing home the sentence of condemnation. It mounts the judgment seat, puts on the black cap, and pronounces the sentence of death. With a harsh unpitying voice it solemnly thunders forth the words, \"Condemned already.\" It bids the soul prepare its defense, knowing well that all apologies have been taken away by its former work of conviction. The sinner is therefore speechless, and the law, with frowning looks, lifts up the veil of hell, and gives the man a glimpse of torment. THE SOUL FEELS THAT THE SENTENCE IS JUST, that the punishment is not too severe, and that mercy it has no right to expect; it stands quivering, trembling, fainting, and intoxicated with dismay, until it falls prostrate in utter despair. The sinner puts the rope around his own neck, arrays himself in the attire of the condemned, and throws himself at the foot of the King's throne, with but one thought, \"I am vile\"; and with one prayer, \"GOD BE MERCIFUL TO ME A SINNER</em>.\" Isaiah felt the same way and said “<strong>woe is me, for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips</strong>”. Though people take the laws of God lightly, God values His laws. His righteousness is not cheap and reduced to man’s level. <strong>Check out what it cost Him to redeem the law breakers and you will understand the values of His laws</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 3:23,</strong> is frequently used in witnessing<strong> “For all have sinned…</strong>” yes we have all sinned but look at Isaiah’s response, <strong>he first acknowledged his personal sin before the corporate (Woe is ME)</strong>. I believe that as long as sinners put their sins as corporate, they will never see their sins as exceedingly sinful. The law makes the sin abound (exceedingly sinful) shutting one’s mouth without any avenue of justification. <strong>Romans 3:19, “Now we know that whatsoever the law says, it says to them that are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God\"</strong> I can see Isaiah’s mouth being stopped as he sees himself guilty before a holy God. I’m not sure if many people I witnessed to back in the days saw the righteousness of God to stand and declare their guilty state before God and not me. To make this point clear, here is an analogy I love by Ray Comfort, I'm driving on the highway doing 75mph on a 55mph, it feels good and looking around me, everyone is doing it. Though I know it's wrong, it doesn't sound or feel wrong when I am going with the flow. As I continue to drive, suddenly the law (cop) makes his way in my lane flashing his lights. All of a sudden I can’t believe that I am doing 75mph when I should be doing 55mph. My conscious accuses me because God gave me one to show when I am doing wrong. He stops me and now I have to answer to the law. What made me feel bad about what I was doing? It’s when the law showed up and it showed me how serious it was to break it, and now my sin abound becoming exceedingly sinful. It was sin when I saw what I was doing, but it appeared to be more serious when the cop showed up. At this point either I am going to use an excuse that everyone is doing it or my mouth is stopped and I plead for mercy. Finney said, <strong>“</strong><em>hence God must bring them first under a felt sentence of death (under the law), but this does not make them righteous, it only prepares the way of bringing them to Christ”</em>. This is how Isaiah was stopped; he first talked about his own personal sin then talked about corporate sin. It’s at his point of conviction and repentance that God gave him grace and mercy. The bible says, <strong>“Him that much is forgiven, loves much</strong>” (paraphrased) and this becomes his fruit of salvation. The highway of sin, everyone is doing it, who is not given to lust, stealing, using the Lord’s name in vain? When God’s law makes its way in the fast lane, the sinner observes his conscious speedometer and all it does is accuse or excuse him. The law makes judgment reasonable.

              "<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the case of David in <strong>2Samuel 24</strong>, David sinned by numbering people, he goes before God and asks for forgiveness. I would imagine God easily forgiving him, but not quite yet. I’m in no way saying God wasn’t going to forgive him, I’m saying that God had to first show him <strong>THE SERIOUSNESS OF HIS SIN AND THE COST TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nA boy saw a vase that was priceless at his house. He did not know it’s true value and did not know why his father had placed in the safe. One day as the boy was running around the supermarket to his surprise he saw a vase that looked exactly like the one his father had preserved. Looking at the price tag, it only appeared to be $5. The boy could not believe why his father could value a vase that only cost $5. So the boy went back home and for some unknown reason played around with the vase, dropped it and shattered it into a thousand pieces. He wasn’t concerned because he remembered he had $5 and could just run to the store and buy the one he saw to replace what he broke. That’s what he did and put it back. When his father came home, the boy told his father he broke the vase and that he shouldn’t worry about it because he replaced it. Suddenly the boy looked at the face of his father turn pale why? that vase was not a cheap vase, it was antic worth $25,000 and not $5 as the boy thought. The horror filled the boy’s heart, what he broke and thought he could easily replace was more than what he anticipated. Suddenly fear gripped the boy’s heart, he now understood the true value of that vase, tears filled his eyes and began to say, “I am sorry, I am sorry”. The father seeing how truly sorry his son was said, “Son I see how truly sorry you are because of what you have done, but there is no way you will be able to replace that vase, but because I love you, I will replace it myself”. The boy could not believe what he heard especially his father forgiving him for his disobedience and replacing what he had broken. Joy filled his heart and his desire from now on was to do that which was right and pleasing to his father<strong>. Had the father just forgiven him without showing him the value of the vase and the cost of replacing it, he would have robbed the son the means of contrition, a place of sorrowful heart leading to repentance</strong>. Now I understand that if I bring someone to Christ without showing them the value of God’s law and the seriousness of breaking them, they will not have contrition and a sorrowful heart the very means that lead them to repentance. All they will think is that their cheap self-righteousness will save them on the Day of Judgment and therefore they will not submit to righteousness which is of God.\r\n\r\nLet’s see how this applied to David’s case. <strong>2Samuel 24:10, “…so David said to the Lord, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, I pray, O Lord, take a way the iniquity of Your servant for I have done very foolishly</strong>”. This to me is a very sincere prayer. Sinners make the same prayers if not once, always. Good confession but their confession is not good enough and I will explain why shortly. In the morning, God sends a prophet to bring to David a message to pick out one of the three punishments he had lined for him. The first two punishments involved men and the last which is “<strong>three days of plague in his land</strong>” involves God directly. He chooses to go for the last one because he would rather fall in the hands of God than men’s. Why plague? if you remember God sending the 10 plagues to the land of Egypt, they are like the 10 commandments that plague us. It’s like the prophet brought one of the commandments to plague David. <strong>Sinners have to be plagued by the Ten Commandments, shutting their mouth of justification hence repenting. Without repentance, there can be no salvation</strong>.A quote Charles Finney<strong>, “</strong><em>This gospel plan seems to sinners deep and dark as midnight, till the Holy Ghost reveals to him his self-righteousness, cleaves down that self-righteous spirit, knocks out his props, and HE FALLS DOWN AND DIES!.. THEN THE CROSS REVEALS LIFE, AND HE REJOICES WITH EXCEEDING JOY IN A SALVATION WROUGHT OF GOD THROUGH REDEEMING BLOOD</em>”, to continue, blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-1of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 1of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-2of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 2of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/13/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-3of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 3of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you continue to ready <strong>2Samuel 24, </strong>youdiscover how God plagued David by killing 70 thousand people, while God sent His Son to this world to die for over 6 billion people. If 70 thousand people had to die for someone to be redeemed, we can conclude the sin was not petty. If a judge is to pass a sentence that requires the offender to pay 70 thousand dollars as his fines, we can conclude it wasn’t a petty crime. <strong>Romans 5:8 “God demonstrated his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us”. Christ was the ultimate sacrifice to pay for the fine for law breakers. If the sacrifice was this great, the law broken must be big. </strong><em>D.L. Moody said, “FOR GOD TO CREATE, HE ONLY HAD TO SPEAK; TO REDEEM, CHRIST HAD TO SUFFER (PLAGUED)”.</em> Quick death is less painful compared to suffering before dying. Christ suffered greatly, crushed before dying and that was His demonstration of His love to us. <strong>Isaiah 53:5, “He was wounded for my transgression, He was bruised for my iniquities</strong>”. His sacrifice was not a painless death but a painful death and once again, that was the demonstration of His love.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhipped on the post, a crown of thorns forced on His head, carrying the heavy cross to the mountain, being nailed and the Roman soldier piercing on His side and the greatest of all, the Son drank the cup of wrath given to Him by the Father. The greater news, He came back to life and lives forevermore. The sin was great to make the Son of God to go through all this to make it right. If I want to tell a sinner that God loves him, I will point him to the cross, the demonstration of His love will speak louder than words. The disciples preached the love of God by preaching Christ crucified (sacrifice). <strong>See the confession was good but for the things to be made right, the fine posed on the offender had to be paid by someone</strong>. It’s like telling a judge that you are sorry and he knows you are but the fact remains that a law has been broken. A sentence has been passed and all that the court needs to clear one is someone paying for the fine or going to jail. The offender can’t afford it because we were not redeemed by silver and gold, someone has to pay it on our behalf or we are heading to jail (hell).\r\n\r\n<strong>If the unsaved do not see the seriousness of their sin and that they deserve justice, they are not ready to receive Christ crucified to pay for their fine</strong>. Finney says, “<em>We can now apprehend God’s method of making sinners personally righteous. First He opens the way, by giving us His Son to honor the law, so that God can come down from heaven and enter into a covenant with the sinner and draw him back to life and love. This is God’s method that Christ is received as the sinner’s righteousness, having borne for him the curse of the law, obeying it perfectly, and then suffering in place of the penalty, which the sinner else must have suffered</em>.” Just like the boy who the father revealed the cost of the vase leading him to a place of repentance, so is the unsaved.\r\n\r\nIn the past I rushed the unsaved through the gospel robbing them the very means of seeing their true state that they may personally flee to the Savior for redemption. <strong>WE BROKE THE LAW AND HE PAID THE FINE, IT’S AS SIMPLE AS THAT</strong>. To continue, Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-5of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 5of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-4of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 4of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-1of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 1of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/13/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-3of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 3of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-2of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 2of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe bible says <strong>James 4:6. “God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble”. </strong>The humble will submit to the righteousness of God. Watch this<strong>, 2Samuel 24:17, “Then David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel striking the people, and said, “SURELY I HAVE SINNED, AND I HAVE DONE WICKEDLY; BUT THESE SHEEP, WHAT HAVE THEY DONE? LET YOUR HAND, I PRAY, BE AGAINST ME…”</strong> David was not justifying himself neither was he seeing that he was being rubbed the wrong way, he saw God serving justice over what he did and he understood that he deserved justice and that humbled him. <!--more-->When a sinner sees his sin in its true state and sees that he deserves hell because of God’s justice, he will truly appreciate the sacrifice offered on his behalf. <strong>A sinner will never fully appreciate grace until he understands how exceedingly his sin is and the cost to make things right</strong>. David saw his sin as exceedingly sinful when he was plagued (value of the law) and how many had to die because of what he did (the cost) so is with us, when we understand why Christ had to go to the cross, we will see <strong>the cost to appreciate the sacrifice</strong>. <strong>If a sinner does not understand what he is being saved from, he will not fully appreciate what he is being saved for</strong>. We are saved from the wrath to come. If God is to serve justice on us on judgment day, we will not make it, <strong>Romans 1:18, “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men…” , Hebrews 9:27</strong>,<strong> “God commands everyone everywhere to repent because He has set a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness”</strong>. God’s judgment will be based on righteousness and not happiness as many think and if at all we were never made righteous, He will serve justice. Christ paying for all the laws I ever broke, forgiving me of my sins and Him coming into my life is the means by which I have passed from death to life. On the Day of Judgment, I will only make it because of the righteousness of God through Christ in me. The bible says, “<strong>Christ in us, the hope of glory</strong>”. <strong>2Corinthians 5:21, “For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God</strong>”. He is the parachute that will save me from the sure death and because of that, I have deep joy in my heart.\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 10:3, “for they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God</strong>”. To sum it up, \"Without repentance, there can be no salvation\" and a person cannot see their sin in its true state unless they see and understand God's righteousness. A sinner cannot know God's righteousness unless the law is read to them exposing their self-righteousness that they submit to the righteousness of God.\r\n\r\nIt is not about making decisions and commitments, it's about God’s righteousness exposing my sinful state that I may say like Isaiah, “woe unto me…” and David, “I have surely sinned and done wickedly” then pleading for grace and mercy, desiring the forgiveness of Christ. <strong>God’s law takes away our ignorance of His righteousness and humbles us to submit to His</strong>. So why did I see many fall away from their faith? it’s because the gospel fell on stony ground, aiming for decision rather than repentance. In that case, the seed cannot be blamed for not taking root. <strong>The seed is for a prepared ground</strong> and that is why <strong>Psalm 19:7</strong> does the job of getting the ground ready, “<strong>the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul</strong>”. It empties us of our self-righteousness dangling us before the jaws of hell and we cry to God, <strong>“be merciful to me a sinner</strong>” and He gives us grace to lift us up from the pits of hell. I can now look back and see that the ones who stood, their grounds were already prepared long before I met them and shared with them. They were searching, they had hit rock bottom and all they needed was the Savior’s righteousness to submit to and that is what saved them. How about the self-righteous?, the law will cause them to hit rock bottom, declare them bankrupt and grace fills their empty accounts <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9, “For it’s by grace that you’ve been saved through faith and not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works lest anyone should boast of”. I am glad for what I am saved FOR and FROM. Grace outdoes sin, it lifts us higher than the place from which we fell. The law traces sin up to our heart; grace traces its own origin to God. Grace is the medicine that heals the sickness of sin. </strong>Give anyone medicine when they do not think or feel they are sick and see if they will value and take in the medicine. Show them how very sick they are and they will take the medicine in no time, make use of it and appreciate the sacrifice someone had to go to get the medicine<strong>. </strong>To continue, blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-4of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 4of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-5of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 5of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-2of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 2of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-1of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 1of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/13/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-3of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 3of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>\r\n\r\nGod forgave David and he truly appreciated it as demonstrated by his sacrifice to the Lord. He refused to offer God what cost him nothing. It cost God a lot to bring him out of his sin, he also understood that it will cost him a lot to live for Him. Isaiah’s lips were touched with alive coal of fire and his sins departed, he then heard the Lord say, <strong>“who shall go for us”,</strong> Isaiah was quick to say, “<strong>Here I am Oh Lord send me</strong>”. In other words, if you could do this for me by giving the very best, I will do anything for You. <strong>John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life</strong>” and because of that, I will serve You for the rest of my life. I will be a living witness of Your saving grace. I will stand like Isaiah and say, “<strong>Here I am Oh Lord send me</strong>”. I will offer sacrifices that will cost me. I will not give you what cost me nothing. I will delight to do thy will. The gratitude I may not express in words, I will express in works. I will give you what is RIGHT not what is LEFT. I HAVE SEEN THE COST TO APPRECIATE THE SACRIFICE.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThis study is a reflection of what I have learnt and put in practice. I have found them to be life changing experience to the extent that many that I shared with cried out, “WHAT MUST WE DO TO BE SAVED”. Through biblical evangelism (preaching law and grace), I have seen God soundly save some, my youngest brother and his wife being one of the few examples.\r\n\r\nWe need to be faithful witnesses declaring the righteousness of God. Let His righteousness expose the sin in the unsaved live, removing the ignorance of self-righteousness and bringing them to submit themselves to God’s righteousness. This is all accomplished by God, however, we are God’s instruments to bring about this truth to the unsaved. We are like the Surgeon’s assistant who puts the right tools in the hands of the Surgeon to perform a heart surgery. This will give sinners a chance to cry, “what must we do to be saved?” And then talk to them about repentance and faith. I desire to see people soundly saved and they in turn become soul winners and not pew warmers.\r\n\r\nWith all these, here is the foreseen danger in our time as penned by General William Booth, the founder of Salvation Army. He said, “<em>The Chief danger of Christianity in 20th century will be…Religion without the Holy Ghost; Christianity without Christ; Forgiveness without repentance; Salvation without regeneration; Politics without God; And heaven without hell</em>”\r\n\r\nSad but true, we are living in those times<strong>. “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”, Romans 10:3.

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Job 31:1, \"I made a covenant with my eyes, not to look lustfully at a girl” NIV</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One thing that scares me daily is the thought that I have the ability to sin and sin is constantly knocking on my door. I usually joke about two things I’m allergic to, sin and pain. There are no two things I can think of that have destroyed many men of God like sexual sin and greed. This continues to plague men daily in a sexually charged world and a world of greed. In the age of Internet, TV, movies, magazines, beaches, dressings etc. all around has created a challenge for men and some women in generral, something we call “every man’s battle”. I think that the level of temptations faced by David, Solomon, Samson and others in the past cannot be compared to what we face today and yet the standard of God’s purity for man has not changed and never will. It’s easy to try and poke holes in God’s word to find something to justify sin, however we need to always remember,<strong> God’s word is truth, He has no revised edition to fit our time</strong>. The word was set to address everything in any age. God’s still holds us to the highest standard revealed in the Holy Scriptures.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your true Christianity is not what you display before people; your true Christianity is who you are when no one is around. It’s where your walk is defined and this is a challenge to men in general. <strong>The lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world, are the two fatal rocks on which multitudes split</strong>; against these Job protests he was always careful to stand upon his guard. While Job was facing his trying moments, he reflected on his life and one thing that he mentions is that he made a covenant with his eyes not to look lustfully at a girl (woman). When God allowed Satan to take away everyone and everything from Job, one person Satan wouldn’t touch was his wife. I believe for this reason, the presence of his wife would remind him of the covenant he made to God and to her and that would help him be pure before God and stand through it all. Job made a covenant to be pure before God and honor his wife by keeping his eyes on her and her alone regardless of what came his way. Of course opportunities may have presented themselves to sway him but he kept on remembering his covenant.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How often does opportunities present themselves to you? You may not be looking for trouble but trouble finds you, what is your response? Does your conscious remind you of the covenant you made to your wife before God? To honor God by being faithful to her in thoughts, in words and in deeds? As my pastor would say, men of God must “<strong>Avoid the second look</strong>”, the first look my catch you off guard, the second look is a choice, a responsibility you are accountable for.<strong> How much commitment you show to your spouse shows how much you value purity</strong>. The bible says, “<strong>2Timothy 2:22, “Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure hear</strong>t”. It doesn’t say try and fight it or deal with it, no, you and I must run for our lives. While running from it, we will run towards righteousness, faith, love, peace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I constantly pray that God would be more present in my life and give me power to overcome the lust of flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. That my eyes may be fixed on Him with my wife as a supporting cast. If I pull my eyes from her or if I work an appetite outside my marriage, I will be living in sin and the fear of God will be absent. Read what Job says in looking to God to search his heart in this area,<strong> vs. 9-10 \"9 If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door, 10 then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her”.</strong> What a scary statement but a statement that would hold him accountable to his actions if he did. The thought of someone else lusting after your wife while you lust after other people’s wives (married or not) should scare you to death. Those who are single who may be dating or looking around, be careful on how you treat those women. That could be someone’s wife if not yours (if you don’t get married to her). Those of you who look at stuff on the Internet, on magazines remember those are someone’s daughter and someone’s wife. There are men who say, “<em>you can look at the menu and not order from it</em>”, the Lord has something to say to such men <strong>Matthew 5:27-28, “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ 28 But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart”</strong>. In the OT, they would have looked at committing adultery as the actual act, we Christians under grace in the NT the standard is made clear, the thought is sinful.<strong> Proverbs 6:32, “Whoever commits adultery (lust) with a woman lacks understanding; He who does so destroys his own soul”</strong> Matthew Henry<em>, “Those that would keep their hearts pure must guard their eyes, which are both the outlets and inlets of uncleanness</em><strong><em>”</em></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To make a covenant is to make an agreement. Would you and I make a covenant daily not to look with lust (both married and single men and struggling women\"? To flee lust? To love God and our wives with a pure heart is hard, we cannot do it by ourselves that is why we need to pray to God for grace and strength to overcome the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life,<strong> Philippians 4:13, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”.</strong> If you've stumbled, repent of it and stand for the Lord, blessings Ev</p>"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Matthew 5:48, “Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.”</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is there such thing as perfect Christian in this world full of temptation, sin, evil and error? Can Christians truly and honestly become perfect? Is perfection attainable in this life? Does God truly and seriously expect or want Christians to be perfect? And if Christians can be perfect,<strong> which is the easiest or quickest and sure way to attaining perfection, if it is attainable?<!--more--></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, let me give you simple definition of the word perfect. It simply means; something or someone without error, mistake, or flaws. When we say that something or someone is perfect, we simply mean that, whatever or whoever we are referring to have no default of any kind. So, now, can we say that Christians are perfect? That they do not have any error? Is it possible for Christians to be without mistakes, error, or flaws? Impossible! If so, then why does the Bible instruct us to be perfect, even as our heavenly Father is perfect?<strong> Mathew 5:48</strong>. In James 1:4, for instance, The Bible admonishes the believers to be perfect: “<strong>But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.”</strong> Yes, we are required to be perfect! There is no exemption and no excuse. The onus of attaining perfection is on us not on God. We have the responsibility to avoid and get rid of anything from our life which can or has defiled us, rendering us imperfect before God. This we must do every day and consistently.<strong> That being the case, what is the easiest way of becoming perfect?</strong> Let me answer that by sharing with you a little story</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One day, a young boy went to a Sculptor and asked him “Sir, What do you do if you want to curve an elephant from a log of wood?” The Sculptor answered and said “Son, the fastest and easiest way of curving a beautiful and perfect elephant from a log of wood or any piece of wood for that matter, is to chop off anything from the log that does not look like an elephant. When you are done chopping off, you will be left with a perfect curving of an elephant. To make it more beautiful, you must sand it and polish it. It is as simple as such. The only most important thing you must remember is, you must know how true an elephant looks like.” The boy was satisfied with the answer. From then, he believed he could curve a perfect elephant.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What is the moral of the story? If you want to be a perfect Christian, chop off anything and everything from your life that does not look like a Christian. To do this successfully, you must have a perfect picture of a perfect Christian before you to guide you. Where would you find such a Christian? In the Bible; The Bible reveals who a perfect Christian is or should be. The Bible image is the only image you can compare yours with. You cannot compare yourself with yourself or someone else, as standards of perfection. You are not perfect and there is none perfect. Only God is perfect and He alone can make anyone perfect, if they be willing to listen, obey His Word which, alone, is able to make us perfect. The word will show you what to chop off. Keep chopping until you see a perfect Christian merging out of your imperfect and impure life. It may be painful doing so. It may take a long time. But, be determined and patient. \"<strong>Let Patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect… (James 1:4) God bless you.</strong> Blessings Pastor Boaz</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/we-all-qualify-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">We All Qualify, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/a-patient-of-patience-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">A Patient Of Patience, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2Timothy 3:16&amp;17, \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work\"</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are those days you find you are dragging your feet behind. The moment your alarm clock goes off, you know it's time to wake up and get ready for tasks ahead of you for that day. Your two legs debate which should get out of the bed first. We even drag when it comes to reading the bible and praying. As you are reading the bible, you fall asleep or you get nothing out of it, you pray for two minutes, mumble a few words and fall to sleep. I find it much easier to read other books than read the bible and yet the bible has all I need pertaining to life. It is the book that should be read daily by every believer.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Someone used the B.I.B.L.E as acronym,<strong> Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth</strong>. The bible teaches us who God is, His plan for salvation among other things, it’s been called the instruction book for life, it's also known as the map to treasure. I have watched several movies about finding treasures and what comes to mind before finding the treasure is not how it looks like or its value but how it can be found. Often times people know that treasures are not junks but valuable. I watched this movie, \"Romancing a stone\" depicting a treasure to be found. The main thing that everyone was fighting for was the MAP to the treasure. The map looked so old and torn but it was precious. Does the bible too lead God's people to treasure? of course, God is our treasure. Whether the map is new or old it does not change what it can do. Just as the old map has the path way to a treasure so is the Bible the pathway to God.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By definition, the dictionary says that Bible is the sacred book of Christianity, a collection of ancient writings including both Old Testament and the New Testament.<strong> IT'S AN AUTHORITATIVE BOOK IN IT'S FIELD</strong>. It does not have a mouth but it speaks. It has a voice. The best ever selling book in the entire universe. The book widely translated, the one many are killed for owning and reading it. It's more than a story book, it's a living and powerful book,<strong> Hebrew 4:12, \"The word of the Lord is living and powerful...\",</strong> tested, tried, and proved. We thank God for the witnesses, however It's the book that does not need an attorney or witnesses to prove or authenticate itself. It is able by itself to do so. When the bible was under attack someone asked Charles Spurgeon to do something, his response, “<em>you don’t need to defend a lion. Just turn it loose and it will defend itself</em>”. We need to turn the bible loose. Laws have been written off this book, nations have been saved through this book and many more. It's a very unique book and a book of a kind. Reading one passage over and over again always has something new, a principal to learn from. What a book!!!! We need it, we need to open it, read it, memorize it, learn from it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2Timothy 3:16&amp;17, \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work\".</strong> God in times has always used men to accomplish His plan. You've heard me say “God can do anything without any man yet He has chosen men to accomplish what He has in mind for His own glory”. 66 books in the bible were written by men under the inspiration of God. We are told some of the reasons, it is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,<strong> for instruction</strong> in righteousness why?, that the man/woman of God may be complete and equipped in the word. Timothy was advised,<strong> 2Timothy 2:15, \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needed not to be a shamed, rightly dividing the word of the truth</strong>\". In the age of error, false teachings and false doctrines, we need the word.<strong> Joshua 1:8, \"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it</strong>.<strong> For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success\", Psalm 119:105, \"Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path\".</strong> Time fail me to get more into this word but I know that you can see how it is a precious book not to be taken lightly. It's our manual book and map to the treasure. All the answers to your questions are in this book, so take it off the shelf, dust it off and open it, read it. Pray for discipline to read it daily. Don't wait till you get to church and then open it, or when you are in trouble for it is your<strong> Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth.

              "<strong>Revelation 1:3- “Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near”</strong>\r\n\r\nAs I read and as I pray, my thoughts are drawn faithfully to these topics, to the Christians responsibility. It is utter foolishness to doubt God in anyway, He is Faithful and True. But what about us? Are we faithful to Him? Is our heart given over to the Lord? Are we truly seeking God with all our heart? And this is not dead works, but the true desire of my inner being for God alone. Works always follow the one truly born of God, they don’t make you a Christian(see <strong>Matthew 7:21-24)</strong>. John gives us clear teaching here, in line with <strong>James 1:22, Romans 2:13.</strong> It is not the hearers of the word, nor the readers, but the doers that are just in the sight of God. <!--more-->This brings in the question of our faithfulness, if we claim to be His followers, are we following Him? Are we faithful to Jesus? When confronted, do we testify of Him? We refer to prayer, to the Bible, to many things in front of people, but what about Christ? He is the center of all existence, the source of all things, it is Him alone that can save souls, the Bible doesn’t save people, nor does prayer in themselves, only Christ can. Jesus said the one who keeps His word, it is he that truly loves Him. All else is dead religion. Jesus Christ came into the world to make sinful men and women holy as He is holy, not to just make us better and moral. He came that He might be glorified in and through me as I abandon my life to Him, but I often wonder how many have truly come to Him this way. But this is the only way. I must lose my life if I will gain His.\r\n\r\nFriends, the time is near, Jesus is coming. Paul tells us in <strong>Ephesians 5:27</strong> who he is coming back for, a bride that is holy and without blemish. Not religious, holy. A bride that walks and talks with Him, and that keeps His word, not when convenient, always. Not on Sundays, everyday. He is coming for a bride that loves Him above all else, not one who compartmentalizes the Son of God and fits Him in between classes and TV if they have time. That is not devotion. True devotion comes when my eyes have been thrown open by the majesty of a holy God, true devotion surrenders entirely that He might be glorified in my life. True devotion adores this precious, beautiful Savior in the manner He deserves, but how many truly know and practice this devotion? John tells us the time is near, Jesus tells us to watch and pray, for we know not the time of His coming, or when we ourselves shall meet Him. Are we ready? We who claim to be Christians, are we walking in the holy, pure, imparted righteousness of Christ? Is Jesus Christ absolutely paramount in your life above all else? Above your spouse, your job, your children, your education, your career? He must be everything. I know my heart is challenged, I pray yours is as well. I pray in these last hours that God would open our eyes to behold the glory of His being, the spotless majesty of His purity. I pray we would all see Him as Isaiah did, that we would be undone before Him, and that we would never be the same again.\r\n\r\nMay you be found in Him this day, Blessings, Bro.

              "<strong>Psalms 23:1, “The Lord is my Shepard. I have everything I need”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist who wrote the great Psalms of all times viewed the Lord from different perspectives and angels. In the first verse of <strong>Psalm 23,</strong> he saw the Lord as a Shepard and himself obviously as the sheep. A Shepard takes care of the sheep. A good Shepard knows his sheep. He feeds the sheep; he protects the sheep from wolves and mischievous thieves and Shepard of other herds; he leads the sheep to green pastures and cool waters. His ultimate commitment and devotion is to the sheep. The sheep may not even be aware of that fact, but that does not change the position of the Shepard or lessen his commitment or encourage him to abandon the sheep, especially when the sheep is in trouble or in need.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThink about it for a moment. If God is my and your Shepard, and he is all knowing and all able and willing to watch us daily wherever we are, then, like David, we too can declare with confidence that, “The Lord is indeed our Shepard; we shall not lack anything\". What we already have and don’t yet have are already provided and are ours to enjoy and expect. We don’t have to see to be satisfied; we don’t have to get first then be grateful. All we need to know is the good Shepard has provided all our needs.\r\n\r\nDo you have any need today? Is there a problem anywhere? Are you worried about the future? Are you afraid something bad might happen to you? Are you scared of loosing something or someone you love? Is your heart troubled and your mind confused? Are you stretched and stressed beyond your ability to cope? Take a moment today and reflect on the fact that you have God as your Shepard. A good Shepard. Instead of worrying, lean on him; learn of him, let go of your fears and worries; follow him. That is what sheep do; they follow the Shepard. And the Shepard leads the way.\r\n\r\nLearn to rest in peace and sleep through your storms, worries, concerns or problems.<strong>“I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; for You alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.” -Psalm 4:8</strong>\r\n\r\nAn old hymn affirms this Biblical admonition:\r\n\r\nWhat have I to dread, what have I to fear,\r\nLearning on the everlasting arms? I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,\r\nLeaning on the everlasting arms.-Hoffman\r\n\r\nGod bless you. Brother Boaz Olang"

              "<strong>Jonah 2:2, “And he said: “I cried out to the LORD because of my affliction, And He answered me. “Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, And You heard my voice”</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s tough to be in a situation that takes away your freedom and limits you to what you can and cannot do. Some we bring upon ourselves and some find us. Regardless of their origination, the results are still the same, expect limitations.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJonah decided to disobey God by going the opposite direction from what the Lord had instructed him. Upon deciding to go to Tarshis, later we find that the Lord sent a storm in the sea and later he was thrown into the sea. Some could say the Lord was trying to kill him, I doubt it, I see that God trying to show Him who is God. The sea should have killed him but listen to this <strong>Jonah 1:17, “Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights”</strong>. What a way to humble a man of God, being swallowed by a fish. His freedom taken away, his pride crushed, his sense of ability limited and all he is left with is to focus on the One he was running away from. He was running away because he thought he had it together, with situation being unbearable, he called on God. Why did he not call on God when the storm was fears, or when they threw him into sea or the first or second day in the belly of the fish? Because man has a tendency of still trying to lead and fix their lives until they come to a dead end then they remember the Lord. Jonah says, “<strong>I cried out to the LORD because of my affliction”</strong>, I thank the Lord because my afflictions allow me to get closer as I call on Him. Now Jonah did cry in the midst of yuck (belly of a fish) and God heard him and out of the belly of the fish did Jonah come forth. Vs <strong>4, \"Then I said, “I have been cast out of Your sight; Yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.’\"</strong>\r\n\r\nJonah after all these went to Nineveh to fulfill his assignment. He believed God to bring Him out of a situation and now He was going to be an ambassador for the Lord. <strong>John 7:38, “…as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\"</strong> His belly did not have the right water till he found himself in another belly, a belly of death yet preserved. The reason he did not want to go to Nineveh was because though he was going to preach future punishment, he knew if the people repented, God would pardon their sins. He did not want forgiveness for the people of Nineveh until he also found himself in a place where he messed up and needed a pardon for himself. He cried to the Lord to be pardoned.\r\n\r\nI don’t know about you but my living water of ministry, encouragements, teaching, preaching came about after having an experience in the belly of some type of fish. The experience taught me new and valuable lessons I could never learn in a classroom. I can now preach that God pardons people’s sins because mine has been pardoned. Out of my life living water flow because He flows in and through me. So if you are in the belly of some fish right this moment, cry to Him for deliverance, let Him set the living water out of that experience and then be an ambassador for Him in whichever Nineveh He places you in because out of a belly did He bring you forth and from your belly shall flow rivers of the living water. Blessings Evans."

              "<strong>1Kings 18:20-40, “… and the God who answers by fire, He is God…”\r\n</strong>\r\nThe world is full of many doctrines, some doctrines have erred from the truth resulting into people being deceived. We have been given an awesome opportunity as believers not just to accept anything without first testing and approving. We then we become vessels God can use to reach His people with the truth He has revealed to us. A number of believers have also fallen on the trap of error as they were not well equipped enough to differentiate or discern.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nElijah was the only prophet in Israel. Many of the prophets had been killed because they did not follow Baal. Baal was the most popular god of the Canaanites, he was a god of lust, power and fertility. He was known to be a god that supplied rain for the crops when there was draught. In his time, Elijah called for draught, and the only way to override the call was not too look to Baal but to God. Baal had 450 prophets who faithfully served him and Elijah got so sick of seeing people worship something that had no power. No wonder Paul writes in <strong>2Timothy 3:5, “having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof</strong>”, some people like these prophets have a form of godliness and denies the power in the sense that they are faithful about going to church, worshipping, and walking with a form of god but that’s about it, they don’t see the true God as Almighty. In the world, people have a form of godliness but they deny the power, they are doing everything to keep commandments and know about God but deny His power to save and forgive their sins. Elijah was dealing with the same kind of people only that these worshiped a false god.\r\n\r\nElijah was tired of seeing the true God robbed of His glory by false god and his prophets. Elijah therefore took upon himself to prove who the true God was. He said that whoever answers by fire is the true God. One man against 450 prophets, <strong>it was time to prove that it’s not by might nor by power but by His Spirit says the Lord</strong>. So Elijah challenged the men to meet him on mount Carmel, he advised them to bring two bulls, one for them and one for him. One man was not threatened by the number. <strong>Truth is never threatened by the number, it always stands alone</strong>. He decided to give them the first chance to prepare their sacrifice. The true people of God are not intimidated by what the false religion has to offer before them. I have seen people from other religions tremble when we challenged their doctrines why? they have no foundation of the truth to build their beliefs on. They have been trained on how to respond to certain questions unless you ask something outside of that. Finally the prophets set their sacrifice on the altar and began to call on their god. The whole day they cried, chanted, cut themselves, meanwhile Elijah was watching and making fun of them. He knew that at one point he will need to call on his God but it will not take hours before He answers him. After they prayed all day and nothing happened, they gave up, their god failed them big time. If I was to pray to a god all day and nothing happens, I would change my stand.\r\n\r\nElijah then took his sacrifice and set it on the altar, he even had water poured all over sacrifice overflowing. Now we know that water and fire don’t work together and my concern is how will a wet sacrifice burn especially when we know that wet wood cannot catch fire? He knew these people might say that he did something that caused the fire, he was not going to let them think he cheated. <strong>Vs. 36, “Lord of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that You are God, and that You have turned their hearts back to you again“. Vs. 38.”Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench”.</strong> This kind of prayer reminds me of lost people I will meet. As lost people, they have something they are worshipping that needs to be challenged. I will need to pray the kind of prayer that moves heaven to send fire to consume their wet hearts, confusion and darkness in their lives.\r\n\r\nThis is God’s work, all I need to do is to represent Him and He will take care of the rest. God is a consuming fire and when He begins to consume, He consumes everything including the things that in natural cannot be consumed by fire. I believe that God has placed us in different positions to be <strong>us against the world.</strong> How will they know unless they are told, how will they come out unless they are challenged, “<strong>for I am not a shamed of the gospel cause it’s the power of God unto salvation” Romans 1:16</strong>. The only way we will challenge the unbelievers is by knowing who God is, what He can do and availing ourselves to be used at any given time to bring people to Him. If you look at the story, you will see how the prophets began to worship the true God but still Elijah killed all of them because they were false prophets whose hearts were not truly changed and they were injecting lies in the minds of people. Be God’s instrument He can use you to challenge and bring people to the full knowledge of Him.

              "<strong>Psalm 40:1-4, “Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his Trust”</strong>\r\n\r\nPeople come before God to pray to Him about different things for they are fully persuaded that He is their refuge and strength. Where you are fully convinced that if the Lord does not come through for you, you are destined to fail. If you are like me, you may find it hard to wait for what you have prayed for and know what God’s will is for the situation you are in. This verse in Hebrews sheds light clearly and I will use it to set the ball rolling. <strong>Hebrews 10:35&amp;36, “Cast not therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward, for you are in need of patience that after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise”</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nThis verse ties with the next few verses we will look at. <strong>Psalm 40:1, “I waited patiently for the Lord; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry“.</strong> As I have mentioned before, the word \"wait\" has different meanings and the first meaning on hold for someone or something. The other meaning is busy serving others just like in restaurants. We have waiters waiting on people and I believe this is what the Psalmist is telling us that he patiently served the Lord and the Lord heard him. In serving (waiting) on God, he was also bringing his petitions to Him. In his faithfulness in serving, the Lord heard his cry and attended to Him.\r\n\r\nNot only did the Lord hear his cry and attended to him, in <strong>Psalm 40:2, “He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, And set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps</strong>“. As you are busy waiting (serving) the Lord, hell won’t be too happy with you serving. Remember Jesus words in, <strong>John 16:33, “These things have I spoken unto you, that in me you might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world</strong>“. There is truth of what will happen, however there is a promise that comes with it. <strong>1John 4:4, “Ye are of God little children for you have overcome them. For greater is He that is inside of you than he that is in the world“</strong>. Attacks will come, the good news, He is the greatest living inside than we and the enemy living in the world. With that established, don’t be surprised at times when you are in horrible pits or in a miry clay for He will pick you up and set your feet upon a rock. He is the Rock of Ages <strong>Psalm 18:46, “The Lord lives; and blessed be my Rock; and let the Lord of My salvation be exalted”.</strong> He will set you on Himself, the Rock.\r\n\r\n\"<strong>…And established my steps</strong>”, the Lord establishes our steps, in other words recognizes our steps. Our steps could be in good ministries, good friends, dealing with issues, meeting deadlines, dealing with arrogant people. In short, all that you need to deal with He recognizes and establishes your step that you may walk worthy of His vocation. Walking with Him requires patience, back to Hebrews we looked at, “<strong>...For you are in need of patience”. Psalm 37:23,</strong> “<strong>The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way”</strong>. The word order here could mean bring something from somewhere else which is missing in the present situation and using it to accomplish what He had in mind. The present things have no capability of making it work but when He orders it from his warehouse (heaven), it comes complete.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 40:3, “He has put a new song in my mouth – Praise to our God; Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord“</strong>. I know the power in singing for it has a way of encouraging you to overcome. It may not be very easy to pray in certain situations but singing a song will make a great impact. Singing helps you lift Him up and what did He say in <strong>John 12:32, “And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me”</strong>. You lift Him up, you will be part of the people who will be drawn. The neat thing about this verse is that He does not even ask you to look for a song, He puts one in your mouth that you may praise Him. Certain songs that we sing out of our mouths, I wonder whether they praise Him?. “<strong>…Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord“,</strong> whenever the Lord is doing something in your life and mine, He has someone else in mind that they may see the goodness of the Lord in your life and fear Him. The fear here is reverencing fear. Many Christians walk as though they have no God to help them and the unbelievers have no one to set an example for them.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 40:4, “Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust”,</strong> there are so many things you will not understand about how God operates but trust Him. My wife and I are in situations right now where we don’t know what to expect but sure enough, we are making the Lord our trust. He has heard our cry and attended to it, He has brought us up from the pits and miry clay, He has set our feet upon a rock, He has established our steps, He has put a song in our mouths, And He has set people to see what He has done in our lives, what else can we do but make Him our trust. <strong>Hebrews 10:36, “…after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise“</strong>. I am determined to do the will of God with gladness for one day if not soon, I will receive the promise. Blessings, Ev"

              "“Preach the word!” Paul said to Timothy; “Be ready in season and out of season.” It is time spent in prayer, waiting on God, hearing from God, being empowered by God that makes us ready for action.\r\n\r\nIn Acts 16:16, Paul and Silas, on their way to prayer, were rudely and unexpectedly confronted by a devil. Did they ask the devil to wait while they “prayed about it?” Did they back away because they weren't “prayed up?” No way. They were ready for action. Prayer was a part of their routine. Prayer was something they had already done and were about to do again. Prayed up? They were always “prayed up.” Without any hesitation or intimidation they exposed that devil and cast it out of that poor, tormented soul.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nBy contrast, in Mark 9:17-29, the disciples were not ready. Due to a lack of prayer and fasting, they were unable to cast out an evil spirit. As well, in Acts 19:14-16, seven sons of a preacher were equally ill equipped for action. Rather than defeating an evil spirit, the evil spirit defeated them, overpowered them and cast them out of the house—all seven, naked and wounded. Why did they fail? They weren't ready. They had spent no time with Jesus and therefore had neither the character nor the power of Christ imprinted upon them.\r\n\r\nJesus said tribulation would come. For this reason, He also said, “Men always ought to pray,” and Paul said, “Pray without ceasing.” There is no excuse for the spiritual leader who doesn't pray. He is no better than a soldier who has gone to battle without a weapon or shield. Victory comes when preparation meets opportunity. The will to win is nothing without the will to prepare! We will hardly know when opportunities, challenges and tribulation are about to befall us. But we are called to be ready. It is only through prayer that our hearts will be readied and our spirits anointed to face those unforeseen trials. Without prayer, we will be tossed about; naked and wounded victims beaten by the enemies for whom we failed to prepare.\r\n\r\nPastor Gregg's blog: <a href=\"http://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/03/pastors-who-dont-pray-are-not-ready-for-action.html\">http://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/03/pastors-who-dont-pray-are-not-ready-for-action.html</a>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/pastors-who-dont-pray-have-little-influence-over-men-pastor-gregg-t-johnson/\" target=\"_blank\">Pastors Who Don't Pray Have Little Influence Over Men, Pastor Gregg T.

              "It was during a prayer meeting in Acts 13 that the Holy Spirit said, “Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” No vision for ministry or good idea can be trusted if it is not learned or affirmed through prayer.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the work of God, there must be no mistake about the leader’s prayer life. Prayer is the work of God. It is not an after thought uttered in haste or spiritual window dressing to validate our ambitions. It is serious business and must be the driving force behind the ministry. If not, there will be serious repercussions for the body he or she is leading. J. Oswald Sanders said, \"A course selected with little regard for prayer, will ultimately lead to an unspiritual and misguided administration. Eventually the Spirit is grieved and quenched, and the result is spiritual dearth and death for that place.\"<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhile a leader’s resume, credentials, and education are important, they must never take precedence over the question of his or her commitment to and love of prayer. Simply stated, leaders who don’t pray cannot be hearing from God and cannot be trusted to direct the body. They may have good ideas, but they may not be the right ideas. They will undoubtedly have noble intentions, but they may be the wrong intentions—wrong because they are not designed according to the good, perfect and acceptable will of God.\r\n\r\nPaul wrote to the Colossians, “We…do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all patience and longsuffering with joy.” Clearly, knowing and doing the will of God were achieved through prayer. It is through prayer that God leads us in His plans. It is through prayer that we contend with the obstacles hindering His will. It is through prayer that He empowers us to fulfill His purposes and it is through prayer that we find the release of all that is needed to do His work.\r\n\r\nPastor Gregg's blog: <a href=\"http://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/03/pastors-who-dont-pray-are-doing-their-own-work-not-gods.html\">http://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/03/pastors-who-dont-pray-are-doing-their-own-work-not-gods.html</a>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/pastors-who-dont-pray-pastor-gregg-t-johnson/\" target=\"_blank\">PASTORS WHO DON'T PRAY, Pastor Gregg T.

              "How frustrating it is to plan elaborate training seminars and intensive discipleship programs that are met with little or no interest from those we are trying to reach. How discouraging it can be to labor over a sermon, studying and preparing for hours only to have no response from those to whom it is preached. How agonizing it is to organize, administrate, plan and coordinate only to be met by resistance, criticism and rejection. Such scenarios are repeated over and over for those leaders who don’t pray.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nNo leader had greater success with the people he led than the Apostle Paul. His success, however, is not due to some charismatic flare, a dynamic preaching voice or incredibly creative ministry programs. Paul’s success can be traced back to one thing: prayer. Paul prayed for his people—and his people grew in Christ.\r\n\r\nTo the Romans he said, “Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.” To the Ephesians he wrote, “I do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers.” He told the Philippians, “In every prayer, I make request for you all.” For the Colossians he wrote, “We (are) praying always for you.” As well, to the Thessalonians Paul prayed that their faith would grow exceedingly and their love would abound. To Timothy, he said, “I remember you in my prayers night and day.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, Paul taught and preached the Word to them. Of course, he organized and set their churches in order. He was often involved in administrative and outreach efforts. But behind the scenes we see Paul prostrate before the Lord, crying out for the people he is leading. He is praying for their hearts to be soft and receptive to the Word of God. He is praying for the Holy Spirit to convict them of sin and grow them in Christ. He is praying against the schemes of the devil against them and for their victory over the struggles they face.\r\n\r\nPaul was a great teacher, but it was his praying that impacted the people. He was a great administrator, but it was his praying that set things in order. He was a great leader, but it was his praying that brought people to greater heights in Christ. From His example we see the great necessity of prayer, and how valuable it is in the life and work of the minister of the gospel.\r\n\r\nHow haughty and high minded prayerless pastors truly are. We actually believe that souls can be converted by our eloquent sermons alone. We actually think that believers will be inspired to greater heights of faith and fruitfulness because of our well organized programs and exceptional leadership abilities. “Not true!” you say? But that is exactly what we demonstrate by our lack of prayer. We are telling God that we don’t need Him. Paul may have needed His anointing to bless his efforts, but not us. We don’t need God to do it, we can do it on our own. If we needed God’s help, surely we would pray, we would fast, we would lay prostrate as Paul did—praying always and not ceasing to make mention of them in our prayers.\r\n\r\nEvangelist Sammy Tippit wrote, “The great need of the hour is that pulpits throughout this land might be filled with humble, holy, praying men. A prayerless pulpit produces a powerless people: powerless to overcome troubling sins, powerless to change the culture, powerless to give witness of their great Savior.” Indeed, if Paul, the greatest spiritual leader and teacher of truth relied on prayer to make his ministry effective, how much more should we humble ourselves and cry out to God for His blessing.\r\n\r\nPastor Gregg's blog: <a href=\"http://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/03/pastors-who-dont-pray-are-unable-to-bring-men-to-greater-heights-in-christ.html\">http://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/03/pastors-who-dont-pray-are-unable-to-bring-men-to-greater-heights-in-christ.html</a>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/pastors-who-dont-pray-pastor-gregg-t-johnson/\" target=\"_blank\">PASTORS WHO DON'T PRAY, Pastor Gregg T.

              "<strong>2Kings 4:8-36, “30 But the child’s mother said, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her”</strong>\r\n\r\nThere is a song by Jim Reeves I loved to listen to in my teenage years with this line in the chorus, “<em>It is no secret what God can do, What he has done for others, He'll do for you…”</em>. While there is such great truths in this line, there is a piece I would add if I had a chance to, “…<em>but you need to know what others have done to be blessed and you do the same to be blessed</em>”. I think it is easy to want what others have without desiring to labor like the way they did to have what they have. It was a great pianist who played a master piece and someone came to him afterwards and said, “<em>I would give everything to play like you</em>”, to which the pianist responded, “<em>I have given everything to play like me”.<!--more--></em>\r\n\r\nOne of the most fascinating stories I cherish in the bible is the story of the Shunammite woman. We may love the story and the outcome, but would we want the process like she did? We all love results, the question is, would we want to endure the process? I am the first to admit that while I hate processes, I sure love outcomes.\r\n\r\nIf you know this story, you recall she had a child out of a promise from Elisha due to the kindness she showed Elisha and his servant<strong>. </strong>Then something happened, <strong>Vs. \"18 And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. 19 And he said to his father, “My head, my head!”</strong>. Everything looked perfect from the time he was a baby until now. Even though we are not told of his age, I would speculate that he was a teenager for he appears to be old enough to go to the field with his father to the reapers. He is also old enough to say what is troubling him. On this day, he cried \"my head\" and his father had one of his servants do something, “<strong>…So he said to a servant, “Carry him to his mother.” </strong>From the past experience, maybe the husband knew his wife well enough to know what to do.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. \"20 When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died”. </strong>Out of her great affection, she took him on her knees, and laid his head in her bosom to sooth the pain, and in this posture he continued until the middle of the day before he passed. All the mother's tenderness could not keep alive a child of promise. I think this is where many parents especially the mothers are. The children they hoped for, labored to show love and tender care, battled and provided for all of a sudden is (are) dead (spiritually) on their laps and they do not know what else to do. She hoped someone would give her answers, however she discovered she was left to figure things out. If anything, they always expected her to have answers. She was the one considered the woman of faith.\r\n\r\nFrom this story and many others in the bible, there is something about a mother’s love that is unique. Being a mother is a very important role that the Lord chooses to give to many women. A Christian mother is told to love her children (<a href=\"http://ebible.com/query?utf=8%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Titus%202%3A4-5&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=http://www.gotquestions.org/eBible.html\">Titus 2:4-5</a>), in part so that she does not bring reproach on the Lord and on the Savior whose name she bears. Mothers have a unique and crucial role in the lives of their children because of their intuition, strength, persistence etc. Many times you hear about a persistent praying mother or praying grandmother. We will see these qualities in the Shunammite woman in our next devotional.

Of course the dog doesn’t know this while it is going through the training, but one day it will walk in its purpose. Have you ever experienced a season of difficult times, unknown times, unsure times, whereby you truly did not realize at the time why you were going through the situation that you found yourself in?<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">David was a shepherd tending his flock in the field. One day David would be summoned to meet with the prophet Samuel who would anoint David as King of Israel. After David is anointed King, although at this time he is truly a king, he is a king without a kingdom at this time (<strong>Genesis 16</strong>), David volunteers to step up to the challenge of facing the Philistine Champion Goliath. What was it about David that cause him to believe that he could actually defeat, not just step up to the challenge, Goliath? David had a perception of his preparation. David thought back to the times that vicious animals attacked his sheep, and David recalled how God delivered him out of the paws of those that attacked his sheep. Once again even though David is a king without a kingdom at this time, David perceived that God was preparing him to defeat Goliath as He did back when David was fighting in the field protecting his sheep. Like a ferocious animal with sharp paws attacking David’s sheep, so was Goliath with a sharp sword attacking the sheep (Israel). David would become the under-shepherd (the shepherd, under the Shepherd [God]), but would David fight for Israel? David didn’t realize until it was time to volunteer for the challenge against Goliath, that God had prepared him in times past for present and future battles and challenges.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you facing something at this time that you feel that you cannot accomplish? If you believe that, you are right, you can’t accomplish it, or can anything work alone. Jesus said, “<strong>apart from Me you can do nothing (John 15).</strong>” Notice that even David fought, it was God who delivered. Saul said to David, “<strong>You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you<em> are</em> a youth, and he a man of war from his youth</strong>.” Saul had man’s perception in mind, while David had a godly perception knowing God prepared him for such a time as this.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What giant are you facing or about to face in your life? Can you like David look back in your life and have a perception of preparation for what lays ahead of you? God has brought you through so much, can He not bring you through whatever you are facing or about to face. Why not take time to write down some of the major battles God has brought you through and thank Him for those times. Then write down those battles you are facing or know you are about to face and thank God He also has the same power to bring you through them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/give-me-a-chance-part-3of3-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Give Me A Chance, Part 3of3, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/gods-decrease-your-increase-sifting-for-victory-part-1of2-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">God's Decrease, Your Increase (Sifting for Victory), Part 1of2, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/give-me-a-chance-part-1of3-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Give Me A Chance, Part 1of3, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1Samuel 17:38-40, “38 So Saul clothed David with his armor, and he put a bronze helmet on his head; he also clothed him with a coat of mail. 39 David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested them.” So David took them off. 40 Then he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag, in a pouch which he had, and his sling was in his hand”</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My wife and I went to a marriage retreat one year where the speaker shared a story from his marriage about how he cut carrots verses how his wife cut carrots. Whenever he would see his wife cutting carrots he would correct her, and instruct her to cut the carrots his way. She would do it for a time although feeling uncomfortable doing it his way. When he left the room, she usually returned to the way that she initially was cutting the carrots.<!--more--> There are certainly times that one will tell another how to do something based how the first one has always done it. Looking throughout Scripture, how should one fight a battle, walk around a wall seven times (if one is present), fight with 300 men only, or sling stones at the enemies head? There were numerous battles in Scripture, and each army won the battle in a different way. Joshua marched around the Jericho walls, Gideon fought with 300 men, and of course David would slay Goliath with a sling and stone. There were different tactics used to bring about victory, but each victory was the battle plan by God’s as the leader and God gave the victory. The only times Israel lost battle is when they did not go according to God’s plans, or because there was sin in the camp. How should one fight a battle?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When David convinced Saul and the others that he would fight Goliath in battle, Saul began to suit David up in Saul’s armor. However when David tried to walk he couldn’t move well in them.<em> “The king’s tunic and armor would have been very distinctive. If David went out dressed in them, many would have thought that the king himself was going out. Perhaps such a misidentification would have seemed attractive to Saul, who had been sought out by the Israelites to lead them forth in battle. In the Iliad a similar switch occurred when Patroclus went out in the armor of Achilles, hoping to intimidate the Trojans. David’s refusal would have reflected his recognition that without being trained on how to use the armor and weapons to his advantage, they would become a detriment</em> (The IVP Bible background commentary : Old Testament).”</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">David chose to wear what he knew and fight with a weapon that he was familiar with. The sling was used in organized warfare therefore Goliath should have known its deadly potential. David perceived that if he used this weapon in the past, he could fight with it now. There are many that we can learn from, but God has uniquely wired each of so differently. We must be wise about putting on Saul’s armor. Battles are won and lost based on yielding ourselves to God. Look back to the battles you have won, and you too will acknowledge God’s hand brought the victory. If you trusted Him in times past, can you not trust Him now? Remember Paul’s words,<strong> “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to<em> His</em> purpose,</strong>” and thank God right now.” Let God prepare you in His way, and respond obediently, and see God will never let you down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/perception-of-preparation-part-3of3-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">Perception Of Preparation, Part 3of3, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/perception-of-preparation-part-1of2-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">Perception of Preparation, Part 1of2, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>2Kings 4:8-36, “30 But the child’s mother said, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her”</strong>\n\nIn the midst of her loss and pain, she gathered courage and strength to do something about her situation. <strong>vs., \"21 she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out, 22 Then she called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.”\n\n<!--more-->\n\n</strong>\n\nSuch confidence had she of God's goodness that she was ready to believe that He would restore what He had now taken away. O woman, great is thy faith! He that gave life would not disappoint. The sorrowful mother begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet at once. There was a drive, a passion, a burden for her once upon a time living child. Her faith perhaps was driven by the testimony of how Elijah raised the widow of Zarephath's son (<strong>1Kings 17)</strong> who was laid on his bed, of which she may have heard. The Zarephath’s son was raised in Elijah’s room and since the spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha, she had faith to believe that a miracle that happened before could happen to her too. So she took the boy put him in Elisha’s room and journeyed to find him while concealing his death from her husband and family, and to prevent grief, and that they might not bury him until she returned.\n\nShe had faith and that faith was demonstrated in her action. Those who would convey spiritual life to dead souls must feel deeply for their case, and labor fervently in prayer for them especially for their children. Though parents, ministers cannot give Divine life to children, they must use every means, <strong>with as much earnestness as if they could do so.</strong>\n\nNothing was going to stop her or slow her down. <strong>Vs. \"25 And so she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, the Shunammite woman! 26 Please run now to meet her, and say to her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?’” And she answered, “It is well.”</strong> It was well that she had found the man of God; and it is well with us when we have found Him who is able to raise our children when we seek Him on their behalf. It is not well only when the miracle happens, it is well when we have done our part. God will do for us what He has done for others, however we have to find what others have done like this woman and engage in that because it builds our faith to believe God.\n\nDespite Elisha sending his servant with his stuff, nothing could change the situation until Elisha came. I love something about this woman, persistence, she says,<strong> vs. \"30 As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her”. </strong>We must continue laboring in prayer persistently until the Lord shows up in the impossible situation. Many have given up and now have a shovel in the hands preparing for the burial of their prodigals. <strong>If you believe in resurrection the last thing you would want is prepare for burial.</strong>\n\nThe rest of the story tells us how Elisha came and raised the boy because of a mother’s faith and persistence. Imagine what would have happened if she did not seek resurrection for her son? She and her family would have buried the boy. Don’t bury the dead yet, why? “<strong>By this faith women received their dead raised to life\",</strong> <strong>Hebrews 11:35.</strong> <strong>Faith in God activated through prayer does not prepare for funeral, it prepares for resurrection</strong>. Therefore put the shovel back, stop pondering on what you could have done better and seek Him for the resurrection for your prodigals.

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1Samuel 17:45 – 46, “Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 46 This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. </strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have you ever looked back at your life and saw that God’s divine handprint was upon the battles that you faced? As we mature in the Lord we begin to discover that God is truly the One that is winning and bringing the victory. Even though you look back and see victory in your life, did you see victory when you were in the midst of battle? I’ve heard it said that hindsight is 20/20, meaning that we seem to see so clearly when looking back but not as clearly when we are going through something, because we are in the midst of a situation. Are you able to use the situations that God has brought you through as a springboard to propel you on to future victories?<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">David remembered that the Lord God had delivered him from the lion and the bear when he battled with them for the sake of his sheep. Now David is using his perception of preparation to give him courage to not just talk about facing Goliath, but actually engaging him in battle. The weapons of Goliath were sword, spear, and javelin. Goliath didn’t even hold his shield in hand because his armor bearer was holding it for him. Perhaps Goliath felt that he had no need to hold a shield for protection. David proclaimed that although Goliath came to him with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin, David was coming to Goliath in the name of the Lord of hosts. David didn’t even mention his weapons: his staff, his sling and the rocks.<strong> Deuteronomy 33:29</strong> states, “<strong>The LORD is your saving shield, and his sword is your glory. Your enemies fawn upon you, as you stride upon their heights.”</strong> Does this not describe the faceoff between David and Goliath? The enemy mocked him, mocked his weapons, but Goliath couldn’t see that David had a sword and shield in the Lord. David’s offense and defense was the Lord Himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">David not only killed Goliath but cut off Goliaths head with Goliath’s own sword. By challenging God’s people Israel, the Philistines were in effect challenging the Lord Himself, and the Lord would have the victory enveloping the natural (sling and sword) in the supernatural. “<strong>Who<em> is</em> this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, The Lord mighty in battle”, Psalm 24:8.</strong> David’s perception of preparation wrought him the victory by the Hand of the Lord. Paul wrote, “<strong>4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, 6 and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled”, 2Corinthians 10:4-6.</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you are in battle, trust in the Lord who has a track record of victory every time He engages in battle. You may be fighting in the natural, but the Lord is your glorious sword and shield in the supernatural. Be encouraged today that you are on the Lord’s side and keep your perception of preparation focused on the Lord of Hosts.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/perception-of-preparation-part-2of2-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">Perception Of Preparation, Part 2of2, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/perception-of-preparation-part-1of2-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">Perception of Preparation, Part 1of2, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/give-me-a-chance-part-3of3-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Give Me A Chance, Part 3of3, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Matthew 14:28-30, vs. 28 “Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water. 29 So He said, “Come.” And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus 30 But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”</strong>\n\nPeter had the idea to walk on the water with His Lord. Christ blessed Peter's faith in Him, and Peter walked as long as he kept his eyes and faith on Christ. However Peter began to look upon the waves instead of Christ. We are to keep our eyes FIXED upon Jesus the author and perfecter of our faith (<strong>Hebrews 12:2</strong>).\n\n<!--more-->\n\nHe is a fixture, unmovable which we must keep our gaze upon, or we will sink into things that the Lord stands above, and wants us to stand above. Our gaze upon Him causes us to stand above things dealing with money, sexuality, friendships, work, discipline, family issues, relationships, spiritual disciplines, etc...\n\nWuerst states, <em>\"He uses Him as the supreme example to which his readers should look as they run life’s race. The word “looking” is aphorao (ἀφοραο) “to turn the eyes away from other things and fix them on something.”</em> The word also means “to turn one’s mind to a certain thing.” Both meanings are applicable here, the spiritual vision turned away from all else and together with the mind, concentrated on Jesus. What a lesson in Christian running technique we have in that little preposition “off, away from,” which is prefixed to this verb. The minute the Greek runner in the stadium takes his attention away from the race course and the goal to which he is speeding, and turns it upon the on looking crowds, his speed is slackened. It is so with the Christian. The minute he takes his eyes off of the Lord Jesus, and turns them upon others, his pace in the Christian life is slackened, and his onward progress in grace hindered. Messiah is called the author of our faith.\n\nKeep your eyes on the prize which is Christ, the One who will take His own to the finish line Christ is the archegon (ἀρχεγον), the chief leader of this faith in that <em>He “furnished the perfect development, the supreme example of faith, and in virtue of this He is the leader of the whole believing host of all time”, </em>meditate on the chorus of this hymn<em>, “Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace”. </em>blessings Pastor Phil."

              "<strong>2Samuel 7:8, \"Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people Israel”</strong>\r\n\r\nGod has a unique way of reminding us how He called us and raised us up for His purposes. God speaks through Nathan the prophet to David and he begins by reminding David of where God found him: <strong>“I took you from the pasture and from following [tending] the flock.</strong>” Who knew David in the pasture? His influence spread as far as his last sheep at that time. David was learning character and how to lead others (at that time sheep). However, although God makes correlations between sheep and people, they are obviously not exactly the same, as you and I are made in God’s image. God was reminding David how far he had come from.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nSamuel was to choose a king from among Jessie’s sons and passed by each one realizing that they were not the one that God had chosen. The Lord had said to Samuel, “<strong>Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature;…for the Lord sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.</strong>” Samuel asked Jessie if he had called all of his Sons, but there was still one more in the field seemingly unaware of what was taking place at his home. David was faithfully tending his sheep and God would call David from the pasture to the palace, from shepherding sheep, to shepherding God’s people. David didn’t fill out an application and interview for the position of a king. God looked and God simply choose him. Why does it seem that God chose him? I love the lyrics of one of Christian artist Carmen’s song, “<em>When others see a shepherd boy God may see a king.</em>” At this time God did in fact see a king, and a great one at that. God didn’t call David initially because he was a great military leader, but because he was faithful in the small things. He took care of the little that was entrusted to him, his sheep, and since he was faithful in the small God would raise him up to be faithful of much. What would happen to David’s sheep if he left to be king? God has a unique way of working things out as Paul said in <strong>Romans 8:28, “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”</strong> Perhaps God would send another person to care for the sheep David loved. God would now use David to be a King after God’s own heart, and that is a heart that David seemed to have beating in his life from the pasture to the palace. From pasture to palace teaches us that:\r\n\r\n1. God has not forgotten about you “in some shepherd’s field”\r\n\r\n2. God chooses whosoever He desires\r\n\r\n3. God’s choices are not based on man’s outward assessment of a person\r\n\r\n4. God is looking at how faithful we are in what He has currently given to us\r\n\r\n5. God will send a “Samuel” to confirm your call (others will see your call)\r\n\r\n6. God anoints people for His ministry\r\n\r\nApplication: What is God calling you to do? In what way is he raising you up? Are you being faithful at the little things, so that he can trust you with greater things, or trying to claw our way to the top? Your talent may take you to the top but only your character will keep you there. Be faithful in your pasture (that which He has entrusted to you) so that God can place you in his way, and in His time in the palace He has for you. Your family, friends, co-workers, boss, etc.., need to see a shining testimony of you being faithful in the little things. Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Daniel 3:17&amp;18, \"If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up\".</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is an ongoing war between Relative and Absolute statements. We get caught up in the middle many times. Let’s tackle a few questions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First question,<strong> \"What do you believe</strong>?\" This question is broad until you add more words to it to identify what the question is specifically targeting. <strong>Can we say that facts can negate beliefs? </strong>of course we can. If I was to say that trucks don't kill, I would have to be 100% sure as a fact, that would be considered an absolute statement, in this case this statement is not true. We all know that trucks can kill so my belief that it cannot will not affect or change facts.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego were in a place where they had to choose between two kingdoms. They were to serve and obey one of the kingdoms. In the earlier chapters we are told of these four young men brought to the land of Babylon to serve. They knew their God all this time but coming to this land, they were faced by new challenges, they had to rely on God to bring them through and He did. We can tell that these men had a God whom they believed in, the God of truth.<strong> Job tells us that He knows his Redeemer lives (Job 19:25), Paul says in 2Timothy 1:12, \"...I know whom I have believed.</strong>\" All these men believed because they knew who their God was (is).</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you know what you believe, you should be able to answer this question, \"<strong>Why do you believe what you believe?</strong> Some people, have no idea why they believe what they believe. I would say that one of the reasons is because it's easy to create what you want to believe in and stick with it without proper reason. A Christian should know why he believes partially because the bible says in<strong> 1Peter 3:15, \"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you...\"</strong> I need to know why I believe when asked and have an answer. Why did these men believe in God? We can tell that through the miracles God had done in their lives. God had seen them through all their life and being in that nation, they knew that they had been sent there by God to serve. As the bible says, \"<strong>Their footsteps were ordered by God</strong>\". These were men who did not just hear about it, they experienced it causing them to move from<strong> the realm of belief to the realm of experience, Psalm 34:8, \"O taste and see that the Lord is good...</strong>\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another vital question, \"<strong>Where do you get your back up from?\"</strong> Anyone who is going to defend what they believe should have at least some backup. Talk to many people and discover they believe in some things they can't back up, they don't have a source of authority to fall back on. If I am going to believe in the word of God to which I am, I will always have His word as my backup.<strong> 2Timothy 3:16&amp;17, \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profited for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works\".</strong> We Christians ought to defend what we believe through the Holy Scriptures for it ties to who we believe in. The scripture is God Himself revealed through the word,<strong> John 1:1, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God\". So it's no longer what I have created to believe in but what I have tested and tasted to believe in the word</strong>. The word may reveal things I don't like about myself but I know that it's the truth for I have tested it. I believe in the law of gravity for I have tested it, there are things I haven’t tested but because I have seen it work in someone's life, that is evidence; proof.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last but not least,<strong> \"Would you be willing to die for what you believe?\"</strong> This is tough but true. Jesus died for what He believed and in that He would redeem mankind. Back in 99 at Columbine high school, a girl died because of her faith. With a gun pointed at her, she was asked if she believed in God, and her answer was YES, that cost her life. Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego, were men ready to die for the sake of truth.<strong> THEY WERE MEN STANDING FOR SOMETHING SO AS NOT TO FALL FOR ANYTHING</strong>. They had counted the cost, why? because they believed, they knew why, they had back up, proof, and were willing to die for it. They knew that this was the truth and no one could take away from them. They understood that<strong> \"to be absent in the body is to be present with the Lord.</strong>\" They were very aware of their outcome unless the Lord miraculously delivered them. They were determined for God to receive glory whether in His deliverance or in their death. Therefore when they were faced by a situation that required them to go against what they believed, they said<strong> Daniel 3:17&amp;18, \"If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up\".</strong> This is a very bold statement, \"<strong>we know our God will but if not, we will not\"</strong> Be ready always, Blessings Evans</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/basic-instructions-before-leaving-earth-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-7of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 7of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-1of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 1of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1Peter 3:15, says “15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, AND ALWAYS BE READY to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;” </strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One day, two JW’s (Jehovah witnesses) visited our home. My wife and I  gave them an opportunity to share about their faith and why they believe what they believe. After they were done, having known some of their positions especially on who Jesus is, we took time to ask them tough questions about their worldview and in that process also shared the gospel with them. We now pray that the Holy Spirit will awaken them, convict them and lead them to the true light.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I often ask people these two questions,<strong> “what do you believe”</strong> and “<strong>why do you believe what you believe</strong>”. People often don't know how to answe these questions--I was no different a few years back.<strong> 1Peter 3:15, says “15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, AND ALWAYS BE READY to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;” </strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The use of \"defense\" in<strong> 1Peter 3:15</strong> is general: Whether formally in an official setting or informally to anyone who might inquire, a believer is to be ready to provide an answer. That answer is about \"<strong>the hope that is in you</strong>,\" which is the Christian faith. Believers should be able to give a rational explanation of their salvation and Christian faith. If you can’t stand for something, it will be easy to fall for anything. We have to be the ones to influence because we have the truth or else we will be influenced which will draw us away from the truth.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Mark 13:22 and Matthew 24:24, 22, says “For false christs and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 23 But take heed; see, I have told you all things beforehand.”</strong> What is interesting is that, we will run into people who are in cults who will seem to speak the same language as we do, use the same words and even feel like they are one of us. It’s in the probing that you find that you mean different things. For example we could all say we know John but the moment we begin to describe the John we are talking about, we discover they are not the same. That is why you as a believer ought to be ready with God’s word to know what you believe, why, and be able to defend your belief. Mark and Matthew tell us that “false christs … will rise,” we don’t have to wait for them to arise, they are already here proclaimed by others, it’s the christ not revealed in the Holy Scriptures. Paul fireproofed his son in the faith Timothy by admonishing him with this words,<strong> 2Timothy 2:15, “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF TRUTH”.</strong> Timothy was going to be faced by people who preached another gospel that appeared real. Paul even mentioned two of those people in this chapter. He told Timothy “<strong>rightly divide the word of truth</strong>” which is an indication of some who will come and wrongly bisect God’s word making it appear real. Timothy was to be ready at all times to defend the faith.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1Corinthians 3:11, “For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ”</strong>. We must truly know this foundation and build our lives on it. We must also know those who pervert this foundation and not embrace all who name the name of Christ in talking of false christs.<strong> 2Timothy 2:19, “…the solid foundation of God stands”,</strong> this is the true foundation that cannot be shaken, the foundation to bring other’s too.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If someone was to come to you and ask you about what you believe and why you believe what you believe, are you ready to fulfill<strong> 1Peter 3:15</strong>? Let us be ready, let God’s word fireproof us for the coming days to not be deceived. In addition, let’s not shy away from those of other faith, they need to hear the truth. God’s truth will set them free from all lies of the enemy<strong> John 8:32</strong>. blessings Ev</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/submitting-to-gods-righteousness-part-7of10-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Submitting To God's Righteousness, Part 7of10, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/basic-instructions-before-leaving-earth-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/the-sure-foundation-is-christ-part-1of2-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sure Foundation Is Christ, Part 1of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/what-are-signs-for-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">What Are Signs For?

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jeremiah 29:11, “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD”</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are times when we find ourselves in the midst of some kind of a desert, a sea or a storm. In times as these, we as Christian begin to question God. We ask questions like,\" How could you let this happen to me if you love me?\" When we are faced with situations like these, there are scriptures from the bible that help us understand God's plan for our lives.<!--more--></p>\r\nThere are 3 stories in the bible that are different, yet they speak the same truth to us. If you look at the story of the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the story of Abraham, and the story of David, what do they have in common? They are stories of promise, stories of what God promised to do. In Exodus, God had promised to deliver the Israelites. In Abraham's story, God had told him to leave his land and go to the place where he would show him. He also promised to give him a son. In David's story, God promised to make him King. The other thing that is common with these stories is that all the promises came at a much later time than what was anticipated by the recipients. Another similarity is that between the promise and the fulfillment of the promise, the recipients endured tough times, temptations, hardships, and at certain times gave up, wanting to look back, or wanting to take short cuts. When the Israelites were in the desert, things were so bad that they said to Moses, \"We were better off in Egypt than here. Forget the promised Land and lead us back to Egypt.\" When David was anointed King, He was constantly pursued by Saul. He was constantly fleeing and most times weary. When Abraham saw that his promise was not being fulfilled, he got impatient and took a short cut by sleeping with his maid.\r\n\r\nToday, God has promised us good things. He has promised to bless us.<strong> Jeremiah 29:11 say that \"for I know the plans I have for you...\"</strong> Our Destiny was already ordained by God before we were even born. He says, \"<strong>before you were born I knew you</strong>..\" This is the trick though, God never explains the process of how He is going to bless you. He doesn't explain every step that you will go through, the tough times, the temptations and the hardships. He knows that if He lets you take a glimpse at the process, you will never take a step towards your destiny. If God had told the Israelites that they would wander in the desert for 40 years and struggle the way they did, they would have never left Egypt. If David Knew that he would be a target of Saul, he would have chosen not to be King. If Abraham knew the problems he would face when he left his home, he would have never left. The reason why the Bible calls these men \"The warriors of faith\" is because no matter what they went through, no matter what the situation was, no matter how bad things were, they only had one thing going for them FAITH. They believed God. They never looked back at where they had come from. Going back was never an option.<strong> They realized that it was not by might, not by power, but by His spirit</strong>. Today we can learn from these men. God has given us promises. He has plans for us. A lot of times<strong> He shows us the promise, but He doesn't tell us the process</strong>. He may have promised you a good job, but He will not let you know that maybe at some point you will have to leave your current place, either voluntarily or otherwise and go through some financial struggles. He may have promised you a ministry, but He won’t let you know that maybe you will suffer some setbacks. He may have promised you a good husband or wife, but He won’t let you know that there are times that things will be so bad between you and your partner, big fights, even break ups. It is up to us to say, \"<strong>Lord, you promised, and I will stay faithful until it comes to pass. No matter what I go through, no matter how rough it is, no matter how much I want to give up, help me keep the faith</strong>\". Paul says,<strong> \"I have fought a good fight, I have ran the race, I have kept the faith, and now I await the crown.\"</strong>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No matter what the situation is, we should remember that nothing can separate us from the love of God. Neither death, nor principalities nor trials and tribulations. When he has tried us, we shall come forth as gold. Blessings Jimmy</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/02/13/give-me-my-wings-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Give Me My Wings, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/do-not-bury-the-dead-yet-part-2of2-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Do Not Bury The Dead Yet, Part 2of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/do-not-bury-the-dead-yet-part-1of2-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Do Not Bury The Dead Yet, Part 1of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Matthew 25:34, \"Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\"</strong></p>\r\nIt's nice to be rewarded for a job well done. Who doesn't appreciate a promotion, a raise, a bonus, to show recognition for the work ethic and value that one has established? The one that does the promoting is the supervisor, the boss, the \"head honcho.\" In this verse the King tells speaks a blessing to the sheep which he places on His right, which is the position of blessing.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe previous verses speak of Christ's return in glory with His holy angels. “<strong>He shall sit upon the throne of His glory: And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left” </strong>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is the King who is inviting those sheep (God's people) to inherit the blessing. What was the criterion for those that inherit the blessing, because the goats (the false converts) do not inherit the blessing?</p>\r\n1. One must live in divine order \"<strong>Then the King say unto them on His right hand, Come\".</strong> When one proclaims that one is a Christian it is assumed that there is a declaration of allegiance to Christ. A Christian means a follower of Christ. He is our \"head honcho\" that goes before us, He is in charge and you and I are not. Who looks like the leader of your life, you or Jesus? Examine your priorities: How do you spend your time, does it speak divine authority? Does your TV get more of you than Jesus? Are your finances used more to build His Kingdom or yours? Do the gifts God gave you bring about your glory or His?\r\n\r\n2. The inheritance is actualized \"<strong>Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you</strong>\". Esau was the firstborn of Isaac and therefore he had the birthright to the blessing of his father. Unfortunately he sold his birthright to his manipulating brother Jacob. Although he had the right of the firstborn, he did not value it over a small bowl of soup. Esau lost his birthright and consequently his blessing because he did not want the birthright. He despised it. Genesis 27:27-30 are the words of blessing spoken over Jacob. Beyond the words, one day Jacob would receive the inheritance of his father that was spoken over him. Like Jacob we were once deceivers, manipulators, but while we were yet sinners Christ died for us, and upon our repentance toward God and faith toward Jesus Christ our sin debt was paid for and we became children of the King. Paul writes, \"<strong>Now if we are children, then we are heirs-heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory (Rom 8:17</strong>).\"\r\n\r\n3. God's Kingdom will become our Kingdom! \"...<strong>the Kingdom prepared for you</strong>.\" There are only two kingdoms, the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of darkness. When the King does the separating of His sheep from the goats, the sheep will enter into the Kingdom that has been prepared for them from the foundation of the world.\r\n\r\nAre you living in divine order? Do you realize that you if you are His sheep that you are an heir of the Kingdom of God, and that His Kingdom will one day be your Kingdom and \"<strong>we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is</strong>,\" and worship for all eternity? \"<strong>Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as He is pure (1 John 3:2-3).\"</strong> Until the nets are filled...Blessing, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>John 15:5, \"I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.”</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5960\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image.jpg?w=280\" alt=\"image\" width=\"280\" height=\"300\" /></a> </strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This account takes place after the disciples had spent three years with Jesus just prior to going to the cross. Jesus is the Vine and Christians are the branches which gives us a picture of the relationship He desires us to understand. You see Jesus wants a flourishing family. He could have picked up anything to illustrate His heart, like a sword, a bucket of water, but His chose grapes as His illustration. Being hours from His death, Jesus wanted to leave a graphic picture of what He desired to come forth from the lives of the disciples, and that was fruit. Christ desired to have His character developed in His followers, and for those followers to be fishers of men.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jesus said that “<strong>If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit</strong>.” To bear Godly fruit one must be connected to God. One cannot produce Godly fruit any other way. God created us to be fruit bearing, and not barren branches. Consider the words by Christian song artist Rebecca St. James in her song “Me Without You<em>.” Like a band without a drummer, That's me without you. Like a year without a summer, That's me without you. Like a king without a country. Like a room without a view; Like an empty gun, Like a fatherless son, That's me without you, Like a ship without a rudder, That's me without you; Like a child without a mother, That's me without you; Like a story with no ending, Like a foot without a shoe; Like a wasted feast, Like a faithless priest; That's me without you, Chorus: Me without you, A pitiful sight, Me without you, It ain't never gonna feel right… Like a war without an enemy, That's me without you; A disease without a remedy, That's me without you; Like a crime without a victim, Like a sleuth without a clue; Like an empty gun, Like a fatherless son, That's me without you, Without you...</em> Repeat</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do you feel hopeless and helpless without Christ? Do you feel that you can truly live apart from Him? He is my only bridge to heaven. <strong>Ephesians 4:23-24 that you are “to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness</strong>…\" Do you see you truly can’t put on the Lord Jesus Christ and separate yourself from Him? We need Christ as bad as someone jumping out of an airplane needs a parachute.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>“Consider this as well. Two men are seated on a plane. The first is given a parachute and told to put it on as it would improve his flight. He’s a little skeptical at first, since he can’t see how wearing a parachute on a plane could possibly improve his flight. He experiments to see if the claims are true. As he puts it on, he notices the weight of it upon his shoulders and he finds he has difficulty in sitting upright. However, he consoles himself with the fact he was told that the parachute would improve his flight. So he decides to give it a little time. As he waits he notices that some of the other passengers are laughing at him for wearing a parachute on a plane. He begins to feel somewhat humiliated. As they continue to point and laugh at him, he can stand it no longer. He slinks in his seat, unstraps the parachute and throws it to the floor. Disillusionment and bitterness fill his heart, because as far as he was concerned he was told an outright lie. </em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>The second man is given a parachute, but listen to what he is told. He’s told to put it on because at any moment he’ll be jumping 25,000 feet out of the plane. He gratefully puts the parachute on. He doesn’t notice the weight of it upon his shoulders, nor that he can’t sit upright. His mind is consumed with the thought of what would happen to him if he jumped without the parachute. Instead of preaching, or thinking that Jesus improves the flight, we should be warning sinners and being aware that all will jump out of the plane.</em><strong><em> “It’s appointed for man to die once and then face judgment (Hebrews 9:27</em></strong><em>). </em><strong><em>The issue isn’t one of happiness, but one of righteousness”,</em></strong> Ray Comfort<em>.</em> Can you really live apart from Christ and have a fruitful life of righteousness, or have you accepted His words, “Apart from me you can do nothing?”</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Application: Think about it. </strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Check out</strong> <a href=\"http://www.livingwaters.com/witnessingtool/gospelwhynotpreachJesusgives.shtml\">www.livingwaters.com/witnessingtool/gospelwhynotpreachJesusgives.shtml</a>, Blessings, Pastor Phil</p>"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Joshua 24:15, \"But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.\" </strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Joshua was calling Israel to honesty and commitment. He wanted them to have one heart focus. He desired to see his people fear God and serve Him with an undivided heart.<strong> James 1:8 tells us that \"a double-minded man is unstable in all he does\"</strong> Joshua wanted stable committed followers, not those who jumped on the bandwagon. Joshua desired Israel therefore to make a declaration of allegiance to the Lord in his midst.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He stared by saying<strong> \"If it seem evil to you to serve the Lord\".</strong> He basically asked them, if you think that it is a waste of time, undesirable, unfulfilling, unworthy, or too hard then speak up now to who will be your god. Joshua was not condoning nor encouraging idolatry, but rather explaining that all must serve something as their god. It is innate that we worship something; the only question is who or who. Joshua drew the line in the sand of commitment, and allowed them the opportunity to which side they would stand on.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is why the US military has boot camp, to weed or sift out the uncommitted, unfit ones. Titus explained it this way \"<strong>They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny Him</strong>\". They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good. Joshua didn’t want a bunch of half-hearted followers, and neither does God.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Look at Joshua’s declarative statement. Here is a man that is focused, and committed, and a leader not only among Israel, but also he takes seriously his role as the spiritual priest of his home (family). He declares, \"<strong>But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord\".</strong> Notice he doesn’t say we might serve the Lord, we will try and serve the Lord, or even we will probable, we intend, to follow the Lord. No he stakes his claim and he stands strong upon his statement. We read nothing of a family discussion on the matter, he didn’t appear to take family votes on this issue - NO! Joshua knew that the spiritual direction and atmosphere of his family was his responsibility.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, in this day and age, there are too many husband and fathers that don’t take their priestly role seriously. They let their kids decide If they want to go to church. They don’t have daily devotions with their wives or children. Many church attending parents rely on the Sunday school teacher or Children’s Pastor to be the only teacher of the kids on the truths of the Lord. I know this because I was a Children’s Pastor for four years. Do your children have a say on what they want to eat or not? Then why do we allow our kids to choose if they want to spiritually eat or not. The state would have parents behind bars if they did not feed their children, yet many allow their families to spiritually starve and spiritually die. Many wives and children are not being spiritually nourished at home. Why is this? Husbands are too busy to take their family responsibility seriously. Exodus 4:24 states At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met Moses and was about to kill him! \"<strong>Because Moses didn’t circumcise his children, God was going to kill Moses</strong>. Joshua was leading a huge number of people; he had taken over for Moses. He filled some pretty big shoes, so much so that God constantly told him,<strong> \"Be strong and courageous</strong>\" Joshua was the leader of a whole nation, yet he made it his business to lead his family faithfully in the thing of God.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Application: How committed to the Lord are you? If you are single and not committed what makes you think you can lead a family spiritually? If you are married, are you and your household (family) following the Lord, because of your leadership? If you are leading well, be encouraged, \"Lead On!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blessings,</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pastor Phil</p>"

If it's that powerful and has such a great weight, why has it been soiled? In courts we hear,<strong> \"I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth,</strong>\" but many of the testimonies are a pack of lies as they discover later. Don't we all hate dealing with liars? what they say, it's hard to extract some truth. Their lies may appear to be truth. Liars can never be trusted and we all know that.<strong> Standing for the truth may often times call for you to stand alone</strong>. <!--more-->To be honest, facing the truth in the eye is not easy, it reveals what you don't want to see, hear or deal with. It's easier to live a lie and in denial than to live a truthful life. The only difference is a lie almost always needs another lie to cover it until it backfires. On the other hand, the truth stands without blinking, compromising or bending. In our day where people make truth what they want it to be, where will absolute truth come from? I am not married to my truth, if I find or someone points me to the scriptures to show me where I missed telling the truth, I will abandon what I embraced and embrace the truth of God’s word. This is why it’s important to study the word which goes beyond feelings and experiences we may elevate on the same level with God’s word. I have seen a lot of messes done in the name of the Lord through feelings and experiences which were contrary to the Word of God and it was embraced because someone believed God told them. We are going to have to ask ourselves some tough questions, do we want truth or do we want our ears tickled by what we want to hear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Truth does not change its stand to accommodate your needs</strong>, either you are for it or against it. David says in<strong> Psalm 138:2, “I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your lovingkindness and Your truth; FOR YOU HAVE MAGNIFIED YOUR WORD ABOVE ALL YOUR NAME”</strong> WOW, The Lord has magnified His truthful word above His name.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>John 1:14</strong> tells us about Jesus the \"Word\" becoming flesh and dwelling among us. I am fascinated by the fact that Jesus had to come on the face of the earth as a Man yet not losing His status as \"God\". We understand that you cannot redeem what you are not related to. This is one side. Here is another side I see, in the Old testament, failing to live by the truth called for heavy punishment. And being that God never brought Himself to the level of a man to fully understand the nature of man, Jesus had to come. This is why I believe when we pray in \"Jesus name\", Jesus presents our case to the Father by saying something like this, \"I know how it feels to be tempted, to go without, to lose someone, to be mocked etc., let my grace prevail. Therefore He sends Jesus to experience what man experiences. This is where I see a balance, the Bible says He came full of GRACE and TRUTH.<strong> If the truth had a final say in our lives, we would all be in trouble</strong>. Thank God for GRACE.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The attributes of grace are love, kindness, gentleness, patience, mercy, forgiveness, peace and joy. Righteousness, holiness, wrath, justice are all summed up in one word, truth. We need to understand that God is a God of grace but also the God of truth. If you thought grace replaced the truth, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Jesus came full of both grace and truth.<strong> In our time we teach and preach more \"grace\" than \"truth\", we can tell that grace has been taken to the extreme, denying the truth to have a say. </strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is hard to confront people with truth for fear of hurting their feelings and withdrawing. Speaking the truth may make you feel like you know it all and better than the person who is receiving it. As mentioned, Jesus had a balance on both. For instant, when He met the Samaritan woman at the well, He spoke truth and grace. Both are on different sides but work well if applied correctly.<strong> Ephesians 4:15, \"but, speaking the truth in love\".</strong> How easy it is to speak the truth and leave someone wounded and broken; Speaking the truth to expose without caring, speaking the truth to show you are right. Paul in writing added an element of \"love\" in speaking the truth. This is what I call,<strong> speaking the truth in grace. Truth should be seasoned with grace</strong>. Confronting not with an aim to destroy but to reveal then heal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Truth dwells on faults and weakness, it's more of a now thing, grace senses potential in a person, it sees far beyond the faults. The Samaritan woman had to know the truth and the truth did hurt but grace saw far beyond and gave her a chance to become what she was not. Truth sometimes might break us but then we have to follow it up with grace to heal. To continue Evans</p>"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>John 1:14, \"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth\"</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Living a lie as mentioned last time is very easy and we see this many times. When Solomon was faced with his first judgment, he encountered with two prostitutes who had both given birth. Two women, two babies the only difference at the time of this meeting with the king, one baby had died as the mother laid on him and she could not live with the reality that her baby was dead. So she took all her love, passion, desire and planted it on this other woman's baby. She claimed that this other baby was hers. This is what deception is, trying to be what you are not. Trying to live a life God never designed for you. Deceiving yourself that everything is alright when in actuality it's wrong.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">God does not anoint lies so until you come clean, honest with yourself and stop deceiving yourself and other people you are not ready for progress. Trying to live someone's life the way one of the prostitutes tried to do will rob you of time you should have had to run in your own lane. Be yourself, be what God wants you to be.<strong> Your progress is not measured by someone else life.</strong> You have no competition, so why live a lie? The prodigal son could not live a lie anymore, he drank a glass of truth and realized he had a problem and sought for help. Jesus said in<strong> John 8:32, \"And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\"</strong> I could take that verse and apply it the way it is yet how many know the truth but it has not set them free? If anything they have taken the truth and push it aside. It's in the process of knowing the truth and desiring to work truth into your life even when it's hard that the truth begins to set you free. Truth works its way through the excessive baggage's pushing through the lies in order to liberate. This is where even the true worship begins to flow<strong> John 4:23, \"But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and TRUTH; ...\".</strong> When truth is given an opportunity to prevail, grace follows to even the tracks.<strong> James 4:6, \"God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.\"</strong> Can you balance grace and truth in your life? Would you face truth in the eye even when it seems so hard? Can you come to the Lord just as you are and be real as you desire change? Let this hymn reminds us that we need to be true and real with God if we want to grow.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1.

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1Kings 12:6-16, “ Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. \"How would you advise me to answer these people?\" he asked. 7 They replied, \"If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.\" 8 But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. 9 He asked them, \"What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, `Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?\" 10 The young men who had grown up with him replied, \"Tell these people who have said to you, `Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'--tell them, `My little finger is thicker than my father's waist. <!--more-->11 My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.' \" 12 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, \"Come back to me in three days.\" 13 The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders, 14 he followed the advice of the young men and said, \"My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.\" 15 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite. 16 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: \"What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!\" So the Israelites went home.”</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Who do you seek advice from? It’s interesting to note that Rehoboam went to two groups of people for advice, the elders (older men) and the young men (his contemporaries). The elders told him what he needed to hear, while the young men told him what he wanted to hear. The elders told him to grant the request of Israel, while the young men told him to lay the heavy yoke on Israel, over and above what Solomon laid upon them. Even though ultimately this was the Sovereign will of God, just like Judas the betrayer, we should be careful who we take counsel from. Each of us needs advice at times, but who do you turn to? I often advise teens not to go to other teens to help them with their problems for the most part, because their friends are going through the same things, but rather to those that are older who have gone through many of the issues that they face, just with “<strong>different clothing</strong>” if you will. So I ask who is your “advisory committee”? Do you have people close to you that can provide godly counsel to you? I have often heard it said you should always have a Paul who builds into you (an inlet), a Timothy that you are building into (an outlet), and a Barnabas to encourage you along the way. Do you have these three kinds of people in your life? The wisdom you are given from your Paul, will be passed on to your Timothy and encouraged by your Barnabas.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Application: Do you have faithful “counselors?” Are you hearing from those who tell you what you want to hear or what you need to hear? Who is your Paul, Timothy, and Barnabas?</strong> Blessings, Pastor Phil</p>"

              "<strong>Galatians 2:20, \"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me\"</strong> I would like to share with you about the nature of regeneration, and the life that follows as described by the Apostle Paul here in his letter to the Galatians. He speaks of an experience that one must truly enter into, this is not something God forces us to do, but we willingly enter into. The KJV renders the beginning of this verse “I am”, which more directly points to something we must daily enter into. I am daily crucified with Jesus, daily I die to myself, daily I live by faith. I cannot say enough that Christianity does not consist in church attendance, nor in bible reading, not in evangelism or good deeds, not even in the sacraments, for without a true work of grace within the heart, all of those things mean nothing. I must be crucified with Him, I must enter in to His death. I must repent of my sin, I must be born again.<!--more--> The root of regeneration is ‘gene’, meaning the gene of Christ, the Holy Spirit, is planted within my heart upon my conversion, and where Christ is planted, Christ grows, But like any other living organism, that right conditions must be present. The seed must be watered and fed, it must be given plenty of sun, it must be cared for and nurtured, but above all, for the seed of Christ to grow in my life, <strong>Christ must truly be planted within me</strong>. What do we each see growing in our lives? Do we see Christ? Do we see the fruits of Godliness and holiness? Or do we see worldliness and carnal desires? Is Christ living in me, or do I still live? Paul says that the life we now live, this crucified life where I have died to myself and have ceased to live, this life where Christ now lives, not I, I live by faith, a continual, ongoing faith, whereby I offer myself wholly to God as a living sacrifice each day, desiring Him above all else, and forsaking all that I may have Him alone. This is the nature of regeneration, the nature of Christ now dwells within me, I am a new creature, desiring nothing but perfect love and devotion unto God. This is the fruit of Christ living in me, I now obey Him and live by His word. <strong>No one has to tell me to read my Bible and pray, no one has to tell me to bear fruit, for I do it naturally, in sweetest harmony with the nature of Christ now living within me.</strong> I no longer live, Christ lives. This is the life all are called to live, the door is open, one that no man can shut, will we not enter in? God is calling friends, do you hear His voice? Will you respond today, will you respond now as you read?

              "<strong>1Samuel 30:1-30, “…But David encouraged himself in the Lord”</strong>\r\n\r\nDavid has just come back to Ziklag a place where he and his men’s families camped for some time. During this time, David had been anointed to be the next king while Saul was still ruling at this time. David’s reign was just around the corner, however his reign was not going to come easy. Saul was out to kill him, the philistines to who he had destroyed their champion had an issue with him and now the Amalekites had descended right into their camping site while David and his 600 men were away to team up with the Philistines to fight Israel. The Philistines did not trust David for they feared that David was in a position of turning against them while in the battle field to join the Philistine enemy. So they refused to allow him to team up with them and David and his men came back to their camping site.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nOne thing I want to point out, there is always an enemy against the people of God. Just because you are anointed and walking victoriously does not mean you are exempt from attacks from the enemy. If you defeated him once, surely enough he will leave you for a season and then come back at a later time. When Jesus was in the wilderness after being tried of the devil, the bible says that the devil left him for a SEASON. The Amalekites were David’s enemies and David had fought them before and won and therefore left him for a season. When they knew David and his men were not at home (camping site), they came in and attacked the place. We need to be on the lookout at all times, the bible says <strong>1Peter 5:8, “Be sober, be vigilant; for your adversary the devil as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour”</strong>. Mark the word, he roams like a lion, he is not the lion, Jesus Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. <strong>Isaiah 62:6</strong>, says “<strong>I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day or night”. </strong>These two verses alone show us that we have an enemy constantly checking whether we are sober and vigilant, he is also trying to see if we have watchmen on the walls. Are you well covered in these areas?\r\n\r\nWhile men were absent, the enemy descended. Where are men today who are watching their camps in prayer and in the word? Majority have exposed their wives and children to danger because they are not watching their camps. If you are driving and you have your family in the car, you would not fall asleep on the wheel would you? If you did, you will have put the lives of your family in danger leave alone yours. Being married has driven me to pray more and be in the word, why, because I need my camp safe. The enemy is out to destroy my spiritual life, my marriage, my home, my ministry etc. the thought drives me to watch and pray.\r\n\r\nSince David and his men were missing in action, the Amalekites came in and took their wives, children and possessions. They went as far as burning the entire place down, what does this remind us of the mission of the enemy,<strong> John 10:10, “The thief cometh not but for to steal, kill and destroy”. </strong>Already two of his missions have been fulfilled, he has stolen and destroyed. When David and his men came and saw everything that had happened, they wept until there was no more strength left in them. It’s ok to weep over what you’ve lost but there comes a time when we have to pronounce benediction over what we have been weeping over and take a stand, encourage ourselves in the Lord and trust God. God is bringing us from a place of being victims to place of being victors for His own glory. What the enemy meant for evil, God will turn it around for our good for His own glory. To continue, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Samuel 30:1-30, “…But David encouraged himself in the Lord”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe challenge with life is that there are times you go through things thinking you are the only one. Then there are those times you are going through them with other people especially those who are looking up to you. In these times, you don’t need those who add more pressure to your life, but those who are there to help you ease your burden. That was not with David.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nUnder these terrible circumstances, David’s men were so angry at him that they conspired to stone him, their leader. The bible says ”<strong>we wrestle not against flesh and blood</strong>”, <strong>Ephesians 6:12</strong>, here we see men operating in the flesh, for one second, they had forgotten how good David was a leader to them and how they had won many victories through his leadership. They even forgot that God had seen them through thick and thin. This was not the first time they were facing challenges together. I am not surprised because even today men change their views and opinion about people when something bad hits. Have you ever been blamed for something simply because you were heading it?, I can imagine David’s men beginning to blame him for their predicaments. They could have sounded something like this, “it’s your fault we are in this mess, you are the reason we lost all; you should have listened to us when we told you it wouldn’t work; I knew that one day this thing will bring disaster but you never listened to me.”\r\n\r\nIt’s very easy to yield to the accusations and be a victim of despair simply because of what men see in you at a given time. Remember that they all wept together until there was no more strength left in them. Instead of embarking on a new plan as to what to do next, his men were making decision under pressure to get rid of their leader, making the situation worse than it already was. Be careful that you do not make decisions under anger, as <strong>Anger</strong> is just one word short for <strong>Danger</strong>. Many make quick decisions while angry and they mess things up big time when they should have made it better. Calm yourself down like David and begin to encourage yourself in the Lord, strengthen yourself in the Lord, speak peace. As long as everyone is hysterical, everything comes to a dead end but the moment one begins to have a clear mind, then he is in a position to channel others in the right direction. Encourage yourself in the word, prayer and reaching out to others in the same situation as you. The more you encourage, the more you will be encouraged. The more you charge someone else’ battery, the more yours will be charged. I have come to learn that sometimes when you are in the worst shape, God sends someone your way with situations similar to yours or even worse. And they don’t come to give, they come expecting to be given. That when you are discouraged, God sends someone your way for you to encourage them.\r\n\r\nBecause David encouraged himself in the Lord, he was now in a position to encourage his men who were making decision out of anger and frustrations. <strong>You cannot give out what you don’t have within. </strong>The bible says, “<strong>Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks”</strong>, if you have abundant peace inside, you will speak peace outside; if you have abundance encouragement inside, you will speak the same. This is what I call, the outworking of the internal what David is teaching us today. When David encouraged himself and encouraged others, he was able to think through what he needs to do about their situation with a clear mind. To continue, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Samuel 30:1-30, “…And David encouraged himself in the Lord”</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are people who may be present but not present to encourage you. That is why we always have to know who we turn to for encouragement and for strength to encourage ourselves in Him.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 27:13, “I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living” </strong>Believe me very few people will encourage you to the level you need to be encouraged. When you know what you are going through, encourage yourself in the Lord, bring back to memory the good things the Lord has done in your life before, let them be a stepping stone for what you are trusting God for. Remember someone would wish to be in your situation since theirs may be worse than yours. Don’t sit and have a pity party, speak like Paul who said, “…<strong>for I know whom I have believed and I am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day”, 2Timothy 1:12</strong>. I’m not talking about positive thinking or positive outlook; I’m talking about speaking God’s word that is able to defeat the enemy of our souls. Jesus defeated the enemy in the desert by the word.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAfter David encouraged himself, was sober and had clear mind, the bible says, <strong>vs. 7, “Then David said to Abithar the priest, Abimelech’s son, “Please bring the ephod here to me”. And Biathar brought the ephod to David. Vs. 8 So David inquired of the Lord, saying, “shall I pursue after my enemies?”</strong> It all comes back to seeking God for a new direction. <strong>Psalm 37:23</strong> tells us, <strong>“The good steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord</strong>”. “Order” is to give directions, to command; that is what we need. Seek God’s direction in what you are dealing with, it’s through seeking Him that you are led as you become obedient, wise, and have faith as you realize that without Him, you can do nothing.\r\n\r\nDavid needed to know from the Lord if he could go after his enemies and if victory would accompany them. <strong>Vs. 8, “And He answered Him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all”</strong>, Amen. When God gives us an okay to go after our enemies, regardless of how the battle may look or sound one thing we need to keep in the back of our minds, we have won. It’s like you already have an “A” for an exam you are about to sit for. It may be so difficult, you may not have the answers and time may be running out. We need to remember in the back of our minds the victory is already won.\r\n\r\nDavid and his men left to pursue after their enemies. Out of the 600 men, 200 men became feeble and tired on the way and couldn’t move anymore after their enemies. Don’t be discouraged when some people who were to help you fight became feeble and stopped pursuing,<strong> the battle is not ours but the Lords</strong>. In <strong>Vs. 16-19, they finally caught up with the enemy, David and his now 400 men fought the battle and won. Vs 18, “So David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives. 19 and nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons and daughter, spoil or anything which they had taken from them, David recovered all”</strong>. What a great recovery to everything from the smallest to the greatest. I could stop at the restoration however God did much more than that, He also gave them ”DOUBLE FOR TROUBLE” Vs. 15, the Amalekites did not only invade Ziklag, they invaded Philistine and Judah and they took their goods and besides that, the enemy was already rich for this was a strong army. David and his men recovered what belonged to them and took all that the enemy had gathered from Philistine and Judah and also what belonged to the enemy.\r\n\r\nI now know that God does give us double for our trouble, more than what we have lost. They had so much that they ended up giving some to friends and relatives. How it is a blessing to be used by God to reach others after you have gone through so much. What they went through humbled them and brought them closer to one another. Though the four hundred men did not want to share what they had gathered with the two hundred left behind, David once again steps in and encourages them to share. After this episode, I would say their faith increased, they saw how their leader handles things under pressure <strong>when he turned disappointments into appointments</strong>. Some of us would not be where we are if we never had major setbacks in our lives and how God turned our disappointments into appointments. He continues to use situations to build us and bless us that we may in turn advance His kingdom for His glory. Blessings Ev"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Isaiah 26:3-6, “You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in you. Trust in the Lord for ever, for the Lord, the Lord is the Rock eternal. He humbles those who dwell on high, he lays the lofty city low; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust. Feet trample it down—the feet of the oppressed, the footsteps of the poor.”</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What does the word steadfast mean? It means unchanging, loyal, fixed, or constant etc. Have you ever been in situations or gone through life where you felt like you were between a rock and a hard place? You felt like the ground was sinking beneath your feet? You felt like the walls of this world were closing in on you and you are panicking and feeling like running out of air? Have you ever felt like you are the only one in this world going through difficulties and challenges that you feel like no one else has any idea what it’s like? Have you ever felt like the devil was sitting right on top of you and you were suffocating and everything you do and touch is messed up, nothing is working right? I will join you in saying YES! Even us as saved Christians go through all the above but what we do after we encounter hardships and challenges of this world is what matters most. I have seen so many professed Christians cuss God and leave their faith because life did not go their way and so they feel entitled to take matters into their own hands instead of looking up to God for help and strength and understanding. And Isaiah tells us very perfectly that when we fix our eyes on God, he will keep us in his perfect peace, that no matter what is going on around us we will be intact because we trust in him.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We need to channel our life line straight with God so that when troubles of this world come our way, we don’t lose focus, we don’t doubt. Let them find us steadfast/loyal/fixed on God and that is the one life line that the devil cannot and will not break. BUT if we have our life lines here on earth guess what? They will be broken and vanish never to be seen again. The one constant that never changes and is always there no matter what, is the mighty God we serve. When my father died 14 yrs. ago, I was turning 17 yrs. old in a month’s time, my world came crushing down. I started thinking of how our lives were basically over for me, my siblings and my mother. I did not see how we were going to survive without my dad as our major bread winner and as a father. In my eyes we were finished, very bitter and angry at the Lord for a while because before my father died we were facing a lot of hardships. Sometimes we did not even have food to put on the table, we went to bed hungry and sometimes my parents could not afford school fees and we would be home and no one really knew what was happening out there. They would see us and think we had a wonderful life but we didn’t. Anyhow, so when dad died a horrific sudden death, you bet I was angry with God but I remember my Pastor talking to me and encouraging me and something he said that I have always remembered and will was he asked me where my life line was connected. I realized then that I had my life line connected to my dad and that was not the way to go. So even though dad was never coming back I knew I would see him again and I reconnected my life line to God.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Has life been easier since then? NO, but, I thank God for the many other blessings in my life and the provision he has constantly given us at his perfect timing. When I see how far we as a family have come there is no way we would have made it if it wasn’t for a higher power which is God. So when life throws a curve ball at me, I know even if I’m hit, I find my strength in the Lord for<strong> Luke 10:19 “I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.”</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would therefore encourage you with this, be steadfast in the Lord, don’t be lukewarm or like a chameleon (changes color depending on the surrounding) that when life is good that’s when you praise God and when life is going down the drain you cuss God and leave him. Let’s take a stand and I kid you not if you choose the Lord’s side, you will never be disappointed. So I leave you with this<strong> Psalm 37:7, “Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes<em>.”</em></strong> And remember, unlike parents, God will not give you what you want just because you throw a temper tantrum, no, he does not work that way! Have a temper tantrum free day.

              "<b>Revelation 22:1-21, \"And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give everyone according to has work\"</b>\r\n\r\nWe are living in the end times believe it or not. A man by the name of Harold Camping confidently predicted the Second Coming of the Lord on May 21, 2011, he thinks he knows Jesus’ timing better than Christ does. While these claims have been made in the past by different people who claimed Christ was coming on a particular date, all failed and so shall this one. Again we have to be reminded that the end times prophesies in the old and the new testament are being fulfilled before our eyes. Jesus said that He does not know the day or the hour of His coming but when we see these signs, we ought to know He is coming soon.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nNow many have said where is He? They say they’ve been talking about His second coming for years starting from the days of the disciples. Read what Peter writes to the people of his time in <b>2Peter 3:1, “Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder), 2 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets</span>, and of the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior, 3 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, 4 and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming?</span> ... 8 But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 9 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness</span>, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night</span>, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up” </b>\r\n\r\nAs Paul was writing to Timothy in <b>2Timothy 3:1-9</b>, I would sum up all the seven verses to these, a world of lawlessness and Godlessness in the last days. Listen to what he says, <b>1\"But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 2, \"People will be <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">lovers of themselves</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">lovers of money</span>, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">unholy</span>, 3, \"without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">not lovers of the good</span>, 4, \"<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God</span>-- 5, \"<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">having a form of godliness but denying its power</span>...6, \"They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires</span>, 7, \"<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth(NIV</span>)</b>. Do we see this in our world today? I'm not sure if Paul was prophesying., I think he may have gazed into the future and made an observation based on how things were happening in his time. I believe he knew that instead of things getting better, they would get worse and here we are seeing them. Things are getting more worse in our world and I don’t think they will stop.\r\n\r\nListen to Jesus speaking about the end times in <b>Mathew 24:3-7, \"And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? </span>4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Take heed that no man deceive you</span>. 5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places:” </b>What a time we are living in.\r\n\r\nNo man knows the day or the hour of His return except the Father. Are we getting ourselves ready like the five wise virgins who had oil in their lamps burning waiting for the coming of the groom? They did not know when He would come but they were ready. We too may not know but we ought to be ready. Blessings Ev"

              "<p><b>Revelation 22:1-21, \"And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give everyone according to has work\"</b></p><p>In the light of God’s word that reminds us that Jesus is coming back again quickly, why are people rejecting the real truth and establishing their own, <b>John 3:19-21, </b>tells us why<b>, \"19 And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil</span>. 20, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed</span>. 21But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.\" </b>It's not about what you feel is the truth but knowing the truth. You establish your own righteousness and you will continue to stay in darkness, but remember tomorrow is promised to no one.</p><p><!--more--><br /> Because people have not repented and turned to God, here are the results, <b>Romans 1:18-32,\"18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness; ...19since what may be known about God is plain to them; because God has made it plain to them. 20For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen; being understood from what has been made; <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">so that men are without excuse</span>.; 21For although they knew God; they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him; but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">22Although they claimed to be wise; they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles</span>. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another</span>. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie; and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.; 26Because of this; God gave them over to shameful lusts. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones</span>. 27In <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust. The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness</span>; 28Furthermore; since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God; he gave them over to a depraved mind; to do what ought not to be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness; evil; greed and depravity. They are full of envy; murder; strife; deceit and malice. They are gossips; 30slanderers; God-haters; insolent; arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they are senseless; faithless; heartless; ruthless. 32Although <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death; they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.\" </span></b> (NIV). These are not my words but His words, read it for yourself.</p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Three times</span></b> in <b>Revelation 22</b> does the word \"<b>I am coming quickly</b>\" is recorded, to me this is a trumpet sounding the coming of Christ soon.<b> Revelation 22:12, \"And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give everyone according to his work\". </b>He is coming to reward according to everyone's deeds, if you did good, your reward will be good, if you did evil and you were never forgiven of it, that would be your pay. Being good before God means being perfect, no one has and never will be perfect. It's only by grace that we are saved, <b>Ephesians 2:8</b>, “<b><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Grace is only given to the one who has been shown mercy, and mercy is given to the one who is humbled and humility comes to the one who has acknowledged to have broken His laws and needs a Savior to save him/her from the wrath to come.”</span></b> Salvation is the key and I believe God will also reward on how faithful we were here on earth especially in reaching the lost. The bible says, \"<b>It's appointed for a man once to die and after this judgment</b>\" what a tragedy it will be that when He comes and finds you not ready when He has given you signs of His coming. I love you so much to tell you that you need to escape hell if you have not. A certain group sang a song with part of this lyrics, \".....<b><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">When The Big One (Death) Finds You May This Song Remind You That They Don't Serve Breakfast In Hell</span></b>\" <b>Revelation 22:13-14, \"13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last.\" 14, \"<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city \"</span></b></p><p>He is coming quickly, are you ready? are you also preparing other people, family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances to be ready for His coming? The bible says, \"<b>Now is our salvation much nearer than when we first believed</b>\" This is your time. Blessings Evans</p>"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hebrews 9:27, “And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment\"</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Statistics show ten of ten people die. The number one killer in the world is not AIDS or cancer, the number one killer is death. We are all on death row whether we believe it or not. We are one beat away from death and the bible says, \"<strong>It's appointed for men to DIE ONCE</strong>\", one life to live on this earth then after this is judgment. The question to ask, what would you preach to someone who has little or no time left before they pass into eternity? Would you tell them \"<strong>Jesus loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life?\"</strong> or a soldier who is about to face a fierce battle and could lose his life, would you instruct him on \"<strong>How to live his best life now\"?</strong> Do we realize we are running out of time to reach the lost day by day by? Jesus' last command ought to be our first priority. Is it?\n\n<!--more-->\n\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whenever I get an opportunity, I share my faith, I desire to go out of my way especially on the streets as I have done in the past to reach the lost (unconverted). I have personally shared with many people one on one in the last 10 years. It's interesting to hear what people believe and put their faith in. Some are living as though they will be in this world forever and then there are those who \"HOPE\" they are good enough to go to heaven.<strong> Romans 10:3 says, \"For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God\"</strong>. Then there are those who constantly wonder what is out there when they walk out of this world. I have met people who would have never thought of going to church because they felt unworthy (we all are) and had no Christian friends to invite them but were glad that someone took time to be out there to tell them the truth and point them to the cross to meet the Savior. I have testimonies after testimonies of what happens out there. Self-righteous people get humbled by the law and the<strong> Holy Spirit John 16:8, \" ….when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:\".</strong> How would they know they running out of time without us telling them? Are we waiting for them to come to church before we can tell them?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A couple of things that motivates me to step out and do what I do, One, my love for God and for Him to be glorified. He deserves it, He SAVED ME! A chief of sinners, He has done everything to save mankind. Two, my dad received his salvation on the streets over 30 years ago. Some people stepped out on the streets to preach the gospel and he happened to be on the streets that day, he heard the gospel, repented of his sins and trusted in Christ to save him. He had no reason being in church but that day some people gave him a reason to go to church and glorify God. Had he not been saved, who knows whether I would be saved today leave alone alive. Three, what if I was the one who was unsaved and someone never bothered to preach the gospel to me, I will definitely be going to hell, thank God I heard the gospel just in time and He saved me and I want others to be saved. What motivates you to want to share your faith? The bible says,<strong> \"freely you have received, freely give</strong>\".</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A gentleman by the name of Mark Cahill who has such a great burden for the lost always asks Christians \"Do you care\" (in reference to those dying in sin) then he asks a much tougher question, \"<strong>Do you care enough to do something</strong>\" <strong>Romans 10:13-15, “13 For “whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved.” 14 How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “ How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!” </strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lord give us a burden, such a great burden to win souls. Blessings Ev</p>"

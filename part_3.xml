  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Joshua 1:8, “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success”</b>

Growing in the Lord only comes from seeking Him daily, and feeding on his word. Saying you want to grow and be blessed is easy, but if you do not do what it takes to generate this growth, then do not be surprised if the enemy defeats you. Hibernating animals feed, while gathering and storing food for winter months because they will be incapable of leaving their dens during the season. Prior to the winter, these animals gather and store enough food to take them through the cold season. As believers, we also ought to do the same—eat the word, while gathering and storing enough for the challenging and harsh seasons. When those seasons come, and they will, we will be able to pull verses we learnt and stored in good times, and apply them in difficult situations.<!--more-->

When Moses passed away, the Lord made Joshua the new leader of his people. Compared to his predecessor, God gave him different instructions, and adhering to each of them would make him prosperous and successful. “Meditate on it day and night, and not only that, but put its contents to practice.” These instructions were clear and concise. The journey ahead was in no way destined to be a smooth one, so as God’s appointed leader, Joshua needed to prepare himself and the people. “<b>The word is not effective when it’s heard or read, it’s effective when it’s utilized</b>.” James validates this point in James 1:22, when he says, “<b>But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.”</b> There are many times we hear the word, and even allude to its power. The question we must all ask our selves is this, “are we doers of the word, and are we practicing what we have studied?” Sometimes the word is placed in our lives to test our faith, especially during those wilderness-like experiences. It’s during those times that we should remember where we stored the word, and pull from it to get us through any kind of challenge. Several men in the Bible encourage us to be in the word:
<ul>
	<li>Peter says, “DESIRE” God’s word. <b>1 Peter 2:2-3 says, "As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, 3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.” </b>I pray daily for a hunger and desire for God’s word: it doesn’t naturally come to me.</li>
	<li>Job says, “TREASURE” God’s word<b>. Job 23:12 says, “I have not departed from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food." </b>Of all books, which one do you treasure most? Would you treasure it more than gold, silver, and other things?</li>
	<li>Paul says, “STUDY” God’s word<b>. 2 Timothy 2:15 says, "Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." </b>In a day of errors and false teaching, we should be like the Bereans, mentioned in <b>Acts 17:11, which says, “These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.”</b></li>
	<li>David says, “HIDE” God’s word in our hearts. In <b>Psalm 119:11, </b>he says<b>, “Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.” </b>I do not know of any other way of overcoming sin, than by hiding God’s word in my heart. The thing we feed the most, ultimately wins. If we feed our spirit, it will win. If we mostly feed our flesh, it will trump over our spirit.</li>
</ul>
We have what God recognizes as a means of blessings—His word. Do you desire his word? <b>Matthew 6:33, “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” </b>

Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong></strong><strong>Zechariah 4:6, “Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of hosts.”</strong>

Are you facing any obstacle, challenge, situation or threats, which are like huge and impossible mountains to climb? Are you right now having piled up needs like a high mountain? Do you feel discouraged and distressed over some things that do not seem to give up, no matter how much you pray? Are there issues in your life and around you, which have built up into mountains too high for you to climb? Do you feel like giving up, at times, because you do not seem to be heading the right direction or realizing your dreams or having your desires met?<!--more-->

Whatever your case may be, I want you to know that there is no mountain standing on your way, which can stop you from becoming the person God created you to be. <strong>Obstacles, which appear like huge mountains can be great stepping-stones to greater victories and success in our lives</strong>. <strong>Without them, we would not know how powerful our God is and the value of His grace upon our lives.</strong>

If you want to turn any mountain in your life to a flat plain, there are three steps I recommend to you to take today and always, whenever you face the impossible mountains:

1. Decide to depend entirely and totally on the Spirit of God for your victory. Your strength, strategies, ideas, friends, church, family, finances, talents, skills etc. may be great and helpful, but will not by themselves push any mountain from your way. You need God "<strong>For it is not by might (personal strength or power) by my Sprit says the Lord. God is dependable and capable of meeting any need, if it’s according to His will. He is God of all flesh and nothing is impossible with Him (Jeremiah 32:27).</strong>

2. Determine in your heart to finish whatever you have started. Run to finish the race (<strong>1Corinthians 9: 24-27).</strong> Many people quit salvation, relationships, marriages, ministry, dreams and projects they started because they came a cross impossible mountains. Ze-rub-ba-bel, in the passage I referred to, was assure that if he stayed on, he would finish what he had started, <strong>not by his might but by the Spirit of God</strong>.

3. Despise not the days of small beginnings or small things. Rejoice over your small achievements and praise the Lord for them. Give thanks in all things at all times. Testify of the Lord’s power and provisions in your life. Exalt Him and give Him the glory for the great things He has done and has promised to do. Remember great things grow from small beginnings. Mighty oak trees grow from tiny seeds. There is a seed of greatness planted in you. It needs time for it to grow into its fullest potential. Trust God. Look up to Him for help. Your up look will determine your outlook. Let Him turn every mountain in your life into a flat plain. Blessings Boaz, Amen!

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 11:13-16, “These all died in faith, not having received the promise, but having seen them a far off, and were persuaded of them and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not a shamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city” </strong>

This passage of Scripture refers to the O.T saints who died with the faith that God had something better for them in store. What concerned them most was not when the promises were to be fulfilled but what they had to do in order to receive the promise.

<!--more-->

They were concerned also about the correct paths or ways they were to take to lead them to the promises in the now and then life. In their lifetime, they did not see the final promised blessing of the redeemed. Their primary hope was for was eternal life with God in a heavenly homeland (Where there is true homeland eternal security). They fixed their eyes on the new citizenship in the new heaven and new earth. See <strong>Isaiah 65:17 and Philippians 3:20 and Revelation 21:1.</strong>

The believers of today must likewise perceive correctly in faith their life’s destination and persevere in faith and trust in God, even when they do not see all the promises of God fulfilled in their lives.<strong> Believers must be ready and allow God to test their faith. For faith that cannot be tested cannot be trusted</strong>. On the long life’s journey to the destinations God has determined for us, one thing is critical, if we are to reach the destinations: and that is having correct map. A map is simply what shows the right way of getting to a destination from the point where one is. A map is about a territory. It is not the territory. It shows points and locations in the territory. Christians are citizens of two territories: the earth, where we live right now and the heavenly kingdom where we are headed. On earth, we are called pilgrims or strangers or sojourners. In other words, we don’t belong here permanently. Our permanent citizenship is heaven. But while we are here, on a journey, we have dreams, goals, wishes, hopes and desires which we would like to achieve, acquire or reach. And, it is in God’s best interest that we successfully reach the destinations. These things are in the territory of life. Do you know where they are? Do you know how to get there? Can you be able to tell when you arrive or whether you should still be on the road? These are important questions to ask on your way to your destiny.<strong> Faith is wonderful and you cannot do without it. But accurate roadmap is crucial. The Word of God is your accurate roadmap. It must be studied, correctly interpreted, understood and correctly applied</strong>. God has given the directions to all you could ever need or desire, in The Word. Use it. Don’t’ depend on your own knowledge or experience or assumptions, for direction. Worse still, do not depend on others who don’t have the correct map, don’t know the way and yet are always trying to give directions. Faith, correct perception of where you are headed and perseverance will lead you to receiving the promise. “<strong>Seek you first the Kingdom of God and all these other things shall be added unto you” Be independent most of the time; dependant on others sometimes; but, depend on God all the time for direction</strong>, strength to persevere and faith to receive the promise. Avoid any misguiding direction or information. Then, like the O.T saints, you will embrace the promises even if you don’t receive them.

<strong>“It is the way we “see” the world-not in terms of our visual sense of sight, but in terms of perceiving, understanding, interpreting, in light of God’s Word (which is what faith is) that determines how we choose paths that lead us to our desired destination” Blessings Boaz</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 39:6, “Thus he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate”</strong>.

To take a way a man’s freedom is to take away his reason for living. Watching inmates being interviewed especially those locked up in a confined environment talk candidly about what it means and feels to loose freedom. There are some who end up going crazy because their freedom is taken away due to what’s been done.<!--more-->

Recently I shared from <strong>Genesis 39</strong>, I feel compelled to look at it again as I gained additional insight off the passage. From <strong>Genesis 39-42</strong>, about 20 times the word ALL is used in reference to Joseph, which I find very important. The ALL I see deals with freedom given to him to act in different capacities. Going back to <strong>Genesis 39 </strong>where Portiphar made Joseph the overseer of ALL that he had, we see him living freely. Given freedom to control, direct, handle, in charge of all in Portiphar’s house. What is freedom? There are several definitions depending on the circumstance, for the sake of this message, I would define it as <strong>the ability to act freely or a state in which somebody is able to act and live as he or she chooses, without being subject to any undue restraints or restrictions. A state of independence</strong>. Joseph had that in Portiphar’s house. He was brought to be a slave, the way he lived suggested more than a slave.

Of course we know that freedom was taken away from him and confined in prison where he was no longer in charge of Portiphar’s house and his movement was restricted having been accused of attempted rape. All that he was in charge of was gone.

Who does not love freedom? Yet in the realm of our day to day, lives crave for freedom, however we have an enemy who wants to take that freedom away from us. There are people right now reading this who at one point felt freedom in certain areas of their lives but right now feel caged, imprisoned, bound because an enemy has done this, oppressed. The joy of being free is gone; you wake up each day feeling imprisoned in fear, doubt, depression, and defeat. Your financial situation has left you imprisoned to debt and you don’t feel freedom to serve the Lord like you should. Family situations, sickness have imprisoned you.

I have a word for us from the Lord, <strong>Psalm 146:7, “…The LORD gives freedom to the prisoners”, </strong>but for what purpose? To be free to just enjoy ourselves and do what we want? No, <strong>Free to serve Him</strong>. That ought to be the drive to desire freedom. When God said in Exodus that he heard the cry of His people the Israelites, He’s main reason for coming to their rescue was not to bring them to the promise land to escape their bondage, prisons and enjoy the land, it was to make them free that they may serve Him. <strong>Exodus 4: 22-23, "Then you (Moses) shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Israel is My son, My firstborn. 23 So I say to you, let My son go that he may serve Me</strong>”. Joseph had the same freedom to serve God in Portiphar’s house, even in prison and when he was elevated out of prison to be Portiphar’s boss. We also thank God for benefits too that come about when He frees us. <strong>John 8:36, “Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed”</strong>

Are you craving for freedom? Is this your cry? “<strong>God free me from my prison to freely serve You”?,</strong> this is my prayer, I am imprisoned in some areas of my life and only Him can free me from my prison and lead me to serve Him more and more freely. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 5:17-20, “17 Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with indignation, 18 and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. 19 But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, 20 “Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life.”</strong>

The disciples in early church as recorded in the book of Acts were powerful having been filled with the power of the Holy Ghost to be witnesses for Christ. After the departure of Christ, we see Peter assume the role of leadership over the disciples. We see him and the rest used mightily of God. The once upon a time coward Peter who denied Christ was bold enough under the unction of the Holy Spirit to preach Christ even to the point of being thrown in prison. <strong>Peter was no stranger to prison neither were some of the disciples as we read in the book of Acts</strong>.<!--more-->

In <strong>Acts 2</strong>, Peter preached the gospel and about three thousand people were converted, in <strong>Acts 3, </strong>Peter and John under the power of the Holy Ghost healed a man. They used the healing as a spring board to preach Christ which led to their arrest. We need to note that the devil is not happy when the work of God is in progress. He does not want God glorified; he would rather take the glory and not God. And as long as you are determined to bring glory to God where you are, be ready to be under attack. The enemy will always say, “<strong>throw down your weapon and I will leave you alone, stop serving and I will leave you alone</strong>”, he will threaten to take away your freedom, squeeze, frustrate, try to silence and get you overwhelmed. His aim is to stop God’s work whatever the cost.

While they threatened the disciples to take away their freedom, they prayed for boldness to continue to preach the word of God stopping at nothing. Continuing in power in the early church, the bible says, <strong>Acts 5:12-16,″12… through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon’s Porch. …. 14 And believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, 15 so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall on some of them. 16 Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed</strong>”. God’s work was on the move and this opened more to persecution.

Who tends to be a threat to the enemy? Those who are in the will of God, hungry to see Him glorified. Those who want to serve Him. Those who are not a threat are less under attack but those who have counted the cost and placed their lives on the line for the sake of Christ are opened to attack. And the attack I take a close notice of in the book of Acts is freedom taken away from God’s people so as to silence them from proclaiming what they had seen and heard. But God will not let the enemy prevail, <strong>Acts 5:17-20, “17 Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with indignation, 18 and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. 19 But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, 20 “Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life</strong>.” They imprisoned them, God sent His angel to free them for His service. You would wonder why the Lord would not prevent them from going to prison. I believe the Lord used those times to confirm to them that they were in His will, to strengthen their faith as He demonstrated His power, and to prove to those who wanted to silence His work His power.

Whenever you feel imprisoned for doing God’s work, the Lord will always provide a way of escape by opening the prison doors for your release to keep serving Him. Blessings Ev

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 21:12-14, "12 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. 13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. 14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done."</strong>

Stay the course is a term that one would hear from a leader, when one a mission, and is tempted to take an easier road. Scott Peck wrote a famous book, The Road Less Traveled, and Jesus said that there were two roads as well, the wide way and the narrow way. The narrow way is the road, or course, less traveled which is why Jesus said few find it (<strong>Matthew 7).<!--more--></strong>

The Apostle Paul seemed to always live his life on a mission. If you recall his life before his conversion, when his name was Saul, his mission was to kill Christians <strong>(Acts 9, 22)</strong>. When Paul was converted Jesus spoke to Ananias saying about Paul, “<strong>For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake", Acts 9:16. </strong>Although Paul would face suffering on the course that he was on for Jesus, he refused to be deterred. In the above verses, there were some well-meaning believers who tried to persuade Paul not to go up to Jerusalem for fear that Paul would be killed. Paul however would not be persuaded, or taken off course. What kept Paul to stay the course?

1. Paul’s eyes were fixed. <strong>Hebrews 12:2 </strong>reads, “<strong>Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” (NIV</strong>) Paul kept his eyes on Jesus and he knew that Jesus would keep His eyes on Paul. If Jesus calls you then He will keep you. Are your eyes fixed on Jesus as you make your daily decisions? What decision are trying to make, and is Jesus’ will even a factor in the process?

2. Paul did not swerve <strong>Proverb 4:27, “Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.</strong>” It’s easy to be deterred when your eyes are not fixed on Christ. One doesn’t intend to go off course; usually one slowly drifts away from the course. What causes you to swerve left or right? What are the obstacles? Have you identified your “course – deterrents?” Laziness? Time/business? Wrong or unbalanced priorities? If your lazy, stop; too busy, change it; priorities wrong, alter them. Stop swerving!

3. Paul was ready to die. <strong></strong><strong>1Corinthians 15:31, "I p</strong>rotest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily". Paul was even ready if need be to die for Jesus. Now I don’t want to die, however, Paul died to his selfishness, his agenda, his course, and embraced Jesus’ course for his life. Do you die daily to these things? At the end of Paul’s life he was able to say these words, which we should all hope to be able to say, “<strong>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith", 2Timothy 4:7. </strong>Will you be able to say that one day, will I? Will you STAY THE COURSE!

Dear Father, guide me to stay the course. Father help me to identify my course-deterrents. Help me to resist the temptations that enter my life, that push me off of Your will and plan for me. Lord, help me slow down and spend more quality time with You. Help me make the moment-by-moment decisions in my life that please You. Lord, forgive me for veering off Your course. I pray all this in Christ’s name, Amen. Blessings Pastor Phil

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Colossians 1:28, "... Christ in you, the hope of glory"</strong>

Most times, hopeless people have no reason to live. Most suicides are as a result of hopelessness. Over one million people commit suicide every year. The World Health Organization estimates that suicide is the thirteenth-leading cause of deaths worldwide. The National Safety Council rates it sixth in the United States. Suicide is the leading cause of death among teenagers and adults under 35. I further discovered that worldwide, an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal suicide attempts occur every year. In the midst of these startling statistics, I take comfort in knowing that hope keeps man alive. As long as hope remains alive, it doesn't matter what we go through, including pain and suffering because hope propels us to continue fighting until the end. People who lose hope throw in the towel and call it quits; however, hopeful people keep standing through time and seasons. Hope is an expectation and an anticipation; something to look forward to. Hope isn't about uncertainty, it's a certainty that just hasn't yet been realized.<!--more-->

<strong>Faith is the backbone that keeps hope alive.</strong> You hope for something that has not materialized yet. When you hope for something, you just can't stop thinking and talking about it, watching for it, and even waiting for it. In <strong>Luke 15</strong>, Jesus tells the parable of a father who had two sons. This is now famously referred to as “The prodigal son.” In the story, the younger son took his inheritance and went to a far country where he wasted it on a riotous living. When he finally came to his senses after spending everything, he decided to go back home. While he was gone, his father had been hoping, praying, waiting, and watching for him to come home. <strong>Luke 15:20 says “And he rose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.”</strong> His father didn't just see him passing by; he had been hoping that one day he would come home. Hope had been keeping him alive, and for that reason, he was never plagued with depression and fear. Hope will make you embrace promises and desires even they seem so distant. When the things you are hoping for finally appear, you will run to receive them.

<strong>Someone who is hopeful is at rest</strong>. The Psalmist says in <strong>Psalms 16:9, “Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh shall rest in hope.</strong>” Feeling restless is a painful situation to be in. People who are in “Hope” mode do different kinds of things to keep that hope alive. <strong>Psalm 71:14 says “But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</strong>” You can be in hope mode and still complain and wonder when the thing you are hoping for will come to fruition. The Psalmist said he would keep hope alive daily and consistently, and praise the Lord even more. Praising the Lord while in hope mode is vital because it keeps fueling the faith needed to trust the Lord even more, so you won't give up.

<strong>Colossians 1:28 says “Christ in you, the hope of glory...”</strong> Our greatest hope is in Christ. What a way to hope. He is always with us, and promises to never leave us. When we get discouraged and feel like giving up, His words of comfort and hope keep us alive, so we can trust Him. As He orders our steps and guides us, He teaches us to hope in Him even more. If he brought us this far, He will certainly take us even further. If He provided for us then, He will do it again. If He fought for us then, we hope that He will do it again. If He provided a job then, He will do it again. We must hope in Him all day long.

Have you lost hope in the possibility of getting married, being in ministry, and being used by the Lord? Have you lost hope in finding your desired career, achieving your goals and becoming somebody? If you have, don't let hope die because Christ lives in you. Keep living to the fullest and exercise the things that will keep your hope alive, and remember, “<strong>Christ in you, the hope of glory, the hope of splendor, of magnificence, of wonder, of brilliance, and of many more"</strong>

Keep Hope Alive!!!!! Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 45:4-5, 7-8 "Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come close to me." When they had done so, he said, "I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you."...... vs. 7-8 "But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt." NIV.</strong>

I have been reading the Bible from cover to cover and this is my 3rd time starting from Genesis and it always amazes me how every time I read the passages I already read before there is always a new revelation or a renewed understanding of what I am reading at the time. I am assuming we are all familiar with the story of Joseph, how his father Jacob loved him more than his other brothers and this resulted into jealousy among his brothers and they eventually sold him off to the Egyptians and they came back and lied to their father that Joseph died<!--more-->. I have always wondered if that was me and I survived like Joseph did, what I would want to do to my brothers, people that I thought loved me and were my own flesh and blood. Could you imagine the kind of feelings that would be going inside your heart? But what did Joseph do? I believe the first and the second time he encountered with his brothers he was tempted to revenge or get even but I believe he stopped himself because he was a man of God and he realized that what he was doing was not right.We all face or have faced or will face circumstances like Josephs' where your own people that you thought you could count on, sell you out. Family members that you thought had your back actually didn't and friends that you thought were closer than a brother were just pests. So when you come into that situation, what are we as Christians supposed to do? As humans we want revenge and we want them to suffer as much as we did, but is that the heart that a Christian should have? We are told in the bible that vengeance is of the Lord. So what do we do? We become the bigger people and return good for evil, we forgive even when it's clear that the other person ought to be the one asking for forgiveness. We live in harmony and peace as much as possible with our neighbors and we carry ourselves like Christians. We watch our tongues, what comes out of our mouths should not make people's heads turn with disbelief and wonder what kind of a Christian are you. We should truly love one another not just giving lip service but actually being it and doing it just as God loves us regardless of the many times we sin against him. And that's what Joseph did, he revealed to them who he was and told them not to  be afraid because I'm thinking they were afraid for their lives.

If you meet someone you did something awful to, you know you are in trouble because that person will want to give you a taste of your medicine. So they were terrified and Joseph tells them no worries, forget about everything, <span id="__mceDel"><span style="font-style:normal;">you guys actually did me a favor, and you know what? It was all God's doing, He allowed all this to happen because He knew you all would need help and I am your help. Isn't that amazing? Whereas sometimes or many times when we are faced with challenges like Joseph did, we want someone to blame instead of taking on that challenge as a blessing, a time to grow, to be pruned (as my husband would say), a time to reflect, and maybe a time to step back, relax and come back stronger and wiser and more blessed.</span><strong><span style="font-style:normal;"> A challenge can be a blessing if channeled correctly.</span></strong></span>

<span id="__mceDel">So my dear brothers and sisters, when faced with impossibilities and challenges, remember Joseph went through all that, even being put in prison for something he never did but he rose, he became the head, from the pit that he was, he became a ruler. Rise above whatever it is you a</span><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel">re facing and know that the Lord is fighting your battle, you are not alone! Believe it because we serve a mighty mighty God!! Blessings Judy</span></span>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 4:20-26-Verse 22, “You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for Salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. 24 God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth...”</strong>

If you are anything like me, every now and then, you probably find yourself meditating on something profound that you should have paid closer attention to in the first place to understand why it was done, so you can explain it to others. I have been meditating on this passage for about a week now. What does it mean to be a worshipful person or be in a worship service? The question isn't whether I know what being worshipful is, it's more of finding ways to articulate it to people in a way that makes sense, as I continue to discover more about the mysteries of worship.<!--more-->

I don't know whether the scripture clearly defines what worshiping God really is. I know what it means to worship Him, but I haven't been able to find a clear biblical text that defines it in its entirety. When I read the scriptures, I conclude that worship isn't limited to praising. In a broad perspective, it can be regarded as directly acknowledging God-his nature, attributes, ways and claims, whether by the outgoing of the heart in praise and thanksgiving, or by the deeds done to honor him. <strong>Worship goes with worthiness; ascribing to God’s greatness</strong>. True worship service is where Christ is exalted in and through us by the Spirit of God. Pastor Gregg Johnson, senior pastor of The Mission Church said <strong>“By His Spirit…For His glory.”</strong>

In <strong>John 4,</strong>Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman at the well and taught her what true worships is, amongst other things. Until that time, most people believed that only in a temple, and specifically at the tabernacle, could anyone truly worship God. But Christ came to establish a new thing. He came to clarify what true worship really is. He stressed the irrelevance of an actual geographical location or physical structure specifically set aside for worship. The place of worship isn't the essence of true worship because true worship is a state of heart and mind. In <strong>John 4:23</strong>, the Samaritan woman says <strong>“Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.”</strong> Worship isn't about where it is done, but how it is done. It has nothing to do with our outward appearance or our actions, but something much deeper than that. In verse 21 of the same chapter Jesus said to her<strong>, “Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.</strong>”

Matthew Henry made the following statement: “<em>As creatures, we worship the Father of all: as Christians, we worship the Father of our Lord Jesus. Now the change shall be, in the nature of the worship. Christians shall worship God, not in the ceremonial observances of the Mosaic institution, but in spiritual ordinances, consisting less in bodily exercise, and animated and invigorated more with divine power and energy. The way of worship which Christ has instituted is rational and intellectual, and refined from those external rites and ceremonies with which the Old-Testament worship was both clouded and clogged” </em>

Jesus reiterated that where we worship shouldn't be the primary focus (though at times it can be), but our attitude and the condition of our hearts. This is the first point I want to emphasis in this devotion. Worship is about how Christ is exalted above every word, thought and deed, in your heart, in your life, and through you “<strong>by His Spirit...for His glory</strong>.”

To be continued. Blessings Ev

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 4:20-26, “22 You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. 24 God is Spirit, and those who worship, Him must worship in spirit and truth.”</strong>

As Jesus mentions in this passage, Samaritans were worshipers. However, their only problem is that they did not know who they were worshipping. By the same token, I am convinced that in our churches today, many people come to worship a God they know little or nothing about. They may know about Him, but have little or no understanding of who He really is; most times, because they haven't studied His word enough to actually get to know Him.<!--more--> How can we worship the true God and still believe that there are many ways to Him? If we truly worship Him, how can we still believe in evolution, and conclude that abortion and homosexuality are not sin? How can we worship God and still embrace gambling and many other vile things that are contrary to the God revealed in the divine scriptures? Some people struggle with dealing and accepting because they are learning, the ones mentioned here are those who have bluntly rejected many of these truths and have acknowledged their way to be okay, they have even given seals of approvals. True worshipers know who their God is, and what He requires of them.

In<strong> Acts 17:16</strong>, Paul encountered the Jews and Gentiles in Athens. These people were very religious, they worshipped idols and other unknown gods. They worshipped gods, but they did not worship the true God because they had never been introduced to Him. They were zealous, but they lacked knowledge. In verse 22 and 23 of the same chapter, Paul says to them “<strong>vs. 22…Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; 23 for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you:” Acts 17:22-23.” </strong>The true worshippers of God the Father must worship him in spirit and truth. These two go hand in hand. By spirit, the scripture isn't referring to the Holy Spirit, but the human spirit--a willing heart. For true worship to occur, a willing heart must be accompanied by truth. God has magnified His Word above His name. I believe the reason for this is simply that believers may learn Biblical truth and turn their worship to Him in spirit and truth. This is one of the reasons I love the preaching of the Word. The preaching of the word exalts Christ, the God of the Bible, rather than the god of my choosing. Heaven and earth will pass away, but the Divine Word will not. With this understanding, the word is preeminent to every other form of manifestation.

Paul Washer, a preacher and missionary with Heart Cry Missionary Society said “<strong><em>Preaching is not the end for those who are hearing, but the means to worship</em>.” </strong>In <strong>Psalm 138:2,</strong>David says,<strong> “I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your loving kindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your word above all Your name.”</strong> The Lord had ordained a center of unity; a place of sacrifice and a house of His indwelling, and David accepted the type of worship revealed in the Lord's Word. Even so, a true-hearted believer in this day must not fall into the will worship of superstition, or the wild worship of skepticism, but worship reverently as the Lord Himself describes in His word. When Christ is exalted, the Word is the means to an end whereby which God is worshipped.

Jesus preached nothing but truth to the Samaritan woman at the well. He did not sugarcoat her sin; instead, He exposed her adulterous lifestyle, but stated that only in true repentance would she finally be able to worship the Holy and Just God. We see the same thing while Paul was preaching to the Athenians Therefore, let us adore the Lord who has spoken to us by His word, and by His Son. In the presence of unbelievers, let us both praise His holy Name and extol His Holy Word. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 1:16, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes …” </strong>

Since last week, the Lord has been dealing with me concerning the power that ought to be present in my life, and in other people as well, and I have found myself meditating heavily on this word “power.” Many people know about God's power. The question is this; is it present in our lives and are we craving to see it at work, or is it possible that the Lord has shut down his power in our lives because we are not hungry enough to actually cry out to Him for it?

<!--more-->

As I was meditating on <strong>Romans 1:16, </strong>I could not think of a more fitting story that highlights God's power more than that of Lazarus, who Jesus raised from the dead in <strong>John 11</strong>. I have seen people who I never possibly imagined could get saved, actually come to Christ, and I believe the Lord does this to constantly remind us of his saving power that comes through the gospel. I believe the Lord is calling on us to pray to Him to be empowered to share the gospel that He may save the lost. Allow me to borrow a few words shared by Ray Comfort and John McArthur, preachers I respect. First of all, Paul declares that the gospel is the power of God. <em>Dunamis</em> (power) is the Greek term from which our word <em>dynamite</em> is derived. <strong>The gospel carries with it the omnipotence of God, whose power alone is sufficient to save men from sin and give them eternal life</strong>.

In <strong>John 11</strong>, John reports to us that Lazarus had been dead and buried for four days. Jesus came to give life that no one else can give, and this was the message he had for Lazarus's sisters in <strong>John 11:25-26</strong> when he said <strong>“25 I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. 26 And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?” Only Christ in His sovereign power could give Lazarus life. It's this same power through the gospel that gives sinners life. </strong>If the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, how is it that there are people who can make professions of faith and not live it? Is it possible that the power of God actually never saved them in the first place? Ray Comfort in his message "Hell's best kept secret" shares this:

<em>"What it is is a sad admission of the amount of confidence we have in the power of our message and in the keeping power of God. If God has saved them, God will keep them. If they’re born of God, they’ll never die. If He’s begun a good work in them, He’ll complete it to that day (Philip. 1:6); if He’s the author of their faith, He’ll be the finisher of their faith (Heb. 12:2). He’s able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by Him (Heb. 7:25). He’s able to keep them from falling and present them faultless before the presence and glory with exceeding joy (Jude 24). Jesus said, “No one will pluck you from my father’s hand” (John 10:29). You see, saints, the problem is that Lazarus is four days dead (John 11). We can run in the tomb, we can pull him out, we can prop him up, we can open his eyes, but “he stinketh” (vs. 39). He needs to hear the voice of the Son of God. And the sinner is four days dead in his sins. We can run up and say, “Say this prayer.” Still, he needs to hear the voice of the Son of God, or there is no life in him; and the thing that primes the sinner’s ear to hear the voice of the Son of God is the law. It’s a schoolmaster to bring him to Christ that he might be justified through faith (Gal. 3:24)"</em>

<strong>John 11:38-39 says </strong>"<strong>38</strong> <strong>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.</strong>” If Christ had the power to bring life, He also had the power to remove the stone. But He told them to take away the stone. Although it's the power of God that gave life to Lazarus, we as believers have 3 tasks in removing stones from the tomb of unbelievers by simply being <strong>Christ-like before them, interceding and witnessing to them</strong>. That's all we can do to reach our unsaved loved ones and friends. Remember that Lazarus's sister called on Christ, and He encouraged them, and eventually gave life.

John McArthur comment on the salvation process says: <em><strong>"Only the power of God is able to overcome man’s sinful nature and impart spiritual life</strong>. <strong>Romans 5:6, “For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly” Salvation through Christ is God’s powerful hand, as it were, that He has let down to lift men up</strong>. His salvation brings deliverance from the spiritual infection of “this perverse generation” (Acts 2:40), from lostness (Matt. 18:11), from sin (Matt. 1:21), and from the wrath of God (Rom. 5:9). It brings deliverance to men from their gross and willful spiritual ignorance (Hos. 4:6; 2 Thess. 1:8), from their evil self-indulgence (Luke 14:26), and from the darkness of false religion (Col. 1:13; 1 Pet. 2:9), but only for those who believe.”</em>

<strong>When we LIVE, PRAY and WITNESS to the lost, the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit through the gospel will CONVINCE, CONVICT, CONVERT and CONTAIN.</strong> Blessings Ev.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 22:30-32, “31 And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.”</strong>

A true worshiper of God constantly hungers to walk in His will. We often wrestle to know if we are acting in the flesh or led of the Spirit. We want to know who is standing on our way, God or Satan. We want to know who is in control. Many times we blame Satan, (give him too much credit) when things are not going right we read his mission, <strong>John 10:10, "The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy..." </strong>His mission is not news to us, but is he the main issue?<!--more-->

The more I walk with God the more I realize that what God has blessed can no man curse or change it, not even Satan. Believers ought to take comfort in God, the One in charge of their lives. Before salvation we were under another ruler. When I study Scriptures, those who were possessed by the devil and cast out were not believers, if anything they were potential converts. They were under Satan’s dominion. At the point of salvation, we came under a new government, under new ownership. <b>This is why I believe those who are of God can only be oppressed by Satan and his agents and not owned by him. God is in control of believers lives.</b>

In this passage<strong> Luke 22:30-32, </strong>we see the oppression of Satan taking effect, however Jesus is in control the whole time only allowing Satan as an agent to sift Peter for something bigger to come. Jesus prayed for Peter’s faith not to fail, in other words, submit to God in faith and resist Satan in areas he was not permitted to touch.<strong> “31 And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.”, Luke 22:30-32. </strong>

This story is similar to that of Paul in <strong>2Corinthians 12. </strong>Paul had been to heaven, he tells the story though he speaks of himself in the third person to stay humble, he says Vs. “<strong>7 And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. 8 Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me, 9 And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong”, 2Corinthians 12:7-10. </strong> Paul knowing God was in control and allowed an agent of Satan to oppress him in some way, Paul in prayer submitted to God, and God gave him grace to resist yielding to more than what was permitted.

So why was Satan allowed in Peter, Paul and even Job’s case? To quote Zac Poonen,<em> “Why didn't Jesus say, "Simon I have prayed for you that you will not deny Me even once"? We would like the Lord to say to us "My son, my daughter, I have prayed for you that you will never fall and never fail." But interestingly enough, our Lord doesn't pray such a prayer for us. What did Jesus pray for Simon? <strong>That when Satan tempted him, his faith would not fail</strong>. He didn't pray that Peter should not fall in temptation, but that when he did fall, his faith in God's perfect love would not fail him so that even when Peter reached the bottom of the pit of failure, he would confess, "God still loves me". That is faith - and that is the confession we must always have on our lips and in our hearts - no matter how low we may have sunk or fallen - that God still loves us, JUST AS WE ARE,…<strong>The Lord uses Satan to remove the chaff from our lives to accomplish His purpose. Only through many experiences of failure do we finally reach a "zero point", where we're truly broken”</strong></em>

<strong>1Peter 5:5-11, “5 …“God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.” 6 Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, 7 casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you. 8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 9 Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. 10 But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you. 11 To Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen”</strong>

<strong>The more we feel the oppression from Satan, the more we ought to submit to God in prayers for therein lies the strength to resist him. If God is in control, we know that God is working all things (including the oppression from Satan) together for our good, Romans 8:28. To stay in God’s will over Satan, we have to constantly submit to God first, then resist for him to flee, James 4:7. Blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 5:17, “And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and the power of the Lord was present to heal them”</span></strong>

Forces against the workings of the Lord come in many ways, in those opposing times, in faith the Lord arises to demonstrate His power.

<!--more-->

It was Jesus custom to teach and perform miracles. On one particular day reported in <strong>Luke 5:17,</strong> He was teaching those who were opened to hear the Word of God, and there came from a far Pharisees and doctors of the law. You would imagine that they were there to hear the Word of God, contrary. An important binary in the NT is the opposition between law and love. Accordingly, the NT presents the Pharisees as obsessed with man-made rules, traditions (especially concerning purity) whereas Jesus is more concerned with God’s love. The Pharisees scorn sinners whereas Jesus seeks them out. They were always opposing what Jesus was doing. In the presence of all the opposing sides, the bible says, "...<b>them</b> <strong>power of the Lord was present to heal them"</strong>, who are them? those whose hearts were opened to receive by faith despite who they were.

We now have to understand the power talked about here and it’s effectiveness before we can see if we need it. Nelson’s New Illustrated Bible Dictionary defines <em>power as the ability or strength to perform an activity or deed. Power is sometimes used with the word authority. If power suggests physical strength, authority suggests a moral right or privilege</em>. Those born of God require power in their lives to live for God. Many times we do things in our own strength unaccompanied by the power of God. No person at no time, now or then could ever do anything that would please God apart from God’s power. <strong>Ephesians 3:20, “Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">according to the power that works in us</span></strong>”. I have quoted this verse many times, but today it hits me from a different angle and that is the last part “<strong>according to the POWER that works within us</strong>”. <strong>God is able to do more in  believers because of the presence of His power in them</strong>. <strong>I am learning that this verse is irrelevant in my life if the power is not first present. The last part enables the first part to be effective in one’s life</strong>. <strong>Acts 1:8</strong> tells us what drives the power, <strong>“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses…,"</strong> The disciples could not accomplish God’s work by their own strength, they needed power, not power for their own programs but power to fulfill the call of God in their lives for His glory.

Where there is power, there are opposing agents and we see it at the current situation with the Pharisees and the doctors of law when they appeared. Pharisees in this case are the discouraging agents and the doctors of the law represent facts closing every avenue of victories because they represent impossibilities. You and I have to learn that despite the Pharisees and the doctors of the law present, the power of the Lord is present to heal (not just physical). The power of the Lord was present before they arrived and their arrival did not change or minimize it, if anything, I say their presence intensified it. It was mighty to heal them; it was exerted and put forth to heal them, to heal their souls, to cure them of their spiritual diseases, and to give them a new life, a new nature.

We need to pray more that God will empower us with His Holy Sprit and then according to the power that works within us, we can be healed both spiritual and physical of whatever we are facing. You may have been trying to break a habit by yourself, God’s power is present to heal you of it. You may have opposing factors, may you be reminded they have no ability to terminate the power. It’s there for you and for me. A victorious life is not out of human strength. You cannot be saved without it and you cannot concur sin without it. Let’s call on God to increase His power in us, blessings Ev.

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 24:31-32, “And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, ‘Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?’</strong>”

What makes you burn inside and really come alive? What is that sporting event that you shout for your team? I can reference all the Yankee fans here in NYC that screams when the Yankees play and beat their rivals the Boston Red Sox. <!--more-->Would you come alive if you got that raise at work, or as lawyer won that case or perhaps you were a salesperson and made a big sale? Hiking, swimming, hobbies, computers, dating someone, etc… are some various things that bring life to people. Perhaps the thing that make you burn with enthusiasm and life was not on the list, but you know what that thing is that makes your heart race. In this passage the thing that made hearts burn, and really come alive was the words that Jesus spoke.

This is the passage of Scripture occurs between the resurrection and the ascension, in the 40-day span of time that Jesus has been raised from the dead, but not yet ascended to the right hand of the Father. The women go to visit the tomb that Jesus had been placed in and they find it vacant. They run and tell the disciples and Peter’s feet couldn’t move fast enough to get to the tomb and discover the truth of the women’s news. And they made their way back to where the rest of the disciples were reminiscing along the way as to their hearts burning while Jesus talked with them by the way (on the road) and when He opened the Scriptures to them. These had a zeal for the very words of Christ. I asked what makes you come alive; now let me ask you, do the Scriptures make you come alive? Is there a burn in your heart as God speaks to you through them, as you discover something new in that passage you’ve read many times before, and if not why not? The early Christians are not really so different from us. At one time it was tax collecting for Matthew, bringing in the big catch for the fisherman, and healing that last patient for Luke, that made these men burn with life. But now, I believe that those temporal things were superseded by the life of God’s Word, as their hearts burned at one time for the temporal, now they burned for the spiritual. Jesus said, <strong><em>“</em>My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work</strong>,” Because it was Jesus’ sustenance. Where is God’s will found, but in His word. Christian, where is your burning heart for God’s Word? If reading these devotions, and Sunday morning church, or mid-week Bible study is all your time in God’s Word, then it’s obvious that you’re not reading for yourself, only being spoon fed by others. I believe it was Charles Spurgeon who said, “<em>Some of you have so much dust on your Bible that you could write the word damnation with your finger</em>.”

Think about it, the hearts of the disciples burned for His Word so much that we have four gospels to tell of the things they had seen and heard as reliable eyewitnesses of Jesus.

Why is there testimony not the testimony of believers today? I too get excited about some temporal things, but it does not compare with my excitement over spiritual things. Think of Jeremiah who said <strong>“I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay</strong>.” He tried to keep from preaching God’s Word but like trying to throw gasoline on a forest fire, the flames in his heart blazed out and he had to preach what was in him, because he couldn’t put a lid on it! God was the consuming fire with Moses on Mt. Sinai, “<strong>For our God is a consuming fire and a jealous God Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: (see Duet 4:24, Hebrews 12:28-29).”</strong>

<strong>Application: Are you consumed? Does your heart burn like Jeremiah, like the early church? Is your Bible your daily bread that you are enthused about? If so keep it up, if not I challenge you to read at least 15 min a day, record what God is saying to you, and obey what you read. Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Kings 19:1-10, “2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.” 3 And when he saw that, he arose and ran for his life, … 4 … <span style="text-decoration:underline;">And he prayed that he might die, and said, “It is enough! Now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!”</span></strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image11.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-6412 alignleft" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image11.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="206" /></a></strong>

One area I have noticed that cripple believers is the area of depression, of course this is something that plagues mankind. I see many on medication to suppress or treat depression. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us have felt this way at one time or another for short or longer periods of time. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer. For this reason I think it is one major cause for suicide.<!--more-->

In <strong>1Kings 18</strong>, we see Elijah gain huge victory over the prophets of Baal when he called fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice he set before the Lord. He demonstrated to the people that there was(is) only one true God. He witnessed the prophets of Baal call on their false god who failed to answer them and Elijah had them killed. Ahab goes home and tells his mean, nasty wife of what Elijah had done. <strong>Vs. 2 “Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time”</strong>. Hearing such news would sadden you immediately especially from a person you know is capable making it happen. Jezebel declared Elijah a dead man. Instead of Elijah being bold representing the God of heaven as he did on mount Carmel, <strong>vs. 3 </strong>says<strong>, "... he arose and ran for his life, and went to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there”. </strong>He forgot God who had given him victory and shifted his attention on what he heard from Jezebel. As he runs for his life, he abandons his servant to be by himself and have a pity party if you ask me. Depression will do this to you, isolate you from people causing you to want to be alone to cry out "woe is me".

<strong>Vs. 4”… . And he (Elijah) prayed that he might die, and said, “It is enough! Now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!”. </strong>If this could happen to a prophet of God, you may face or are already facing this thing called depression. He became suicidal, desired death, lost hope, lost strength. He forgot his mission and all he could do is sit under a broom tree and wish for death.

I love how the Lord dealt with his depression, <strong>vs. 5-8, “5 Then as he lay and slept under a broom tree, suddenly an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise and eat.” 6 Then he looked, and there by his head was a cake baked on coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and lay down again. 7 And the angel of the LORD came back the second time, and touched him, and said, “Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.” 8 So he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God”. </strong>Instead of the Lord giving him his wish, the Lord knew what he needed best and that was rest, rest in Him. That rest also needed to be fueled with food and water.

This is what we need in our depressing times, rest in the Lord, His Word as our food and His Spirit like water to our soul for the journey ahead is long.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> The Lord is not done with making much of Himself thorough the vessels He has raised to show Himself strong on behalf of those that </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">trust in Him</span><b>. Psalm 37:7-8, “7 </b><strong>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass. 8 cease from anger, and forsake wrath; Do not fret—it only causes harm”. </strong>Have you been dealing with minor depressions because of the Jezebel’s threatening everything in your life causing you to flee? Where are you fleeing to? I run to the Lord and not from the Lord. When God revived Elijah with rest, food and water, it gave him enough strength to carry him through 40 days and 40 nights.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The Depressed need to proclaim healing in stead of believing the lies of having a lifelong condition with the hopelessness of a stigmatic labeling diagnosis that more often than not, are treated with longstanding damaging medication treatments. The darkness of such trickery that feeds into the pharmaceutical greed does not come from a good place, nor is it a place of health of mind, body or spirit of a person that is in a personal relationship with Jesus. It is by His stripes that we can be and are ultimately healed. It is in standing on our faith in Him and Him alone, that the ultimate physician and Father God provides to those who believe. For to know the Lord is to know of His grace, love, mercy and the power of prayer or professing and standing on His word...not the word of man, and not dependent on man. 

For the Word tells us in 2 Timothy 1:7 For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.

2 Corinthians 5 Describes and affirms our belief in Father Son and Holy Spirit, whereas, it is in our alone times with the Lord, or as others claim it to be in Isolation or Depressed state of being....Perhaps those prone to depression are ultra sensitive to the Lord with burdened hearts as He hath provided them with. Who are any of us to project or determine what constitutes a difference between a longing for peace and rest in the Lord separate from the worldly opinions that are at times medically unsound doctrine that further harms ones body with poisonous toxic medications?

Should we not then understand that we do not fight against flesh, but principalities and the oppressor who seeks to kill and destroy? Should we not see through the deception of what is known as conditions that humans get when not relying on the Lord?  2 Cor 5:13 For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; or if we are of sound mind, it is for you.
  
Do we question Jesus and His state of mind after he had accepted and obeyed His Father knowing of the death he would endure for humanity? Do we suggest that Jesus was depressed? Do we state He was suicidal? Do we judge Him for the wilderness, the alone time, and the fervent prayers, tears, or afflictions of the burdens that He so carried? Certainly, that would be such an incorrect assumption. To be alone and at rest with the Lord is meant to be an isolated occurrence, not seen by man, done in secret, where our prayers and supplications are made known to God and God alone in the name of Jesus. With or without depression, we are human and we have human emotion of our flesh. It is in the Spirit that we are overcomer's capable of receiving complete wholeness through the healing blood of Christ. It is our hearts that are transformed, and our lives that give testimony to the works He has done.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 24:44-45, “44 He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” 45 Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures” (NIV)</strong>

What troubled me for a while was listening to a very learned person misunderstand scriptures. I mean someone with more degrees than a thermometer read a scripture passage and miss the whole point of the passage. They get everything else but the scripture despite the fact they have read it over and over again. How many times have we also read verses after verses and it was plain, then one day as we were reading it again, it became alive. <strong>Anyone can read the scriptures, only God can give understanding to His Word. </strong>The devil knows the scriptures, he tempted Jesus with it, the only thing he does not understand it.<!--more-->

<strong>Understanding is revelation only God gives to those whom He has opened their hearts.</strong> As I have said already, we can hear the word or even read it yet without understanding, it will not make sense or be of any benefit to us. Jesus shared with His disciples of the things that were to be fulfilled. They heard what He said but it did not make sense to them. They even forgot what He said. Then after it was all fulfilled, He reminded them again of what He had told them and the bible adds another verse to show us something profound,<strong> vs. 45 "Then He opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures”</strong>

I don’t want to read for the sake of reading, I want to read with understanding and understanding is revelation from God. Do you know “<strong>salvation is revelation”?</strong> It is revelation that comes about where God takes His spoken Word and makes it alive in a person He is saving so that they understand who they are as sinners and what He has done for them in Christ and they respond in repentance and faith. In <strong>Acts 8</strong>, we are told of how God sent Phillip the evangelist to meet an Ethiopian Eunuch whose heart was open to read God’s word. <strong>Acts 8:30-31, “30 So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do you understand what you are reading?</span>” 31 And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him”.</strong> This man was reading with no understanding until God sent Phillip,<strong>vs. 35 “Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him</strong>”. Only God could give understanding of the scripture through Phillip to this man because God opened His heart.

We have another example in <strong>Acts 16:14, “Now a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Lord opened her heart to heed</span> the things spoken by Paul”</strong>. Paul's preaching would have no bearing on Lydia unless the Lord opened her heart as He did. If God opened our hearts to heed to the gospel, are we continuing to pray that He opens our hearts to understand what we are reading? You could be reading the bible for the sake of reading it, are you praying for understanding (revelation)? That His word becomes alive in you. The word is ever alive, my question to us all, is it alive in US? <strong>1John 5:20, “And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">understanding, that we may know Him who is true</span>; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life”, blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 15:1-23, "...Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice..."</strong>

Making a promise you can't keep isn't advisable. People generally have a tendency to make promises they have no intention of keeping, or have the ability to keep. This problem is consistent even in ministry. Often, someone will say “I will be there” for particular event, but fail to show up without ample notice. If you had project lined up for them to do, making last minute preparations and adjustments for adequate cover becomes difficult and frustrating. <strong>Ecclesiastes 5:4-5 says “4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it; For He has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you have vowed 5. Better not to vow than to vow and not pay it" <em></em></strong>Every good thing we do must be done to the glory of the Lord; therefore, anytime we make a vow, let's remember that we are doing it unto the Lord; better not to promise than fail to keep a promise.<!--more-->

What I'm sharing here is in relations to aiming at a target with a gun, but failing to fire a bullet, or actually firing a bullet, but missing the target all together. Law enforcement personnel, such as soldiers and police officers are trained to hit targets precisely or they will not be of any use to their task force. Frustration is inevitable when firing hundreds of bullets results in nothing more than missed targets. Missing a target, both in practice, and in the line of duty, can cost lives. In <b>1Samuel</b>, God appointed Saul as the first King of Israel via Samuel's anointing oil. The Lord appointed him to lead the Israelites, but in <strong>chapter 15:3</strong>, Saul disobeyed specific instructions assigned to him in the special task God had commissioned. <strong>1Samuel 15:3</strong> says,<strong> “Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them. But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.” </strong>The instructions were clear and specific: destroy everything. The Amalekites had ambushed the Israelites; therefore, God's judgment was upon them. Could the Lord's instructions to Saul have been any clearer? I don't think they needed additional interpretation. Let's read a little further to find out what Saul did. Verse 4 and 5 of the same chapter says <strong>"4 So Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah. 5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek..." </strong>Saul accepted the assignment, and saw his target as the Lord had explained. He even gathered soldiers and moved towards his target, an indication that he was firing his bullet. Verse 7 says <strong>"And Saul attacked the Amalekites.” </strong>From the surface, it sounds like Saul did exactly what God had asked him to do, but verse 9 says “<strong>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were unwilling to utterly destroy them. But everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.” </strong>Saul missed the target when he failed to destroy everyone and everything. Even if you are part of God's plan, failing to do what He asks is tragic. You've heard people say “he hit the bullseye,” a metaphor that refers to hitting the center of a target. In Saul's case, he missed the bullseye, because he only destroyed the people and things he rendered worthless. We are often guilty of disobedience when the Lord asks that we rid our lives of junk, we only eliminate the things that are worthless in our sight, and keep those we still consider dear to our hearts. I call this <strong>“the bullet that fired, but missed the target.” </strong>Missing the target is contrary to God's will. You can even be in ministry but be outside God’s will (target), living in disobedience.

When confronted with truth, lies and cover-ups are the greatest disservice we can do to ourselves. A lie can only be covered for a certain period before it is exposed. Lying to God is one of the worst things we can do: remember, He knows our thoughts and sees our actions. Whatever is done in secret will be brought to light on the day of judgment. You can cover up your secrets and lies all you want, but at some point, you will have to come clean because He can convict you through your conscience. Saul thought that he had done God's will, but he had actually disobeyed Him. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 15:1-23, "...Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice..."</strong>

In part one of this devotion, we looked at Saul, a man who fired the gun God gave him, but missed the target because he failed to complete his given task in its entirety. He did what he thought was best, hoping that God would be pleased with him. In the second part of this devotion, let's see how Saul tried to cover up his shortcoming.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. "13 Then Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, "Blessed are you of the Lord! I have performed the commandments of the Lord (1 Samuel 15:13).”</strong> Saul did not fear the Lord because he thought he could fool Samuel, the prophet who initially anointed him as King of Israel. There is a similar situation in the book of Acts where a couple told Peter that they had sold everything and given their earnings to the Lord, but in reality, they only presented part of it. Like Saul, they lied to the Holy Spirit, and completely missed the target. Their case was slightly different from Saul's in that their failure to honor their vow to the Lord cost them their lives. No one asked or forced them to make the vow; they did it out of their own volition. As for Saul, his instructions were clear as day; therefore, his disobedience was inexcusable. His first lie was claiming to have accomplished all that God had commanded. Vs. <strong>"14 But Samuel said, "What is then is the bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear (1 Samuel 15:14).”</strong>As they usually say, “busted!” Saul had been caught in his lie. To cover his first lie, Saul went on to say that he destroyed everyone, except a few people and items he spared as sacrifice to the Lord. As Samuel confronted him even further, he insisted that he had fulfilled the Lord's commandments. Later on, we discover that he had also spared king Agag, who he should have also destroyed.<strong>1John 1:8</strong> says <b>""If w</b><strong>e say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.” </strong>This scripture sums up the whole nature of man as sinful, and no matter how much we try, we can never completely fulfill the Lord's requirements. The Bible also says, <strong>“Our righteousness is as filthy rugs,” </strong>not just our sins. With this understanding, we know that in men's eyes, even the best that we offer the Lord is not good enough because we are still sinful by nature. We have to openly approach God with all our failures, weaknesses, and the things we are holding on to we should have destroyed in the first place, and confess that we have sinned.

In <strong>Psalms 139:23-24,</strong> David says <strong>"Search me, O God and know my heart, Try me and know my thoughts. And see if there is any wicked way on me. And lead me in the way of everlasting.” </strong>David understood that what he didn't consider sin could actually be sin in God's eyes. What a way to come to the Lord and say<i> “it doesn't matter whether I feel holy today, search me and be the final Judge. I give you permission to perform surgery. Check what'sinsideof me, and if there be sin, cleanse me.”</i>

Saul not only stood by his disobedient actions, he justified them, which ultimately brought about his downfall. Here is how he missed his target: <strong>1Samuel 15:22 says "So Samuel said, "Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings, As in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice.” </strong>In Saul's case, obedience was the target. Desiring to honor the Lord with sacrifices was notable, but disobeying what he had been clearly instructed to, and then attempting a cover-up was wrong (missed target). In vs. 23, Samuel defined his sin when he said <strong>“For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. And stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.” </strong>What a way to define disobedience. The children of Israel disobeyed God countless times, and so do we. The Bible says that stubbornness is as a spirit of witchcraft. To me, this shows that disobeying God, parents, and leaders is a terrible thing. It's not about what we want and what we consider good, It is obeying what we've been asked to do, as long as it's in line with God's word. What you are asked to do may sound stupid, ridiculous, and you may even have a better way of going about it, but obedience is pivotal. If you mess up, covering your mistakes, or blaming others for them is not the way to go about things: coming to God and crying out to Him shows repentance. <strong>1John 1:9,</strong><strong> "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” </strong>

Aim for the target God has set before you. Fire your bullet towards the target, be faithful in everything you do, and keep your promises. Blessings Ev.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 17:11-19, “And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks”</strong>

In January 2009, a miracle was witnessed in New York where an airbus flight 1549 carrying 155 passengers crashed into Hudson river with the plane remaining intact. All the passengers lived making it one of the greatest miracles I have witnessed reported on media.<!--more--> I believe some people on board realized something was wrong with the plane and regardless of their beliefs took an opportunity to cry out to God for mercy. This reminded me of <strong>Luke 17</strong> where Jesus was on a journey to Jerusalem. His journey required Him to pass through Samaria and Galilee and <strong>vs. </strong>says, “<strong>12</strong> <strong>Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off. 13 And they lifted up their voices and said, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”. </strong>The timing strikes me, there had to be more than ten lepers in that city, these ten happen to be present at the time Jesus was passing by, It was their day of miracle. In their present situation, they lifted up their voices and pleaded for mercy. What did Jesus do, immediately,<strong> vs. 14, “…He said to them, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed”. </strong>It was like saying<strong>, </strong>I have heard your cry, I have provided a way, go and testify to the priest what happened. The plane that landed on the Hudson River, God had already prepared away regardless of what it was. <strong>This kind of plane may have never been designed to land on water; only God could make it work. Who do we thank?</strong>

What amazes me about the lepers story is not so much the miracle but the action right after, the bible says, <strong>Luke 17:15, “And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks”. </strong> This verse indicates that out of the ten who were immediately healed, one turned around before even reaching the priest, came back and with a LOUD VOICE GLORIFIED GOD, fell down on his face at His feet, GIVING HIM THANKS”. What a heart of gratitude. He understood nothing just happens, he knew he did not deserve the healing he received, there were more lepers who missed that opportunity. What made him better than the rest? nothing and he knew that. He came back with sacrifices of praise. It could have been worse but God! Watching people being interviewed after the crash, I was a little disappointed because few came back to praise God for the miracle yet many sought for His help. And if not all on board prayed, someone in that plane prayed that they would ALL make it. <b>Much was said of what happened; little was said about God in the matter.</b> It would have been easy to blame God if something really went wrong and lives were lost, but what about now? Maybe there are some thanking God who never made it on TV but they, like the one leper came back to give thanks. Despite the people God used to make all go well, who is the Hero in the picture? I woke up that morning thanking God for the miracle, lives He spared. Unsaved people were on board who would have passed into eternity without Christ, children were on board, it would have been worse. He proved to us again that He is God and nothing is too difficult for Him. That He is the God of 11:59, when you think it’s over, He does something breath taking. Who do we thank?

Jesus paints to us a picture of how we can be ungrateful sometimes, He says, “<strong>17 “… “Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? 18 Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?</strong>” The other 9 took the miracle and moved on with their lives. Could it be possible that when Jesus said to all the ten to go and show themselves, He wanted to see if they would see a need to give thanks when they got healed? Only God knows. The rest went to live their lives as though nothing happened, maybe they thought they deserved the healing, one man new better, he deserved nothing but received something. As Ravi Zacharias says, “<em>while the kids thank Santa for putting candy in their socks, who do I thank for putting two feet in mine?”.</em>

I am a firm believer that nothing just happens, there is always a reason. If I was to trace back my life and family from the age I can remember, I can completely see the hand of God in every stage. Even before I became a Christian, I knew the workings of the Lord. The Lord was gracious many times to hear my cry. Not too long ago while praying on Saturday morning, I began to recall how some of my family members escaped near death experiences and sickness that could not be detected by the doctors. Two of my brothers survived hot water burns at different times when they were young, one of my brothers who survived water burn almost drowned in his teenage years in a dam and recently survived ladder fall, my dad survived a street attack and stomach ulcers, I did too escape street attack and almost drowned twice, my mom, dad and brother got healed of diseases that could not be detected, another survived a fall and just this week, my brother Andrew survived a fall that nearly took his life, but God. Who do I thank for all these miracles? How about you, if you were to sit and begin to recall more detailed account of your life and family and how you’ve made it this far, who would you thank for making it this far? Have you thanked God for yesterday’s miracles? Oh it’s so good to give thanks unto the Lord. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 9:1-38, “25 He answered and said, “Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.”</strong>

What runs through your mind when you face something that appears to be a challenge or a struggle? The first thought possible and common question, “what did I do wrong”? We equate the challenge to be a punishment for something we may have done wrong. We begin to scan our memories of what it could be. <!--more-->We see it with the disciples when they encountered with a man who was born blind. <strong>John 9:2-3, “2 And His disciples asked Him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” and 3, “Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him".</strong> To the disciples, there had to be a cause and that cause to their thinking had to do with sin. Jesus had a different response.

It is interesting to see how Jesus healed this man. Naaman was told to go and wash in river Jordan 7 times, he had a problem with that. As for this man in <strong>John 9</strong>, Jesus spat on the ground, made clay and anointed his eyes. Here is what got me, imagine a blind person who desires his eyes opened, you take something thick and you apply it in his eyes and then tell him to go and wash in the pool of Siloam? How can a blind man lead his way to the pool? Why is Jesus making it even tougher for him? Here is what I believe, in as much as this man needed the physical healing, Jesus wanted to demonstrate that He needed spiritual eyes to see things the natural eyes could never see. I believe the Spirit of God directed this man to the right pool. The Spirit was like that cane the blind use to find their way. It also shows that though Jesus gave him spiritual eyes, He cared about him to give also physical. <b>He dealt with the spiritual then physical.</b>

This man who we are not even given his name humbles himself, builds faith and moves as commanded. So he goes to the pool and washes, scales falls off his eyes and he comes back seeing. Here is another thing that got me, the bible says he was born blind, it is not recorded if he had ever been to that pool and even if he did, he would not know which way. But Jesus performed a miracle because we see him come back with his eyes opened and knows where to go. Does this show us that the same Spirit that led him to the pool blind is the same Spirit that led him back seeing? This shows that when we are touched and healed, it is not the end but the beginning. He came back rejoicing and became a voice and a testimony to many.

The testimony was so huge that they kept asking him how his eyes were opened and he kept on testifying how Jesus opened his eyes. The Pharisees kept on asking him many questions hoping that he would change his story but he would not.

With so much pressure on him, and Jesus having been called all sought of things, he stood firm and proclaimed his healing testimony, <strong>John 9:25, “He answered and said, “Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.</strong>” No one can take away what God has done in your life. The enemy might whisper in your ear that you are not healed and even try and convince you that Jesus did not do it, that it happened by chance or the doctors did it.<strong> Do you see that he did not even say the pool healed him? </strong>he knew Jesus did it, going to the pool was a demonstration of faith and obedience. I love his final strong testimony before they kicked him out of the temple,<strong> vs. 30-33, “30 The man answered and said to them, “Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes! 31Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him. 32, Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. 33 If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing."</strong> He healed me, period, he delivered me!!! Nothing can talk me out of what He did and nothing can talk you out of what He did if you stand firm in your testimony. Let the enemy whisper all he wants, He can’t take what you don’t give him.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 22:1-19, “9 Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood”.</strong>

With the help of God through His Word, I would like to paint a picture of what I believe a young man’s honor to his father should be by looking at an episode where Isaac is led of his father to be sacrificed. The Bible does not give Isaac’s specific age when God asked Abraham to sacrifice him, but there are events surrounding Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac which gives us clues. Most scholars believe that Isaac was in his late teen’s or early twenties at the time of the offering.<!--more-->

To show that Isaac may have not been a young child, we see him old enough to travel three days with Abraham without his mother. His conversation with Abraham is that of an older child or a young adult. Finally, Isaac is the one who carried the wood for the sacrifice up the mountain (<strong>Genesis 22:6</strong>). The latter is strong evidence that Isaac was no longer a small child and serves as the main reason that our best guess is that he was at least in his late teens or early 20′s.

If Isaac was in his late teens or early 20′s while his father was over 100 years old, we can conclude that Isaac was willing to obey his father even to the point of death. Mathew Henry paints a picture, “<em>Isaac, for aught that appears, is as willing as Abraham; we do not find that he raised any objection against it, that he petitioned for his life, that he attempted to make his escape, much less that he struggled with his aged father, or made any resistance: Abraham does it, God will have it done, and Isaac has learnt to submit to both, Abraham no doubt comforting him with the same hopes with which he himself by faith was comforted. Yet it is necessary that a sacrifice be bound. The great sacrifice, which in the fullness of time was to be offered up, must be bound, and therefore so must Isaac. But with what heart could tender Abraham tie those guiltless hands, which perhaps had often been lifted up to ask his blessing, and stretched out to embrace him, and were now the more straitly bound with the cords of love and duty! However, it must be done”</em>

I can only imagine father and son sticking side by side encouraging each other. Abraham had already lost his first son Ishmael who was sent away with his mother, the Lord was fine with it. Here comes Isaac, the only promised son God required Abraham to, the son who he loved. At a young age where he could have driven his father to an early grave with his life, one episode tells it all, a willing son honoring his father. This is how best I could imagine Isaac speaking to his father, “I know that you honor God first more than anything else and I know that you love me regardless of what is asked of you, I am ready to glorify God by obeying as you fulfill the call of God through me, this is my HONOR TO YOU”.

I believe Isaac was more of an encouragement to his father the most when he needed that encouragement, he looked like the victim but he wasn’t. Only God could give and could take way. The servants who came with them could have discouraged him from sacrificing his son but here is a young man who carries what is required for sacrifice only to discover he is the sacrifice and still be willing to go through it. This is a son a father is proud of, a son that God blesses. <strong>If there is a young man or young woman who claims to fear God and does not honor their father and mother, it’s nothing to God</strong>. The honor may not necessarily mean that they deserve it, parents fail like anyone else, the whole reason for honor is a means of glorifying God. God has placed parents in strategic places for a reason. Honor of Isaac has taught me a lot. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 10:9, "then He said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God.” He takes away the first that He may establish the second"</strong>

It amazes me  how God does not do things according to the way we think. He always takes a different turn and just when you think you have figured Him out, He does something that blows your mind and you are back seeking to know more. Over and over again I see God raising the unexpected, the one that the blessing was not secured for by man's standards, is the one He raises. <!--more-->When You look at Cain and Abel, the blessing rests on Abel, looking at Esau and Jacob, the blessing rests on Jacob, the prodigal son and his older brother, the blessing rests on the unexpected. Abel, Jacob, and the prodigal son have one thing in common, they are second born and no one ever expected them to be blessed. Why is this important? simple, God is in the business of raising the second (the unexpected).

The first tends to be stubborn and unwilling to humble himself or bend therefore God always bypasses the first to establish the second. God bypassed Adam the first man created to send Jesus His Only begotten Son, the last Adam. What Adam messed up, Jesus came to fix it. Jesus came to undo what Adam did.

<strong>Hebrews 10:9</strong>, the theme verse of my life starts by saying, <strong>"He said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will", </strong>Jesus came to do the will of the Father, the mark of obedience in the second. For God to build the second, the layer of the first has to come off that the tender heart of the second may be established. While the first may desire to do things his own way, the second is seeking ways to do the will of the Father. In the world we were like the first stubborn born and God had to bypass all that to bring out the inner child inside of us that receives Him by faith, that is our second birth. <strong>Mark 10:15, "Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.” </strong>It's not the sophisticated, all knowing and good looking He raises, He raises the weak, the one who feels he is unable but yet available.

The word "establish" means to bring about, to place or settle. What's God word saying to us "<strong>He takes away the first that He may establish the second"</strong>. Are you glad that He has called you in spite of your weaknesses, failures, insecurities to establish you simply because you were willing to do His will? He bypassed everything you knew about yourself to build the inner child kind of faith He has placed there. What you placed second in your life is what He has come to establish. What you never thought He could use is what He is establishing. Our prayer today, Lord establish in our lives what we placed second, insignificant and unexpected. Bypass our pride, arrogance, stubborn and establish our faith, hope, confidence and humility to concur the first. As you establish us, establish all that you have brought in our lives. Establish our finances, marriages, children, jobs, ministries etc. as we yield to Your will. Bypassing the first to establish the second is a very humbling experience. Blessings Ev

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 6:10-20, "Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil"</strong>

<strong>To fight effectively in your spiritual battle, you must know Christ, obey His standards by submission, and be prepared to fight</strong>. Anyone in Christ is a target as Jesus was in the wilderness by Satan.

Paul in his conclusion in writing to the Ephesians, begins in <strong>6:10</strong> by saying,<strong> "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might"</strong>. I find it very important to pay attention to the last words, they sum up everything that has already been said.<!--more-->He shares with them on how to be strong, <strong>“In the power of His might”, </strong>derived from I believe <strong>Zechariah 4:6, "... Not by might, not by power but by My Spirit, says the Lord of hosts</strong>". It's clear that by “His might” would mean by “His Spirit” because God empowers us through Him.

<strong>Vs. 11, "Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil</strong>". It will be beneficial to define armor to understand why we need to put it on.<strong> Armor is a defensive, as of metal, wood, or leather, worn to protect the body against weapons</strong>. So we can say that we have weapons formed against us always flying to destroy us, we need protection. To know that we are at war, let <strong>vs. 12</strong> bring it to light, "<strong>For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places".</strong> I don't want to concentrate so much on what we fight against, I want to dwell on how to get ready for it.

<strong>Vs 14, "Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth</strong>", What really holds us together is the truth, the truth becomes the belt that holds what we know dearly. The truth tightens and chocks out every lie. "<strong>Having put on the breast plate of righteousness</strong>", this is like putting on the bullet proof vest to protect the most sensitive parts of the body. The bible says in <strong>Proverbs 4:23, "Keep thy heart will diligence, for out of it are the issues of life</strong>". That is where life begins for a Christian and that is a place that must be girded well, it defines who we are in Christ. <strong>vs. 15. "Having shod your feet with the preparation of gospel of peace</strong>", a soldier is someone who is ready to march into the battle field. His aim is to defeat the enemy, win and rescue those held captive in sin.

<strong>Vs. 16. "Above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked one</strong>". If you are going to win, you must have a shield, something to strengthen what you already have. The neat thing about the shield, it can be used to protect every part of the body not like the other gadgets that are used to protect a particular area. Faith defends the truth, the heart, the feet, etc. <strong>Hebrews 11:6, "without faith, it is impossible to please Him..." </strong>This means we can have everything but without the shield, we will not please Him the reason the bible says "<strong>ABOVE ALL TAKE THE SHIELD OF FAITH</strong>".

<strong>Vs. 17. "And take the helmet of salvation</strong>", people who go riding horses, bikes, motorcycles are required to wear helmets. It has been proven that it can save lives and it has many times. When we have the helmet of salvation, we too are safe when we sometimes fall, yes we might have bruises and pains but we still know that we haven't lost our salvation. "<strong>and the word of the Spirit, which is the word of God</strong>". This is the only offensive weapon, the rest are defensive weapons. <strong>Hebrews 4:12, " For the word of the Lord is living and powerful, sharper than any double edged sword, piercing even division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrows, and is a discerner of thoughts and the intents of the heart." </strong>The word does all the fighting with an aim to win. Different gadgets talked about here we need them, that is why Paul tells us to put on the WHOLE OF THE ARMOR.

I sum up the entire process of dressing for the battle with <strong>Romans 13:14, "But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill it's lust thereof</strong>".<strong> Putting on the Lord Jesus means putting on the Whole Armor of God</strong>. He is everything from the truth, <strong>John 14:6,</strong> He is righteous <strong>Romans 10:3,</strong> He is the reason for the gospel <strong>Isaiah 52:7</strong>, He is the shield of faith, <strong>Psalm 3:3</strong>, He is our salvation, <strong>Romans 10:13</strong>, He is the sword of the Spirit, <strong>John 1:1</strong>. <strong>You put on the Lord Jesus, you have all it takes to stand against the wiles of the devil</strong>. Put Him on. Blessings Ev

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 17:5-8, “5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. 6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. 7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. 8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only”</strong>

In 1999 I had the privilege of going to visit the Holy Land. As we traveled around the places that Jesus had once stepped, I noticed that wherever Jesus did something significant, a church was built to commemorate the act.<!--more--> The famous Church of the Holy Sepulcher had four denominations claiming the church. This was separated by tiles, which the Greeks, Catholics, Ethiopian Orthodox, all lay claim to. There was so much building of religious structures, yet so many that obviously didn’t have Jesus.

Many religious groups seem to claim allegiance to God through religious buildings, tradition, and religious acts. Has the story of the Transfiguration been somewhat of a mystery to you? Jesus was transfigured Jesus’ three closest disciples, Peter, James and John, and they were privy to see Moses and Elijah standing with Jesus. Peter had an idea to build three tabernacles, one for Moses, one for Elijah, and of course one for Jesus. Was this a bad idea? It was certainly typical, like many of the acclaimed religious building in Israel. God seemed to interrupt Peter as the voice spoke from the cloud saying, “<strong>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</strong>.” God’s emphasized His Son, and didn’t even mention His two faithful servants Moses and Elijah. The men fell on their faces and were sore afraid. Moses represented the Law, and Elijah represented the Prophets, Jesus of course was the fulfillment of the Law, and the One to which the Prophets spoke of. Truly with all our traditions in church, and all our attempts to be holy by trying to keep the Law, and all our prophesying (preaching), Jesus must shine. Jesus said, “<strong>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill”</strong>, <b>Matthew 5:17.</b> What is it that fulfills the Law and the Prophets? Think back to the teacher of the Law (a Pharisee) who was testing Jesus after they had heard he silenced the Sadducees with His words. The question was asked, “what is the great commandment in the Law”. Jesus answered, “ <strong>You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets”</strong>. Is this not the picture at the transfiguration. Everything the Law was saying and everything the Prophets spoke hangs upon Jesus Christ. The law of love, the prophetic word of love is what is often not seen. If we are to honor Christ, we must love God and love people, and stop making our emphasis on building tabernacles for Moses and Elijah. We don’t need a more elaborate Bible, we need to spend time hearing from God with Word of God. We don’t need a bigger building, a television ministry, a big revival meeting. We simply need to obey God to love Him and love people. We need to spend and be spent doing this, as this is what God Himself deemed to be paramount, and so much so it is a command. It is the Great Commandment, not the great idea, not the great suggestion, and not the great option. So Christian, do you spend your time loving God and loving people. If not, then you side with Peter and are perhaps well meaning in building tabernacles to Moses and Elijah, but not touching the very heartbeat of God. We need to get on our heart what is on the heart of the Father. In the end God, His Word, and the souls or spirits of people will be all that remains. If Moses and Elijah had their hand upon Jesus, and you have Jesus in your life, then where is the shinning of that love emanating from your life? Make it a point to keep the main thing, the main thing. Do it today! By Pastor Phil

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Even the so many times God had to declare that this Nazarene man was His beloved son, today we still find many people who do not accept that, and either ignore the Jew Jesus Christ totally, are they do the opposite and make a god out of him. They even go so far that they want to make the Messiah, who died into the God of heaven and earth (who is an eternal spirit which has no beginning and no end and so can not die.)
Instead of loving their neighbours, many in the Christian community attack the others and they do prefer to worship in front of pictures and statues of that Nazarene man, which is contrary to one of the first commandments of God not to make pictures of the Only One God nor to pray in front of any picture or statue and to worship such things.
The love is gone out to the dogmatic teachings of a Trinity, but the essence of the salvation brought by a human person has totally gone lost.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 6:9-19, “15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise”</strong>

I have learnt that patience is not taught in a classroom, it is taught and mastered in the sea of life. A dangerous prayer one can pray, “God teach me patience”, it is a prayer for those who know the end result but do not know the process yet willing to stick it out. What happens when you are dealing with something that requires patience? for me many times I try to find alternatives. If driving on the road and there is traffic, I find it easy to try another road. <!--more-->The problem I found when avoiding what I should have dealt with is that I got lost. Some things looked familiar as I made that choice only to find I was going further and further away from my destination. In the long run “I wish I knew” runs through my head. When God is teaching us patience, it always comes as an open book test. To make it interesting, if you fail the test, you can take it over and over again. What does this tell us, God is also very patient with His children. Can you imagine a teacher giving an open book test, all the answers are there but the student keeps failing that test? After a while his or her patience will run out, but not with God. He was patient with the Israelites who complained and murmured. He was patient with Gideon who kept on asking for a sign. He was patient with David who was weak when it came to women. He was very patient with Peter who kept on messing things up. He who invented patience knows how to be patient. Point to make, faith goes with patience.

The writer of Hebrews recalls how Abraham had hope and patience to inherit the promise God made. He is encouraging us to do what some people like Abraham did before the promise was fulfilled, <strong>Hebrews 6:11&amp;12, “And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end, that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises</strong>”. Some of these people are the open books who have to teach us how to endure through faith till the promise comes. Their promises are the result of their faith and patience and we look at it and say if they did it, we too can do it by God’s grace. Everyone has a dream, promises, desires, some of them have come to pass but there are some that have not. In the valley of decision calls for action, <i>“should I stay on this road I already know of, and wait patiently to receive the promise or should I take a back road hoping to lead me there?</i>" Abraham took the road God had set for him. There were a lot of traffic and he may have many times thought of taking the back roads as the traffic was not moving but faith kept him on that road. <strong>Hebrews 10:35&amp;36, “Cast not therefore your confidence with has great recompense of reward. For you are in need of patience that after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise</strong>”. The key to fulfilling the promise is sticking with the will of God in a situation till the end. Your confidence and my mine are in Christ our great reward because when we have confidence in someone that they can and will do it, regardless of when they do it, we will still patiently wait for them to do it. Patience is a must to every wise man. I don’t want it but I need it, it teaches me to be in the will of God gearing me to the promise. In the end when you look back you begin to see why patience was a must in your journey to the promise.

In the valley of decision though hard, I will stick to the road I started on based on His will. I will be tempted to take the back roads, however I will learn to stay on the main road. He is patient therefore He will help me be patient. If I fail, I can take the test again, I will utilize the open book in the valley of decision. After we have done the will of God… Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Song of Solomon 7:1–9, "How beautiful your sandaled feet, O prince’s daughter! Your graceful legs are like jewels, the work of a craftsman’s hands. Your navel is a rounded goblet that never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by lilies. <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6020" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/law-and-grace.jpg?w=300" alt="Law-and-grace" width="300" height="206" />Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus <!--more-->. Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel. Your hair is like royal tapestry; the king is held captive by its tresses. How beautiful you are and how pleasing, O love, with your delights! Your stature is like that of the palm, and your breasts like clusters of fruit. I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like the clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples, and your mouth like the best wine.” </strong>

Songs of Solomon or Song of Songs is perhaps one of the most controversial books in Scripture because of its erotic language use. One camp feels that the book describes ones relationship with the Lord, while the other sees Solomon is sharing his passionate feelings toward his wife, his lover. My personal perspective is that of the later one that this describes passionate, romantic, and erotic love shared between husband and wife.

1. Start at the Bottom. Solomon praised his wife starting with her sandaled feet, and then moved to her legs. Wives enjoy when their husbands notice the little things about them even their feet and legs. Husbands remember that God brought those feet and legs at one time to you, and you are to keep those feet and legs with you in ONENESS with you. Praise your wife (not in an idolatrous way) for these features.

2. Continue in the Middle. Solomon praised his wife’s navel, waist and breasts. Many men are drawn away by the mid features of other women, but God desires that our wives be the only source of satisfaction. Solomon writes is <strong>Proverbs 5:19–20, “A loving doe, a graceful deer- may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love. Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another man’s wife? Why not compliment your wife for her mid features today"</strong>

3. Don’t forget the top. Solomon praised his lover for her neck, hair, eyes, mouth, nose and breath. When you look at your wife what do you see. Are you captivated by her beauty? Are you drawn away by her unique features above her shoulders? Most men are drawn only to those features that are from the waist to the shoulders. Even Solomon mentioned his wife’s breasts three times. It seems like he had a thing going on! However, he shared his intimate words with his wife.

How beautiful you are and how pleasing, O love, with your delights. “…your breasts like clusters of fruit. I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit. He described his wife to her from the bottom to top. He was drawn away, captivated, enamored by her beauty that was for his pleasure and to her delight. What wife would not like to be complimented by her husband? Husbands let’s make sure that we are the ones complimenting our wives, because we don’t want someone else to do it for us. Our wives need to have our voices in their ears praising their beauty and, not another voice. Have you complimented your wife lately? Enjoy your wife and let her enjoy you as well. And perhaps both you and your wife have features that have aged a little. Remember DON’T TRY and pick another rose just because your petals don’t look like they used to. Your wife is the rose that God picked for you, so water, shine, and nurture her with your words. Do you date your wife? Why not take her out date, like when you first met. Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Isaiah 6:5, “So I said: “ Woe is me, for I am undone! …”</strong>

Growth is a challenge Christians face on a day to day basis. Not only in the life of a Christian but even in business, in the home, in church. No one wants to run a business that is not growing and healthy. A parent would get worried if their child was not showing signs of growth physically, mentally and the like. No one wants to be associated with something that is a stagnant, yet in the realm of our Christian walk, it’s easy at times to be stagnant and lukewarm. Some are stagnant by choice and others don’t allow things and people to challenge their walk that would cause them to grow<strong>. I believe growth takes place in an environment where there is a challenge.<!--more--> </strong>

Isaiah had an experience that challenged his walk with the Lord and he had to reevaluate his stand. His experience with the Lord knocked him out of the normal, where he felt safe, where there was more to his life than being just a man who feared God. In the year king Uzziah died, Isaiah saw the Lord sitting on the throne (I believe by vision) and everything he thought he knew about God and what he would have thought as a sign of his arrival at the top was challenged by the holiness of God. This brought him back to ground zero, incomplete. I remember days I would bring my paperwork to the teacher because I thought it was complete and then the teacher would write on top of the paper, “incomplete”. How often do we stay normal, everything is normal, our Christian walk is normal. We don’t want the Lord to disrupt our lives because if He did we may hear “incomplete”. What is incomplete requires challenge, change and hard work and who wants change when everything seems ok. <strong>Why fix what is not broken?</strong> As long as you are a Christian, you are saved, you are going to heaven, you read the bible occasionally, you go to church, you are involved in some ministry, what more would the Lord require of you?

The bible says, in<strong> 2Corinthians 13:5</strong>, “<strong>Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you are disqualified”. </strong>Evaluate your Christian life and see if you are truly growing in your walk or if you are stagnant. The same verse says <strong>“Test yourselves</strong>”, in school, teachers test students to see if what they are learning is sinking in. Without the testing, how will you know whether you are growing or not. <strong>You must have a measuring bar that serves as the striving factor for your life</strong>. We are to be imitators of Christ. Now Christ was (is) Holy, we have not prayed, served like He did, and even reached people the way Christ did. Until we look at Him as our measuring, bar we will be stagnant in our growth in Christ. Isaiah’s experience showed him that he was not even close, he therefore cried, <strong>Isaiah 6:5, “Woe <em>is</em> me, for I am undone! …”. This is an interrupted life for a bigger purpose. </strong>In my early Christian life, the fact that I was saved and going to heaven was enough until God interrupted my life and I saw myself undone. The experience developed a thirst to be more like Jesus which served as a challenge to strive to be like Him. I wanted to pray more, reach the lost, grow more in holiness and the list goes on. God brought people my way who challenged my walk as they served as a reminder that there is more to Christ than just being saved and going to heaven. This still challenges my walk with Him as I examine myself daily to see if I am growing or stagnant. I have also challenged many to do the same as <strong>Acts 14:22</strong> encourages the same, “<strong>strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, “We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.”</strong>

Today you may be the old Isaiah’s normal Godly life or you can examine yourself to see if you are stagnant in your walk and pray to God to give you an Isaiah’s experience that will entirely challenge and change your walk with the Lord. The race for growth and change is still on, make sure you are running the race with patience looking unto Jesus the Author and the finisher of our faith, He is the measuring standard. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Exodus 4:1-5, "...So the Lord said to him, "What is that in your hand?" He said, "A rod""</strong>

God can use you because He has placed something in you to work with. You may not know what it is but it’s there. We all have different gifts and talents given by God. There is something about being together in unity that paves away for gifts and talents to be realized. God allows us to have different measures of gifts when shared, our growth increases. The bible says that we collectively are like a human body that has hands, legs, head etc. They are all working together and not able to function fully without the help of the other. The legs cannot tell the hands “I don't need you” neither can the mouth tell the eyes that it does not need it. They all have different functions but they all work together. <strong>Psalm 133:1, "Behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity."<!--more--></strong>

God calls Moses for a task to deliver the children of Israel out of bondage. He is scared to death and we know why, he had killed an Egyptian and ran away. He was safe and peaceful where he now was. In his prior life, Moses was a prince in the land of Egypt at one time and then later refused to be one when he discovered he was not an Egyptian. A once upon a time prince becomes a killer then a fugitive and here comes God sending him back to where he killed. I believe that at one point in life, God will send some people back to places they came from, not to be part of it again but to be a deliverer to them that perish. When God does send you back to deliver them, you will not go in your own strength or power but His.

It's not easy to go back to where you have come from when everyone there already knows your history especially if you messed up big time. You are not sure if they will listen to what you have to say or not, but when God sends you. How often do we talk to God about what we think is going to happen, how we will fail and yet He is telling us to just believe. God goes as far as demonstrating what he will do and the question He has for Moses,<strong> "What is that in your hand?" Moses’s response, "A rod".</strong> God is the <strong>source</strong> and He has chosen to use the things that we have as the <b>means</b> to get the job done (a rod). When there is something in your life that you do not think the Lord will use, that is exact thing He will use. Be it your voice, smile, words of encouragement, little help, giving, being there for someone who needs help, a touch, prayers. To you it maybe small and insignificant but to God it is something that He can use. Don't you ever lose the rod you have in your hand thinking it’s nothing. What you have can work wonders in someone's life. Let no one cause you to forfeit by telling you that it's not necessary, if it's working for you, you need to stick with what is working for you. In fact you ought to be the best in it. You may never know the impact you will be making as you use the rod in your hands. Moses delivered the children of Israel using the same rod which was considered the rod of a shepherd. Pharaoh had a mighty powerful army. God did not send Moses with a backing army, He sent him with a rod of a shepherd and His presence.

If you've been waiting for something bigger than what you have before being used, I have news for you, “<strong>What you have in your hand is what you need”</strong>, your faithfulness in small things will open new channels for greater things. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>James 1:4, "But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing"</strong>

To walk with God, patience is a must or else you will not last long with God. <strong>As I walk with the Lord, I am learning that God is not in a hurry</strong>. If anything, He takes time to do things. Whatever He is doing is not just for today and tomorrow, He is doing it for days to come. He is building His people who will stand through time. I am amazed how some Christians want things yesterday. They get saved today, tomorrow they are dying to be on talk shows teaching everyone how to get saved. Many are anxious to be recognized and entrusted with positions and when it does not happen within their time frame, they get angry and leave. In church if their talents are not recognized, they change churches. Such people do not make it long with God. Such people want God to fit in their schedule and God is not going to. Either you are in His program or you are alone.<!--more-->

Genesis dedicates roughly 12 chapters on the life of Joseph. It is a vital story that relates to the life of a believer. From the time Joseph receives a dream to the time the dream is fulfilled takes a great deal of process. <strong>We shout over the end results but forget that there is a process</strong>. When you understand that there is a process, you ready yourself for it. <strong>If you want to live a meaningful life, your goal should be large enough to serve as a challenge</strong>. <strong>Your greatest responsibility is however to do the will of God with patience in the circumstance in which He has placed you as His representative</strong>. Whatever you have to accomplish has to have a beginning. You cannot jump to the result without starting from somewhere. Someone said, "<strong>a journey of a thousand miles begin with a step</strong>". Joseph rejoiced over his end results, he even shared it with his family and we know how that did not go well. Almighty God in His own wisdom knew that this armature would need work to sustain that dream and develop a character to support it. <strong>I see that God's main thing in our lives is not so much to deliver us out of situations or give us what we desire, He is in the business of building characters</strong>. Character causes one to live in any kind of situations and still shine while in it. Their character will not change with time or positions, it will remain intact. <strong>Patience is an ingredient that should not miss in a believer's life</strong>.

<strong>James 1:4, "But let patience have its perfect work". </strong>James (Jesus’ half-brother) tells us to "Let patience do its thing". We cannot dictate it, push it, work it up; It goes in its own pace. With patience expect obstacles, barriers, setbacks, walls, and delays. Let it perfect your character through each step, that is its job. Joseph had his shares of struggles, a lot of obstacles, barriers, setbacks etc. It was not even clear if the dream would ever come to pass due to turn of events, still he persevered. <strong>His responsibility was to persevere in every stage, patience was building his character and God was orchestrating His destiny. </strong>David and Job had different experiences that required a lot of patience, God built their characters. "...<strong>that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing". </strong>Perfecting something means taking time to work on it, at times things may not go as expected but you stick with it. This is what God is doing with His children, taking them through a process of perfection and completion leaving them lacking nothing. Joseph, David and Job took this class and we read about their later lives, they lacked nothing character wise.

If you are frustrated with God because of what He has not done, check to see if you growing in patience, see how your character is impacted by it. When God delays promises, it is not because the promise needed time to be made, it is because the person who He made the promise for was not ready for it. In short, <strong>the problem is not with God, the problem is with us</strong>. There are so many things that I have prayed to God for and now I see why they have not come, I do not have enough character to support the results yet. I am letting patience do its work, I do not want to mess the blessings God will send my way because I had no character. I am checking in with Dr. patience, I need work. I am a patient of patience, what about you?, Blessings Evans

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 6:3-4, “But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you"</strong>

If you are like me, then perhaps you too have that little something inside of you that likes to be recognized by others for doing a good job or good deed. I enjoy blessing others, and I find myself sharing some of the ways in which I have blessed people with others. I don’t do it to brag as if to say, “Look what I did for the Lord,” but rather I see it as a way to express how God is using my life to bless other people. <!--more-->In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus speaks of being able to bless others through giving, but doing so in secret. He speaks of giving to the needy around us, specifically to fulfill a financial need. Jesus instructs His children not to be like some politicians, that announce their beneficial giving to society so that they can win votes with people, or as Christ said to receive “the glory of men”. Jesus focused on giving in secret, and that those secret blessings, would be revealed. Our Lord gives practical instructions of how to give in this unfamiliar way, the secret way:

1. Don’t Keep Score. We are to give to the needs of men and women in such secrecy that we scarcely know what we have given. Jesus said “<strong>do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing</strong>.” Our giving should be prompted by the desire to obey God and with compassion to meet the needs of others. I believe men, much more then women, like to keep score on relationships. If I bless someone, does Christ want me to keep a mental score of what the one that received my blessing should do for my when I want or need something and expect them to deliver on it? Giving to get is not the heart of Christ, therefore it should not be the heart of those bearing His name. Jesus gave His very life to us, and we can never return that sacrificial expression of love to Him, but He did it for us anyway.

2. Don’t Showboat. When someone is trying to purposefully impress others, they are showboating. This is precisely what Jesus is instructing us not to do, “toot one’s own horn.” If anyone had bragging rights, it was Jesus. However, can you picture Him speaking with His twelve in this manner: “I healed fifty people today, how many did you heal? 5,000 people attended my sermon and I fed them all, how many stayed for your sermon, and did you feed all of them?” By no means did Jesus pride- fully speak like this. Jesus blessed, and gave, and blessed, and gave, and then moved on to do it again. At times Jesus would bless someone and tell them to keep it a secret from everyone except the priest (<strong>Matthew 8:3-4</strong>).

3. Recognize the Secret Blessings Revealed. I was blown away after preaching about <strong>Psalm 23</strong> in college to the men on my floor. Upon returning to my room, I found a book at my door called A Shepherd’s Look at the <strong>23rd Psalm</strong>, with a note reading, “Thank you for sharing with me what I needed to hear, sincerely, a fellow sheep." That person should have seen my excitement, and perhaps one of the guys walking by was secret blessing giver. I challenge you to unplug your scoreboard, cease the showboating, bless in secret, and watch secret blessings revealed.

Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 6:6, “But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you"</strong>

In part one of Secret Blessing Revealed, Jesus emphasized that one that gave in secret would be blessed openly. Now He shifts to speaking about secret prayer. Jesus assumes that His disciples would be men given to prayer, but He forbids the prayers of “hypocrites” which means to be an “actor,” placing a mask on one’s face in front of people but taking that mask off behind the scenes. <!--more-->In Jewish life, prayer had a prominent place that led to countless rabbinic decisions. Jesus is not forbidding public prayer, but rather he stresses the attitude in prayer, and true character is what you are in the dark when no one is looking. Jesus therefore gives us instruction of having our secret prayers from our prayer closet manifest in the blessings that God would reward us on.

1. Practice your prayer life. Jesus assumes, and rightfully so, that His children would speak to Him. If Christians are followers of Christ, how can one follow if one fails to communicate with the One they are following? Although prayer is assumed here, how many Christians are consistent in prayer other then saying grace at a meal, or a quick bedtime prayer? Do you have daily time when you talk with your Savior and He speaks with you? Jesus spent hours in prayer and seconds performing miracles. His disciples saw this time and time again, but instead of asking Him, “teach us how to do miracles,” they asked Him, “Lord, teach us how to pray.” The one, prayer, affected then other, performing miracles. Hours in prayer equaled seconds performing miracles!

2. Create a meeting place. In the life of Jesus, he regularly would separate himself from others, even His twelve at times, to seek a place of prayer where He could commune with His Father. Jesus would wake up early in the morning before anyone else and would find refuge in His prayer time. Jesus would find a place where he was not distracted, nor could not be disturbed in prayer. Jesus said, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head,” yet despite being without a home, he always managed to find a place to pray. Do you have a place where you meet with God? Do you go there often? Is that place a priority?

3. Pray in private then in public. Again Jesus is not forbidding public prayer, but if one prays more in public, Jesus says that one seeks the praise of men over the praise of God. Go into your room (your place of private prayer), close the door (to keep free distractions), placing yourself on “lockdown” whereby you know that it is time to meet with God and no one or nothing else matters at that time. This is the most important time in your day! When you pray in private watch how God uses you then to pray in public, and how He can speak through you on behalf of others, because you are already doing that in private.

4. The Father, rewards secret prayer. Remember that you are communing with your Heavenly Father, and He will make His children shine like Job, Daniel and his friends, etc…. Send your prayers up, and watch the blessings come down. Practice your prayer life, in a private meeting place with the Father who rewards your secret prayer.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 41:33, "Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a discerning wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt”…And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in who is the Spirit of God?”…And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt”</strong>

One man was asked how he makes elephant sculptures off a tree trunk, his response, “I take the tree trunk, chop off out of it what does not look like an elephant and what I will be left with will be an elephant. Thereafter I refine that elephant to bring to a completion what I had in mind when I thought of making it”. I have read somewhere that “<strong>leaders are not born but are made”</strong>. <!--more-->One of our mission statement at church is to raise leaders. Leaders are few because we have so many followers. In as much as so many people don’t feel they are leaders or have the qualities of leadership in them, what they need is to have everything chopped off from them that does not make them look like a leader and what they will be left with is what they need to be.

I believe that all of us have qualities of leadership. It may not be for a big corporation or group but a leader just over a person. What will take for that to happen is first determining who you are, where you are, where you want to go. Getting into conditions that will boost you to your destination. To bring a mental picture, look at an egg, if a chicken is expected out of that egg, then number one: it has to be put under a certain temperature which would lead to incubation and when it’s time is due, a chick will fight it’s way out of the shell. Remember that it had to be given the right conditions to develop from being an egg to being a chick. As long as it’s just a yolk, nothing will happen but when it matures into a chick, the shell is no longer it’s dwelling place. This mental picture shows we have the qualities of being leaders whether we know it or not, all that is needed is to be in a right incubator. It’s okay to be an egg but when you know that you have the ability to be more than an egg, you will not be comfortable being one. You will desire to fight your way through. Often times a word that lingers within our hearts and mind is “I CAN’T”, that’s good because you just passed the test and now you can be made one. Just because you can’t do it doesn’t mean it can’t be done. You have to believe in yourself, the people who believe in you and the Almighty God who will make it happen.

Joseph was a leader developed, for a while he was in an incubator of life being developed to be a leader. When he was but a young man, he was to me like an egg, comfortable being one but when he dreamt twice, the dreams triggered and awakened something inside of him reminding him he wasn’t all the Father wanted him to be. From making the mistake of bragging about how his household will bow before him, to being sold into Egypt, to being in Potiphar’s house, to being in jail to finally rising to power, I can see every part of his leadership being developed. Joseph being developed to be a leader recognized the leadership of someone else above him and he yielded to that leadership, he was first under the leadership of Potiphar and then Pharaoh. He was a man in authority and under authority, through his struggle in life, God developed the humility in him, a quality of a leader.

A servant’s heart is a required quality, this does not just come, it’s developed through a pattern of life. <strong>Mark 9:35, “And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, “If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all”. </strong>Being a leader is not about bossing people around, it is leading by example, this has to be developed. Jesus was not a bossy leader but one that led by example. Doing what many leaders of today would not do, being a servant of all. Joseph learnt servant hood through serving his brothers, Portiphar, the people in prison, the people of Egypt and his own. Wisdom was one of his leadership qualities, again we can see how foolish he was in the beginning. In due time, what was inside of him was developed to mature up. His interpretation of the dream to giving the advise on what was to be done was a God given developed quality the Egyptians needed. I wish I had time I would have talked more on Joseph’s leadership qualities.

You can see that it took time to develop his leadership skills however he was ready for it, he knew of his limitations, he did not limit God. He may have not understood the leadership class he was taking but I believe he appreciated it in life because God put him in an incubator. That egg, the thing that was delicate, that which could not move, that which could not function beyond, and that which was small had to be awakened to push it’s way out to become more than just an egg. Do you see yourself as more than an egg? it’s okay to be an egg but not bound to stay an egg forever. There are so many things in you that have not materialized yet, you need to be in an incubator. Ask God to show you what you could be as a leader and let that trigger something inside of you to desire to be one. Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 40:1-4, “Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his Trust”, Hebrews 10:35&amp;36, “So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. 36You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised” (NIV)</strong>

This verse ties with the next few verses we will look at. <strong>Psalm 40:1, “I waited patiently for the Lord; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry”.</strong> The word wait has different meanings, sitting down waiting for someone or something is one meaning, the other means busy doing something for others (serving). Waiters wait on people in restaurants. I believe this is what the Psalmist is telling us that he patiently served the Lord (waiting) while petitioning his needs before Him. In his faithfulness in serving, the Lord was able to hear his cry and attend to Him. “...<strong>Cast not your confidence which has great recompense of reward” </strong>Not confidence in man or self, confidence in God who we cry out to.<!--more-->

Not only did the Lord hear his cry and attend to him, in <strong>Psalm 40:2, “He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, And set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps</strong>”. While you are busy waiting (serving) the Lord, hell won’t be happy with you but keep serving. Remember Jesus' words in, <strong>John 16:33, “These things have I spoken unto you, that in me you might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world</strong>”. Tribulations are there, we are not to deal with them alone. How will you know what He can do if there is no challenge in your life He can use to display His power?. <strong>1John 4:4, “Ye are of God little children for you have over come them. For greater is He that is inside of you than he that is in the world”.</strong> Attacks will come, the good news, greater is He that is in us than he who is in the world.

Don’t be surprised at times when you are in horrible pits or in a miry clay for He will pick you up and set your feet upon a rock. He is the Rock of Ages who stands for sure, <strong>Psalm 18:46, “The Lord lives; and blessed be my Rock; and let the Lord of My salvation be exalted</strong>”. He will set you on Himself, the Rock. The Lord heard his cry, attended to him, brought him up out of the pits, set his feet upon the rock and believe me, the Lord is still doing much more in his life. “...<strong>And established my steps</strong>”, the Lord establishes our steps, in other words recognizes our steps. Our steps could be into good ministries, good friends, dealing with issues, meeting deadlines, dealing with arrogant people, etc. In short, all that you have to deal with, He recognizes and establishes your step that you may walk worthy of his vocation. Walking with Him requires patience, back to Hebrews we looked at, “...<strong>For you are in need of patience</strong>”. <strong>Psalm 37:23, “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way”.</strong>

<strong>Psalm 40:3, “He has put a new song in my mouth – Praise to our God; Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord”</strong>. There is power in singing praises to God, it encourages you to overcome. It may not be very easy to pray in certain situations but you can singing a song. Singing helps you lift Him up and what did He say in <strong>John 12:32, “And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me”</strong>. You lift Him up, you will be part of the people who will be drawn. The neat thing about this verse is that He does not even ask you to look for a song, He puts one in your heart that you may praise Him. Certain songs that we sing out of our mouths, I wonder whether they praise Him? “<strong>Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord”</strong>, whenever the Lord is doing something in your life and mine, He has someone else in mind too. So everything He is doing in your life is for someone also to see the goodness of the Lord in your life and fear Him. The fear here is reverencing before God and they will say, “The God whom so and so serves is a true God” and trust Him. Sad enough, many Christians walk as though the God they serve is dead and the unbelievers have no one to set an example for them.

<strong>Psalm 40:4, “Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust”</strong>, there are so many things you will not understand about how God operates but trust Him. We are in situations right now where we don’t know what to expect but sure enough, we will wait on the Lord as we put our trust in Him to bring us through.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“What the Church needs today is not more machinery or better, not new organizations or more and novel methods, but men whom the Holy Ghost can use—men of prayer, men mighty in prayer. The Holy Ghost does not flow through methods, but through men. He does not come on machinery, but on men. He does not anoint plans, but men—men of prayer.” —E.M. Bounds

Gospel ministry in America today has achieved a level of proficiency unprecedented in the history of the church. We have million dollar facilities with the latest technologies, marketing strategies that rival Madison Avenue, and unlimited number of programs to meet every conceivable need of the spiritual consumer.<!--more-->Sunday morning services are designed to dazzle by sight and sound. Colorful lights awash over stylish backdrops offer soothing ambiance as professional worship leaders inspire the crowd with musical brilliance. Anyone want some coffee, tea, juice or bagels? We’ve got plenty to make everyone feel welcome and right at home. We’ve become so proficient.

And the preaching? It has never been so dynamic. Video clips, drama routines, and PowerPoint accentuate the modern pulpit. Preachers have become skillful orators that deliver cute, humorous, and motivational sermons in less than seventeen minutes without the slightest hint of offense or controversy. We’ve become so proficient.

To ensure oratory excellence, preachers today need not labor over—or struggle to write a good “talk.” There is an abundance of material right at our fingertips, our libraries are filled with commentaries and published homilies. Famous preachers offer sermons for sale on DVD and millions, if not billions of sermons are ready for download at the click of mouse or the swipe of an iPad.

We have become so proficient. We are strong in technology, strong in facility, strong in programs and strong in presentation. But I fear that what is our greatest strength is also our greatest weakness.

R.T. Kendell wrote, “If the Holy Spirit were taken completely from the earth today, ninety percent of church work would go on as if nothing at all had happened.”

My fear is that we have become so proficient in our own ability that we no longer rely on the power of the Holy Spirit. We’ve become so proficient we can do it without Him. We no longer need Him, we no longer seek Him, we no longer pray.

Any novice Bible student knows that the most important meeting of the New Testament church was the prayer meeting. Unfortunately, today, it’s also the least attended meeting.

It’s true. Today we have no problem filling the church for fellowships and social events, but where is the prayer? We have no problem gathering people for potlucks and chili cook-offs but where is the call to fast? In the words of David Wilkerson, “We love the supper room, but avoid the upper room.” And unfortunately, the church will never penetrate this godless culture and make true converts to Christ unless we fall in love again with prayer.

We may build a crowd with our motivational talks and free coffee, but will we make disciples? Will the power of the Holy Spirit be so strong upon our services, our worship, our preaching that sinners realize their need to repent, be converted and surrender to the Lordship of Christ? Will the anointing of God be so heavy that lives are transformed, addicts are set free, marriages are restored, bodies are healed and young people are called to ministry? Not without prayer. Tragically, hell will be filled with people who’ve learned from prayerless, un-anointed preachers how to be happy and achieve success. If there is one thing we need today, it’s pastors who pray, preachers who pray, men of God who mount the pulpit with a fire in their bones acquired through prayer, fasting and a hunger for God.

More than a century ago, Andrew Murray said, “The man who mobilizes the Christian church to pray will make the greatest contribution in history to world evangelization.” Likewise, Leonard Ravenhill declared, “The man who can get believers to praying would, under God, usher in the greatest revival that the world has ever known.” In the early 20th century, Dr. R. A. Torrey wrote, “The devil is perfectly willing that the Church should multiply its organizations and its deftly contrived machinery for the conquest of the world for Christ, if it will only give up praying.” Torrey further wrote, “Satan laughs as he looks at the church of today, and says: ‘You can have your Sunday schools, and your children’s programs and your Men’s Clubs, and your choirs, and your music, and your preachers, and even your revival efforts even—if you do not bring into them the power of Almighty God, sought and obtained by earnest, persistent, believing, mighty prayer.’”

But how does a church become a praying church? How do a people become a praying people? The answer is found in three simple words: A PRAYING LEADER!”

The next few blogs I will write will have one goal: to inspire leaders to pray! What good are facilities if not a house of prayer? What good is music if not soaked in prayer? What good are our eloquent homilies and colorful PowerPoint sermons if not bathed in prayer? We may reach the minds of men; but if we do not transform them from spiritual death to life through repentance, all of it is nothing more than a show of vanity to entertain the flesh.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</strong>

I would like to share with you this morning about the word ‘believes.’ I pray you will read with an open heart, I pray a desire and hunger will be awakened within someone this morning for more of God, to go on to the fullness prepared for each of us in Christ as we walk by faith.<!--more-->

The word “believe” signifies a belief that is alive and vibrant, that is continually growing. In its Greek definition, to believe is to think something to be true, to be persuaded of, and to place confidence in someone, to have faith. It means to entrust one’s spiritual well being to Christ. In its usage in the text here, it represents as I said, a belief that is ongoing, that is growing day by day. It is he that goes on believing that shall not perish, for he that ceases to believe ceases to live spiritually, the same way that the man who ceases to breathe ceases to live. This is the essence of faith, it is ongoing and active, the just shall <strong>live</strong> by faith<strong> Habakkuk 2:4 </strong>says. We <strong>walk</strong> by faith Paul says( <strong>2Corinthians 5:7).</strong>

To believe is to continually entrust my life to Jesus, to surrender myself completely to Him each and every day, walking in obedience to His word, it is to give up everything for Him. In John 15 Jesus speaks to us of abiding, and that this is our responsibility. If we abide in Him, v.5 tells us that we bear much fruit, and by this the Father is glorified. If we cease to abide in Him, v.6 says we are cast out and thrown into the fire.

Dear friends, we must be sure of our profession. Paul tells us to test ourselves to see if we are in the faith, to be sure that we have truly believed, and that we daily continue to believe, seeking to love the Lord with all our hearts. our surrender to God must be perfect, simply meaning complete, all of our heart given to God, encompassing all of our life, all of our ambitions and dreams, all of ourselves. We will not be able to hide behind a doctrine, or our own reasoning, we must bring our lives into complete conformity to God’s word, being enabled by His grace. Have I truly believed? Am I continuing to believe? Am I closer to the Lord today than I was yesterday, last week, or last year? If not, something is wrong. Let us do the first works again, repent and turn to Jesus with all your heart. I close with the words of the Savior to the church at Smyrna in <strong>Revelation 3:11- “Behold I am coming quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.” Believe and hold fast dear friends, believe and go on believing. </strong>

In Christ’s love, Brother Benjamen

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Judges 6:16, "And the Lord said to him, “Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man.”</strong>

I had a journal called <strong>Big Time Prayers for a Big time God</strong>. The title is so fitting for the character of God, yet it is not a character trait that most use to describe God, <strong>BIG</strong>. A little boy is told that the heater bars on a stove are hot and will burn his hand. He believes his parents cognitively. One day while mom is cooking, the little boy is enameled by the glowing colors of the stoves heater bars and reaches out to touch them, as something most little boys have done before. As soon as he touches the heater bars he no longer believes they are hot, HE now KNOWS they are hot. <strong>His experience brought him from the realm of cognitive belief, into experiential knowledge</strong>. With the pain of the burn, and the smell of his little burnt finger, this boy heard the echo of his parents loud and clear.<!--more-->

That's what happened to Gideon in <strong>Judges 6</strong>. Gideon is called by God while he is threshing wheat in the wine press in order to save it from the Midianites. As Gideon is doing this, he receives the call of God upon his life as God calls him "<strong>Mighty Warrior</strong>." What a thing to be called by God. What an ironic title for a man with such a timid record. Gideon himself even challenged the validity of such words of himself. Gideon proclaimed that he was from the weakest family, and that he himself was the weakest one of his own family. He felt least qualified for the job. But it is just like our BIG GOD, to use the weak things of this world. God assures Gideon, "<strong>I will be with you, and you will strike down ALL the Midianites together</strong>." WOW, He hadn't really done anything for God yet, but God saw Gideon threshing the Midianites, the way he was threshing the wheat.

God tells Gideon to break down the altar of the false god of Baal, his father’s altar. Gideon is going to go against his earthly father, the king? Yes, he did for the purposes of his Heavenly Father, The KING of kings!

Gideon builds the altar and proclaims at the altar, <strong>Jehovah Shalom, "The Lord is my Peace</strong>." Why, because experientially he saw the angel of God face to face and did not die, but rather peace was the fruit that resulted. <strong>Gideon had an EXPERIENCE with our BIG GOD</strong>!

Then Gideon does his tests of the Lord's will with the fleeces, and then after all that God goes and cuts his army from 32,000 men, to 10,000 and then to only 300! Why, because God was going to show <strong>Himself BIG</strong>! The story goes, Gideon with 300 gained <strong>a BIG victory</strong>, because he had <strong>a BIG GOD</strong>, <strong>our GOD as His commanding officer. </strong>

What can you point to experientially lately, that you can perhaps appreciate as an attribute of God? BIG perhaps sounds too common for our great God, but yet BIG is so fitting for Him simultaneously. Gideon was called "<strong>Mighty Warrior</strong>," what is God calling you experientially lately? God used Gideon to defeat the Midianites, after Gideon's perception of himself was defeated, what is God calling you to defeat, or gain victory in that He is waiting for you to go in His power and take the land? <strong>How BIG is God to you!?!? </strong>Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Judges 7:2, "The LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her,"</strong>

When you are facing a difficult battle ahead does it make sense to decrease your weapons? Gideon was the leader of Israel's army, and God would decrease the size of Gideon's army with a battle just on the horizon. The Lord's instructions probably came as a complete shock to Gideon. I can imagine the he was confused upon hearing, <strong>"You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands</strong>." That doesn't sound very sensible to me; decrease your army size, because there are too many men for battle. Gideon's army was already outnumbered four to one.<!--more--> When I was trying out for sports teams growing up, if one didn't qualify for the team they were cut from the team, so that only the best players were left to produce a winning team. There were usually two cuts that took place. This is what God did when he sifted Gideon's army. God cut the first wave of people from the team by having Gideon announce, "<strong>Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead</strong>." The result was that <strong>"twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained</strong>." The first cut allowed the cowards to disqualify themselves and go back home to mommy. Now God would have second cuts, and reduce Gideon's army even further. A special examination or screening was set up based on the manner of water drinking among the 10,000 remaining soldiers. There the LORD told him, "<strong>Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink." (7:4) Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink</strong>." Those that kneeled down to drink were cut, and those that apparently crouched down to scoop up water by using their hands as a dog uses its tongue remained. The LORD said to Gideon, "<strong>With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands</strong>." The size of the army went from 32,000 to 10,000 to a mere 300 men to fight. Why would God do such a thing?

1. God can do a lot with a little. God can bring a victory with a few as easily as he could with a large army. Israel would not be able to boast about their victory, as the Lord removed all ground for boasting. Sometimes God reduces you in order to prepare you to move forward, and increase you. John the Baptist said, "<strong>He must Increase, I must decrease (John 3:30)</strong>." But this is not all.

2. God decreases us to show Himself strong. God said<strong>, "...for my power is made perfect in weakness."</strong> [Paul replied] <strong>Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me</strong>." The world needs to see God's power through your weakness. Are you shining brightly, or dimly?

3. God Knows those that are willing to take risks for Him. Not everyone is willing to obey God when things seem illogical on the surface. Sifting Gideon's army for battle is not good military strategy in the natural, but in the supernatural it was just what the Master ordered, and Gideon obeyed. What would you have done?

God can do a lot with very little to show Himself strong, and He knows those that are willing to take risks for Him even when "reason" says otherwise. I, you, we serve a victorious God. What is He asking you to do without to accomplish His will? Are you willing to take that risk?

Until the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Judges 7: 9 - 11, "During that night the LORD said to Gideon, "Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands. If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp." So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.”
</strong>
Gideon's army was less than 1 percent of its original size after the shifting took place, when God cut the majority of troops from the team through the leadership of Gideon. Gideon is resting at night, and God interrupts his rest with urgent orders to respond to divinely urgent news. Gideon is commanded to get up because God was going to give him victory if he would attack immediately. <!--more-->Knowing Gideon's heart, God sees Gideon's fear, and responds to it with encouragement. Although faith is the opposite of fear at times we need to be navigated from one point to the other on the vehicle of encouragement. God told Gideon if you are too afraid to attack right now then spy on your enemies and eavesdrop on their conversation, you will be encouraged by what you hear. What could they possible hear from the enemy that would give them encouragement?

In sports competition I would love it if the opposing team would begin to fight against themselves, or when they would somehow lose heart. A divided team can't stand, and a team that has no heart because it is gripped by fear has crippled themselves before engaging in the battle. At this point both armies were fearful of one another, but God was about to rip the fear from Gideon's heart and encourage him, thus replacing fear with faith. Gideon and Purah (most likely his armor-bearer) eavesdrop on the enemies camp and, "<strong>Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. "I had a dream," he was saying. "A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed."</strong> His friend responded, "<strong>This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands</strong>." No doubt this dream came from God to their enemies, as the fear of Gideon's sword ransacked their minds, gripping them with fear, discouragement, and defeat, before the battle was even engaged. I believe it was at this point that Gideon finally believed God. There are some great truth here for God's present day soldiers, you and me.

1. <strong>God's Word is timely</strong>. We are bound by the realm of time, and God is not. God told Gideon to go now to either battle or eavesdrop and Gideon obeyed. Our enemies are defeated already, but we need to listen to God's Word to be reminded of that truth. Jesus said in <strong>John 8:31 - 32, "If you...continue in my Lord...the truth will set you free.</strong>" God's Word brings freedom if we apply it. Are you a hearer of God's Word and a doer of God's Word?

2. <strong>God's Word is encouraging</strong>. We've all been discouraged. Gideon's army was decreased yet the battle was still on the horizon. Both armies were gripped with fear, but God cares for his people, and meets our discouragement with encouragement, fighting fear with faith. Are you discouraged today, I've been there many times, go to God's Word but you need not go alone.

3. <strong>God's Word brings partnership.</strong> Gideon was commanded to go with Purah, his confidant, his close trustworthy partner. I can picture them smiling with huge grins at each other and being able to encourage one another. Now there were two people bringing encouragement back to the camp together. We need a close partner, who is yours? Do you encourage each other? Battles are here, more are coming, but God's Word is timely, encouraging, and brings partnership. God is victorious, let us act by faith upon his Word by being obedient to Him, regardless of the fear that grips our hearts. Go to God's Word and allow it to silence the fear that grips you.

Until the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 5:6, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled</strong>”

The times I step out to witness to the lost, I usually learn a thing or two about the lost. One thing I have learnt in my encounter with the unsaved is that 99% of the ones I have talked to were not searching. They were comfortable where they were (sinful life) and they hoped that God will weigh their good and bad deeds. If they are good as many tell me, God will overlook their bad and let them into heaven. If we, the soundly saved Christians wait untill they come to church to hear the gospel before they get saved, very few will and many will continue to have false assurance.<!--more-->

<strong>Acts 16</strong>, Paul and Silas were jailed, at midnight as they were praying, singing praises and worship to God, vs. <strong>"26 Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were loosed. 27 And the keeper of the prison, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself. 28 But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, “Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.” 29 Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. 30 And he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” </strong>

How many of the unsaved do you ever hear cry, “<strong>what must I do to be saved?" </strong>They are comfortable where they are. The bible says in <strong>Matthew 5:6, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled”</strong> and how many of the unsaved do you hear hunger and thirst for righteousness? By righteousness I mean the hunger to be made right. It is the righteousness of God through Christ that saves. We will enter into heaven not because we are good people but because we are bad people (wretched) who Christ has made right in His righteousness. And those who do not think they are hungry will not thirst to be filled.

If the unsaved are not hungry to be made right, what will create the kind of hunger we read of the prison keeper who said, “<strong>sirs, what must I do to be saved?" </strong>The key is in <strong>Matthew 5:13,</strong> where Jesus said, “<strong>You are the salt of the earth; …</strong>”, but what does that mean? Salt does a lot of things and one of the things it does, IT CREATES THIRST. When we share with the lost about sin, judgment, God’s righteousness, His holiness, hell, heaven, all we are doing is sharing God’s word that creates hunger and thirst, and the more we share the more they become thirsty. The word drives away false hope leaving them hungry and thirsty for righteousness, and with an cry they say, “then what must I do to be filled (saved)” and Jesus like in <strong>John 4 </strong>who gives the water of salvation to satisfy the thirst the law demands (righteousness) and the unsaved never thirst again to be made right because the thirst has been satisfied through the righteousness of God in Christ.

As salt, we must go out on the highway and the byways and speak to the lost, give them something to make them hunger and thirst for righteousness and when they cry “<strong>what then must we do to be saved”</strong>, we then give them God’s means of salvation, Jesus Christ. I have seen that they are not coming, so I am going after them because Jesus said so. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 31:10-30, “Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised."</strong>

These three part series is an encouragement to godly women and learning experience to godly men about godly women. I have learnt a lot watching my wife, the women in my ministry, my mom, some of the ladies I discipled back in the days. My learning enables me to treat and pray for them effectively. The intercessory prayer ministry my wife and I were involved with, 95% were ladies.<!--more--> I have respect for ladies may be one of the reasons is how my salvation came about. My special mom prayed me into the Kingdom, of course dad always prayed for me but when mom stepped it to join forces with him, the Lord saved me. I was discipled by a lady. It's not easy nowadays see men treat ladies the way they should be treated. I also don’t understand why many women get attracted to men who mistreat them.

Several times I have come across women who referred to themselves as <strong>Proverbs 31</strong> women, this led me to read and study the chapter for myself. It says, <strong>vs. "10 who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubbies".</strong> Let's start by defining the word<strong> "virtuous", this is having or characterized by moral virtue (goodness) and righteousness</strong>. From experience, I have come to learn that when a woman is of good character, however bad the husband might be, she has a way of neutralizing the bad side of her husband, a good example is that of Abigail, Naabal’s wife. But when a woman is bad she destroys the house, for example Jezebel, Ahab’s wife. This makes me believe that depending on the character of the woman, she will either make or break her home.

With that said let’s look at our first point, <strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of kindness, Proverbs 31:20, "She extends her hand to the poor, Yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy", </strong>a great example is of the Shunammite woman in <strong>2Kings 4:8,</strong> which reads <strong>"Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a great woman (virtuous), and she persuaded him to eat some food". </strong>Note the way the bible calls her “<strong>a great woman”. </strong>She was no ordinary woman, her kindness is highlighted, going far and beyond, her hospitality made her special. Her kindness is continuously highlighted when she lovingly consulted her husband about going above and beyond what she had already done,<strong> 2Kings 4:10, "Please, let us make a small upper room on the wall…so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there". </strong>Because he passed by many times, she asked her husband if she could set a room and food, whenever he was around, he would need food to strengthen him and there she was doing what was right.

Even in the midst of something missing in her life, a child, it did not change who she was. <strong>Galatians 6:9,” And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart</strong>”. A virtuous woman will see a need and put other people's needs ahead of hers. She does not do what is left, she does what is right. She will not do it to be seen but because it is the right thing to do. To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 31:10-30, “Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised."</strong>

<strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of Obedience, Proverbs 31:11&amp;12, "The heart of her husband safely trust her; so he will have no lack again, she does him good and not evil all the days of her life."</strong> There is a proverb that says<strong> obedience is better than sacrifice </strong>and we see this in the life of Ruth. She left her home where she worshiped pagan gods and followed Naomi who was her mother in law before she lost her son (husband to Ruth). <!--more-->Even though Ruth knew there was nothing to keep her close to Naomi, they remained friends. One thing about Ruth is that she is a faithful follower, has a teachable spirit and never complained. <strong>Ruth 2:11&amp;12, "And Boaz said unto her, "it has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother in law since the death of your husband... and you have come to a people you did not know before, The Lord repay your work, and a full reward be given you by the Lord God of Israel.",</strong> If you read the entire book of Ruth, you will see how Ruth looked up to Naomi as a mentor and was careful to follow her instructions, Naomi instructs her to do. <strong>Ruth 3:5, "And she said to her (Naomi), "All that you say to me, I will do". </strong>According to the proverbs, she can be trusted and Naomi knows that Ruth will do her good and not evil all the days of her life. Her character was instrumental to Boaz in choosing a wife for himself. God rewarded her obedience

<strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of faith. Proverbs 31:21, "She is not afraid of snow for her household</strong>". She is the type of woman who is not living in the natural but in the supernatural for she knows that her help is in the name of the Lord, <strong>Psalm 124:8, “Our help is in the name of the Lord”.</strong> To go back to the Shunammite woman, not only was kindness her strength, she was also a woman of faith. <strong>2Kings 4:26, "Run now, I pray thee to meet her, and say unto her, is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? and she answered it is well." </strong>It's easy to say it is well when everything is going well however, when you read the story of this woman, it wasn't okay at the time she said it was, she had just lost a son. The son was in the field working with his father and he fell sick, the father brought the son to his mother and he died on her lap. <strong>A woman of faith knows something has to be done, she rises up to act by faith in the midst of fear and confusion for she is operating by faith. She will speak life in her situation regardless of the circumstance; she will strengthen herself and put her faith into action.</strong>

<strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of prayer, Proverbs 31:17, "She girdeth her loins with strength and strengthens her arms". </strong>There is something about a praying woman; she knows how to stand before her Master. If you go to churches now you will find that majority of prayer warriors are women. Hannah was a praying woman for that which she desired came through prayers. <strong>1Samuel 1:10, "…and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto then Lord, and wept sore." </strong>Here is a woman battling in the Spirit doing intensive intercession for something she believes God is able to do. Her intercession is not for selfish reasons but desiring to be blessed that many may also be blessed through her prayers. She prayed for a son (Samuel), God gave her a prophet for her prayers were diligent, earnest, powerful, and effective. <strong>Samuel 1:15, "...but I have neither drank wine or strong drink, but have poured my soul before the Lord," </strong>she was not afraid of pouring her heart to the Lord holding nothing back. She lingered longer in the presence of the Lord. A virtuous woman <strong> knows that her strength lies in her prayers and therefore she girds herself with it even though her husband may not be there to support and encourage her, that was Hannah’s strength. </strong>To continue Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 31:10-30, “Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised."</strong>

<strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of destiny, Proverbs 31:25, "Strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come". </strong>Everything she is doing is to bringing her strength and honor and it's not because she is trying to build herself a name but because her character has placed her in a position where people honor and respect her, and therefore she has a destiny that will cause her to rejoice. Mary the mother of Jesus becomes a woman of destiny for she is favored among women to carry a precious seed that will one day save the entire world.<!--more--> <strong>Luke 1:42, "and she spake out with a loud voice, and said, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,” Luke 1:44, "Lo and blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of these things which were told of her from the Lord."</strong> A woman of destiny does consecrate herself, she sets herself apart from many things that might try and abort her destiny. She even knows who to hang out with and as for Mary; she was hanging out with Elizabeth the mother of John who at that time was also pregnant. Both women knew how to encourage and build each other up. She has no time to fool around when she knows someone's life depends on her destiny.

Time fails me for I would have talked about a <strong>persistent virtuous woman</strong> (the woman with the issue of blood), Leadership (Esther). <strong>Proverbs 31</strong> talks about all these characters. I have mentioned these qualities in different women, but the writer believed that a woman was capable of having all these characters. None of these things were inherited or just came about, someone had to work hard to achieve them. I love the way it starts in <strong>Proverbs 31:10, "who can find a virtuous wife (woman), for her worth is far above rubies,"</strong> I believe God is raising Virtuous, precious, powerful women who will be movers and shakers because of their character. "<strong>Women who perceives that their merchandise is good, and their lamp does not go out by night,” Proverbs 31:18</strong> meaning she knows who she is and she knows that her character is good and because of that she keeps her inner beauty and the outer beauty shinning 24, 7, her character is not seasonal.<strong> Proverbs 31:29, "Many daughters have done well, but you excel them all." I have heard it said, Charisma will put anyone on top, but only character will keep them there. Proverbs 31:10-30, "Favor (charm) is deceitful, and beauty is vain (passing), but a woman that feareth the Lord, shall be praised.</strong>" The fear of the Lord is the key to these qualities. It shows who you are abiding in.

May the Lord cultivate the spirit of the Shunammite woman (kindness and faith), the Spirit of Ruth (Obedience), Spirit of Mary (Destiny), Spirit of Hannah (praying) in the lives of our women. A woman who fears the Lord shall be praised. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1Corinthians 3:1-23, vs. "11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ" NIV</strong></p><p>Foundation is the defining moment if anything is expected to succeed. The process and the outcome is traced back to the foundation. How the foundation is laid will determine the basis on which things will stand. <strong>Foundation defines what we are made off.</strong> Parents try to lay a foundation for their children; husbands and wives try to establish a foundation for their marriage; and are churches, corporations, schools etc. If the foundation is wrong, anything built on it may be crooked, may not survive for long and is very dangerous. This is the whole reason builders take time to lay strong proper foundation. From looking at how foundations are laid especially in buildings, it has to go down first before it comes up.<!--more--></p><p>Paul addressed Christians at Corinth not as spirited men, those who he believed to have matured. He found that the people who should have been growing were not because they were trying to define again the foundation already laid. Instead of building on what was already laid, they were still dealing with petty issues such as jealousies, quarrelling and divisions. Fighting over who to follow Paul or Apollos. I see this same problem even today where people are disputing on whose teaching to go by, who to follow, causing the same problems Paul found at Corinth. If you don't know and understand the foundation, then like the Corinthians you will try to establish a foundation laid by men. The problem is, men fail everyday and twice on Sunday. What happens when your favorite preacher stumbles and falls, would you fall too if your foundation is laid on him? What will your destiny be based on? What about your mentor, your spiritual leader?</p><p><strong>1Corinthians 3:5, “What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task (NIV). </strong>It is interesting to note the "WHAT" used in this verse rather than "WHO". "WHAT" addressed their laboring service as opposed to "WHO" that addressed their personalities. Those who followed Paul might have chosen him because of his personality and style of doing things and so were those who followed Apollos. He reminds them that he and Apollos were channels through which they believed. Their teaching was not for people to believe in them but the message they brought to them as assigned by God. Here is how he ties himself to Apollos, vs. <strong>6-7, “6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. 7,So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow". </strong>Paul and Apollos were both laborers, the controlling factor in what they were doing was LABORING and not SUCCESS. Now I can understand why Apollos’ ministry was not a threat to Paul's, they both understood they were co laborers.</p><p>Yes they were different in their ministries but they were building on a foundation already laid. Today we see competition and insecurities among preachers, pastors, leaders driven by who is more successful. And majority want to find out how they succeeded and duplicate that pattern in their ministries hoping it works. This would affect the business, size of congregation, size of budget, facilities. How easily believers get sucked in all these and follow men's teaching and principles rather than God's. The key factor in this chapter is God who <strong>MADE IT GROW</strong>. The planting by Paul and the watering by Apollos was nothing if God did not make it grow. This establishes this fact, "<strong>The creation and fostering of faith is God's work alone". </strong>If a spiritual leader's message and style is your foundation then you are trading on a very dangerous foundation. <strong>Christ is the solid rock on which we stand, all other grounds are sinking sand</strong>. They can reveal the foundation already laid, the question is, whose foundation?. To continue, blessings Ev</p><h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size:1em;">Related articles</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul"><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/a-true-worshiper-of-god-part-1of2-evans-olang/" target="_blank">A True Worshiper Of God, Part 1of2, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/identified-with-despised-christ-part-1of3-evans-olang/" target="_blank">Identified With Despised Christ, Part 1of3, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1Corinthians 3:1-23, vs. "11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ" NIV</strong></p><p>We defined foundation and looked at how possible it is to look at men’s foundation rather than God’s foundation. At Corinth, Paul had laid a good foundation "<strong>Jesus Christ and Him crucified</strong>", instead of them building on THIS foundation, they started trying to redefine it which moved them from the spiritual growth to become carnal minded. Thank God that Paul came back to correct their understanding and thank God He is correcting the understanding of those who missed it.<!--more--></p><p>Paul laid a foundation, but he was not the foundation. Paul and Apollos were nothing, God was ALL. Without God, their labor was in vain. He says, <strong> vs. 11, “For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ". </strong>God has already laid His foundation on His Word, the bible. No one can go around and lay another foundation. Many Religions have tried over and over again to lay another foundation instead of building on THIS one laid. I refuse to be called a religious person simply because being born of God is not about religion but RELATIONSHIP. Many religion teach that you have to find your way to God by doing the so called “good works”. Christianity based on the word of God teaches that it's only by grace through faith are we saved (<strong>Ephesians 2:8&amp;9).</strong> Grace lays the foundation we could never lay and there can be no other foundation again thereafter. Jesus said in <strong>John 14:6, "I am THE way and THE truth and THE life. No one comes to the Father except through me". </strong>"THE" tells us that it's only by Him.</p><p><strong>1Corinthians 3:10, "By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert (master) builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds." </strong>The main work of a master builder is <strong>contribute knowledge rather than labor</strong>. If Paul had laid a foundation <strong>"Jesus Christ and Him crucified</strong>", he is now giving the knowledge that they will need for building themselves while others rallied around them to help. He also warned them to be careful of how they build on this foundation. How we each build matters, Paul writes, <strong>vs. 12-15</strong>, “<strong>12 If any man builds on THIS foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, 13 his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work. 14 If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. 15 If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames”</strong>. These verses challenge me because I understand that to build on THIS foundation, it's not about happiness as many teach, it's about something bigger than that, <strong>Romans 14:17-18</strong> tells <strong>"17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men."</strong></p><p>You can see that happiness is not a material towards building an everlasting building; <strong>righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit are THE KEY materials</strong>. Happiness comes and goes. The rest of good things are benefits for serving. So let us build on THIS foundation with the KEYS that will survive the fire rather than benefits that will not. The KEY materials are the pillars that hold the building. So who is our sure foundation "<strong>Jesus Christ and Him Crucified</strong>", therefore let's be careful that we do not blindly exalt one who lays a foundation. Let us also be careful that the master builder gives us the right knowledge for building. Let us careful about how we build.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Chronicles 20:1-25, "vs. 12...For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.” </strong>

Have you ever had some of those days you feel you do not have enough to accomplish a task? Looking at what you need to do, then sizing it with what you have leads you to believe that unless a miracle happens, there is no way you can have it done. <strong>2Chronicles</strong> tells us of king Jehoshaphat who did that which was right before God. He followed the footsteps of David. As king, he had his own battling troops no doubt, yet in one occasion he was faced with a fierce battle. Instead of one army’s threat, he had several to face. He was to fight the Moabites, Ammonites among others. He looked at what he had, what he was to face and what he needed and saw how short he was in succeeding unless he had back up.<!--more-->

This king had no problem admitting he was not able, the world might say he was weak, I would call that humility. Believers should not be afraid to admit they are unable. Sometimes I hear preachers say do not confess you are defeated, sounds like bad luck if you do. I believe most people God has raised are people who admitted their lack of ability and were vulnerable to admit it. King Jehoshaphat says, <strong>2Chronicles 20, "...we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us.” </strong>In rare cases do you hear leaders confess they are unable. Unless you declare bankrupt, you are not ready for God. <strong>Your strength does not lie in your position</strong>, <strong>your strength lies on Who is able</strong>. He admitted they had no power, second he admitted that they did not know what to do and third he confessed that their eyes were upon God. Over the years I have learnt that God loves to demonstrate His power before and for His children. David says, in <strong>Psalm 68:1, "Let God arise, Let His enemies be scattered". </strong>

Watch this, after king Jehoshaphat and his people prayed to God, the word from God through Jahaziel came to Jehoshaphat in <strong>vs. 15,</strong> saying<strong>, "...Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the LORD to you: "Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God's</strong>". <strong>The Lord encouraged them without changing their situation</strong>. He says, "<strong>do not be afraid</strong>", how many times do we hear God encouraging His people through His word not to be afraid? Fear and doubt are the enemies of faith. <strong>Before God does anything, He first deals with our fears because fear has a way of messing things up</strong>. Then He tells them not to be dismayed meaning not to lose courage. Joshua was told to fear not but be courageous for the Lord was with Him. If the battle is the Lord's, then that means I do not need to be in the battle field right? I cannot be afraid when I know I do not have to be there. Not only are they told not to be afraid nor dismayed, they are told". <strong>"Tomorrow go down against them</strong>...", <strong>2Chronicles 20:16</strong>. “Lord, You said the battle is Yours, how come You are telling me to go against them? How is it Yours if I have to face what I want Your help me with?” <strong>This is not about what you can do in the battleground, this is about taking God at His word by faith</strong>. We have battles facing me and my wife as I believe you too. It could be financial battles, marriage battles, dealing with children battles, change of jobs or career battles and like this king, you just do not know what to do. Do not be afraid to admit you need help and call on God. We are encouraged not to be afraid nor dismayed, the battle is His however we still need to report to the battlefield. Let us move and face it head on at His word because He has a plan we do not know. Just because the battle is His does not mean you will be absent from the battlefield. To continue. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Chronicles 20:1-25, "vs. 12...For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”</strong>

If our strength is not in our position and if God tells us that we still have to go against what we called on Him for, let us see where we fit in His plan of fighting for us. Twice the king and his people were told to go against their enemies. In the last message I wrote that you and I are still required to report to the battlefield.<!--more-->

<strong>2Chronicles 20:16&amp;17, "Tomorrow go down against them .... 17, "You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the LORD, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!' Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, for the LORD is with you."</strong> If you go to a battle field, the enemy knows you are there to battle, here the Lord says, <strong>"you don't need to fight</strong>". No one goes to a battlefield with no battle plan, the enemy will not stop attacking you simply because you are not there to fight. Why is it that we have the tendency of feeling that we must fight, try and resolve issues, have answers for everything? I believe Jehoshaphat and his people were sent to the field to see God move. God did not need their help, we feel at times that unless we help God it cannot be done. When God brings you to the battlefield you've been avoiding, it is not because He wants your help or see if you had good strategy of facing it, He wants to show you of what He is capable of. He has brought you to a place where He can boost your faith. He is there to remind you that your strength is not in your position, leadership, money, notoriety, or fame, your strength is in Him. David refers to Him as "<strong>MY Strength</strong>". Now we can tell the reason David was more concerned about the presence of God and not like Saul who cared about position. Moses had a great position yet he would not go back to Egypt alone without the presence of God accompanying Him. What can we say then, as long as the presence of God is going with us, we can face any battle, situation, or circumstances, <strong>Romans 8:31 says, "...If God be for us, who can be against us?” (KJV).</strong>

Now that the king knew his strength was not in his position, he positioned all the people in readiness to go to the battlefield. He went strong in the Lord with his people encouraged, <strong>vs. “20, ...Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in the LORD your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper." </strong>He knew he was going to the battlefield where the Lord had control of the situation. He also felt that being there to watch the Lord fight was not good enough, he therefore gathered singers and musicians to praise the Lord. It is easy to pray and then sit and do nothing waiting for God to move, these people saw an opportunity to praise God<strong>, they</strong> <strong>turned their fears into praise</strong>. <strong>They could not fight, but they could praise God</strong>. Worship was not about what they could do but what God was going to do. They were not doing sorry, low, dull numbers, they lifted their voices to praise Him. <strong>vs. 22, "Now when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated</strong>". Through praises and worship, they made the Lord look good and the Lord moved. <strong>Psalm 28:6-7, “6 Blessed be the LORD, Because He has heard the voice of my supplications! 7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, And with my song I will praise Him</strong>”. The Lord set an ambush upon their enemies. When the Lord says the battle is His, praise Him in the battle field while He fights for you. Blessing Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a><strong>Psalm 55:1-23, "... So I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest"</strong></a>

We are facing tough times especially economic crisis. Everyone is affected in these tough times. The magnitude may be small or great but the fact remains life is tough. We as believers many times have promised the world that if they come to Jesus, all their troubles will disappear. Many have responded to the call expecting comfort and good life. When everything did not go as they expected, they abandoned their faith. You and I have to address this early in our Christ walk this question, “Why do we serve Christ?” It’s been said, “life is not fair but God is good”, situations and circumstances will not make Him less of Himself, He is the same forever. So understanding that we will always be faced with situations leads us to address them.<!--more-->

Would our prayers be something like this, <strong>"Father, please get me out of this",</strong> and if the situation does not change in a day or two, we come back to God and pray<strong>, "Father, when I'm I getting out of this?" </strong>or should we be praying<strong>, "FATHER, WHAT SHOULD I GET OUT OF THIS?" </strong>David found himself in this kind of dilemma as he records in <strong>Psalm 55</strong>. He was going through overwhelming situations. This might have been the times he was constantly running for his life from Saul. With the trials, temptations, exhaustion, confusion, frustration, brokenness, spent, troubled and the list continues, the word “enough is enough” must have come to his mind and so his faith was replaced with <strong>“I wish</strong>”. <strong>"So I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest". </strong>I have wished this many times when everything was out of control.

I love doves, they are very pretty birds. Doves are symbol of peace, the Spirit of God descended on Jesus as a dove, and who would not love doves? the bible says that, <strong>"be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves", Matthew 10:16. </strong>David desired wings of a dove to fly far away from his problems. Doves flap their wings fast to get out of situations at any given time. But with God, flying away from situations is not His plan, <strong>Romans 5:3-5, “3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.” Situations are learning and growing opportunities.</strong> I do not want to have wings of a dove to escape and miss the opportunities to learn something in the current situation. It was also David who said in <strong>Psalm 119:71, "It's good for me to have been afflicted that I may learn Your statutes”. </strong>If it is not the wings of a dove I need. What kind of wings do I need?

<strong>Isaiah 40:31, "But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings as the eagles". </strong>These are the wings we need. Look at the way the wings are given to us, as we wait on God meaning serving God without complaining about what we are dealing with or facing.  Our strength will be renewed in tough situations, and through the renewing of our strengths, we will be mounted with wings like eagles. Eagles do not struggle to fly, they stretch their wings and the wind carries them through. Rarely will you see eagles flap their wings. When it's in the air flying, it could be up there for hours while doves fly then gets some rest before they continue with their journey. The eagles fly above and so should a Christian fly above situations rather than run away from them. While flying above, the Spirit will blow us (direct us) in the direction He wants to lead us, just like the wind will move the eagle to different directions. To add, eagles can see far as to what they need. May the Lord cause us to see far and wide what He is working all things together for our good. <strong>If you fly away like a dove, you will miss the opportunities present to see God in your situation</strong>.

David's desire to have wings like dove and fly away would not even make his problems go away as they would have caught up with him eventually. <strong>What you do not deal with in the night will catch up with you in the mornin</strong>g. David takes comfort in <strong>vs.22 "Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous fall” (NIV). I pray that God will give us all the wings of eagles if we ever need wings. Blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The term today for effective, state of the art, fashionable ministry is “cutting edge.” It describes the up-to-the-minute modern media we use to penetrate cultural resistance and communicate the gospel in a way that connects to the sensory paradigms of sight, sound and emotion. In a world where visual imagery is king and attention spans are declining, cutting edge ministry can be anything from music and drama to video and fancy lights creating the right feel of a room.<!--more--> While these may certainly be effective modes of outreach and relevant tools of communication, they should in no way be misconstrued as ministry’s “cutting edge.” There is only one cutting edge of ministry that penetrates cultures, pierces paradigms and converts resistant people. Prayer is our “cutting edge.” Scripture tells us, “If the ax is dull, and one does not sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength." (Eccl. 10:10) Have you ever tried to chop wood with a dull ax blade? Every swing requires more and more effort and yields smaller and smaller results. You must rely more on brute, physical strength to force the ax through the wood. How different it is when the blade has been sharpened in advance—prepared for its task on the sharpening stone. It almost glides through the tree without exerting any physical effort. It is prayer that makes ministry sharp, living and powerful—like a two edged sword piercing the soul and discerning the intents of the heart. Without prayer, gospel ministry is reduced to mere entertainment competing with the world for carnal attention. Each “show” must be more dynamic and amusing then the last if the masses are to return for more. Pastors lacking in prayer may have the look of effective ministry, but there are much deeper, more essential dynamics that will be lacking. There may be crowds, but there won’t be converts. There may be hype, but there won’t be holiness. There may be entertainment, but there won’t be an anointing that breaks the yoke and sets souls free. As Paul warned Timothy, there may be the appearance of godliness, but it will definitely lack the power. http://greggtjohnson.com/1/post/2013/02/pastors-who-dont-pray-lack-the-cutting-edge.html]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 19:22, "What is desired in a man is kindness..."
</strong>
A father told his son, "if you have nothing nice to say to someone, please don't say a thing", he never heard from his father again, the father never had anything nice to say to or about his son. Why is it that we live in a world that shows less or no kindness? Husbands show no kindness to their wives and vise versa, kids are not kind to each other, parents are not kind to their kids, people are not kind to other people. We have murders, abortions, rapes, robbery etc because people are not kind. If everyone was kind as the bible puts it, we wouldn't have any of these issues to deal with, we would all live in peace and harmony.<!--more-->

Kind is the state of friendly, generous or warm hearted nature. A state of showing sympathy, understanding, charitable and considerate. Treating the way you would want to be treated. The bible says in <strong>Proverbs 19:22, "What is desired in a man is kindness..." </strong>How true is this, something that God would want in every man and woman. We know that kindness warms the heart, it brings a smile. It gives a sense of value and belonging. Who wouldn't want to be shown kindness? Everyone desires for someone to treat them nicely and say nice things about t<span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel">hem. We all want to be affirmed, someone to believe in us and speak it out. There is power in words spoken therefore you never know what you speak today could impact an individual's life for a long time. Words of encouragements have a way of melting away fear and doubts in a p</span></span><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel">erson, hence creating avenues for healing and restoration. We have to learn to be sensitive to each other's needs and not blinded by our own.</span></span></span></span>

<strong>Ephesians 4:32, "And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you." </strong>Paul in writing to the Ephesians told them to replace all bitterness, anger, clamor and evil speaking by being kind to another, having a soft sport of forgiveness. Being the one to step out and do something that is not always seen or experienced in situations that fight kindness. We can affirm our spouses, appreciating them for who they are, what they mean to our lives instead of looking for things of that bring strife. We can encourage our kids in their day to day walk, believing in them and speaking it into their lives. The power of words can begin a process of greatness in young lives. We can also teach them kindness by demonstration between mom and dad on how they treat each other. We all have point of references, something to fall back to. If we all understand that what is desired of us is kindness, we will show more of it on a day to day basis in our homes, in church, community, in our jobs, wherever we go. Are you aware of what is desired of you? Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 11:29, "For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable"</strong>

Car manufacturers fascinate me. Each of them have built different types of cars, some customized to suit the buyers. For instant, Mercedes Benz can have one of their built cars, look alike but different classes eg. C and S class series. You may find two cars look the same however they cost different. The difference in cost is driven by different factors such as performance, upgrades (sunroof, navigation system, more power etc) that make one more expensive than the other. <!--more-->Everyone has a reason for going for different type of cars depending on what they are looking for in a car and what they can afford. Cars can be upgraded and customized. Here is the reason for bringing this up, just because a car has been made does not mean there is no more room to either upgrade or customize it. For us humans we have God our maker who made us and still is willing to upgrade us with gifts and talents.

Let's explore what talents are. According to the dictionary, talents are marked innate ability, as for artistic accomplishments. It's natural endowment. We are different in order to maintain our individuality. With the uniqueness of each of us, we have talents and abilities. I was watching something on TV not too long ago, and they brought these young kids of about 10 years and under. They all had different talents and abilities. One at the age of 4 could sing and dance Elvis songs; there was also a 4 year old girl who had such knowledge of the government and politics. Talents is what you have that very few people have. Talent in singing, writing poetry, dancing, public speaking. At my house I have brothers talented in drawing portraits, another in poetry and another in playing drums, different talents but fitting in one household. I believe God allows us to have talents to enjoy and trade with them to reach His people.

<strong>Mathew 25:14-15, "14 For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them. 15, "And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey"</strong>. We don't know what they might have been given to do but it's clear they were asked to do was according to their own abilities. The Master knew what they were capable of; he bestowed goods and talents to them. He expected them to do something with the talents to the maximum. Are you using your God given talents to the maximum? Each of them doubled their goods through their talents except the last man who buried his because he only had one. The rest were rewarded according to the way they used their talent, the last one was denied and even that which he had was taken away.<span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel">When we come back to talking about gifts, we understand that gifts are not things worked for but bestowed without any plan for compensation. Anytime you pay for a gift, it wouldn't be considered as a gift anymore. The good God of mercy has taken the liberty to bestow gifts in us for a </span></span></span></span></span><span id="__mceDel"><span id="__mceDel">reason. The gifts are to be used to edify the body of Christ. All the gifts of the saints fall back to the Holy Spirit who empowers men to do what they would not do on their own. Once again, each of us have different gifts, <strong>Romans 12:6, "Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them"</strong>. The gifts we have also differs because of the measure of grace and faith and has to be put to work. Regardless of what we have, God requires us to use them. What are some of the spiritual gifts, prophesy, ministry, teaching, leadership,mercy, exhortation. All these gifts and many more originate from the same Spirit and are to be used to benefit the body. I have my own and I can also tap from someone who has the gift I don't have. This is the part where we need each other for the gifts we have to benefit each other. <strong>1Corinthians 12:7, "But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all</strong>", <strong>Romans 12 and 1Corinthians 12 talks </strong>about spiritual gifts and what they are for. Before men, gifts are for self while with God, gifts are to benefit the entire body of Christ. If God has given you a gift and talents you are not using in your local church, you are missing the opportunity to maximize that gift. The body has different parts, the hands, legs, eyes, ears to mention a few. All have different functions but depend on each other. It's like saying the hands have the gift to handle, touch, build; meanwhile the legs have the gift to carry, move, and help escape danger. Different functions but depend on each other. The hands needs the legs, ears, eyes etc for it to be complete and so is the gifting we have that other people don't and what they have that we don't have. We need our gifts and their gifts and vice versa. <strong>Romans 11:29, "For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable"</strong>, interesting to know that His gifts are irreversible, in other words, they are final. I believe God will not take away what he has bestowed upon us, but if we are not using them, it will not be rewarding to us or people around us. We all have gifts and talents on board, let's maximize them to build and further His kingdom. The more you use them, the more you allow room for gifts upgrade. The more you empty yourself with what you have, the more gifts will be bestowed upon you. Blessings Ev</span></span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 23:12, “And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.” </strong>

Paul was known by many as a troublemaker against the kingdom of darkness. I don’t know who these Jews made their vow to, and who it was that would curse them, but they were not going to kill Paul, because God would not allow His servant to die at this time. The thinking of these Jews was so warped because they were willing to come under a curse to kill Paul; however they failed to realize that they were already under a curse, the curse of sin. <strong>Deuteronomy 28:15 – 68</strong> and <strong>Psalm 1</strong> show this very clearly.<!--more-->

Why did these men desire to kill Paul? Paul was boldly preaching Jesus Christ. When we speak boldly and unashamed speak about Jesus, people that are resistant may get very upset, in this case they had murder in their hearts. The truth is painful for those living under a curse, and resistant to it.

Picture with me a time when you may have been sleeping, and you wake up because someone has been loud and turned the light on. Although no one poked you in the eye, you feel pain, your eyes actually hurt. The light caused pain because your eyes have adjusted to the darkness during the night. Whoever turned on the light is usually someone that you may want to “send to heaven immediately” or at least you may want to throw something at them.

These desiring to kill Paul lived in darkness, their hearts were so adjusted to darkness, and they desired to love under a curse until they murdered this Jewish preacher that proclaimed the Jewish Messiah, Jesus Christ. The light of Jesus Christ emanated from Paul and it hurt the darkness of their hearts and they were literally on a manhunt to murder Paul. “<strong>And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil” (John 3:19)</strong>. Realize that when you as a Christian shine the light of Jesus into the dark heart of the sinner, it will hurt and they may hate you for it, curse you, and even persecute you. If this happens at times, don’t be surprised. Jesus said in <strong>John 15:18-19</strong> “<strong>18 If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. 19 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you</strong>.”

<strong>John 15:20-21</strong>, <strong>“Remember the words I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. 21 They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me.”</strong>

<strong>Matthew 5:10-12,</strong> “<strong>10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. “11 Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you</strong>.

<strong>“In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven” (Matthew 5:16).</strong> Now go out and shine today, whether at work, school, or in the market place, SHINE!

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 12:9-11, “9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus” </strong>

A pastor saw a young lady in his church after a summer time of her being away. Upon coming back from her vacation, the pastor noticed that her stomach was quite large. He thought that her and her husband were obviously going to have a baby and therefore said, “You’re starting to show.” However she replied, “I’m not pregnant”. Needless to say the woman was very offended, in which time that the Pastor said, “I’m sorry, I’ll perhaps need you to forgive me seventy times seven for that one insensitive comment.”<!--more-->

Have you ever offended someone, either purposefully or accidentally? Perhaps you have a humorous story as well. However, have you ever offended someone, because you were living for Christ? When Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, not everyone was happy about this public miracle. Jesus was in Bethany, with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, and “<strong>9</strong> <strong>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus</strong>.”

Now that Lazarus is a walking miracle, raised to newness of life, his very life was offensive to many, and they wanted to kill not only Christ, but Lazarus as well. If Christ has raised your life from being dead in your sins and transgressions when you repented and put your trust in Jesus Christ, then should your life not offend? How many get offended as you speak and live for Christ? There should be those that absolutely despise you for the cause of Christ. You were just like Lazarus, dead in your sins and trespasses, and also broke God’s Moral Law (The Ten Commandments). Christ called you by name, “come forth” and at which time you repented and put your trust in Christ. Others took the grave clothes off you by discipling you in the faith that you might walk closer to Him, and become more like Jesus. Lazarus represented Christ, and therefore his life was on the line, he was despised, he was hated, his enemies called for his blood. It is kind of humorous, as Ravi Zaccharias said, “<em>what are the Jews going to threaten Lazarus with, death? How can someone like Lazarus actually be threatened by death, he already has been there and done that?” </em>

Christian, if you are truly living your life for Christ, then where are your accusers, where are those that hate you and want you dead because your life is so offensive and repugnant to those in the world? We don’t desire to offend others with the gospel, that is not our goal, nor should it be, however, the gospel is offensive. Paul wrote, “<strong>18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God…For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; 24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.” 1Corinthians 1:18-24.</strong>

Ray Comfort <em>writes “The undertaker’s nightmare”. The Son of God created havoc for undertakers by speaking to their frigid merchandise. His voice was supernatural. A mere “Lazarus, come forth,” spoken to a corpse meant a nightmarish dilemma for the Bethany funeral director, because he was left with no body to deal with. Up until that moment, his business was mortally secure. Four days after the death, he had everything wrapped up, when suddenly, three words unraveled his inanimate toil. Reimbursement of all funeral expenses was just the beginning of the bad dream. Death was his living, and if this stranger from Nazareth continued to speak around graves, his business itself would soon be terminal. Jesus Christ was the undertaker’s nightmare because death bowed its vile knee to His voice, and the day is promised when all undertakers will hit the unemployment line! The raising of Lazarus snatched the profit from the undertaker; but the incident happened for the inestimable profit of humanity. It was the long-awaited fulfillment of what was spoken of by the prophets of old. It was a beam of wondrous and glistening light in the most hopeless and darkest of all caves.</em>”

Perhaps if you never offend anyone, perhaps you should check to see if you are walking with Christ. Share your faith with three people a day, and at the end of the week, see how many were receptive and how many were offended. Speak boldly and with compassion, for the lost need to hear the truth about Jesus from one he has raised from being dead in their sins, therefore you make a good candidate. Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 12:24, "...unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain"</strong>

Man in general is a selfish being, from Genesis all the way you will see in different instances where man shows how selfish he is. Well we could say that happened in the bible days but let's look at the world today, we see it again. I would expect that the believers would be exempt, that is not the case, maybe we are all not aspiring to get up there but still we are very selfish in certain areas.<!--more-->

Someone might say those are very harsh words. Think of a number who church to them is about what they can gain out of it, it's about what God can do for us and always desiring to hear, receive and be ministered to and not ready to give. I'm not talking about finances but give time, help that is needed and more so bring people to the Kingdom who need the same things we desire. We always come for us, I have seen this even with small ministries, folks are trying to find out who is going to be there and what to expect and receive instead of what can I give or what can I do to make this ministry successful. How about worship, many don't want to because they are waiting for God to give them a spirit of worship. We are the ones who need to worship God, that's our duty to give Him all the praises and not do it when we feel like.

Jesus shows us what service is before He is betrayed. The bible says that He knew who will betray Him, reject Him but still He served them. He knew that He did not come to receive but came to give and one of his last teachings was "give". He girded Himself with a towel, went down on His knees and washed His disciples feet regardless of who they were and what He knew of them, read it in <strong>John 13</strong>.

We have been called to service, we are being raised for a time like this not just to be receivers but givers too. In the text referenced we are told that "<strong>unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain</strong>". Already we are seeing the beginning point and that is death as there can be no resurrection without death. The grain of wheat is very small however we are told of it's significant role when something is done with it. We too as believers yes may be very small in the church and might not be known but the truth of the matter is, we are very significant. Your prayers, presence, support does make a difference because you are significant in the body of Christ. Look at the verse closely, it says unless the grain of wheat referring to only one grain (individual), God calls His people as individuals, He does not call them as a group. We are called to die to self as the grain does need to fall on the dirt and dies. I have learnt that no one can go up unless they go down first simply because those who went to the top without going down tend to be arrogant and prideful in their walks but if you went down and the Lord brought you up, you have every reason to give thanks to Him and cherish the position He has entrusted you with. One has to fall on the ground and die, it's because when anything falls into the ground, the outward appearance is consumed by the ground and real seed which is on the inside begins to show forth. We have to be stripped of self righteousness and feeling that we are a little bit better and are brought to a place where the ground consumes what we perceive of ourselves and we allow the Lord to transform the inside as what is on the inside is the real deal. This might not happen overnight as when it falls on the ground it remains by itself for a season awaiting to begin to shoot forth from the ground and later produce much grain. I don't know about you but for me, preparation takes place in the closet and like the seed which is not seen when it begins to go <span id="__mceDel">through the process, results is what people see.</span>

Many cannot be effective in reaching others because they are not willing to die to self, they are not willing to sacrifice or give their time, money, talents. I was never anointed to sit on it but utilize it. In fact it's not for me but for those who are in need. In <strong>Luke 6:38, "Give and it shall be given unto you, good measure press down shaken together running over...", Acts 20:35, "...it's more blessed to give than receive</strong>". I desire to witness to the lost, encourage, inspire, pray and reach them that need gospel. With our jobs let's also have the same attitude and not just see what my job will offer me but what I can offer to my job. Let's have the attitude that we all came to make a difference wherever the Lord places us.

What do you have and what can you give, are you always on the verge of receiving and never give? Pray today that God will teach you how to fall on the ground like the grain seed and also teach you how to die to things that might hinder your step to give. Give your time, talents, gifts, energy, experiences, knowledge, wisdom, love, patience, understanding and the list goes on. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 10:17, "So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God"</strong>

Commercials are one of the greatest tools the manufacturers use to convey messages of their new products. Millions of dollars are poured into commercials to create awareness of the latest products. The commercials are supposed to be catchy and sometimes funny, some with twisted humor. Why do people go for things they go for? either someone told them about it and were convinced it works or saw it on TV, heard it on radio, billboards, newspapers. The product will not do them good if they don't try it. For a fact, most commercials exaggerate what their products can do only to discover its ability to work for a short time and its effectiveness is gone.<!--more-->

We have talked about faith so many times but let this help build your faith. <strong>Faith is the confident belief in the truth, value, and worthiness of a person, idea or a thing. It's being loyal to a person or a thing</strong>. If you were to tell me your name, I must have faith to believe you told me the truth. If I said, "I don't believe you", chances are, you will be offended because I am insinuating you are deceiving me, the same way if you told me where you live and I told you I doubt it, you will not take it kindly. <strong>Hebrews 11:6, says "For without faith it is impossible to please God...". </strong>You want to please God, you have to have faith, believing what He has said without doubting. Doubt is an indication of mistrust, and what an insult it is to God. He has displayed his products to us inform of creation, life, blessings again and again therefore He is God who can be trusted, have faith in Him.

<strong>Faith is commitment</strong>. When the bible talks about FAITHFUL servant, it refers to one who is committed to a task because he has believed the one who authored the task. It is a way to build more faith because the person whom you hang around for long, their character is displayed, you have a better way of dealing with them when it comes to faith. It is evident that you have no faith in some people, you cannot trust them with things like information or finances, they have no character to support that trust. Thanks be to God who is faithful, He never leaks your information to someone else, and does not mess with what you have trusted Him with. The children of God are people of faith, committed to this walk of life with Christ, <strong>2Corinthians 5:7, "For we walk by faith and not by sight</strong>". It is a tough one but we are determined to ride it out because we want to please Him.

He that uses the product must first believe that it works and what is the testimony? I don't think faith just appears from nowhere and we believe it. It comes by hearing, hearing someone's testimony that God can, hearing the word that drills through the nutshell of doubt and unbelief. The continuous word spoken goes around that shell and melts it down allowing it to have a new master <strong>F.A.I.T.H</strong> (<strong>F</strong>orever <strong>A</strong>ll <strong>I</strong>n <strong>T</strong>hy <strong>H</strong>and). You can only come to someone because you know they have it, Christ does have it forever in His hands. Doubt is the enemy of faith and it comes easily, but faith needs a lot of force to occupy. Faith is gradual concurring one step at a time depending on what it is given to feed on. We have established what faith comes by, "<strong>Hearing</strong>", this presents a little problem because you could hear things but wrong things and for sure those can also build faith but only towards the wrong things. "<strong>It comes by hearing by the word of God</strong>". God's word is like the commercial that we see out there, the only difference is that <strong>His word is not exaggerated, nothing can be added to it and nothing can be taken away from it. It presents itself, defends itself and also proves itself. It never fails, it does not work for a season, it works always</strong>. <strong>It does not fall short of anything and it does not return void. What it starts, it will accomplish. It is committed through the author to accomplish what it is meant for</strong>.<strong> Do not forget that faith draws a man to God</strong>. Having faith in someone whom you know cannot do it is being unwise. There is nothing impossible with Him, He is the <strong>"…author and the finisher of our faith..." Hebrews 12:2,</strong> for, <strong>Hebrews 11:6,"...He that comes to God must first believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him</strong>". Let your faith be boosted because you have heard the word of God. Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 1:11, "O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget think handmaid, but wilt give unto think handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</strong>"

WOW, what a whooper of a desperate prayer. Hannah just in one chapter shares her deepest heart chamber with God, because it seemed that only He would understand. She was a woman who was misunderstood by those around her. The Lord had closed her womb which in OT times was viewed as a curse by. <!--more-->She was provoked severely by Peninnah, Elkanah's other wife, for it and her heart was deeply grieved. She would only weep and not even eat, and bitterness of soul built up within her. Not even her own husband nor Eli the priest (the spiritual one) understood her sorrowful spirit. So what did she do? Did she set out to kill her husband or the other wife, because she couldn't conceive a child? Did she verbally try and abuse the other wife or try and defend her situation? Did she verbally attack Eli the priest, for not being able at first to understand her condition, for even he thought her to be drunk as she prayed her prayer. No, she did none of these things that were possible reactions by any other in her situation. What would you have done?

How did Hannah finally respond to her sorrowful situation, of no one understanding her, and being labeled as cursed by God Himself? She prayed a prayer. What, that's it, she didn't take up arms and go postal, run away, or even take her own life? No, she prayed a powerful, real, heartfelt, from the guts of her desperation, prayer.

Just then, the Lord remembered (not that He ever forgot) her, answering her prayer. And granted her a son, the prophet Samuel. God has answered her prayer, bigger and greater than she could have ever imagined. But isn't God like that, we ask for something in His will, and He goes above and beyond what we had seen through our, many times, lack of faith. Even recently the Lord blessed me with a vehicle beyond what I dreamed in prayer for. Praise God!

She responds to God in a way that we need to when God blesses us, in worship and thanksgiving, lest we worship the blessing, and not the Blesser! "<strong>For this child I have prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of Him: Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshiped the Lord there."
</strong>
*This child - Samuel
*I have prayed - she labored in prayer
*The Lord hath given me - she acknowledges that God alone blessed her
*I have lent him to the Lord - she, and no one else, gave him back to God unconditionally in dedication to the Lord's work. She was a mom of faith. She didn't't give up something for lent (40 days give it to God then take it back), she gave completely open handed to God.

Ø What about you are you in a desperate situation, then pray, He hears as He remembered Hannah, He will remember you.
Ø When God blesses you, in His way, will you give back to Him open handed?
Ø Self check - The USA chokes on the blessings of God greatly. Is there anything God gave you that you are worshiping, instead of giving back to Him? One must be painfully honest to break free from any idolatry.
Ø Remember - God loves us to give back to Him what He has given up, but He most desires us to lend Him a life, our life, and lead others to Him that they might lend their lives to the Lord as well. Blessings Pastor Phil.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Colossians 3:23, "And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men"</strong>

Let me select a few people in the bible who knew God and acted on what they believed to have been God’s will.<!--more-->

<strong>1Samuel 17</strong> tells us of the story of David and Goliath. We all know this story. David comes to the field and his main and only job in the field is to check on his brothers and bring them food. Watch how the Lord opens a door to glorify His name through this young man. The Philistines threatened Israelites by a reason of a giant in their team. No one in Israel could face this giant; they had forgotten that God was their giant. David shows up to find Goliath threatening and defying the armies of God, he then says vs. 26,<strong> "...who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?", vs. 37, "Moreover David said, "The LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine."</strong> David could only speak with boldness because he knew who God was (is). He knew what God was capable of doing, he delighted himself in the Lord and he knew the Lord would be pleased with the move. God had opened a door for him and all he needed to do was walk through it. He was in God's will and we know what happened.

In the case of Hannah in <strong>1Samuel 1</strong>, God had something in store for her, instead of speaking it directly to her, He allowed Penninah, her husband's other wife to provoke her. It built such a great desire in her heart for a son. I don't know how much she knew the Lord because year after year she prayed that God would bless her and the Lord did not. I like her spirit, she knew that having a child was acceptable therefore she couldn't quit. The more she spent time in the presence of God, the more she learned to know Him and His ways, and the more her selfish desires for a child melted a way. This was her prayer that opened doors for her blessing,<strong> 1Samuel 1:11, "Then she made a vow and said, "O LORD of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, ...".</strong> God showed her something and that became the desire of her heart and we know that the male child Samuel was God's anointed prophet. God was glorified in Samuel's work.

Then here comes Esther a slave girl. An opportunity arose and she was encouraged to step in and fill in a position for a new queen. God opened a door for her to make a difference without her even knowing. The Jews were being mistreated and something had to happen for this to stop. At one point it was about herself but listen to what her uncle tells her,<strong> Esther 4:14, "For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"</strong> Esther had an opportunity to glorify God using her position to deliver her people the Jews. Isn't it amazing that when you know God, you become sensitive to the things He is doing? I heard of a song, "<i>God has given me a window and I can finally see the light</i>". I now know when God is giving me a window, it becomes clear and clearer as you get to know Him more and more.

How about Peter in <strong>Matthew 14</strong>, the man who walked on water besides Jesus. He saw Jesus walking on water, he had walked with Jesus to know what was acceptable. Jesus had said, greater works than these shall you do more so in reference to preaching, so why not do what Jesus was doing, walk on water? Peter saw an opportunity to strengthen his faith and the faith of those who were in the boat with him, he therefore said<strong> vs. 28, "..., "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water." 29 So He said, "Come." And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus".</strong>

Time fails me to talk about others in the bible who over and over again God commends them for their initiative acts for His glory. God said, <b>"I</b><strong> will write my laws in their hearts and they will know what to do without me even telling them" (paraphrased</strong>). Yes there are some that you have to clearly hear the Lord but there are some that He shows you, opens the doors and you do your part. What did the people I just shared have in common, they did it with all their heart not for themselves but unto God,<strong> Colossians 3:23, "And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men".</strong> And because of their humility God exalted them in due season. Their aim was to please the Lord in all that they did. They had known what He would require and God reached them with blessings, <strong>James 4:10, "Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up".</strong> I have applied these principles in my walk with God and God has been glorified in each step and He has lifted me up in due time. I sought for opportunities, walked through the doors God opened, did everything heartily without complaining and my motivation was to Glorify Him, He is still opening more doors to glorify Himself.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>2Kings 7:1-20, "And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?"</b>

There was such a great famine in the land of Samaria that everything was valued and expensive. The bible says that even the dung of a dove was considered precious and rare commodity highly priced. This alone gives me a picture that there was such a great famine in this land. Knowing the situation in Samaria, let’s look at four men again in vs. 3 who we are not even given their names.<!--more--> These were men we would consider less fortunate in the society for no. 1 <strong>they were lepers</strong>. Anyone who had leprosy in the olden times was cast out of the city. They lived in caves, mountains or right out of the city. The lepers were always required to chant "unclean, unclean". Situation number one looked severe then topped with situation number 2. <strong>Which is as lethal as number one and that is famine.</strong> Sick and no food, How much can a man take?

They were aware of their situation as outcasts and they knew sooner or later one of these situations would kill them first, sickness or starvation or both. I love how they reasoned with themselves, <strong>vs. 3&amp;4"...and they said one to another, why sit here until we die? if we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also"</strong>. I thank God that in some tough times He still allows us to think and reason. Though we may feel handicapped in some areas, we are reminded that there are things deposited in us that are alive and functioning. I do not want to throw everything out of the window simply because there is part me that is not functioning like it should. I may be struggling in some areas and that could be my leprosy, and I might be going without the spiritual food for some unknown reason. One thing I know, that I am not dead yet so devil don't bring me no casket for burial, God is showing me the part my life that is still living and He is giving me grace to activate them. The other part of me is a means to bring life to the rest of my being. I see many beat themselves because what was working for them at one point stopped. I believe there are <strong>TANKS</strong> God reserved for a time like this. You might have not known that you had a filled tank and just when you thought you had exhausted everything and left hopeless, He comes to open this tank He put in reserve. This is the time you see that you could do more with less. The four lepers lost friends, food, health, family but thank God they did not lose their senses, the ability to reason. I believe God reserved this tank of reasoning for a time like this and it was a matter of time before He would pop it up for their use. Yes they were limited but that did not stop them from thinking of the next move, it was a risky move, still they put everything on the line for whatever happens.

Four feeble men decided to march to the enemies’ camp in <strong>vs. 5, "And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians"</strong>. They had no weapons, they were sick but still pushed themselves as they marched to the enemies camp. I know that there are times when God requires us to do the ridiculous things that He may show Himself as God in tough situations. There are things He will not accomplish until we respond to the move. It is until we demonstrate how badly we want it that we do something about it (pray, fast, seek, knock, ask).

There are times when I feel that I have lost so much to function effectively, but those are the times I am reminded that I am not dead yet, God put a tank on reserve for a time like this, therefore I will rise up again, take a step of faith and move as I say, “Be glorified in me”.<strong> Philippians 4:6, "Be careful for nothing....". Blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 7:1-20, "And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?"</strong>

And the four leprous men reasoned and moved, <strong>vs. 5-6"And when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there. For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of Chariots, even the noise of horses, even the noise of great host: and they said one to another, Lo, King if Israel has hired against us the kings of Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us"</strong>. When these men moved, <strong>God took over.<!--more--></strong> Think of the things you see yourself doing which are acceptable according to God’s word, then think of your limitations that have paralyzed you. Here is something to chew on, <strong>the world</strong> <strong>crowns success, God crowns faithfulness. </strong>You may not be successful but you can be faithful and that could be a great strength an employer could be looking for in a job situation. In God's eyes we are not dealt with by who we are and what we have accomplished but by what He accomplishes through us. It is good to have the qualifications, it is a greater blessing when you see the Lord fight for you where you do not have all that it takes, I’m speaking from experience. Somewhere in <strong>Romans it says, “them that He called, He justified and them that He justified, He also glorified”</strong>. This is what faith is all about, hoping for those things which are not seen and yet believing that they can happen. <strong>2Corinthians 12:10, "Therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities, in reproaches and necessities, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong". </strong>May I use this verse in a different way<strong>, “when you are not that's when you are for Christ’s’ sake</strong>.

The four lepers moved, the Lord multiplied the sound of their feet and they sounded like a mighty army. Take a closer look at what God did, <strong>God did not change their condition for the sake of the enemy, He changed the way the enemy perceived of them</strong>. God may not change your situation or circumstances, He may allow someone else see you as an asset<strong>. God may allow someone else to see more potential in you than you could see by yourself and that is because He has reserved a tank for His glory for such a time as this. </strong>They were weak almost dying, they did not have war gear and to make it worse, they were just four heading to the enemy’s camp to surrender and that is when the Lord made their feet sound like a mighty army. Of course their walk was no different and they did not even know what happened; only God knew. I do not know how God does it but it works. I may never understand how He operates but I love to be part of His operations.

The enemy did not care to check if these were true warriors coming after them, they fled leaving their tents, their horses and everything for the sake of their lives. “<strong>Greater is He that lives in side of us than He that is in the world”, 1John 4:4 tells us</strong>. Read the rest of the story and you will see how they ate and drunk and had a good time, God favored them. They came and mentioned it to the king of Israel of what happened. The king of Israel thought the Syrians were playing a trick on them and the Syrians thought Israel came to attack them, God was in control of the destiny of these four men. All my life I never got what I deserved or qualified, all I have known is how best God can be glorified in my life through what He does therefore when I moved, God stepped in and made the sound of my feet sound like a mighty army. Instead of being judged by what I had, I was judged by what God could do through me. So the things I have not yet accomplished will not cause my dreams and desire to die. Though it looks like nothing is happening and the conditions are getting tougher, part of me maybe affected and not function effectively, I am reminded God is in control. Even in the midst of it, I will not let them hinder me from rising up and moving. I may be feeble and I may not walk well but that is a good sign that <strong>I am not dead yet</strong>. <strong>Psalm 118:17, "I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord". God has a reserved tank for a time like this. </strong>My life in Christ is a book yet to be written, a song yet to be sung, a testimony yet to be testified, a desire yet to be fulfilled to the glory of God. I cannot go under just because I have leprosy in my life. I encourage you too not to go down, though something in you is draining life out of you and at times you feel like this is it and can’t do it anymore. <strong>It is not over, until God says it is over, </strong>so ask the Lord to show you the other tanks He put on reserve , rise up and use what is in that tank and give God all the glory as a sign you are not dead yet. Dead things have no voice. Blessings Ev

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One day, as an artist was down on his knees pounding with chisel and mallet at the base of his sculpture, a preacher approached and said, "I wish I could deal such changing blows to the hearts of men." The sculptor looked up at him, and with a steadfast gaze replied, "Maybe you could if you worked like me…down on your knees."<!--more-->

Jesus never taught His disciples to preach. Instead, He taught them to pray. EM Bounds said, “All ability to talk to men is measure by the ability with which a preacher can talk to God (about) men.” These were the leaders who would spread the message He died for through preaching and teaching, yet Jesus taught them more about praying than He did about public speaking. Prayer was the decisive factor in spreading the gospel; prayer was the primary ministry they were called to; prayer was the guarantee they would succeed.

Charles Spurgeon once cried, "We need red-hot, white-hot men who glow with intense heat; whom you cannot approach without feeling that your heart is getting warmer; who burn their way in all positions straight on to the desired work; men like thunderbolts flung from Jehovah's hand, crashing through every opposing thing, till they have reached the target aimed at; men impelled by Omnipotence." Such a fervent condition can only be obtained through prayer. It cannot be learned in school, although school is good. It cannot be gotten by books, although reading is good. Prayer is what soaks a preacher’s soul in the burden of God and empowers him to ignite others.

In Acts 4:13, the religious leaders marveled at the apostles. They knew these men were “uneducated and untrained,” and yet “they marveled…and realized they had been with Jesus.” And more, they saw “the man who had been healed standing with them (and) could say nothing against it.” Peter and John had no silver and they had no gold. They had no earthly resources or human ability to rely on. All they had was what had been obtained in prayer: Holy Ghost unction. With that, they healed a cripple man, confounded the religious elite and ushered in a revival that would turn the world upside down.

Today, however, we have plenty of silver and gold. Today, we have the most intelligent and intellectual preachers that seminaries can produce—but how many of them have truly been with Jesus. How many can persevere in prayer long enough to make any lasting difference in a culture that is rapidly going to hell.

Without prayer, we may be able to attract a crowd but we'll never convert them into disciples. Without prayer, we may be able to build large churches with with attractive programs, but there will be no encounter with the presence of God that melts hardened hearts, transform lives and produce men and women who are on fire for God ready to ignite the world for Jesus Christ. Pastor Gregg T. Johnson

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Corinthians 2:1-5, “1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. 2 For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. 3 I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling. 4 And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 5 that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God"</strong>

Today marks our 11th Year Anniversary of writing devotionals, glory be to God for great things He has done and this far He has brought us. When I think about His faithfulness, all I do is humble myself because He has shown Himself so strong on behalf of those who put their confidence in Him. He uses the weak, the despised, the rejected to get His work done so that He gets all the glory for working in such a life. As Paris Reidhead in 1963 preached this message, “THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY THAT JESUS CHRIST WILL GET GLORY OUT OF A LIFE THAT HE'S REDEEMED WITH HIS PRECIOUS BLOOD IS WHEN HE CAN FILL THAT LIFE WITH HIS PRESENCE AND LIVE THROUGH IT HIS OWN LIFE.”, so on this truth do I stand.

These 11 years have been a true great experience of learning about our amazing God through the pages of the bible and sharing it with the world. The writings have been a great tool the Lord has used to open my eyes and I give Him all the praise. He has brought brethren to minister along side of me especially Pastor Phil Sessa, and I can honestly say, the Lord is not a respecter of any man. I have learnt that God is not looking for those with abilities to use, He is looking for those available to use.

Over the years, hundreds of messages have gone out and hundreds of testimonies have been received of how the Lord has used these messages to impact lives. Today I hope you join us in celebrating what the Lord has done.

Blessings

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 16:16-18," ... And these signs shall follow them that believe..."</strong>

We as believers have been privileged to be part of things the Lord is doing partially because we are His children and He desires to let us in on what He is doing. He may never explain the process but definitely we will know the outcome. Because He is the reason for the outcome, we understand that He is not a man that He should lie neither is He a son of man that He should repent, if He has said it, surely enough, He will do it.<!--more-->

Talking about signs is interesting as signs are to show us directions and give us the condition of a place. There are signs that tell us to slow down, sharp bends, animals around, steep slope, no change of lane, lanes reduced or increased etc. As you can see all these does show us certain things a head of time. This is how the world in the natural operates and at times when we come to God, many times we desire the same; we want to see first before we can follow. We want to be sure of what is a head of us and the signs are a means to build confidence of what to expect, however with God it's different. If you do not have the signs a head of time, fear may grip you hence affecting even your speed.

Jesus said"…<strong>And these signs shall follow them that believe</strong>". Jesus knew that for every believer to operate under His power and on a higher level, the believer has to be brought out of the natural into the supernatural. On the supernatural you do not know how to operate in that setting, God is all you need . This is where if God does not come through for you, there can be nothing good that can happen. If you look at what faith is all about, it's not about feeling, it's about trusting. It is also not about knowing but believing. I may not know the way but because, "<strong>I know whom I have believed, … I am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day", 2Timothy 1:12</strong>. I may not need to see the signs because I might be tempted to follow the signs by myself without God. If I do not know, He will direct me all the way. Something to keep in mind, we don’t settle for signs, you don’t see a sign and then camp around it because you have seen it. Signs point to something bigger, signs are to lead you to a destiny. In this case, signs are to point us to Jesus, they are a means to an end. Remember the wise men who were led by the stars, the stars were the signs. But they did not look at the signs to be fascinated by them or even worship them, the signs were to lead them to this new born baby Jesus, the Messiah. Many are out of line because they run after signs and wonders, running from one meeting to another expecting a zap of some kind. “<strong>Signs follow them that believe</strong>” , a means to a bigger picture, Jesus Christ. For safety, I would put signs at the bottom, God’s word should be right on top.

<strong>Psalms 23:6,</strong> "<strong>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord"</strong>. I believe that there are things we need not to fight or even try to fix them as long as we are doing what the Lord requires of us, because good things will follow us if they are in God’s will for our lives. Remember it does not say we shall follow goodness and mercy but they shall follow us. Isn't it amazing that we will not only hear what the Lord is doing and can do but be part of what He is going in our lives? Then we need to take away our signs that cause us to walk carefully according to the worlds’ ways and desire to see God do greater things that will blow the mind and the mentality of men. After all, He is able to make away where their seems to be no way and the crooked paths straight. Only believe, all things are possible with God, the signs point to Him. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 14:3, "As He sat at the table, a woman came to him having an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard."</strong>

The four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John give as different accounts of events. Matthew and John were with Jesus as His disciples. Mark and Luke were not disciples however many scholars and theologians believe Mark’s account were provided to him by Apostle Peter. The four were impacted in different ways and you will see how they were each impacted by the account of their story. Though they all may have seen the same thing in reality or by narration, they did not report exactly the same way. Yes there are different accounts each of them give of certain incidents but there are some incidents that all of them did not report. Here is a classic case involving a woman who came to Jesus with an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard.<!--more-->

Matthew reports this incident in <strong>Matthew 26</strong>; Mark in <strong>Mark 14</strong>; Luke in <strong>Luke 7;</strong> John in <strong>John 12</strong>. Reading all the four accounts, the story is the same however each of them takes the time to address certain things that others did not report.

Why would each record the same differently with some leaving things out and add some stuff in? Here is my thinking, everyone was impacted and touched differently and that is what they reported. <strong>What captures your heart is what you are most likely to report</strong>. What you respond to the most is what you will work towards. How you are really impacted may not be the way I will be but we still report about the same story. I would like to address each of their accounts and we will arrive at the common denominator.

Matthew says, they were all in the Bethany in the house of Simon the leper. He first identified where they were and whose house they were in. He also tells us the condition of the owner. He doesn't take time to tell us who Simon the leper's background was, his tribe, the condition of his heart. Mark comes along and reports the same as Matthew reports in his first line. Luke comes along and does not give us the man's name but tells us that he was a Pharisee. Matthew and Mark were touched by the fact that Jesus was hanging out with the sick. As for Luke, he was touched by the fact that Jesus was in the house of a Pharisee, the people who opposed Jesus. What does John have to say? John starts by talking about the presence of Lazarus who had died and had been raised from the dead by Jesus, he was impacted by the fact that a man who was once dead was alive seating with them at the table for Passover. Four same first accounts but different beginnings.

Their report is on a woman who came in with an alabaster flask of. Whether she was invited or not we are yet to find out. As she comes in, I don't believe she is noticed until she does something that takes away everyone's breathe. Matthew, Luke and Mark just refers to her as the woman, a sinful woman. John utilizes an interview approach in my judgment to find out who she is. I can imagine him asking "please give me her name, he discovers that the woman's name was Mary. Different accounts and different stories and how they have been reported give us a better understanding of what really happened. Putting those pieces together gives us a full picture of where they were, whom they encountered with, their names, the incidents etc. Is it possible not to always rely on one side of the story? You figure it out.

My first point as I finish part one is, what you have seen and experienced and that has impacted your heart. We are not the same, God has given us individualities that each of us has a way to be impacted and impact others by our stories of life and how He has brought us this far. To be continued. Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 26:7, "A woman came to Him having a lambasted flask of very costly fragrant oil..."</strong>

The act of this woman was not rehearsed, practiced, or scripted worship, this was a decision made, action taken to worship Him holding nothing back.

Let us address a problem that arose while she worshiped. Matthew is very lenient, he brings all the disciples to the same level without pin pointing one person. Read what he says, <strong>"8 But His disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, "Why waste? 9, "For this fragrant oil might have been sold for much and given to the poor", Matthew 26:8-9.</strong> <!--more-->People’s reaction indicated Jesus was not worthy of this kind of worship. He did not deserve an expensive worship. The truth of the matter is, worshipping Christ will cost you something. That is why we sing, “<strong>We bring the sacrifice of praise</strong>”. Sacrifice goes with surrender. David was given a piece of land to offer sacrifice to the Lord, he refused to take it for free and offered money to buy it. Listen to what he said when offered a land for free<strong>, “Then the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will surely buy it from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God with that which costs me nothing</strong>”, <strong>2Samuel 24:24.</strong> Worshipping the Lord is costly.

Luke is different, he gets into more details,<strong> "Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, "This Man, if He were a prophet, would know what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner", Luke 7:39. </strong>The moment she walked in, she had already been labeled and despised therefore anything good that she was going to do from then forward was not going to be considered at all. By listening to the Pharisee speak, to him Jesus being in his house gave him an idea that he was a good righteous man. Paul tells us in <strong>Romans 7:18, "For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh..."</strong> This sums up the life of human beings that nothing good dwells in the life of man except Christ. To say more, the Pharisee changed his mind about Christ when he said “<strong>This Man, if He were a prophet…” </strong>To him being a prophet suggested handling only a certain class of people. He also had a wrong perception of Jesus, Jesus was more than a prophet.

To talk more about the Pharisee, he no longer referred to him as Jesus but this Man. It was no longer Christ but some questioned prophet who could not discern or create boundaries as to who He should be in contact with. Mark responds to people's action differently, he does not mention the Pharisee neither does he mention the disciples, all he says is that some people questioned it. He goes ahead and even talks about the price of the oil to show how expensive it was. He continues to say that they criticized her sharply.

John on the other hand says something about people's reaction; remember John is specific. At first, he identified the woman, and then identifies someone else who questioned the act of this woman. <strong>John 12:4-5, "4 But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot....said, 5, "Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"</strong> This is having people tell you what you should and shouldn't do when it comes to worshipping the Lord. Judas did not consider Jesus worthy of this worship.

This woman Mary had counted the cost of worshipping, she knew it was an expensive worship. She was sacrificing something precious to her, having learnt like David that she will not offer to the Lord what costs her nothing. No one could define how she needed to worship, it was not about the people but Jesus. With that said, who defines how you worship Him? When you worship, is it costing you? Are you giving the Lord what is LEFT (remaining) or what is RIGHT (just)? To finish Be blessed Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 26:7, "A woman came to Him having a lambasted flask of very costly fragrant oil..."</strong>

As I mentioned earlier, John tells us exactly who asked the question. <strong>John 12:4-5, "4 But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot....said, 5 "Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor</strong>?" If you know the story of Judas, he was the man who betrayed Jesus. Jesus knew him all along but still allowed him in. He knew that he was a thief yet the money collection bag was entrusted in his hands. Question, did he really care for the poor? John says that he did not and it is also a clear indication that He did not care about Jesus receiving this kind of worship. Something to ponder on, didn’t Jesus know everything that was in the hearts of the people in that room? It was just a matter of time before the hidden would be revealed. <strong>True worship will always reveal what is inside</strong> and when revealed, either you deal with it or cover it up. <!--more-->Remember that everything was fine until the woman showed up and began to worship, then real hearts, agendas and desires were revealed in that little time. Before Abel won the attention and the affection of God, Cain was all right. The moment Abel did that which was pleasing to Lord, Cain had an attitude which led him to kill his own brother. David was a man after God's own heart, the favor of the Lord was upon him, that created a problem for Saul. As you know, Saul constantly tried to find ways to kill David. This is how real worship will reveal what is in your heart and the heart of the people around. David danced and worshiped the Lord and suddenly Michal, Saul's daughter despised him when he worshipped.

Besides the woman’s worship creating a problem, there was another thing the people had problem with<strong>, Luke 7:48-49, "48 Then He said to her, "your sins are forgiven 49 "and those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?".</strong> Where were these people when John the Baptist said, <strong>"Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world</strong>"? Jesus also said, "<strong>The Son of Man has the power to forgive sins". </strong>We must get to know Him before we can love Him, and we must love Him before we can desire to obey Him something these people lacked.

In the whole story reported by the four gospels there is one common denominator, the star of the show to which none of them strayed away from in the story is JESUS the one whom we worship. Everything told in the story centered on Him. He is the reason why what was in the hearts of men revealed. He knew everyone in that room and what was in their hearts. We don't hear Him in the story asking to be worshiped or demanding, but when one of His own come in and did it, He was moved. She lifted Him from the earth. <strong>John 12:32, "And I, if I be lifted from the earth, will draw all men unto me".</strong> I don't know who might have been impacted, challenged, convicted, and inspired by what happened in that house. Jesus said that what the woman did would be preached on forever.

I am blessed to know that someone reported something that did not only impact them, it has also made an impact in my life. Just when I would think I finally got it, He reveals to me that I am not there yet. Your testimony can be an impact, your worship can do the same, and your service. Remember that He is the common denominator in your story. What you do for the Lord may sound silly and foolish but before His eyes, it's very significant. To close, <strong>your life in Christ is a story being recorded to be reported, the question is, who gets the credit? I hope Jesus does, blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 26:7, "A woman came to Him having alabaster flask of very costly fragrant oil..."</strong>

All the four gospels say the woman came in with an alabaster flask of very costly spikenard. Mark adds, "…<strong>Then she broke the flask</strong>...", <strong>Mark 14:3</strong>. This woman who John tells us is Mary teaches us what worship is all about. The fact that she broke the flask has a lot to say about worship. In church it is easy to be cool, calm, and collected, and by that I mean, it’s easy to control how you worship. That is like opening a flask and pouring the amount of oil you want to pour out and closing it back. You have the power to control what comes out. A broken person is like the flask (jar) with no time to control. <!--more-->You break a jar with liquid in it, it's impossible to control the flow, you cannot even collect what has been poured out however hard you may try. You cannot save what you have broken but He can. If you open it then I assure you that you can save it. Anything you carefully open may be something you are not ready to lose. What comes out of something broken does not stay in one place, it spreads out finding paths to flow in. Is this not the case with worship, it flows freely from a broken heart, <strong>Psalm 34:18, “The LORD is near to those who have a broken heart, And saves such as have a contrite spirit”</strong>. They are not ashamed to look foolish worshipping the Lord, they do not care about who sees them and what they say about their style of worship. They are just glad that Jesus saved them when they were a wretched sinners and this is their way of showing gratitude to the One who deserves all worship.

Here comes Luke telling us more of what she did. Of all the people that were in that house, Jesus was the one who deserved to be worshipped. Instead of the rest learning and joining the woman in worshipping, they got caught up in what she was doing. <strong>Luke 7:38, "and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with her tears, and wiped them with her hair and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil"</strong>. Doesn't sound like a woman who is cool, calm and collected, sounds like a woman who is ready to do whatever it took to glorify the Son of God regardless of those around her. We tend to be cautious of those around us when we worship, we may even be tempted to stop someone who is pouring him or herself to the Lord because we are uncomfortable with the way they worship. Everyone wanted to stop this woman from what she is doing, however Jesus did not kick her away or ordered for her to be taken away because He loved the worship. She gave all she had and then some when no one else could. What more does John tell us to impact us, <strong> "...And the house was filled with fragrance of the oil</strong>", <strong>John 12:3</strong>. Her act changed the atmosphere of the house, her worship drew everyone's attention to herself but to Jesus because I believe many saw how they had walked with Jesus they never worshipped the way He should be worshipped.

What does this very simple woman have to teach us about worship? <strong>Brokenness leads you to give all.</strong> Anyone around you shouldn't define how you worship. Only Jesus deserves worship. What you give could be a fragrance that would fill the room affecting everyone and impacting everyone. To continue. Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 5:21-43, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”</strong>

In school, sentence punctuation was huge. A sentence can have same wordings, how you punctuate it can change its meaning. I have been misunderstood through emails by the way I punctuated my sentences to an extent that what I meant was not how it was received. With this in mind, God has given us His word, how we punctuate His word will make it sound how we want it to or we choose to stick with what the Author intended for it to be punctuated. Do not put a question mark where God puts a period, and do not put a period where God puts a comma. If there is a period, it is a done deal we can move on to the next thing. If He puts a comma, there is a short pause for there is more to come.

<!--more-->

Jesus was doing good as always. He came to seek and to save the lost, on the other hand, He was teaching, providing for His followers and healing those who were sick. On one particular day, He had just healed a demon possessed man and before long there came a man to Him a ruler of synagogue by the name of Jairus. He was a Jew, and if you read different passages, Jesus being a Jew was rejected by His own people for the bible says, "<strong>He came to His own but His own received Him not"</strong>. Another passage says, <strong>"a prophet is not honored and welcomed in His own town", </strong>referring to His people the Jews. What really prompted this man, a ruler to come to Jesus against all odds? We will find out. <strong>Mark 5:22-23, "... And when He saw Him, he fell at His feet and begged Him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay hands on her, that she may be healed</strong>". We see he had a serious emergency, a life at stake, almost lost. Why not ran the girl first to seek treatment elsewhere? Did he not forget that his people always had a problem with Jesus? what would people say if he went to Him? when you are in need, no matter what people think or how you have always been perceived by other people, you will lay a side your pride and ego and look for help. When you know your help can be through a church, what people think will not stop you from getting help there.

When the Master received the message, He started a journey to meet this girl because this man had faith in Jesus to heal his daughter. Now Jesus had a great multitude after Him, even with that He left to rescue. <strong>Mark 5:24, "So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him". It was like Jairus had called 911 and help was on the way.</strong>

The first 4 verses talks about Jesus encountering with Jairus, everything seemed to be going as planned, Jairus must have been excited because the Lord was willing to come, however in vs. 25, the story takes a different turn and begins to focus on someone else referred to as the woman with the issue of blood. She had heard about Jesus, she knew her condition, she was not worthy to be around anyone for she was considered unclean. She had been in her condition for 12 years, she had spent much on worthless physicians and here she hears about the greatest healer and she believed she could be healed too. She reaches out and touches the hem of His garments as she had faith that just touching His attire was enough to get her healed. At that point Jesus stops to find out who touched Him. What do you think must have gone through Jairus mind? what do you think his reaction towards the woman who had stopped Jesus from reaching his daughter in bed dying? What would your reaction be if you called 911 and as the paramedics were coming to your rescue, they stopped somewhere else to help someone? <strong>This is an interruption that causes delay that opens doors to frustrations that test your faith as you learn patience and trust. </strong>Hope this sentence makes sense to you as it does to me. Think about this situation and connect it with yours as I continue in part 2. Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 5:21-43, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”</strong>

The first 4 verses from vs. 21 concentrated on the man with a sick daughter, the next 10 verses takes a turn to concentrate on this woman with the issue of blood. In reading the story, we can conclude that it wasn’t a quick stop, in vs. 35, <strong>"While He was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue's house who said, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?” </strong>This is not news this father wanted to hear despite knowing how close his daughter was to dying. Who is to blame for the death of the little girl? Some would blame the woman with the issue of blood, she delayed Jesus from reaching the sick girl. Some would blame Jesus, they would argue that He should have set His priorities straight. The bible says in<strong> Isaiah 55:8, "for My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, " says the Lord". To you He may have delayed, to Him, He is always on time.</strong>

<!--more-->

How we perceive and look at things may not be the same way God looks at them. Instead of praying, "<strong>Lord see it the way I see it</strong>", we ought to pray, "<strong>Lord let me see it Your way</strong>"<strong>. </strong>Stick with the Master through it all. This man had hopes when the situation was still bearable until he learnt that his child was no more. People also discouraged him from bothering the Teacher because it was too late according to them. <strong>What we call over and finished may not be what God calls it</strong>. Here are people who had changed God's word by putting a period where the Lord was putting a coma. You may have thoughts that He has limited abilities based on what you have heard, you might think this is beyond His league.

Could it be possible that Jesus decided to delay because He wanted to perform a greater miracle beyond just healing? <strong>The bigger the miracle, the greater faith. </strong>The bible says, <strong>"whatever is impossible with man, is possible with God</strong>". Can we say He forgot? A person who is all knowing can never forget. Can we get to that level where we see God as He is and not as we perceive Him to be? Jairus might have only seen Jesus as a healer (where he placed a period) and so were the people who came from his house, however the bible says in <strong>John 14:6, "Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life”</strong>. In <strong>John 1:4, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men</strong>". I look at life as the ultimate thing that no man can create. God has allowed man to do wonderful things, to create life (and salvation) or restore life from the dead is His job. If Jesus has power to give life, shouldn't that be an indication to us all that there is nothing impossible with Him? Someone is frustrated because they called on God when their situation was still bearable but nothing happened. Please understand that God is still able, more than able for His ways and His thoughts are not our ways and thoughts. If you have something you trusted Him with but died before He reached them, Remember, <strong>it's not over until He says so</strong>.

To someone it may be over, to God it is just a beginning of greater things. Jesus therefore said, <strong>Mark 5:36, "...Do not be afraid; only believe</strong>". Jesus took Jairus back to the faith he had when he first approached Him. <strong>It is faith that activates the power to do the impossible</strong>. God will do His part but you and I have to do our part, have faith. No need to be frustrated with someone else because they received their blessings before you even though you asked of Jesus first. No need to be frustrated with Jesus because He did not come when you called on Him, the bible says, "<strong>He has made all things beautiful in His time</strong>". Beautiful things are not disappointing things but joy giving things. Just be glad He has not said it is over and left. Don’t put a period where Jesus put’s a comma. To finish!! Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 5:21-43, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”</strong>

If the Lord had not been on my side, I would have been consumed. His presence always assures me that everything will be fine even if I don't see it. I don't have to understand it, all I have to do is only believe, All things are possible with God. My faith is not so much grounded on “He will”, may faith is grounded on “He can”. It does no matter whether He did not appear when I really needed Him, all that matters is that He is here now and nothing is too difficult for Him. Instead of accusing Him for not coming in time, we should say, "<i>Lord we are glad You are here"</i>.

<strong>Mark 5:38, "Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who wept loudly". </strong>Do not act like you don’t have no problem. Admit that you have a problem but confess that there is a way<!--more--> out. I believe that wherever there is an entrance, there will be an outlet, all we need to do is find it. <strong>Admitting is recognizing there is a will to change</strong>. Now Jesus did not come to have a funeral service, He came to do the impossible. <strong>Mark 5:39, "When He came in, He said to them, Why make this commotion and weep? the child is not dead, but sleeping". </strong> Was Jesus naïve to really see that this child was dead? If Jesus is life, this was no match to Him, He compares it to sleeping. The mourners were looking at the natural, they were not seeing that the One who conquered death and had power over the situation. It was as if to say to them, "I <i>wish you would see what I see, you see it as dead, I'm seeing it as an opportunity to perform a miracle".</i> May the Lord give us the eyes (faith in God) to see things as He sees them.

The problem today is that we hang out with people who don't believe and they speak discouragements in us saying, "<i>there is no way it will happen</i>", sooner or later we believe a lie. Jesus had the same people surround Him and He knew them. He closed out everyone who made fun of the miracle to be done and only brought to the inner circles those who had faith to believe. <strong>Mark 5:40, "And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with Him, and entered where the child was lying". </strong>Surround yourself with people who will boost your faith over your need. Share with them what your need is, let them assist you pray over it by faith.

<strong>Mark 5:41, "Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, "Talitha cumi," which is translated, "Little girl, I say to you, arise". </strong>Two wonderful things I picked from this line, Jesus not only wants to do something in our lives, He wants to touch us too. His touch brings warmth and assurance. Go to the hospitals, you will see that most patients just need someone to either hold their hands or just hold them. The second thing from this line, He did not speak about the girl, but He spoke to the girl. I don't know who can speak to a dead thing and it hears him, only Jesus can. However dead the situation is, if He speaks, the dead thing will hear His voice. We speak to people and animals that can hear us and they do what we say sometimes, Jesus speaks to that which does not exist or if it exists, no matter if it's alive or dead and has ears or no ears they will still hear His voice. He is so awesome. I will not even share the outcome of the story, there is nothing impossible with Him.

What I'm I saying as I conclude, It's not over until God says so. He is the God who keeps time, strive to see things the way He sees them, and know that there is nothing impossible with Him. Blessings Evans

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Daniel 1:6-7, “6 Among these were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 7 The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego”</strong>

William Shakespeare wrote, “A rose by any other name is still a rose.” When it’s all said and done weather it’s a Hybrid Tea, a Grandiflora, a Floribunda, a Landscape rose, a Climbing rose, a Miniature rose, a Standard Tree Rose, a Patio Tree Roses, a Miniature Tree Rose, or an English rose, “A rose by any other name is still a rose.” Shakespeare’s words ring true in light of trying to change a name, does not equate to an identity change. <!--more-->When Daniel and his friends were exiled into the ungodly land of Babylon the Prince of the eunuchs whom God would bring Daniel into favor with tried to really make the young Hebrew men adjust to their new pagan surroundings. The Hebrews had to adapt and learn a different language, a different culture, different literature (stories/heroes), a different dress (clothing / outerwear), and now they were even being given different names. Weather knowingly or unknowingly I believe this was an attempt to tamper with the very nature and identity of these young men. After all as the old saying goes, “when in Rome do as the Romans do.” Well it seems this is precisely what those overseeing the Hebrews were trying to do; when in Babylon, do as the Babylonians do.” These Hebrews came in with Hebrew names, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, but The chief official gave them new names….” It seems apparent that this name change was not one whereby the Hebrew men were consulted. Consider the Hebrew name they had and what it meant as opposed to the Babylonian name that was pronounced upon them, and the meaning it held.

Daniel means “<strong>God is my judge</strong>” and his name was changed to Belteshazzar, which means may Bel (an Assyrian god) protect him. Hananiah translates to “<strong>Yahweh has shown grace</strong>,” or “Whom Jehovah hath favor,” yet his Babylonian name change was Shadrach, “a Sumerian or Elimite moon-god”. Mishael is interpreted as “<strong>Who is what God is</strong>,” and he was given the name Meshach, which “ironically” stands for “Who is what Aku (a pagan god) is”. Lastly Azariah is equivalent to “Yahweh has helped, yet his alias became Abednego “servant of Nego (a pagan god)”. These men were Yahweh followers to the core, even though their names were altered. The Babylonians may have changed everything outside about them, but nothing on the inside could be tainted. Remember the key verse from <strong>Daniel 1:8,</strong> <strong>“But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself…</strong>,”was the desire within not to be defiled and that desire was lived out the entire time they were on ungodly terrain. <strong>Romans 12:2</strong> tells us, “<strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”</strong>

Babylon (a type of the world) will try and change you and make you one of its disciples, conformed to its ungodly image. No matter what this world calls you, and how it identifies you, remember your name, Christian, follower of Christ. That name doesn’t hold much weight with the world, but that’s fine, because who are you trying to please anyway. These young men had the help and favor of God who their judge. They served the matchless, unchanging God whose name is Yahweh, Jehovah, the Ancient of Days. Know who you are in Christ, a saint, NOT a sinner; a holy child of God, not an unholy worthless life. Many Christians don’t recognize their name, their nature, their identity in Christ, and that works against them. Today know who you are in Christ.

<strong>Application: No matter what the world calls you, remember that God calls you His child. Now live unashamedly for Christ that purchased you by His own blood. By Pastor Phil</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 6:17, “And Elisha prayed, "O LORD, open his eyes so he may see.” Then the LORD opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha”</strong>

Remember driving down the road on a hot day and seeing the illusion of water on the road created by the heat? Many times our eyes are not actually the reality of truth and if we can be fooled physically, how much more can we be fooled in our spiritual eyesight? Read <strong>2Kings 6:8-18</strong> for the full picture.<!--more-->

<strong>The first component to having eyesight like Elisha is to have a reputation of having godly insight. (see v. 11-12) </strong>Elisha had a reputation of godly insight among both the godly (King of Israel) &amp; the ungodly (the servant of the Aramean king). How did Elisha gain this reputation? It wasn’t through bragging about his spirituality but through spending time with God as prophets had to do if they were to prophesy God’s word. The only way to obtain a reputation of having godly insight is by spending time with God. Look at how our thoughts (mindset) lead to our destinies: “<strong><em>Whoever sows a thought, reaps an action; Whoever sows an action; reaps a habit;, Whoever sows a habit; reaps a lifestyle; Whoever sows a lifestyle; reaps a destiny</em></strong><em>.</em>” If the prophet was not 100% accurate he would be stoned to death as a false prophet. We cannot cease spending time with God and expect to have a true godly &amp; spiritual reputation.

<strong>The second component to having eyesight like Elisha is to not to have fear and unbelief, but trust and have faith in the Lord (see v. 14-16)</strong> The Armean king sent an army to capture Elisha by a surprise NIGHT ATTACK! However, Elisha received revelation from God about the attack. You see the eyesight of the ungodly is warped, because they can never see as God sees and what He shows to His servants. Elisha’s servant was nervous as he saw the city surrounded by army of horses and chariots, and therefore asked, “<strong>What shall we do?”</strong> The situation did not look promising and the young disciple I can imagine had “I’m gonna die” in his head. Elisha’s responded by saying “<strong>Do not fear…,”</strong> because Elisha could see the fear pent up inside his disciple. Elisha was saying you’re not to respond to the great army outside in fear.

<strong>1Timothy 1:7 “For God hath not given us a spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.”, </strong>KJV. Fear is cousins with unbelief, it is the manifestation of unbelief. Many times because WE magnify our situation or problem that it looks bigger than God. Yes the army (problem) was big but the angelic host (God) was bigger!

<strong>The third component to having eyesight like Elisha is seek the Lord in prayer to gain God’s perspective (v. 16). </strong>Elisha saw God’s revelation, but his young disciple didn’t see it. Elisha interceded that his disciple might see. His prayer was short, specific, and in faith. Elisha saw the angelic host of horses and chariots of fire that his disciple didn’t see, yet it was certainly there! Through prayer, the young disciple gained Elisha’s perspective on things and turned to God’s perspective. The Lord opened his eyes, and he saw the angelic army surrounding them. He saw what Elisha had said, …<strong>those that are who are with us are more than those who are with them</strong>.” As the Scripture says, “<strong>If God is for us who can be against us,” therefore “walk by faith and not by sight.” </strong>

<strong>Application:</strong>

Maybe you realize you don’t have a reputation of spiritual insight because you’ve not been spending time in God’s presence. Or perhaps you have been spending time with the Lord, but fear and unbelief have been shrouding your vision and you desire to trust and have faith in the Lord’s provision and protection to gain God’s perspective. Spend time with the Lord as He is the truth, a refuge, and a mighty warrior. By Pastor Phil

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1Corinthians 16:13-14, “13 Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. 14 Let all that you do be done in love” </strong></p><p>Society is ever so confused about the identity and the role of men in this day and age. At one time it would seem, they were to only provide for the family, and be strong and rugged individuals. Women were to be at home and submissive to their husbands. Now society seems to want to reverse the roles and identities of the two genders, and desires men to be more feminine, and women to be more masculine with the ungodly women’s liberation movement. In order to look at this issue through the lens of truth, one cannot look through the ever changing winds of this confused society, but rather to the unchanging truth of God’s Word. With that said look at the final instructions Paul wrote to the Corinthian church in his first letter to them.<!--more--></p><p>When looking at the Church in Corinth, “Even by the pagan standards of its own culture, Corinth became so morally corrupt that its very name became synonymous with debauchery and moral depravity. To “Corinthianize” came to represent gross immorality and drunken debauchery.” In Corinth there were men involved with incest (5:1), and the moral depravity was rancid. Paul gives five commands to the Church which includes: be alert (watchful), firm, mature, strong, and loving.</p><p><strong>Be watchful</strong>: Why would Paul instruct them to be watchful and furthermore, watchful of what? Paul used the word <em>gregoreo</em>, which means to stay awake, to be in continuous readiness and alertness to learn—‘to be alert, to be watchful, to be vigilant. If you recall the watchmen on the wall in Ezekiel, the watchmen were supposed to exemplify the tenants of the previous definition and warn the people of an enemy attack so they could be prepared for battle and thus save their lives. However, if the watchman was asleep or failed to do his duty, God would hold the watchman accountable for the blood of His people. How do men stay alert, by staying in prayer and in the Word of God. The Psalmist gives instruction to young men in <strong>Psalm 119:9-11, “9 How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word. 10 With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments! 11 I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.”</strong></p><p>Men cannot be confused on their responsibilities. Men will spend hours watching sports games on television, at the stadiums for these events, but where are the men of God that will say like Paul I count all things as loss as compared to the treasure of Christ. Do you watch so you can keep your life pure? Do you look to God’s Word for strength and direction on how to stay alert? Do you memorize Scripture and quote the Word of God when you are tempted with lust, pride, and envy just as Jesus did (<strong>Luke 4, Matthew 4</strong>)? An average movie is about 2 hours long, and in that amount of time one can read the entire book of John. Yet men make excuse after excuse as to not having time to read their Bibles. Men make time for that which is important to them. Be watchful! Be like Job who said, <strong>“ I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food," (Job 23:12).” </strong>Put your Bible before your belly or to say in the vernacular no read no feed!</p><p><strong>Stand firm in the faith:</strong> Continuous holding ground, or hold ground and keep holding ground. Paul again writes from jail, “<strong>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil” Ephesians 6:11.</strong> Men in war must stand their post, fight the battle, and stand against the enemy. Sir, do you stand firm in the faith of Christ? Men get into God’s Word daily, consistently and obey what you read.</p><p><strong>Act like men</strong>: (Gk. <em>andrizomai</em>) is a frequent command in the Septuagint and is used in contexts encouraging people (esp. soldiers) to act with courage and strength in obedience to the Lord and with confidence in His power (<strong>see Deuteronomy 31:6–7, 23; Joshua 1:6–7, 9; 10:25; 1 Chronicles 28:20; Psalm 27:14)</strong>. One might say, MAN UP! Men often choose movies where the man risks his life for a cause greater than himself. Men, risk your life, living dangerously for Christ counting your life as worth nothing compared to living for Him. Paul penned these words from JAIL, “<strong><em>Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord</em></strong> (Philippians 3:8). Sir I ask you, is your heart set more on who is going to win the a national sports events or that you exemplify Christ in your life. You must treasure Christ above all things in your life. If someone were to ask you what the greatest treasure in your life is, would your answer be “CHRIST”? Would those closest to you say that of you?</p><p><strong>Let all you do be done in love</strong>: Love is HARD WORK! The American concept of love is totally backwards, and has more to do with emotions alone than true biblical love. Look at what Jesus said in <strong>John 15:13, “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends” (KJV).</strong> Men would you lay your life down for your wife, your children, your Lord? Become more like Christ by digging in to the Word of God. Read and study God’s Word, and apply it to your life. If you are too busy to spend time with God then He is not your Lord and if so read <strong>Matthew 7:21 – 23</strong>. Love the Lord, love your family, love the lost (your enemies) that they might come to Christ. Preach the Gospel and never be ashamed of it (<strong>Romans 1:16),</strong> stand on it, and stand your ground. I ask, if not now, when and if not here, where? <strong>Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. Let all that you do be done in love</strong>.</p><p>Until the nets are filled…Phil, “The Evangelist”</p><h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size:1em;">Related articles</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul"><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/daniel-name-change-not-nature-change-pastor-phil-sessa/" target="_blank">Daniel: Name Change Not Nature Change, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>2Samuel 10:11-12, “11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: may the Lord do what seems good to Him (KJV and ESV combined)”</strong></p><p>When you look at most men on TV sitcoms, the men are portrayed as a bumbling fool, unfit household leader, the brunt of the family jokes, the one most highly dishonored, one that has no influence over his children, and subservient to his wife. Then the guys in the movies are hard, indestructible, and the one that gets a different girl with every sequel of the movie.<!--more--> Hollywood is definitely confused about men and is certainly influential over our society. Ray Comfort shares in What Hollywood Believes, “<em>It is a sad irony that when legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMiller (director of the epc movie the Ten Commandments) first came to California in the early 1900s, he settled in a small town that was giving away free land to anyone willing to build a place of worship. The town, said to be a ‘Christian’ settlement, had a picturesque name – Hollywood. Yet through the years the famous town has come to bear little resemblance to middle America”</em> Just as Hollywood has come far from their Christian heritage, men today that profess to be Christian seem so far from what a biblical man should be. Right off the bat, let me state, that I am not saying one needs to be Christ (the perfect man) that is impossible, nor is the expectation to be Paul, John, Luke, etc…you and I are not them, but our identity should be in Christ.</p><p><strong>Men of trustworthiness – </strong>Although this point deals with a previous verse from the text at hand, it is necessary to bring this into this message because it set the tenor for why Joab was sent to battle. The writer of Proverbs states, “<strong>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble Is like a bad tooth and a foot out of joint (Proverbs 25:19).”</strong> I get frustrated by the lack of faithful men that profess to be Christians. I have found that so many are unreliable when you need them, many don’t stick to their word when they give it. Men that are simply to show up for prayer, evangelism, church service, discipleship, work, etc… when push comes to shove they are not faithful. At one time in American history there was a saying that a man’s word was his bond, how much more should our “yes be yes” and our “no be no?” Men, keep your word, with your family, with your church, with your friends, do what you said you were going to do. When you say you are going to show up, then show up, be there when you say. Look how many women have stepped up in leadership because the men have not been faithful, they have allowed this growing trend. David was able to look to Joab and “<strong>he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men (2Samuel 10:7).</strong> Can your pastor look to you and trust you will step up to serve? Can another mature believer look to you to follow through, to use your area of influence, to use your gifts/abilities to serve when called upon, or perhaps you would even go so far as to volunteer?</p><p>I have heard it said there are five stages in manhood which are: male-hood, boyhood, manhood, fatherhood, and husband-hood. The Apostle John focused on this reality of spiritual maturity when he writes <strong>1John 2:12-15.</strong> He is not actually writing to children, young men, and fathers in the physical sense, but in the spiritual maturity sense. He writes the following: “<strong>12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father. 14 I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one”. </strong></p><p>Many men are still boys (little children) spiritually. Jesus called us to have faith like a child, but not the maturity of a child. Paul gave the Corinthian church a tongue lashing for still being spiritual babies. He wrote, “1 <strong>But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. 2 I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, 3 for you are still of the flesh (1 Colossians 3:1–3).”</strong> There comes a time to GROW UP! Now I recognize in all fairness that people grow at different rates spiritually, similar to physical growth. Some have growth spurts, others have slow steady growth, but all Christians, if they are Christians WILL GROW, and this is inevitable. If a Christian never grows, you can bet that they are not abiding in the vine (<strong>John 15:7</strong>). In moving from boyhood to manhood, I heard it said that taking responsibility is what separates the men from the boys. In our secular culture the man is the one that “gets the most girls,” but God is looking for men that are faithful to Him, their wives, their families, and their churches. <strong>Job</strong> is described in the following manner, “<strong>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil</strong> (1:1).” Do you think he was faithful?, you bet, just read the book and how he was faithful even when his wife told him to curse God and die. I will touch specifically on Job at a later time, as he was truly a man God used.</p><p>You have to begin to be faithful in the little things, so you can be entrusted with more. Glorify God in the little things, and He will allow you to glorify Him with more. The man given one talent was UNFAITHFUL and even what he had was stripped from him and given to another, another that had been faithful with their talents. God has commanded you to daily pray, but do you?; He has commanded you to daily read the Word, but do you?; to share the Gospel, but are you?; to serve, but are you a servant? There are those that want to preach, but has He called you to lead in that capacity? A young Bible college student wanted to preach to crowds on the spectrum of a Billy Graham. I invited him to come to NYC and evangelize on the streets with me and said, let’s see how you do sharing the Gospel with one person first. The guy never even showed up. Whenever I disciple people, I see if they are faithful with the little things, and if not it saves me a lot of time knowing that I will not invest greatly in lives that are not willing to at least be faithful in the little things. If someone shares that they want to learn the Bible, I give a verse to memorize. If they are faithful we move on, if they are unfaithful it displays that their heart doesn’t have the desire that the mouth professes and it is simply lip service. We have too many professing men that are just lip service men. Recall what Jesus said in <strong>Matthew 15:7,8</strong>, <strong>“7 You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: 8“ ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; 9 in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men</strong>.’ ”</p><p>Why did these give lip service, because that is truly what they believed! What you truly believe will come out when the heat is on. Recall the 3 Hebrew boys in <strong>Daniel 3</strong>, that refused to bow, and not knowing the outcome of their commitment. They obeyed God and left all the consequences to him. I preached to a man that threatened to cut me while holding a blade in his hand. Yet I shoved the sword of the spirit into his heart and he walked away convicted having put his blade away. He was cut to the heart by the Word of God.</p><p>Look into God’s Word and read about faithful men, and then examine if you are faithful. Ask those closest to you (wife, children, boss, co-worker), to be Judgment honest with you, and ask if they believe you to be faithful. Ask a faithful, mature Christian to examine your faithfulness. Do you show up at work on time, and then leave when the day is over? Do you cut corners, or do what expected of you, dare I see above and beyond what is expected of you? Do you raise your kids, or are they raising you? Are you the pastor of your home, or is have you shirked your responsibility and allowed your wife the pastor of your home?</p><p>Where are the “Joabs” to call upon now? Men be faithful, be trustworthy, and if need be, grow up. To be continued…</p><p>Until the nets are filled….Blessing Phil, The Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Samuel 10:11-12, “11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: may the Lord do what seems good to him” (KJV and ESV combined).</strong>

When David heard of the ensuing battle this he sent Joab and all the mighty men against the Ammonites. John Piper shares, “<em>As it developed, the Ammonites were arrayed at the walled city to protect it, the Syrians were gathered in the open field, and Joab, with the Israelites, were sandwiched in the middle. So Joab took charge of one group of men and set himself against the Syrians, and the rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai, his brother, and set them against the Ammonites. In verses 11 and 12 Joab gives this great word of challenge and faith to Abishai…If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you. Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people and for the cities of our God, and may the Lord do what seems good to Him”<!--more--></em>

<strong>Brother’s Keeper: </strong>I wrote a message years ago, and one which Evans had shared called <em>Brother’s Keeper or Brother’s Killer </em>concerning the question that Cain posed to the Lord (after he killed his brother Abel) when he asked<strong>, “Am I my brother’s keeper". </strong>The answer to that question should have been answered by Cain himself, and the answer should have been a resounding, yes. However the question was asked as a harsh challenge and I imagine in a sarcastic tone. Men cannot live as islands unto themselves. The writer of Proverbs wrote<strong>, “as iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another man (27:17).” As the proper tool shapes and sharpens iron for its desired use, so a man benefit intellectually and theological through being sharpened by a keener mind and encourages improvement of good character which the face will reveal by their personal friendship. Men need to live the Christian life, and need the kind of conversion mentioned. </strong>Furthermore, men need other men in battle; they do need to be one another’s keeper. Joab was there to help his brother in battle. Israel was in the middle between two armies that desired to destroy them<strong>. </strong>Abishai was sent against the Ammonites; Joab went against the Syrians. Piper shares again saying <em>“It is wise battle strategy, when the enemy is widespread and diverse, that we not engage all the troops in one place. It is also wise to have everyone doing most of the time what they are best at.”</em>

Men you have perspective, gifts, and talents, etc…, that you add to the battle against the enemy. You need to humbly ask another brother at times to battle alongside you. The enemy has sent attacks on men, and men must band together to fight. It takes humility to ask for another’s help. Many will perhaps pray and ask God for help, but often His body (the church) is the help that He supplies by His good hand. Men fight together, and are to hold one another accountable by and to the Word of God. Men seem to be ferocious in sports (which is temporal), and timid about the things of God (which is eternal). Men can scream at a sports event and this is seen as commendable, but when men get serious about the Lord, then they are deemed a fanatic. Why oh man do you allow the world to set the rules to govern your life? We are far too influenced by our culture and it’s dictates. Yet John write, “1<strong>5 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. 17 And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever”, 1John 2:15-17.</strong> The three temptations listed are the same three that the first man (Adam, <strong>Genesis 3</strong>) disobeyed God concerning, and these same three were the three that the second Adam (Christ, <strong>Matthew 4, Luke 4</strong>) would not fall victim. The temptations never changed, neither did the Word of God, but only one of them held to the Word of God and defeated the enemy.

<strong>Let US play the men</strong>. The ESV states “<strong>let us be courageous for our people</strong>”. I love the term “US”. There are many that try to be what Tony Miano calls Nomad Christians. These men try to live the Christian life alone; they try to be lone ranger pastors, or nomad evangelists. However, even the Lone Ranger had a sidekick. No Christian is an island, even Christ (not that He had a need) traveled with His disciples. There are so many verses that deal with such terms as “us”, “one another”, etc… how can one possibly be a man of God alone? One cannot obey the Bible apart from the one another verses. The writer of Hebrews commands, <strong>Hebrews 10:24-25</strong> “<strong>24 And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.”</strong> Many Christians assemble (similar to all the pieces in a puzzle box) but they never assemble (putting each piece in its strategically designed location). Men are to play the man at home by taking the lead role as the Bible commands, and loving their wives as Christ loved the church (<strong>Ephesians 5</strong>). Men must train, nurture and discipline their children (<strong>Proverbs 22:6</strong>). As shared previously, as men of God we need to biblically man up!

Examine yourself; ask others to examine you, especially those close to you like your wife. Then make the necessary changes all for His glory!

To be continued…

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>2Samuel 10:11-12, “11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: may the Lord do what seems good to him (KJV and ESV combined)).</strong></p><p><strong>Rest in God’s Sovereign Hand</strong>: “May the Lord so that which seems Him good, was the cry of Joab.” This is a bold statement, but one that He found rest in also. The battles ultimately rested on the shoulders of the Lord, and not on the shoulders of Joab and Abishai. I imagine they fought as if the battle depended upon them, but knowing that <em>the outcome was not really in their ultimate control</em>. Joab urged the army to “be strong” and recognized that the outcome of the battle depended ultimately upon the Lord (cf. 15:26) (John MacArthur).<!--more--> If we believe it, we will proclaim it, and it would seem that the opposite is true as well (<strong>Romans 10:9,10</strong>)! Joab, I imagine was a leader who exemplified faith, and I further imagine that his faith inspired others to have faith (not in him, but in the One who he placed his faith in. As men are we ok with that or must we control every situation? Can we rest assure as has often been said by Charles Stanley, “<em>Obey God and leave ALL the consequences to Him</em>!” Can you surrender to God’s sovereign hand?</p><p>Recall Ezekiel when the Lord asked him, “<strong>And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord God, you know</strong>.” God asks the question, and Ezekiel states, that God knows the answer to the question. He trusted in the Lord’s answer, because God ultimately knew the answer.</p><p>Remember Job, who stood in the midst of pain and opposition and yet spoke the words to his “friends” when he said, “<strong>Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him</strong>(13:14)” Job assured his accusers that his convictions were not self-serving, because he was ready to die trusting God. But still he would defend his innocence before God, and was confident that he was truly saved and not a hypocrite (v. 16). Despite all that he lost, despite all that he experienced personally, and the fact that his so – called friends pounded their advice on him, he rejected their advice, and being in the midst of his situation, made such a resounded trust statement that spewed from the depths of a desperate heart that trusted the Lord.</p><p>By life's end, a 19th century pastor named George Mueller had built five large orphan houses and cared for 10,024 orphans. The entire time, he depended on God's response to his prayer of faith to supply the needs of the orphans in his care. He believed that a man that is happy (satisfied) in the Lord is a man that can trust in the Lord that he finds his happiness in. For more on him go to <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/biographies/george-muellers-strategy-for-showing-god">http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/biographies/george-muellers-strategy-for-showing-god</a></p><p>Men are often fixers, we like to fix situations, rather than rest in what God can do when we fight especially on the battle field of prayer. Men simply must fix their eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Look at <strong>Ephesians 6</strong> which speaks of the armor of God. Remember Paul wrote that letter from prison and described the armor as he looked upon a Roman soldier and the way they were dressed for battle, in times of peace or war. However, unlike a Roman soldier, many of us will never see live physical military combat, but if you are a man of God you will fight many battles on your knees in prayer. You will fight many battles in your mind when tempted by pride, lust, greed, rebellion against God, anger, rage, etc, as you become conformed more and more into the image and character of Jesus Christ (<strong>Philippians 2:5; 4:8, Romans 8:29).</strong></p><p>How much does Scripture implore us to trust the Lord? I am glad that you asked. I trust in God (Psalm 25:2; Psalm 31:6; Psalm 31:14; Psalm 55:23; Acts 27:25); in God I put my trust (Psalm 56:4; Psalm 56:11); my God, in whom I trust (Psalm 91:2); my eyes are toward you (Psalm 141:8); I have trusted in the Lord (Psalm 26:1); you are my trust from my youth (Psalm 71:5); I trust in the loving-kindness of God for ever (Psalm 52:8); I trust in you (Psalm 143:8); I trust in your loving-kindness (Psalm 13:5); my heart trusts in him (Psalm 28:7); we trust in the Lord (2Kings. 18:22); we trust in his holy name (Psalm 33:21); we are relying on the Lord (Isaiah 36:7); we rely on you (2 Chronicles. 14:11); so that we might trust in God (2Corinthians 1:9); to you I lift up my soul (Psalm 25:1); save your servant who trusts in you (Psalm 86:2); I will trust and not be afraid (Isaiah 12:2); I know whom I have believed (2 Tim. 1:12); God, our eyes are on you (2 Chronicles. 20:12); I will put my trust in him (Hebrews 2:13); we know and believe the love God has for us (1John 4:16); though he slay me I will trust him (Job 13:15); though war arise, yet will I be confident (Psalm 27:3); I believed, even when afflicted (Psalm 116:10); when I am afraid I will put my trust in you (Psalm 56:3). Look to Scripture, and trust in God’s Word doing what it says to increase your faith in Him by His Word.</p><p>Where is the Joab of today? Men will you say like Joab, “<strong>Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: may the Lord do what seems good to him”</strong></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Much of this series on biblical manhood applying <strong>2Samuel 10:11</strong> was gleaned from John Piper’s message titled, <em>Six Lessons from Joab and Abishai Partnership¸ </em>which can be found at <a href="http://www.desiringgod.com">www.desiringgod.com</a>.</p><p>Blessings, Until the nets are filled…Phil, The Evangelist</p><h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size:1em;">Related articles</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul"><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/biblical-manhood-part-3of4-pastor-phil-sessa/" target="_blank">Biblical Manhood, Part 3of4, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/biblical-manhood-part-1of4-pastor-phil-sessa/" target="_blank">Biblical Manhood, Part 1of4, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/biblical-manhood-part-2of4-pastor-phil-sessa/" target="_blank">Biblical Manhood, Part 2of4, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 17:1-58, "Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself give smooth stones from the brook..."</strong>

We often run into people with hidden potentials yet to be discovered. In the entertainment industry, people continue to be discovered because of their talents. I have come across stories of people sharing their humble beginnings. Often times you hear about a struggle involving rejections, written off, words spoken that they were not good enough but later they broke through.<!--more-->

Everyone desires a chance to show what they have within, their talents, abilities, skills, performance, products. A chance to be a boss, husband, wife, teacher, worker etc. People will always cry, "give me a chance to show what I can do". Don't we see this in the work force? people see new positions they may not have all the qualifications needed for but they believe in themselves that given a chance, they can do it. <strong>A belief that you can offer something and make a difference can push you to desire a chance</strong>. Our chance as believers is not to show off, but make God look big in the eyes of men. He is already big let's not forget that, this is for the people in the world, we need to show them how Big Our God is.<strong> 2Chronicles 16:9, "For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself so strong on behalf of those whose hearts are loyal to Him". </strong>He has given us a chance to show Him so strong.

<strong>There is a big difference between knowing what to do...and doing what you know</strong>. Most people know what to do but they cannot propel and believe in God in them to do what they could not do themselves. They have potentials hidden. David and Goliath is a story that reveals some things that are vital in our lives. We know David's position, he was a shepherd boy who took care of sheep and smelled like one. Though young, he was good at what he did, faithful in his job. An opportunity arose when his father sent him to the battlefield to bring food to his brothers. We see his obedience in obeying his father by doing what he asked him. It’s not indicated if he loved to take care of the sheep when his brothers were soldiers in the army, all we know is that he knew his job pretty well. He was faithful and obedient in doing so. You may not like what you do, but can you be still good at it, faithful and obedient while trusting God to elevate you in due time? I believe God sees our attitude in what we do and if we cannot be content first with where we are, we will not be content when we move to.

<strong>1Samuel 17:20, "So David rose in early in the morning... and took the things and went as Jesse (his father) had commanded him". </strong>God was orchestrating David’s ways. He did not know what awaited him. He may have never seen himself beyond being a shepherd boy but his obedient led him to serve his superiors (his brothers) without murmuring or complaining.

When He came to the battle field, he found the battle was a stand still, he left what he brought with the supply keeper, ran to the battle ground to greet his brothers. While there, he hears Goliath sending threats to the Israelites. David had just learnt that no one including the king had the capability of facing this giant. David seeing an opportunity inquired and they rehearsed to him what will happen to any man who can kill Goliath. It's like hearing, a job description and the benefits. The job is to kill Goliath, benefits are great riches, a hand of king's daughter in marriage and exemption from taxes. What an opportunity but who is he? what chance does he have? And who will be the hero in the story? Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 17:1-58, "Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook..."</strong>

The bible is interesting in the sense that it could take time and dwell on something, fully describing it. Here is an example, <strong>1Samuel 17:4, "And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath from Gath, whose height was six cubits and spans" </strong>through vs. 7 the bible describes nothing but how the giant was dressed for battle. The bible wants us to see something about this man. Just reading how equipped he was, I can see why the Israelites were afraid of him. This is no ordinary sizable man. I wondered why the bible wouldn't just say he was a giant and a champion. I believe the Lord wants us to know that our enemy is not a wimp as many may think. He is prepared for you and I at any given moment. Goliath was more qualified, trained, prepared, ready, equipped, eloquent, developed, sophisticated, protected, confident, threatening and a fighter, what chance did David have? All the trained men, who have all that it takes to battle could not face the giant. I even wondered why the bible did not even take time to describe how Saul was dressed for the battle.<!--more--> The Lord would have us know that no matter how big, strong and well prepared the enemy might be, our stand is in <strong>1John 4:4, "ye are of God, little children for you have overcome them: because for greater is He that is in you, that he that is in the world". </strong>You might stand at a place looking at the position God called you too and you see how it is prepared with its requirements. What you see may scare you because you don’t see yourself matching it. If you know who you are in Christ and Christ brings you to see what you did not even ask for, that is a sign that He will qualify you to overcome it. I have seen this work in my life, God brought me to something that I wasn't even qualified, the description showed me how my Goliath was dressed but <strong>"God is not a respecter of persons, He is a respecter of principles</strong>". If God brought you to this point, believe that He will take you to that point, <strong>Philippians 1:6, "Being confident of this very thing, that He which has began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ"</strong>

This is the concept David learnt when the rest could not, and with that in mind he set himself to fight the giant and the first obstacle was his brothers. <strong>1Samuel 17:28, "Now Eliab his older brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was aroused against David.." </strong>Sounds familiar? not everyone is ready for your progress, some may say, "there is no way you can make it", "there is no way you can have that position", "there is no way you can change that department", "you have nothing it takes to make a change, look at us who are more qualified and should do it but we are not because we are unable". To make the matters even worse, the brother accused him of coming to watch the war, accused him of pride. He was reminded of where he belonged, in the wilderness with the sheep. What would you do if you have believed in God to make it then you have someone in the church, in the home, a friend discourage you? they speak death into you saying, "there is no way you can make it?". David would have said, "well you are right, I will pack up my stuff and go home". This was not his attitude, if he went back home, that would mean he couldn't trust God enough. Already he knew that he did not come to the battle ground to watch yet he was accused of it, he then begins to see that God set him up for something he was not aspiring for. He knew he had a chance to show God so strong among His people.

Ask yourself this question, maybe you were not looking to be somewhere but God graciously brought you to that place. You know your limitations, you have things and people trying to discourage you from doing what is right, something that will bring honor to His name. You have a chance to make a difference, you know who is in you, what will you do about it? Is your desire to have a chance? Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 17:1-58, "Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook..."</strong>

Here was a man with one cry, “give me a chance”, <strong>1Samuel 17:32, "Then David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with the Philistine</strong>". David made up his mind to please the Father. Everyone including the king did not feel David was ready for he was young, inexperienced, no training on war, but God readied him for this battle. Him and God were majority.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 38, "So Saul clothed David with his armor...". </strong>You can't fight in someone else armor, <strong>BE YOURSELF, </strong>use what you know works for you because you have tested and proven them. Saul thought that since Goliath was equipped and ready, trying to dress David in his armor would do the same. All David needed was his point of reference (what God had done in his life) and what God was going to do if he remained himself in the Lord. David could not fight with what he had not proven neither can we.

<strong>1Samuel 17:40, "Then he took his staff in his hand; and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook...". </strong>This is the core message. David took his staff, not any ones and went to the brook and picked out five smooth stones. There is a great significance in what he did, the <strong>stones represent good skills to win a battle</strong>. He picked them from a brook. The bible says,<strong> "you shall be like a tree planted by the waters”</strong>, Elijah was brought to a brook, The bible says, "<strong>Jesus is the living water</strong>", "<strong>out of your belly shall flow rivers of life".</strong> This shows that David was picking what he needed from a place that represents going to the Lord. The stones he picked were smooth and polished, well selected. Have you and I picked the smooth stones from the brook of God to overcome? These are talents, abilities, strengths. On your job resume, you talk about your abilities and strengths. The employers tend to look at some of these because they become an advantage to what they are looking for. If you have smooth stones of meeting deadlines, honest, dependable, adaptable and the like, this would add to your qualifications. <strong>You have to pick out your smooth stones to get you anywhere</strong>. What are your smooth stones? David picked his from the brook. Where do you get yours from?

<strong>1Samuel 17:45, "...You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, ...". </strong>Many believe that the stone brought Goliath down. I doubt it, I believe what David spoke to the giant melted his heart when he showed how God was strong on his behalf. All Goliath now saw was not David but God in David and the stone merely finished the job started. Your smooth stone will only finish the job started by involving God in your affairs. Your confession that you are able through God's help will help you begin the work of overcoming. Your abilities and strengths accomplishes what was began. <strong>We pray give us a chance as long as we know we can truly depend on God to see us through</strong>. David might have not had what was required for the battle in the natural sense but in the spiritual sense he did. Our cry, “Give us a chance and we will show Him So strong before men”. Blessings Evans

Thank you for that thought.

I'm blogging my way through The Bible's story in 2013, and I just reached David's confrontation with Goliath. Feel free to visit www.bigstoryguide.wordpress.com]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”.</strong>

Its been said that 80-90% of the people who make a profession of faith fall away, I witnessed this first hand when I evangelized. Some never made it to church and some did for a short time. Do you know of souls you witnessed to, led them through sinner’s prayer but still did not see the fruit of salvation in their lives? Well you might say that at least a seed was planted however there is something seriously wrong somewhere we all need to be concerned about and address. I have rejoiced over the ones who stood, I praise God for them but my heart has been troubled over the ones who did not stand and I had to go before God in prayers to find out why. As I began to attentively study the book of <strong>Romans chapter 1-7, 2Samuel 24</strong> and <strong>Isaiah 6</strong>, it became very clear to me why. God was gracious enough to teach me some things. My eyes have been so much opened that I must share with you what I have learnt in the last few years. I came across some of the preachers in the 19th, 20th, and 21st century whose preaching’s God has used to enlighten me. I pray that you will learn something from this series.<!--more-->

To get us started, it will be beneficial to look at the first line of the scripture <strong>Romans 10:3, “for they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness”. </strong>What causes a person to be ignorant of God’s righteousness? When he does not truly know God. The world has their own perception of who they think God is. They have gone even to the extent of creating their own god to suit themselves. Haven’t you heard something like this, “My god would never do that?” I agree, their god would never do that because he is not the God of heaven as described in the bible. Knowing the God of heaven is knowing His TRUE NATURE which is revealed to us through the ten commandments (law). <strong>He reveals Himself in the spirituality of His law</strong>. <strong>That is where His righteousness and perfect purity of character are revealed for men to learn it there</strong>. To be honest, I don’t see the Ten Commandments as laws imposed on mankind to learn and follow, I believe it’s primary work is to reveal to us who God is. You will agree with me that many who are not saved or soundly saved are ignorant of God’s righteousness and with that, they have created a god to suit themselves, a god they are comfortable with. <strong>Proverbs 16:2, “All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the heart”.</strong> I see this a lot when I talk with the unsaved<strong>. </strong>

Again, men are ignorant of God’s righteousness when they do not understand His method of making sinners righteous. For someone to be made righteous, they must be living in sin. Sin is the opposite of righteousness. So what is sin? <strong>1John 3:4, “Sin is transgression of the law”.</strong> In other words, it’s an offense against religious or moral law. If we have this definition, then we can say that without the law, there can be no sin. If one breaks the law of God, it causes one to be a sinner. What does the law have to do with what we will be sharing on? because men are ignorant of the righteousness of God when they do not know and understand the laws of God which reveals what sin is. The bible says, <strong>Romans 3:20, “By the law is the knowledge of sin</strong>”. Paul says to us in <strong>Romans 7:7, “…I would have not known sin except through the law”</strong>. Paul tells us that he did not know what sin was until the law of God told him. <strong>So the law tells us what sin is because it reveals who God is</strong>. If I was to use SIN as an acronym, <strong>S</strong>avior <strong>I</strong>s <strong>N</strong>eeded. How can a person be truly saved when they do not really know what sin is?

Often times we hear the messages of God’s love and mercy. They are powerful messages we all embrace, without them we have nothing at all. At times we hear God’s justice yet we don’t see God’s justice simply because we have never understood what it is, who it applies to and when it ought to be applied. Some feel that God is love and therefore cannot serve justice, that will make Him unjust. The bible says, <strong>Psalm 89:14</strong>, <strong>“Righteousness and Justice are the foundations of His throne</strong>”. He is the God of faithfulness, without injustice, good and upright He is. Lawlessness would not require justice and there can be no government without the laws governing their country. <strong>The law is the primary reason why we have justice</strong>. If there is no law, what shall justice be based on? To continue, blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>

In the early chapters of the book of Isaiah, we have some things shown to us. I believe Isaiah was a good man according to men’s standards and with that he would have justified himself. Comparing to other people, you can tell that he was reasonably clean however this is a horizontal standard. If anything we all should look at the vertical standard (God’s) of being good. Being good means being perfect and being perfect would mean you have kept the Ten Commandments perfectly from the time you were born till now. Perfection means it has no crack even a little bit. If you were going to buy a vase or a mirror, one little crack shatters it’s perfection and thus if you kept all the commandments and broke even one at any point, then you become guilty of all for, you have shattered it’s perfection and <strong>James 2:10 says “Whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend it at one point is guilty of all”</strong>. <strong>Psalms 19:7, “The law of the Lord is perfect...”</strong> <!--more-->The Author of the law is perfect therefore when we break the law, it’s not against men but God. Many see their sin as done unto men and it doesn’t look that bad in comparison to men, but look at it from God’s point of view and see how serious it is. For instance, if lying (the 9th commandment) to a child may not sound that serious; if I lied to my wife, I’m in trouble; if I lied to my boss, I could lose my job; if I lied to the government, I could go to jail; if I lied to God… It’s who you lie to that determines how big or small the punishment.

What Isaiah saw in Isaiah 6 was not a bunch of laws being imposed on him but God displaying His righteousness before him. <strong>Romans 14:17, “For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost” </strong>Something had to die in Isaiah’s case and all he was left with was to see God in His glory, holiness and righteousness. The light of His righteousness exposed the deep sin that was in his life hence he could not justify himself in God’s presence. <strong>Until people see the righteousness of God, they will never see their sin in its true state because they will be ignorant of it</strong>. The righteousness of God is what plows the hard heart, turning the soil of the heart and softening it for the gospel. What triggers men to see the righteousness of God? <strong>When the law of God is read to them</strong>. When it’s read, it takes away the ignorance men always had and either it accuses or excuses them. Charles Spurgeon, the prince of preachers said, “<em>The law, when it comes into the heart, it shows us how very black we are. Some of us see that we are sinners. It’s very easy to say it. The word “sinner” hath only two syllables in it, and many there be who frequently have it on their lips, but who do not understand it. They see their sin, but it does not appear exceedingly sinful till the law comes. We think there is something sinful in it; but when the law comes, we detect its abomination. Has God’s holy light ever shone into your souls? Have you had the fountains of your great depravity and evil broken up, and been wakened up sufficiently to say, “O God! I have sinned?”, Now, if you have your hearts broken up by the law, you will find the heart is more deceitful than the devil”</em><strong>. </strong>What Spurgeon is saying is that the law has to break the heart that the holy light of God’s righteousness may expose the sin inside. The laws draws the curtains of the holy of holies and all that you thought was not there or you thought you took care of is revealed. To use Ray Comfort’s analogy, You are wiping your coffee table in the morning, the table looks nice and clean. When you draw the curtains for the early sunrise to come in, what will you see in the air, dust; on the table you cleaned, dust. Did the light create the dust? Not really, it merely exposed what you and I could not see with our naked eyes. It’s by the help of the light that we saw that the table needed thorough cleaning and so is with the light of God’s righteousness exposing our sinful state, the hidden stuff. <strong>The law does not create sin, it merely exposes</strong> what we might have not thought was sin, what is hidden deep within and shows the seriousness of breaking the law.

It’s safe to say that a person knows he or she is a sinner and yes he or she might confess that he or she is a sinner but he or she will not see his or her sin as exceedingly sinful then desiring to be made right until the curtains are drawn back and His light of the law shines through<strong>. </strong>Listen to what Paul is saying in<strong> Romans 7:8, “… apart from the law sin was dead, but when commandment came, sin revived and I died”. </strong>If he had no law, he was righteous but when the law revealed to him his true state, he died cause the law killed his self-righteousness. <strong>It wasn’t grace that showed Isaiah his sin, it’s was the righteousness of God through the law that did.</strong> To continue, blessings Ev

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>

God upholds his laws, <strong>Psalms 19:7, “The law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul</strong>”. Charles Finney said, <strong>“</strong><em>God’s righteousness and perfect purity of character are revealed in His law”. The law was designed to call to attention the state of the heart which is the real value in God’s sight</em>” No one is saved by the law, the bible says, <strong>Romans 3:20</strong> “<strong>By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified</strong>”, the law is just the mirror. I have never seen a mirror clean anyone. Charles Finney also said, “<em>Ever more the Law must prepare the way for the Gospel. To overlook this in instructing souls is almost certain to result in false hope, the introduction of a false standard of Christian experience, and to fill the church with false converts…Time will make this plain</em><strong>."</strong> And the bible continues to highlight the purpose of the law, <strong>Galatians 3:24, “Wherefore the LAW was our school master to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith”. </strong>To quote CharlesSpurgeon,<strong> “</strong><em>The law cuts into the core of the evil, it reveals the seat of the malady, and informs us that the leprosy lies deep within. Oh how the man abhors himself when he sees all his rivers of water turned blood, and loathsomeness creeping over all his being”</em><strong>. <!--more--></strong>

This was not a smiling case for Isaiah because never has the law ever painted a good picture. It condemns, leaving you helpless in need of a Savior; it does not justify, all it does is leave you guilty. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE LAW. DL Moody said, “<em>The law can only chase you to the cross, no further</em>”. To further quote Charles Spurgeon, “<em>Having thus removed the mask and shown the desperate case of the sinner, the relentless law causes the offence to abound yet more by bringing home the sentence of condemnation. It mounts the judgment seat, puts on the black cap, and pronounces the sentence of death. With a harsh unpitying voice it solemnly thunders forth the words, "Condemned already." It bids the soul prepare its defense, knowing well that all apologies have been taken away by its former work of conviction. The sinner is therefore speechless, and the law, with frowning looks, lifts up the veil of hell, and gives the man a glimpse of torment. THE SOUL FEELS THAT THE SENTENCE IS JUST, that the punishment is not too severe, and that mercy it has no right to expect; it stands quivering, trembling, fainting, and intoxicated with dismay, until it falls prostrate in utter despair. The sinner puts the rope around his own neck, arrays himself in the attire of the condemned, and throws himself at the foot of the King's throne, with but one thought, "I am vile"; and with one prayer, "GOD BE MERCIFUL TO ME A SINNER</em>." Isaiah felt the same way and said “<strong>woe is me, for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips</strong>”. Though people take the laws of God lightly, God values His laws. His righteousness is not cheap and reduced to man’s level. <strong>Check out what it cost Him to redeem the law breakers and you will understand the values of His laws</strong>.

<strong>Romans 3:23,</strong> is frequently used in witnessing<strong> “For all have sinned…</strong>” yes we have all sinned but look at Isaiah’s response, <strong>he first acknowledged his personal sin before the corporate (Woe is ME)</strong>. I believe that as long as sinners put their sins as corporate, they will never see their sins as exceedingly sinful. The law makes the sin abound (exceedingly sinful) shutting one’s mouth without any avenue of justification. <strong>Romans 3:19, “Now we know that whatsoever the law says, it says to them that are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God"</strong> I can see Isaiah’s mouth being stopped as he sees himself guilty before a holy God. I’m not sure if many people I witnessed to back in the days saw the righteousness of God to stand and declare their guilty state before God and not me. To make this point clear, here is an analogy I love by Ray Comfort, I'm driving on the highway doing 75mph on a 55mph, it feels good and looking around me, everyone is doing it. Though I know it's wrong, it doesn't sound or feel wrong when I am going with the flow. As I continue to drive, suddenly the law (cop) makes his way in my lane flashing his lights. All of a sudden I can’t believe that I am doing 75mph when I should be doing 55mph. My conscious accuses me because God gave me one to show when I am doing wrong. He stops me and now I have to answer to the law. What made me feel bad about what I was doing? It’s when the law showed up and it showed me how serious it was to break it, and now my sin abound becoming exceedingly sinful. It was sin when I saw what I was doing, but it appeared to be more serious when the cop showed up. At this point either I am going to use an excuse that everyone is doing it or my mouth is stopped and I plead for mercy. Finney said, <strong>“</strong><em>hence God must bring them first under a felt sentence of death (under the law), but this does not make them righteous, it only prepares the way of bringing them to Christ”</em>. This is how Isaiah was stopped; he first talked about his own personal sin then talked about corporate sin. It’s at his point of conviction and repentance that God gave him grace and mercy. The bible says, <strong>“Him that much is forgiven, loves much</strong>” (paraphrased) and this becomes his fruit of salvation. The highway of sin, everyone is doing it, who is not given to lust, stealing, using the Lord’s name in vain? When God’s law makes its way in the fast lane, the sinner observes his conscious speedometer and all it does is accuse or excuse him. The law makes judgment reasonable. To continue, Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>

In the case of David in <strong>2Samuel 24</strong>, David sinned by numbering people, he goes before God and asks for forgiveness. I would imagine God easily forgiving him, but not quite yet. I’m in no way saying God wasn’t going to forgive him, I’m saying that God had to first show him <strong>THE SERIOUSNESS OF HIS SIN AND THE COST TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT</strong>.<!--more-->

A boy saw a vase that was priceless at his house. He did not know it’s true value and did not know why his father had placed in the safe. One day as the boy was running around the supermarket to his surprise he saw a vase that looked exactly like the one his father had preserved. Looking at the price tag, it only appeared to be $5. The boy could not believe why his father could value a vase that only cost $5. So the boy went back home and for some unknown reason played around with the vase, dropped it and shattered it into a thousand pieces. He wasn’t concerned because he remembered he had $5 and could just run to the store and buy the one he saw to replace what he broke. That’s what he did and put it back. When his father came home, the boy told his father he broke the vase and that he shouldn’t worry about it because he replaced it. Suddenly the boy looked at the face of his father turn pale why? that vase was not a cheap vase, it was antic worth $25,000 and not $5 as the boy thought. The horror filled the boy’s heart, what he broke and thought he could easily replace was more than what he anticipated. Suddenly fear gripped the boy’s heart, he now understood the true value of that vase, tears filled his eyes and began to say, “I am sorry, I am sorry”. The father seeing how truly sorry his son was said, “Son I see how truly sorry you are because of what you have done, but there is no way you will be able to replace that vase, but because I love you, I will replace it myself”. The boy could not believe what he heard especially his father forgiving him for his disobedience and replacing what he had broken. Joy filled his heart and his desire from now on was to do that which was right and pleasing to his father<strong>. Had the father just forgiven him without showing him the value of the vase and the cost of replacing it, he would have robbed the son the means of contrition, a place of sorrowful heart leading to repentance</strong>. Now I understand that if I bring someone to Christ without showing them the value of God’s law and the seriousness of breaking them, they will not have contrition and a sorrowful heart the very means that lead them to repentance. All they will think is that their cheap self-righteousness will save them on the Day of Judgment and therefore they will not submit to righteousness which is of God.

Let’s see how this applied to David’s case. <strong>2Samuel 24:10, “…so David said to the Lord, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, I pray, O Lord, take a way the iniquity of Your servant for I have done very foolishly</strong>”. This to me is a very sincere prayer. Sinners make the same prayers if not once, always. Good confession but their confession is not good enough and I will explain why shortly. In the morning, God sends a prophet to bring to David a message to pick out one of the three punishments he had lined for him. The first two punishments involved men and the last which is “<strong>three days of plague in his land</strong>” involves God directly. He chooses to go for the last one because he would rather fall in the hands of God than men’s. Why plague? if you remember God sending the 10 plagues to the land of Egypt, they are like the 10 commandments that plague us. It’s like the prophet brought one of the commandments to plague David. <strong>Sinners have to be plagued by the Ten Commandments, shutting their mouth of justification hence repenting. Without repentance, there can be no salvation</strong>.A quote Charles Finney<strong>, “</strong><em>This gospel plan seems to sinners deep and dark as midnight, till the Holy Ghost reveals to him his self-righteousness, cleaves down that self-righteous spirit, knocks out his props, and HE FALLS DOWN AND DIES!.. THEN THE CROSS REVEALS LIFE, AND HE REJOICES WITH EXCEEDING JOY IN A SALVATION WROUGHT OF GOD THROUGH REDEEMING BLOOD</em>”, to continue, blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>

If you continue to ready <strong>2Samuel 24, </strong>youdiscover how God plagued David by killing 70 thousand people, while God sent His Son to this world to die for over 6 billion people. If 70 thousand people had to die for someone to be redeemed, we can conclude the sin was not petty. If a judge is to pass a sentence that requires the offender to pay 70 thousand dollars as his fines, we can conclude it wasn’t a petty crime. <strong>Romans 5:8 “God demonstrated his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us”. Christ was the ultimate sacrifice to pay for the fine for law breakers. If the sacrifice was this great, the law broken must be big. </strong><em>D.L. Moody said, “FOR GOD TO CREATE, HE ONLY HAD TO SPEAK; TO REDEEM, CHRIST HAD TO SUFFER (PLAGUED)”.</em> Quick death is less painful compared to suffering before dying. Christ suffered greatly, crushed before dying and that was His demonstration of His love to us. <strong>Isaiah 53:5, “He was wounded for my transgression, He was bruised for my iniquities</strong>”. His sacrifice was not a painless death but a painful death and once again, that was the demonstration of His love.<!--more-->

Whipped on the post, a crown of thorns forced on His head, carrying the heavy cross to the mountain, being nailed and the Roman soldier piercing on His side and the greatest of all, the Son drank the cup of wrath given to Him by the Father. The greater news, He came back to life and lives forevermore. The sin was great to make the Son of God to go through all this to make it right. If I want to tell a sinner that God loves him, I will point him to the cross, the demonstration of His love will speak louder than words. The disciples preached the love of God by preaching Christ crucified (sacrifice). <strong>See the confession was good but for the things to be made right, the fine posed on the offender had to be paid by someone</strong>. It’s like telling a judge that you are sorry and he knows you are but the fact remains that a law has been broken. A sentence has been passed and all that the court needs to clear one is someone paying for the fine or going to jail. The offender can’t afford it because we were not redeemed by silver and gold, someone has to pay it on our behalf or we are heading to jail (hell).

<strong>If the unsaved do not see the seriousness of their sin and that they deserve justice, they are not ready to receive Christ crucified to pay for their fine</strong>. Finney says, “<em>We can now apprehend God’s method of making sinners personally righteous. First He opens the way, by giving us His Son to honor the law, so that God can come down from heaven and enter into a covenant with the sinner and draw him back to life and love. This is God’s method that Christ is received as the sinner’s righteousness, having borne for him the curse of the law, obeying it perfectly, and then suffering in place of the penalty, which the sinner else must have suffered</em>.” Just like the boy who the father revealed the cost of the vase leading him to a place of repentance, so is the unsaved.

In the past I rushed the unsaved through the gospel robbing them the very means of seeing their true state that they may personally flee to the Savior for redemption. <strong>WE BROKE THE LAW AND HE PAID THE FINE, IT’S AS SIMPLE AS THAT</strong>. To continue, Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>

The bible says <strong>James 4:6. “God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble”. </strong>The humble will submit to the righteousness of God. Watch this<strong>, 2Samuel 24:17, “Then David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel striking the people, and said, “SURELY I HAVE SINNED, AND I HAVE DONE WICKEDLY; BUT THESE SHEEP, WHAT HAVE THEY DONE? LET YOUR HAND, I PRAY, BE AGAINST ME…”</strong> David was not justifying himself neither was he seeing that he was being rubbed the wrong way, he saw God serving justice over what he did and he understood that he deserved justice and that humbled him. <!--more-->When a sinner sees his sin in its true state and sees that he deserves hell because of God’s justice, he will truly appreciate the sacrifice offered on his behalf. <strong>A sinner will never fully appreciate grace until he understands how exceedingly his sin is and the cost to make things right</strong>. David saw his sin as exceedingly sinful when he was plagued (value of the law) and how many had to die because of what he did (the cost) so is with us, when we understand why Christ had to go to the cross, we will see <strong>the cost to appreciate the sacrifice</strong>. <strong>If a sinner does not understand what he is being saved from, he will not fully appreciate what he is being saved for</strong>. We are saved from the wrath to come. If God is to serve justice on us on judgment day, we will not make it, <strong>Romans 1:18, “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men…” , Hebrews 9:27</strong>,<strong> “God commands everyone everywhere to repent because He has set a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness”</strong>. God’s judgment will be based on righteousness and not happiness as many think and if at all we were never made righteous, He will serve justice. Christ paying for all the laws I ever broke, forgiving me of my sins and Him coming into my life is the means by which I have passed from death to life. On the Day of Judgment, I will only make it because of the righteousness of God through Christ in me. The bible says, “<strong>Christ in us, the hope of glory</strong>”. <strong>2Corinthians 5:21, “For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God</strong>”. He is the parachute that will save me from the sure death and because of that, I have deep joy in my heart.

<strong>Romans 10:3, “for they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God</strong>”. To sum it up, "Without repentance, there can be no salvation" and a person cannot see their sin in its true state unless they see and understand God's righteousness. A sinner cannot know God's righteousness unless the law is read to them exposing their self-righteousness that they submit to the righteousness of God.

It is not about making decisions and commitments, it's about God’s righteousness exposing my sinful state that I may say like Isaiah, “woe unto me…” and David, “I have surely sinned and done wickedly” then pleading for grace and mercy, desiring the forgiveness of Christ. <strong>God’s law takes away our ignorance of His righteousness and humbles us to submit to His</strong>. So why did I see many fall away from their faith? it’s because the gospel fell on stony ground, aiming for decision rather than repentance. In that case, the seed cannot be blamed for not taking root. <strong>The seed is for a prepared ground</strong> and that is why <strong>Psalm 19:7</strong> does the job of getting the ground ready, “<strong>the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul</strong>”. It empties us of our self-righteousness dangling us before the jaws of hell and we cry to God, <strong>“be merciful to me a sinner</strong>” and He gives us grace to lift us up from the pits of hell. I can now look back and see that the ones who stood, their grounds were already prepared long before I met them and shared with them. They were searching, they had hit rock bottom and all they needed was the Savior’s righteousness to submit to and that is what saved them. How about the self-righteous?, the law will cause them to hit rock bottom, declare them bankrupt and grace fills their empty accounts <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9, “For it’s by grace that you’ve been saved through faith and not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works lest anyone should boast of”. I am glad for what I am saved FOR and FROM. Grace outdoes sin, it lifts us higher than the place from which we fell. The law traces sin up to our heart; grace traces its own origin to God. Grace is the medicine that heals the sickness of sin. </strong>Give anyone medicine when they do not think or feel they are sick and see if they will value and take in the medicine. Show them how very sick they are and they will take the medicine in no time, make use of it and appreciate the sacrifice someone had to go to get the medicine<strong>. </strong>To continue, blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”</strong>

God forgave David and he truly appreciated it as demonstrated by his sacrifice to the Lord. He refused to offer God what cost him nothing. It cost God a lot to bring him out of his sin, he also understood that it will cost him a lot to live for Him. Isaiah’s lips were touched with alive coal of fire and his sins departed, he then heard the Lord say, <strong>“who shall go for us”,</strong> Isaiah was quick to say, “<strong>Here I am Oh Lord send me</strong>”. In other words, if you could do this for me by giving the very best, I will do anything for You. <strong>John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life</strong>” and because of that, I will serve You for the rest of my life. I will be a living witness of Your saving grace. I will stand like Isaiah and say, “<strong>Here I am Oh Lord send me</strong>”. I will offer sacrifices that will cost me. I will not give you what cost me nothing. I will delight to do thy will. The gratitude I may not express in words, I will express in works. I will give you what is RIGHT not what is LEFT. I HAVE SEEN THE COST TO APPRECIATE THE SACRIFICE.<!--more-->

This study is a reflection of what I have learnt and put in practice. I have found them to be life changing experience to the extent that many that I shared with cried out, “WHAT MUST WE DO TO BE SAVED”. Through biblical evangelism (preaching law and grace), I have seen God soundly save some, my youngest brother and his wife being one of the few examples.

We need to be faithful witnesses declaring the righteousness of God. Let His righteousness expose the sin in the unsaved live, removing the ignorance of self-righteousness and bringing them to submit themselves to God’s righteousness. This is all accomplished by God, however, we are God’s instruments to bring about this truth to the unsaved. We are like the Surgeon’s assistant who puts the right tools in the hands of the Surgeon to perform a heart surgery. This will give sinners a chance to cry, “what must we do to be saved?” And then talk to them about repentance and faith. I desire to see people soundly saved and they in turn become soul winners and not pew warmers.

With all these, here is the foreseen danger in our time as penned by General William Booth, the founder of Salvation Army. He said, “<em>The Chief danger of Christianity in 20th century will be…Religion without the Holy Ghost; Christianity without Christ; Forgiveness without repentance; Salvation without regeneration; Politics without God; And heaven without hell</em>”

Sad but true, we are living in those times<strong>. “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God”, Romans 10:3. Blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Job 31:1, "I made a covenant with my eyes, not to look lustfully at a girl” NIV</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">One thing that scares me daily is the thought that I have the ability to sin and sin is constantly knocking on my door. I usually joke about two things I’m allergic to, sin and pain. There are no two things I can think of that have destroyed many men of God like sexual sin and greed. This continues to plague men daily in a sexually charged world and a world of greed. In the age of Internet, TV, movies, magazines, beaches, dressings etc. all around has created a challenge for men and some women in generral, something we call “every man’s battle”. I think that the level of temptations faced by David, Solomon, Samson and others in the past cannot be compared to what we face today and yet the standard of God’s purity for man has not changed and never will. It’s easy to try and poke holes in God’s word to find something to justify sin, however we need to always remember,<strong> God’s word is truth, He has no revised edition to fit our time</strong>. The word was set to address everything in any age. God’s still holds us to the highest standard revealed in the Holy Scriptures.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">Your true Christianity is not what you display before people; your true Christianity is who you are when no one is around. It’s where your walk is defined and this is a challenge to men in general. <strong>The lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world, are the two fatal rocks on which multitudes split</strong>; against these Job protests he was always careful to stand upon his guard. While Job was facing his trying moments, he reflected on his life and one thing that he mentions is that he made a covenant with his eyes not to look lustfully at a girl (woman). When God allowed Satan to take away everyone and everything from Job, one person Satan wouldn’t touch was his wife. I believe for this reason, the presence of his wife would remind him of the covenant he made to God and to her and that would help him be pure before God and stand through it all. Job made a covenant to be pure before God and honor his wife by keeping his eyes on her and her alone regardless of what came his way. Of course opportunities may have presented themselves to sway him but he kept on remembering his covenant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How often does opportunities present themselves to you? You may not be looking for trouble but trouble finds you, what is your response? Does your conscious remind you of the covenant you made to your wife before God? To honor God by being faithful to her in thoughts, in words and in deeds? As my pastor would say, men of God must “<strong>Avoid the second look</strong>”, the first look my catch you off guard, the second look is a choice, a responsibility you are accountable for.<strong> How much commitment you show to your spouse shows how much you value purity</strong>. The bible says, “<strong>2Timothy 2:22, “Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure hear</strong>t”. It doesn’t say try and fight it or deal with it, no, you and I must run for our lives. While running from it, we will run towards righteousness, faith, love, peace.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I constantly pray that God would be more present in my life and give me power to overcome the lust of flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. That my eyes may be fixed on Him with my wife as a supporting cast. If I pull my eyes from her or if I work an appetite outside my marriage, I will be living in sin and the fear of God will be absent. Read what Job says in looking to God to search his heart in this area,<strong> vs. 9-10 "9 If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door, 10 then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her”.</strong> What a scary statement but a statement that would hold him accountable to his actions if he did. The thought of someone else lusting after your wife while you lust after other people’s wives (married or not) should scare you to death. Those who are single who may be dating or looking around, be careful on how you treat those women. That could be someone’s wife if not yours (if you don’t get married to her). Those of you who look at stuff on the Internet, on magazines remember those are someone’s daughter and someone’s wife. There are men who say, “<em>you can look at the menu and not order from it</em>”, the Lord has something to say to such men <strong>Matthew 5:27-28, “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ 28 But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart”</strong>. In the OT, they would have looked at committing adultery as the actual act, we Christians under grace in the NT the standard is made clear, the thought is sinful.<strong> Proverbs 6:32, “Whoever commits adultery (lust) with a woman lacks understanding; He who does so destroys his own soul”</strong> Matthew Henry<em>, “Those that would keep their hearts pure must guard their eyes, which are both the outlets and inlets of uncleanness</em><strong><em>”</em></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To make a covenant is to make an agreement. Would you and I make a covenant daily not to look with lust (both married and single men and struggling women"? To flee lust? To love God and our wives with a pure heart is hard, we cannot do it by ourselves that is why we need to pray to God for grace and strength to overcome the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life,<strong> Philippians 4:13, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”.</strong> If you've stumbled, repent of it and stand for the Lord, blessings Ev</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Matthew 5:48, “Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.”</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Is there such thing as perfect Christian in this world full of temptation, sin, evil and error? Can Christians truly and honestly become perfect? Is perfection attainable in this life? Does God truly and seriously expect or want Christians to be perfect? And if Christians can be perfect,<strong> which is the easiest or quickest and sure way to attaining perfection, if it is attainable?<!--more--></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">First, let me give you simple definition of the word perfect. It simply means; something or someone without error, mistake, or flaws. When we say that something or someone is perfect, we simply mean that, whatever or whoever we are referring to have no default of any kind. So, now, can we say that Christians are perfect? That they do not have any error? Is it possible for Christians to be without mistakes, error, or flaws? Impossible! If so, then why does the Bible instruct us to be perfect, even as our heavenly Father is perfect?<strong> Mathew 5:48</strong>. In James 1:4, for instance, The Bible admonishes the believers to be perfect: “<strong>But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.”</strong> Yes, we are required to be perfect! There is no exemption and no excuse. The onus of attaining perfection is on us not on God. We have the responsibility to avoid and get rid of anything from our life which can or has defiled us, rendering us imperfect before God. This we must do every day and consistently.<strong> That being the case, what is the easiest way of becoming perfect?</strong> Let me answer that by sharing with you a little story</p>
<p dir="ltr">One day, a young boy went to a Sculptor and asked him “Sir, What do you do if you want to curve an elephant from a log of wood?” The Sculptor answered and said “Son, the fastest and easiest way of curving a beautiful and perfect elephant from a log of wood or any piece of wood for that matter, is to chop off anything from the log that does not look like an elephant. When you are done chopping off, you will be left with a perfect curving of an elephant. To make it more beautiful, you must sand it and polish it. It is as simple as such. The only most important thing you must remember is, you must know how true an elephant looks like.” The boy was satisfied with the answer. From then, he believed he could curve a perfect elephant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is the moral of the story? If you want to be a perfect Christian, chop off anything and everything from your life that does not look like a Christian. To do this successfully, you must have a perfect picture of a perfect Christian before you to guide you. Where would you find such a Christian? In the Bible; The Bible reveals who a perfect Christian is or should be. The Bible image is the only image you can compare yours with. You cannot compare yourself with yourself or someone else, as standards of perfection. You are not perfect and there is none perfect. Only God is perfect and He alone can make anyone perfect, if they be willing to listen, obey His Word which, alone, is able to make us perfect. The word will show you what to chop off. Keep chopping until you see a perfect Christian merging out of your imperfect and impure life. It may be painful doing so. It may take a long time. But, be determined and patient. "<strong>Let Patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect… (James 1:4) God bless you.</strong> Blessings Pastor Boaz</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>2Timothy 3:16&amp;17, "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work"</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There are those days you find you are dragging your feet behind. The moment your alarm clock goes off, you know it's time to wake up and get ready for tasks ahead of you for that day. Your two legs debate which should get out of the bed first. We even drag when it comes to reading the bible and praying. As you are reading the bible, you fall asleep or you get nothing out of it, you pray for two minutes, mumble a few words and fall to sleep. I find it much easier to read other books than read the bible and yet the bible has all I need pertaining to life. It is the book that should be read daily by every believer.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">Someone used the B.I.B.L.E as acronym,<strong> Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth</strong>. The bible teaches us who God is, His plan for salvation among other things, it’s been called the instruction book for life, it's also known as the map to treasure. I have watched several movies about finding treasures and what comes to mind before finding the treasure is not how it looks like or its value but how it can be found. Often times people know that treasures are not junks but valuable. I watched this movie, "Romancing a stone" depicting a treasure to be found. The main thing that everyone was fighting for was the MAP to the treasure. The map looked so old and torn but it was precious. Does the bible too lead God's people to treasure? of course, God is our treasure. Whether the map is new or old it does not change what it can do. Just as the old map has the path way to a treasure so is the Bible the pathway to God.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By definition, the dictionary says that Bible is the sacred book of Christianity, a collection of ancient writings including both Old Testament and the New Testament.<strong> IT'S AN AUTHORITATIVE BOOK IN IT'S FIELD</strong>. It does not have a mouth but it speaks. It has a voice. The best ever selling book in the entire universe. The book widely translated, the one many are killed for owning and reading it. It's more than a story book, it's a living and powerful book,<strong> Hebrew 4:12, "The word of the Lord is living and powerful...",</strong> tested, tried, and proved. We thank God for the witnesses, however It's the book that does not need an attorney or witnesses to prove or authenticate itself. It is able by itself to do so. When the bible was under attack someone asked Charles Spurgeon to do something, his response, “<em>you don’t need to defend a lion. Just turn it loose and it will defend itself</em>”. We need to turn the bible loose. Laws have been written off this book, nations have been saved through this book and many more. It's a very unique book and a book of a kind. Reading one passage over and over again always has something new, a principal to learn from. What a book!!!! We need it, we need to open it, read it, memorize it, learn from it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2Timothy 3:16&amp;17, "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work".</strong> God in times has always used men to accomplish His plan. You've heard me say “God can do anything without any man yet He has chosen men to accomplish what He has in mind for His own glory”. 66 books in the bible were written by men under the inspiration of God. We are told some of the reasons, it is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,<strong> for instruction</strong> in righteousness why?, that the man/woman of God may be complete and equipped in the word. Timothy was advised,<strong> 2Timothy 2:15, "Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needed not to be a shamed, rightly dividing the word of the truth</strong>". In the age of error, false teachings and false doctrines, we need the word.<strong> Joshua 1:8, "This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it</strong>.<strong> For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success", Psalm 119:105, "Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path".</strong> Time fail me to get more into this word but I know that you can see how it is a precious book not to be taken lightly. It's our manual book and map to the treasure. All the answers to your questions are in this book, so take it off the shelf, dust it off and open it, read it. Pray for discipline to read it daily. Don't wait till you get to church and then open it, or when you are in trouble for it is your<strong> Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. Blessings Ev</strong></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Revelation 1:3- “Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near”</strong>

As I read and as I pray, my thoughts are drawn faithfully to these topics, to the Christians responsibility. It is utter foolishness to doubt God in anyway, He is Faithful and True. But what about us? Are we faithful to Him? Is our heart given over to the Lord? Are we truly seeking God with all our heart? And this is not dead works, but the true desire of my inner being for God alone. Works always follow the one truly born of God, they don’t make you a Christian(see <strong>Matthew 7:21-24)</strong>. John gives us clear teaching here, in line with <strong>James 1:22, Romans 2:13.</strong> It is not the hearers of the word, nor the readers, but the doers that are just in the sight of God. <!--more-->This brings in the question of our faithfulness, if we claim to be His followers, are we following Him? Are we faithful to Jesus? When confronted, do we testify of Him? We refer to prayer, to the Bible, to many things in front of people, but what about Christ? He is the center of all existence, the source of all things, it is Him alone that can save souls, the Bible doesn’t save people, nor does prayer in themselves, only Christ can. Jesus said the one who keeps His word, it is he that truly loves Him. All else is dead religion. Jesus Christ came into the world to make sinful men and women holy as He is holy, not to just make us better and moral. He came that He might be glorified in and through me as I abandon my life to Him, but I often wonder how many have truly come to Him this way. But this is the only way. I must lose my life if I will gain His.

Friends, the time is near, Jesus is coming. Paul tells us in <strong>Ephesians 5:27</strong> who he is coming back for, a bride that is holy and without blemish. Not religious, holy. A bride that walks and talks with Him, and that keeps His word, not when convenient, always. Not on Sundays, everyday. He is coming for a bride that loves Him above all else, not one who compartmentalizes the Son of God and fits Him in between classes and TV if they have time. That is not devotion. True devotion comes when my eyes have been thrown open by the majesty of a holy God, true devotion surrenders entirely that He might be glorified in my life. True devotion adores this precious, beautiful Savior in the manner He deserves, but how many truly know and practice this devotion? John tells us the time is near, Jesus tells us to watch and pray, for we know not the time of His coming, or when we ourselves shall meet Him. Are we ready? We who claim to be Christians, are we walking in the holy, pure, imparted righteousness of Christ? Is Jesus Christ absolutely paramount in your life above all else? Above your spouse, your job, your children, your education, your career? He must be everything. I know my heart is challenged, I pray yours is as well. I pray in these last hours that God would open our eyes to behold the glory of His being, the spotless majesty of His purity. I pray we would all see Him as Isaiah did, that we would be undone before Him, and that we would never be the same again.

May you be found in Him this day, Blessings, Bro. Benjamen

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalms 23:1, “The Lord is my Shepard. I have everything I need”</strong>

The Psalmist who wrote the great Psalms of all times viewed the Lord from different perspectives and angels. In the first verse of <strong>Psalm 23,</strong> he saw the Lord as a Shepard and himself obviously as the sheep. A Shepard takes care of the sheep. A good Shepard knows his sheep. He feeds the sheep; he protects the sheep from wolves and mischievous thieves and Shepard of other herds; he leads the sheep to green pastures and cool waters. His ultimate commitment and devotion is to the sheep. The sheep may not even be aware of that fact, but that does not change the position of the Shepard or lessen his commitment or encourage him to abandon the sheep, especially when the sheep is in trouble or in need.<!--more-->

Think about it for a moment. If God is my and your Shepard, and he is all knowing and all able and willing to watch us daily wherever we are, then, like David, we too can declare with confidence that, “The Lord is indeed our Shepard; we shall not lack anything". What we already have and don’t yet have are already provided and are ours to enjoy and expect. We don’t have to see to be satisfied; we don’t have to get first then be grateful. All we need to know is the good Shepard has provided all our needs.

Do you have any need today? Is there a problem anywhere? Are you worried about the future? Are you afraid something bad might happen to you? Are you scared of loosing something or someone you love? Is your heart troubled and your mind confused? Are you stretched and stressed beyond your ability to cope? Take a moment today and reflect on the fact that you have God as your Shepard. A good Shepard. Instead of worrying, lean on him; learn of him, let go of your fears and worries; follow him. That is what sheep do; they follow the Shepard. And the Shepard leads the way.

Learn to rest in peace and sleep through your storms, worries, concerns or problems.<strong>“I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; for You alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.” -Psalm 4:8</strong>

An old hymn affirms this Biblical admonition:

What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
Learning on the everlasting arms? I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.-Hoffman

God bless you. Brother Boaz Olang]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jonah 2:2, “And he said: “I cried out to the LORD because of my affliction, And He answered me. “Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, And You heard my voice”</strong>

It’s tough to be in a situation that takes away your freedom and limits you to what you can and cannot do. Some we bring upon ourselves and some find us. Regardless of their origination, the results are still the same, expect limitations.<!--more-->

Jonah decided to disobey God by going the opposite direction from what the Lord had instructed him. Upon deciding to go to Tarshis, later we find that the Lord sent a storm in the sea and later he was thrown into the sea. Some could say the Lord was trying to kill him, I doubt it, I see that God trying to show Him who is God. The sea should have killed him but listen to this <strong>Jonah 1:17, “Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights”</strong>. What a way to humble a man of God, being swallowed by a fish. His freedom taken away, his pride crushed, his sense of ability limited and all he is left with is to focus on the One he was running away from. He was running away because he thought he had it together, with situation being unbearable, he called on God. Why did he not call on God when the storm was fears, or when they threw him into sea or the first or second day in the belly of the fish? Because man has a tendency of still trying to lead and fix their lives until they come to a dead end then they remember the Lord. Jonah says, “<strong>I cried out to the LORD because of my affliction”</strong>, I thank the Lord because my afflictions allow me to get closer as I call on Him. Now Jonah did cry in the midst of yuck (belly of a fish) and God heard him and out of the belly of the fish did Jonah come forth. Vs <strong>4, "Then I said, “I have been cast out of Your sight; Yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.’"</strong>

Jonah after all these went to Nineveh to fulfill his assignment. He believed God to bring Him out of a situation and now He was going to be an ambassador for the Lord. <strong>John 7:38, “…as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."</strong> His belly did not have the right water till he found himself in another belly, a belly of death yet preserved. The reason he did not want to go to Nineveh was because though he was going to preach future punishment, he knew if the people repented, God would pardon their sins. He did not want forgiveness for the people of Nineveh until he also found himself in a place where he messed up and needed a pardon for himself. He cried to the Lord to be pardoned.

I don’t know about you but my living water of ministry, encouragements, teaching, preaching came about after having an experience in the belly of some type of fish. The experience taught me new and valuable lessons I could never learn in a classroom. I can now preach that God pardons people’s sins because mine has been pardoned. Out of my life living water flow because He flows in and through me. So if you are in the belly of some fish right this moment, cry to Him for deliverance, let Him set the living water out of that experience and then be an ambassador for Him in whichever Nineveh He places you in because out of a belly did He bring you forth and from your belly shall flow rivers of the living water. Blessings Evans.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Kings 18:20-40, “… and the God who answers by fire, He is God…”
</strong>
The world is full of many doctrines, some doctrines have erred from the truth resulting into people being deceived. We have been given an awesome opportunity as believers not just to accept anything without first testing and approving. We then we become vessels God can use to reach His people with the truth He has revealed to us. A number of believers have also fallen on the trap of error as they were not well equipped enough to differentiate or discern.<!--more-->

Elijah was the only prophet in Israel. Many of the prophets had been killed because they did not follow Baal. Baal was the most popular god of the Canaanites, he was a god of lust, power and fertility. He was known to be a god that supplied rain for the crops when there was draught. In his time, Elijah called for draught, and the only way to override the call was not too look to Baal but to God. Baal had 450 prophets who faithfully served him and Elijah got so sick of seeing people worship something that had no power. No wonder Paul writes in <strong>2Timothy 3:5, “having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof</strong>”, some people like these prophets have a form of godliness and denies the power in the sense that they are faithful about going to church, worshipping, and walking with a form of god but that’s about it, they don’t see the true God as Almighty. In the world, people have a form of godliness but they deny the power, they are doing everything to keep commandments and know about God but deny His power to save and forgive their sins. Elijah was dealing with the same kind of people only that these worshiped a false god.

Elijah was tired of seeing the true God robbed of His glory by false god and his prophets. Elijah therefore took upon himself to prove who the true God was. He said that whoever answers by fire is the true God. One man against 450 prophets, <strong>it was time to prove that it’s not by might nor by power but by His Spirit says the Lord</strong>. So Elijah challenged the men to meet him on mount Carmel, he advised them to bring two bulls, one for them and one for him. One man was not threatened by the number. <strong>Truth is never threatened by the number, it always stands alone</strong>. He decided to give them the first chance to prepare their sacrifice. The true people of God are not intimidated by what the false religion has to offer before them. I have seen people from other religions tremble when we challenged their doctrines why? they have no foundation of the truth to build their beliefs on. They have been trained on how to respond to certain questions unless you ask something outside of that. Finally the prophets set their sacrifice on the altar and began to call on their god. The whole day they cried, chanted, cut themselves, meanwhile Elijah was watching and making fun of them. He knew that at one point he will need to call on his God but it will not take hours before He answers him. After they prayed all day and nothing happened, they gave up, their god failed them big time. If I was to pray to a god all day and nothing happens, I would change my stand.

Elijah then took his sacrifice and set it on the altar, he even had water poured all over sacrifice overflowing. Now we know that water and fire don’t work together and my concern is how will a wet sacrifice burn especially when we know that wet wood cannot catch fire? He knew these people might say that he did something that caused the fire, he was not going to let them think he cheated. <strong>Vs. 36, “Lord of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that You are God, and that You have turned their hearts back to you again“. Vs. 38.”Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench”.</strong> This kind of prayer reminds me of lost people I will meet. As lost people, they have something they are worshipping that needs to be challenged. I will need to pray the kind of prayer that moves heaven to send fire to consume their wet hearts, confusion and darkness in their lives.

This is God’s work, all I need to do is to represent Him and He will take care of the rest. God is a consuming fire and when He begins to consume, He consumes everything including the things that in natural cannot be consumed by fire. I believe that God has placed us in different positions to be <strong>us against the world.</strong> How will they know unless they are told, how will they come out unless they are challenged, “<strong>for I am not a shamed of the gospel cause it’s the power of God unto salvation” Romans 1:16</strong>. The only way we will challenge the unbelievers is by knowing who God is, what He can do and availing ourselves to be used at any given time to bring people to Him. If you look at the story, you will see how the prophets began to worship the true God but still Elijah killed all of them because they were false prophets whose hearts were not truly changed and they were injecting lies in the minds of people. Be God’s instrument He can use you to challenge and bring people to the full knowledge of Him. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 40:1-4, “Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his Trust”</strong>

People come before God to pray to Him about different things for they are fully persuaded that He is their refuge and strength. Where you are fully convinced that if the Lord does not come through for you, you are destined to fail. If you are like me, you may find it hard to wait for what you have prayed for and know what God’s will is for the situation you are in. This verse in Hebrews sheds light clearly and I will use it to set the ball rolling. <strong>Hebrews 10:35&amp;36, “Cast not therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward, for you are in need of patience that after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise”</strong><!--more-->

This verse ties with the next few verses we will look at. <strong>Psalm 40:1, “I waited patiently for the Lord; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry“.</strong> As I have mentioned before, the word "wait" has different meanings and the first meaning on hold for someone or something. The other meaning is busy serving others just like in restaurants. We have waiters waiting on people and I believe this is what the Psalmist is telling us that he patiently served the Lord and the Lord heard him. In serving (waiting) on God, he was also bringing his petitions to Him. In his faithfulness in serving, the Lord heard his cry and attended to Him.

Not only did the Lord hear his cry and attended to him, in <strong>Psalm 40:2, “He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, And set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps</strong>“. As you are busy waiting (serving) the Lord, hell won’t be too happy with you serving. Remember Jesus words in, <strong>John 16:33, “These things have I spoken unto you, that in me you might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world</strong>“. There is truth of what will happen, however there is a promise that comes with it. <strong>1John 4:4, “Ye are of God little children for you have overcome them. For greater is He that is inside of you than he that is in the world“</strong>. Attacks will come, the good news, He is the greatest living inside than we and the enemy living in the world. With that established, don’t be surprised at times when you are in horrible pits or in a miry clay for He will pick you up and set your feet upon a rock. He is the Rock of Ages <strong>Psalm 18:46, “The Lord lives; and blessed be my Rock; and let the Lord of My salvation be exalted”.</strong> He will set you on Himself, the Rock.

"<strong>…And established my steps</strong>”, the Lord establishes our steps, in other words recognizes our steps. Our steps could be in good ministries, good friends, dealing with issues, meeting deadlines, dealing with arrogant people. In short, all that you need to deal with He recognizes and establishes your step that you may walk worthy of His vocation. Walking with Him requires patience, back to Hebrews we looked at, “<strong>...For you are in need of patience”. Psalm 37:23,</strong> “<strong>The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way”</strong>. The word order here could mean bring something from somewhere else which is missing in the present situation and using it to accomplish what He had in mind. The present things have no capability of making it work but when He orders it from his warehouse (heaven), it comes complete.

<strong>Psalm 40:3, “He has put a new song in my mouth – Praise to our God; Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord“</strong>. I know the power in singing for it has a way of encouraging you to overcome. It may not be very easy to pray in certain situations but singing a song will make a great impact. Singing helps you lift Him up and what did He say in <strong>John 12:32, “And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me”</strong>. You lift Him up, you will be part of the people who will be drawn. The neat thing about this verse is that He does not even ask you to look for a song, He puts one in your mouth that you may praise Him. Certain songs that we sing out of our mouths, I wonder whether they praise Him?. “<strong>…Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord“,</strong> whenever the Lord is doing something in your life and mine, He has someone else in mind that they may see the goodness of the Lord in your life and fear Him. The fear here is reverencing fear. Many Christians walk as though they have no God to help them and the unbelievers have no one to set an example for them.

<strong>Psalm 40:4, “Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust”,</strong> there are so many things you will not understand about how God operates but trust Him. My wife and I are in situations right now where we don’t know what to expect but sure enough, we are making the Lord our trust. He has heard our cry and attended to it, He has brought us up from the pits and miry clay, He has set our feet upon a rock, He has established our steps, He has put a song in our mouths, And He has set people to see what He has done in our lives, what else can we do but make Him our trust. <strong>Hebrews 10:36, “…after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise“</strong>. I am determined to do the will of God with gladness for one day if not soon, I will receive the promise. Blessings, Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“Preach the word!” Paul said to Timothy; “Be ready in season and out of season.” It is time spent in prayer, waiting on God, hearing from God, being empowered by God that makes us ready for action.

In Acts 16:16, Paul and Silas, on their way to prayer, were rudely and unexpectedly confronted by a devil. Did they ask the devil to wait while they “prayed about it?” Did they back away because they weren't “prayed up?” No way. They were ready for action. Prayer was a part of their routine. Prayer was something they had already done and were about to do again. Prayed up? They were always “prayed up.” Without any hesitation or intimidation they exposed that devil and cast it out of that poor, tormented soul.<!--more-->

By contrast, in Mark 9:17-29, the disciples were not ready. Due to a lack of prayer and fasting, they were unable to cast out an evil spirit. As well, in Acts 19:14-16, seven sons of a preacher were equally ill equipped for action. Rather than defeating an evil spirit, the evil spirit defeated them, overpowered them and cast them out of the house—all seven, naked and wounded. Why did they fail? They weren't ready. They had spent no time with Jesus and therefore had neither the character nor the power of Christ imprinted upon them.

Jesus said tribulation would come. For this reason, He also said, “Men always ought to pray,” and Paul said, “Pray without ceasing.” There is no excuse for the spiritual leader who doesn't pray. He is no better than a soldier who has gone to battle without a weapon or shield. Victory comes when preparation meets opportunity. The will to win is nothing without the will to prepare! We will hardly know when opportunities, challenges and tribulation are about to befall us. But we are called to be ready. It is only through prayer that our hearts will be readied and our spirits anointed to face those unforeseen trials. Without prayer, we will be tossed about; naked and wounded victims beaten by the enemies for whom we failed to prepare.

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It was during a prayer meeting in Acts 13 that the Holy Spirit said, “Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” No vision for ministry or good idea can be trusted if it is not learned or affirmed through prayer.

When it comes to the work of God, there must be no mistake about the leader’s prayer life. Prayer is the work of God. It is not an after thought uttered in haste or spiritual window dressing to validate our ambitions. It is serious business and must be the driving force behind the ministry. If not, there will be serious repercussions for the body he or she is leading. J. Oswald Sanders said, "A course selected with little regard for prayer, will ultimately lead to an unspiritual and misguided administration. Eventually the Spirit is grieved and quenched, and the result is spiritual dearth and death for that place."<!--more-->

While a leader’s resume, credentials, and education are important, they must never take precedence over the question of his or her commitment to and love of prayer. Simply stated, leaders who don’t pray cannot be hearing from God and cannot be trusted to direct the body. They may have good ideas, but they may not be the right ideas. They will undoubtedly have noble intentions, but they may be the wrong intentions—wrong because they are not designed according to the good, perfect and acceptable will of God.

Paul wrote to the Colossians, “We…do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all patience and longsuffering with joy.” Clearly, knowing and doing the will of God were achieved through prayer. It is through prayer that God leads us in His plans. It is through prayer that we contend with the obstacles hindering His will. It is through prayer that He empowers us to fulfill His purposes and it is through prayer that we find the release of all that is needed to do His work.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[How frustrating it is to plan elaborate training seminars and intensive discipleship programs that are met with little or no interest from those we are trying to reach. How discouraging it can be to labor over a sermon, studying and preparing for hours only to have no response from those to whom it is preached. How agonizing it is to organize, administrate, plan and coordinate only to be met by resistance, criticism and rejection. Such scenarios are repeated over and over for those leaders who don’t pray.<!--more-->

No leader had greater success with the people he led than the Apostle Paul. His success, however, is not due to some charismatic flare, a dynamic preaching voice or incredibly creative ministry programs. Paul’s success can be traced back to one thing: prayer. Paul prayed for his people—and his people grew in Christ.

To the Romans he said, “Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.” To the Ephesians he wrote, “I do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers.” He told the Philippians, “In every prayer, I make request for you all.” For the Colossians he wrote, “We (are) praying always for you.” As well, to the Thessalonians Paul prayed that their faith would grow exceedingly and their love would abound. To Timothy, he said, “I remember you in my prayers night and day.”

Indeed, Paul taught and preached the Word to them. Of course, he organized and set their churches in order. He was often involved in administrative and outreach efforts. But behind the scenes we see Paul prostrate before the Lord, crying out for the people he is leading. He is praying for their hearts to be soft and receptive to the Word of God. He is praying for the Holy Spirit to convict them of sin and grow them in Christ. He is praying against the schemes of the devil against them and for their victory over the struggles they face.

Paul was a great teacher, but it was his praying that impacted the people. He was a great administrator, but it was his praying that set things in order. He was a great leader, but it was his praying that brought people to greater heights in Christ. From His example we see the great necessity of prayer, and how valuable it is in the life and work of the minister of the gospel.

How haughty and high minded prayerless pastors truly are. We actually believe that souls can be converted by our eloquent sermons alone. We actually think that believers will be inspired to greater heights of faith and fruitfulness because of our well organized programs and exceptional leadership abilities. “Not true!” you say? But that is exactly what we demonstrate by our lack of prayer. We are telling God that we don’t need Him. Paul may have needed His anointing to bless his efforts, but not us. We don’t need God to do it, we can do it on our own. If we needed God’s help, surely we would pray, we would fast, we would lay prostrate as Paul did—praying always and not ceasing to make mention of them in our prayers.

Evangelist Sammy Tippit wrote, “The great need of the hour is that pulpits throughout this land might be filled with humble, holy, praying men. A prayerless pulpit produces a powerless people: powerless to overcome troubling sins, powerless to change the culture, powerless to give witness of their great Savior.” Indeed, if Paul, the greatest spiritual leader and teacher of truth relied on prayer to make his ministry effective, how much more should we humble ourselves and cry out to God for His blessing.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 4:8-36, “30 But the child’s mother said, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her”</strong>

There is a song by Jim Reeves I loved to listen to in my teenage years with this line in the chorus, “<em>It is no secret what God can do, What he has done for others, He'll do for you…”</em>. While there is such great truths in this line, there is a piece I would add if I had a chance to, “…<em>but you need to know what others have done to be blessed and you do the same to be blessed</em>”. I think it is easy to want what others have without desiring to labor like the way they did to have what they have. It was a great pianist who played a master piece and someone came to him afterwards and said, “<em>I would give everything to play like you</em>”, to which the pianist responded, “<em>I have given everything to play like me”.<!--more--></em>

One of the most fascinating stories I cherish in the bible is the story of the Shunammite woman. We may love the story and the outcome, but would we want the process like she did? We all love results, the question is, would we want to endure the process? I am the first to admit that while I hate processes, I sure love outcomes.

If you know this story, you recall she had a child out of a promise from Elisha due to the kindness she showed Elisha and his servant<strong>. </strong>Then something happened, <strong>Vs. "18 And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. 19 And he said to his father, “My head, my head!”</strong>. Everything looked perfect from the time he was a baby until now. Even though we are not told of his age, I would speculate that he was a teenager for he appears to be old enough to go to the field with his father to the reapers. He is also old enough to say what is troubling him. On this day, he cried "my head" and his father had one of his servants do something, “<strong>…So he said to a servant, “Carry him to his mother.” </strong>From the past experience, maybe the husband knew his wife well enough to know what to do.

<strong>Vs. "20 When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died”. </strong>Out of her great affection, she took him on her knees, and laid his head in her bosom to sooth the pain, and in this posture he continued until the middle of the day before he passed. All the mother's tenderness could not keep alive a child of promise. I think this is where many parents especially the mothers are. The children they hoped for, labored to show love and tender care, battled and provided for all of a sudden is (are) dead (spiritually) on their laps and they do not know what else to do. She hoped someone would give her answers, however she discovered she was left to figure things out. If anything, they always expected her to have answers. She was the one considered the woman of faith.

From this story and many others in the bible, there is something about a mother’s love that is unique. Being a mother is a very important role that the Lord chooses to give to many women. A Christian mother is told to love her children (<a href="http://ebible.com/query?utf=8%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Titus%202%3A4-5&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=http://www.gotquestions.org/eBible.html">Titus 2:4-5</a>), in part so that she does not bring reproach on the Lord and on the Savior whose name she bears. Mothers have a unique and crucial role in the lives of their children because of their intuition, strength, persistence etc. Many times you hear about a persistent praying mother or praying grandmother. We will see these qualities in the Shunammite woman in our next devotional. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>1Samuel 17:36-37, “36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. 37 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee” </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Growing up, I lived about fifteen minutes away from a Seeing Eye dog training center called Guiding Eyes for the Blind. Now certain dogs are being trained to one day be prepared to serve as “eyes” for a blind person. Of course the dog doesn’t know this while it is going through the training, but one day it will walk in its purpose. Have you ever experienced a season of difficult times, unknown times, unsure times, whereby you truly did not realize at the time why you were going through the situation that you found yourself in?<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">David was a shepherd tending his flock in the field. One day David would be summoned to meet with the prophet Samuel who would anoint David as King of Israel. After David is anointed King, although at this time he is truly a king, he is a king without a kingdom at this time (<strong>Genesis 16</strong>), David volunteers to step up to the challenge of facing the Philistine Champion Goliath. What was it about David that cause him to believe that he could actually defeat, not just step up to the challenge, Goliath? David had a perception of his preparation. David thought back to the times that vicious animals attacked his sheep, and David recalled how God delivered him out of the paws of those that attacked his sheep. Once again even though David is a king without a kingdom at this time, David perceived that God was preparing him to defeat Goliath as He did back when David was fighting in the field protecting his sheep. Like a ferocious animal with sharp paws attacking David’s sheep, so was Goliath with a sharp sword attacking the sheep (Israel). David would become the under-shepherd (the shepherd, under the Shepherd [God]), but would David fight for Israel? David didn’t realize until it was time to volunteer for the challenge against Goliath, that God had prepared him in times past for present and future battles and challenges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Are you facing something at this time that you feel that you cannot accomplish? If you believe that, you are right, you can’t accomplish it, or can anything work alone. Jesus said, “<strong>apart from Me you can do nothing (John 15).</strong>” Notice that even David fought, it was God who delivered. Saul said to David, “<strong>You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you<em> are</em> a youth, and he a man of war from his youth</strong>.” Saul had man’s perception in mind, while David had a godly perception knowing God prepared him for such a time as this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What giant are you facing or about to face in your life? Can you like David look back in your life and have a perception of preparation for what lays ahead of you? God has brought you through so much, can He not bring you through whatever you are facing or about to face. Why not take time to write down some of the major battles God has brought you through and thank Him for those times. Then write down those battles you are facing or know you are about to face and thank God He also has the same power to bring you through them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>1Samuel 17:38-40, “38 So Saul clothed David with his armor, and he put a bronze helmet on his head; he also clothed him with a coat of mail. 39 David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested them.” So David took them off. 40 Then he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag, in a pouch which he had, and his sling was in his hand”</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">My wife and I went to a marriage retreat one year where the speaker shared a story from his marriage about how he cut carrots verses how his wife cut carrots. Whenever he would see his wife cutting carrots he would correct her, and instruct her to cut the carrots his way. She would do it for a time although feeling uncomfortable doing it his way. When he left the room, she usually returned to the way that she initially was cutting the carrots.<!--more--> There are certainly times that one will tell another how to do something based how the first one has always done it. Looking throughout Scripture, how should one fight a battle, walk around a wall seven times (if one is present), fight with 300 men only, or sling stones at the enemies head? There were numerous battles in Scripture, and each army won the battle in a different way. Joshua marched around the Jericho walls, Gideon fought with 300 men, and of course David would slay Goliath with a sling and stone. There were different tactics used to bring about victory, but each victory was the battle plan by God’s as the leader and God gave the victory. The only times Israel lost battle is when they did not go according to God’s plans, or because there was sin in the camp. How should one fight a battle?</p>
<p dir="ltr">When David convinced Saul and the others that he would fight Goliath in battle, Saul began to suit David up in Saul’s armor. However when David tried to walk he couldn’t move well in them.<em> “The king’s tunic and armor would have been very distinctive. If David went out dressed in them, many would have thought that the king himself was going out. Perhaps such a misidentification would have seemed attractive to Saul, who had been sought out by the Israelites to lead them forth in battle. In the Iliad a similar switch occurred when Patroclus went out in the armor of Achilles, hoping to intimidate the Trojans. David’s refusal would have reflected his recognition that without being trained on how to use the armor and weapons to his advantage, they would become a detriment</em> (The IVP Bible background commentary : Old Testament).”</p>
<p dir="ltr">David chose to wear what he knew and fight with a weapon that he was familiar with. The sling was used in organized warfare therefore Goliath should have known its deadly potential. David perceived that if he used this weapon in the past, he could fight with it now. There are many that we can learn from, but God has uniquely wired each of so differently. We must be wise about putting on Saul’s armor. Battles are won and lost based on yielding ourselves to God. Look back to the battles you have won, and you too will acknowledge God’s hand brought the victory. If you trusted Him in times past, can you not trust Him now? Remember Paul’s words,<strong> “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to<em> His</em> purpose,</strong>” and thank God right now.” Let God prepare you in His way, and respond obediently, and see God will never let you down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 4:8-36, “30 But the child’s mother said, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her”</strong>

In the midst of her loss and pain, she gathered courage and strength to do something about her situation. <strong>vs., "21 she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out, 22 Then she called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.”

<!--more-->

</strong>

Such confidence had she of God's goodness that she was ready to believe that He would restore what He had now taken away. O woman, great is thy faith! He that gave life would not disappoint. The sorrowful mother begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet at once. There was a drive, a passion, a burden for her once upon a time living child. Her faith perhaps was driven by the testimony of how Elijah raised the widow of Zarephath's son (<strong>1Kings 17)</strong> who was laid on his bed, of which she may have heard. The Zarephath’s son was raised in Elijah’s room and since the spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha, she had faith to believe that a miracle that happened before could happen to her too. So she took the boy put him in Elisha’s room and journeyed to find him while concealing his death from her husband and family, and to prevent grief, and that they might not bury him until she returned.

She had faith and that faith was demonstrated in her action. Those who would convey spiritual life to dead souls must feel deeply for their case, and labor fervently in prayer for them especially for their children. Though parents, ministers cannot give Divine life to children, they must use every means, <strong>with as much earnestness as if they could do so.</strong>

Nothing was going to stop her or slow her down. <strong>Vs. "25 And so she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, the Shunammite woman! 26 Please run now to meet her, and say to her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?’” And she answered, “It is well.”</strong> It was well that she had found the man of God; and it is well with us when we have found Him who is able to raise our children when we seek Him on their behalf. It is not well only when the miracle happens, it is well when we have done our part. God will do for us what He has done for others, however we have to find what others have done like this woman and engage in that because it builds our faith to believe God.

Despite Elisha sending his servant with his stuff, nothing could change the situation until Elisha came. I love something about this woman, persistence, she says,<strong> vs. "30 As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her”. </strong>We must continue laboring in prayer persistently until the Lord shows up in the impossible situation. Many have given up and now have a shovel in the hands preparing for the burial of their prodigals. <strong>If you believe in resurrection the last thing you would want is prepare for burial.</strong>

The rest of the story tells us how Elisha came and raised the boy because of a mother’s faith and persistence. Imagine what would have happened if she did not seek resurrection for her son? She and her family would have buried the boy. Don’t bury the dead yet, why? “<strong>By this faith women received their dead raised to life",</strong> <strong>Hebrews 11:35.</strong> <strong>Faith in God activated through prayer does not prepare for funeral, it prepares for resurrection</strong>. Therefore put the shovel back, stop pondering on what you could have done better and seek Him for the resurrection for your prodigals. Blessings, Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>1Samuel 17:45 – 46, “Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 46 This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Have you ever looked back at your life and saw that God’s divine handprint was upon the battles that you faced? As we mature in the Lord we begin to discover that God is truly the One that is winning and bringing the victory. Even though you look back and see victory in your life, did you see victory when you were in the midst of battle? I’ve heard it said that hindsight is 20/20, meaning that we seem to see so clearly when looking back but not as clearly when we are going through something, because we are in the midst of a situation. Are you able to use the situations that God has brought you through as a springboard to propel you on to future victories?<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">David remembered that the Lord God had delivered him from the lion and the bear when he battled with them for the sake of his sheep. Now David is using his perception of preparation to give him courage to not just talk about facing Goliath, but actually engaging him in battle. The weapons of Goliath were sword, spear, and javelin. Goliath didn’t even hold his shield in hand because his armor bearer was holding it for him. Perhaps Goliath felt that he had no need to hold a shield for protection. David proclaimed that although Goliath came to him with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin, David was coming to Goliath in the name of the Lord of hosts. David didn’t even mention his weapons: his staff, his sling and the rocks.<strong> Deuteronomy 33:29</strong> states, “<strong>The LORD is your saving shield, and his sword is your glory. Your enemies fawn upon you, as you stride upon their heights.”</strong> Does this not describe the faceoff between David and Goliath? The enemy mocked him, mocked his weapons, but Goliath couldn’t see that David had a sword and shield in the Lord. David’s offense and defense was the Lord Himself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">David not only killed Goliath but cut off Goliaths head with Goliath’s own sword. By challenging God’s people Israel, the Philistines were in effect challenging the Lord Himself, and the Lord would have the victory enveloping the natural (sling and sword) in the supernatural. “<strong>Who<em> is</em> this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, The Lord mighty in battle”, Psalm 24:8.</strong> David’s perception of preparation wrought him the victory by the Hand of the Lord. Paul wrote, “<strong>4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, 6 and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled”, 2Corinthians 10:4-6.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">When you are in battle, trust in the Lord who has a track record of victory every time He engages in battle. You may be fighting in the natural, but the Lord is your glorious sword and shield in the supernatural. Be encouraged today that you are on the Lord’s side and keep your perception of preparation focused on the Lord of Hosts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 14:28-30, vs. 28 “Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water. 29 So He said, “Come.” And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus 30 But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”</strong>

Peter had the idea to walk on the water with His Lord. Christ blessed Peter's faith in Him, and Peter walked as long as he kept his eyes and faith on Christ. However Peter began to look upon the waves instead of Christ. We are to keep our eyes FIXED upon Jesus the author and perfecter of our faith (<strong>Hebrews 12:2</strong>).

<!--more-->

He is a fixture, unmovable which we must keep our gaze upon, or we will sink into things that the Lord stands above, and wants us to stand above. Our gaze upon Him causes us to stand above things dealing with money, sexuality, friendships, work, discipline, family issues, relationships, spiritual disciplines, etc...

Wuerst states, <em>"He uses Him as the supreme example to which his readers should look as they run life’s race. The word “looking” is aphorao (ἀφοραο) “to turn the eyes away from other things and fix them on something.”</em> The word also means “to turn one’s mind to a certain thing.” Both meanings are applicable here, the spiritual vision turned away from all else and together with the mind, concentrated on Jesus. What a lesson in Christian running technique we have in that little preposition “off, away from,” which is prefixed to this verb. The minute the Greek runner in the stadium takes his attention away from the race course and the goal to which he is speeding, and turns it upon the on looking crowds, his speed is slackened. It is so with the Christian. The minute he takes his eyes off of the Lord Jesus, and turns them upon others, his pace in the Christian life is slackened, and his onward progress in grace hindered. Messiah is called the author of our faith.

Keep your eyes on the prize which is Christ, the One who will take His own to the finish line Christ is the archegon (ἀρχεγον), the chief leader of this faith in that <em>He “furnished the perfect development, the supreme example of faith, and in virtue of this He is the leader of the whole believing host of all time”, </em>meditate on the chorus of this hymn<em>, “Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace”. </em>blessings Pastor Phil.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Samuel 7:8, "Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people Israel”</strong>

God has a unique way of reminding us how He called us and raised us up for His purposes. God speaks through Nathan the prophet to David and he begins by reminding David of where God found him: <strong>“I took you from the pasture and from following [tending] the flock.</strong>” Who knew David in the pasture? His influence spread as far as his last sheep at that time. David was learning character and how to lead others (at that time sheep). However, although God makes correlations between sheep and people, they are obviously not exactly the same, as you and I are made in God’s image. God was reminding David how far he had come from.<!--more-->

Samuel was to choose a king from among Jessie’s sons and passed by each one realizing that they were not the one that God had chosen. The Lord had said to Samuel, “<strong>Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature;…for the Lord sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.</strong>” Samuel asked Jessie if he had called all of his Sons, but there was still one more in the field seemingly unaware of what was taking place at his home. David was faithfully tending his sheep and God would call David from the pasture to the palace, from shepherding sheep, to shepherding God’s people. David didn’t fill out an application and interview for the position of a king. God looked and God simply choose him. Why does it seem that God chose him? I love the lyrics of one of Christian artist Carmen’s song, “<em>When others see a shepherd boy God may see a king.</em>” At this time God did in fact see a king, and a great one at that. God didn’t call David initially because he was a great military leader, but because he was faithful in the small things. He took care of the little that was entrusted to him, his sheep, and since he was faithful in the small God would raise him up to be faithful of much. What would happen to David’s sheep if he left to be king? God has a unique way of working things out as Paul said in <strong>Romans 8:28, “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”</strong> Perhaps God would send another person to care for the sheep David loved. God would now use David to be a King after God’s own heart, and that is a heart that David seemed to have beating in his life from the pasture to the palace. From pasture to palace teaches us that:

1. God has not forgotten about you “in some shepherd’s field”

2. God chooses whosoever He desires

3. God’s choices are not based on man’s outward assessment of a person

4. God is looking at how faithful we are in what He has currently given to us

5. God will send a “Samuel” to confirm your call (others will see your call)

6. God anoints people for His ministry

Application: What is God calling you to do? In what way is he raising you up? Are you being faithful at the little things, so that he can trust you with greater things, or trying to claw our way to the top? Your talent may take you to the top but only your character will keep you there. Be faithful in your pasture (that which He has entrusted to you) so that God can place you in his way, and in His time in the palace He has for you. Your family, friends, co-workers, boss, etc.., need to see a shining testimony of you being faithful in the little things. Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Daniel 3:17&amp;18, "If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up".</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There is an ongoing war between Relative and Absolute statements. We get caught up in the middle many times. Let’s tackle a few questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First question,<strong> "What do you believe</strong>?" This question is broad until you add more words to it to identify what the question is specifically targeting. <strong>Can we say that facts can negate beliefs? </strong>of course we can. If I was to say that trucks don't kill, I would have to be 100% sure as a fact, that would be considered an absolute statement, in this case this statement is not true. We all know that trucks can kill so my belief that it cannot will not affect or change facts.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego were in a place where they had to choose between two kingdoms. They were to serve and obey one of the kingdoms. In the earlier chapters we are told of these four young men brought to the land of Babylon to serve. They knew their God all this time but coming to this land, they were faced by new challenges, they had to rely on God to bring them through and He did. We can tell that these men had a God whom they believed in, the God of truth.<strong> Job tells us that He knows his Redeemer lives (Job 19:25), Paul says in 2Timothy 1:12, "...I know whom I have believed.</strong>" All these men believed because they knew who their God was (is).</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you know what you believe, you should be able to answer this question, "<strong>Why do you believe what you believe?</strong> Some people, have no idea why they believe what they believe. I would say that one of the reasons is because it's easy to create what you want to believe in and stick with it without proper reason. A Christian should know why he believes partially because the bible says in<strong> 1Peter 3:15, "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you..."</strong> I need to know why I believe when asked and have an answer. Why did these men believe in God? We can tell that through the miracles God had done in their lives. God had seen them through all their life and being in that nation, they knew that they had been sent there by God to serve. As the bible says, "<strong>Their footsteps were ordered by God</strong>". These were men who did not just hear about it, they experienced it causing them to move from<strong> the realm of belief to the realm of experience, Psalm 34:8, "O taste and see that the Lord is good...</strong>"</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another vital question, "<strong>Where do you get your back up from?"</strong> Anyone who is going to defend what they believe should have at least some backup. Talk to many people and discover they believe in some things they can't back up, they don't have a source of authority to fall back on. If I am going to believe in the word of God to which I am, I will always have His word as my backup.<strong> 2Timothy 3:16&amp;17, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profited for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works".</strong> We Christians ought to defend what we believe through the Holy Scriptures for it ties to who we believe in. The scripture is God Himself revealed through the word,<strong> John 1:1, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God". So it's no longer what I have created to believe in but what I have tested and tasted to believe in the word</strong>. The word may reveal things I don't like about myself but I know that it's the truth for I have tested it. I believe in the law of gravity for I have tested it, there are things I haven’t tested but because I have seen it work in someone's life, that is evidence; proof.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last but not least,<strong> "Would you be willing to die for what you believe?"</strong> This is tough but true. Jesus died for what He believed and in that He would redeem mankind. Back in 99 at Columbine high school, a girl died because of her faith. With a gun pointed at her, she was asked if she believed in God, and her answer was YES, that cost her life. Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego, were men ready to die for the sake of truth.<strong> THEY WERE MEN STANDING FOR SOMETHING SO AS NOT TO FALL FOR ANYTHING</strong>. They had counted the cost, why? because they believed, they knew why, they had back up, proof, and were willing to die for it. They knew that this was the truth and no one could take away from them. They understood that<strong> "to be absent in the body is to be present with the Lord.</strong>" They were very aware of their outcome unless the Lord miraculously delivered them. They were determined for God to receive glory whether in His deliverance or in their death. Therefore when they were faced by a situation that required them to go against what they believed, they said<strong> Daniel 3:17&amp;18, "If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up".</strong> This is a very bold statement, "<strong>we know our God will but if not, we will not"</strong> Be ready always, Blessings Evans</p>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>1Peter 3:15, says “15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, AND ALWAYS BE READY to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;” </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">One day, two JW’s (Jehovah witnesses) visited our home. My wife and I  gave them an opportunity to share about their faith and why they believe what they believe. After they were done, having known some of their positions especially on who Jesus is, we took time to ask them tough questions about their worldview and in that process also shared the gospel with them. We now pray that the Holy Spirit will awaken them, convict them and lead them to the true light.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">I often ask people these two questions,<strong> “what do you believe”</strong> and “<strong>why do you believe what you believe</strong>”. People often don't know how to answe these questions--I was no different a few years back.<strong> 1Peter 3:15, says “15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, AND ALWAYS BE READY to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;” </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The use of "defense" in<strong> 1Peter 3:15</strong> is general: Whether formally in an official setting or informally to anyone who might inquire, a believer is to be ready to provide an answer. That answer is about "<strong>the hope that is in you</strong>," which is the Christian faith. Believers should be able to give a rational explanation of their salvation and Christian faith. If you can’t stand for something, it will be easy to fall for anything. We have to be the ones to influence because we have the truth or else we will be influenced which will draw us away from the truth.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mark 13:22 and Matthew 24:24, 22, says “For false christs and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 23 But take heed; see, I have told you all things beforehand.”</strong> What is interesting is that, we will run into people who are in cults who will seem to speak the same language as we do, use the same words and even feel like they are one of us. It’s in the probing that you find that you mean different things. For example we could all say we know John but the moment we begin to describe the John we are talking about, we discover they are not the same. That is why you as a believer ought to be ready with God’s word to know what you believe, why, and be able to defend your belief. Mark and Matthew tell us that “false christs … will rise,” we don’t have to wait for them to arise, they are already here proclaimed by others, it’s the christ not revealed in the Holy Scriptures. Paul fireproofed his son in the faith Timothy by admonishing him with this words,<strong> 2Timothy 2:15, “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF TRUTH”.</strong> Timothy was going to be faced by people who preached another gospel that appeared real. Paul even mentioned two of those people in this chapter. He told Timothy “<strong>rightly divide the word of truth</strong>” which is an indication of some who will come and wrongly bisect God’s word making it appear real. Timothy was to be ready at all times to defend the faith.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1Corinthians 3:11, “For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ”</strong>. We must truly know this foundation and build our lives on it. We must also know those who pervert this foundation and not embrace all who name the name of Christ in talking of false christs.<strong> 2Timothy 2:19, “…the solid foundation of God stands”,</strong> this is the true foundation that cannot be shaken, the foundation to bring other’s too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If someone was to come to you and ask you about what you believe and why you believe what you believe, are you ready to fulfill<strong> 1Peter 3:15</strong>? Let us be ready, let God’s word fireproof us for the coming days to not be deceived. In addition, let’s not shy away from those of other faith, they need to hear the truth. God’s truth will set them free from all lies of the enemy<strong> John 8:32</strong>. blessings Ev</p>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jeremiah 29:11, “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD”</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There are times when we find ourselves in the midst of some kind of a desert, a sea or a storm. In times as these, we as Christian begin to question God. We ask questions like," How could you let this happen to me if you love me?" When we are faced with situations like these, there are scriptures from the bible that help us understand God's plan for our lives.<!--more--></p>
There are 3 stories in the bible that are different, yet they speak the same truth to us. If you look at the story of the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the story of Abraham, and the story of David, what do they have in common? They are stories of promise, stories of what God promised to do. In Exodus, God had promised to deliver the Israelites. In Abraham's story, God had told him to leave his land and go to the place where he would show him. He also promised to give him a son. In David's story, God promised to make him King. The other thing that is common with these stories is that all the promises came at a much later time than what was anticipated by the recipients. Another similarity is that between the promise and the fulfillment of the promise, the recipients endured tough times, temptations, hardships, and at certain times gave up, wanting to look back, or wanting to take short cuts. When the Israelites were in the desert, things were so bad that they said to Moses, "We were better off in Egypt than here. Forget the promised Land and lead us back to Egypt." When David was anointed King, He was constantly pursued by Saul. He was constantly fleeing and most times weary. When Abraham saw that his promise was not being fulfilled, he got impatient and took a short cut by sleeping with his maid.

Today, God has promised us good things. He has promised to bless us.<strong> Jeremiah 29:11 say that "for I know the plans I have for you..."</strong> Our Destiny was already ordained by God before we were even born. He says, "<strong>before you were born I knew you</strong>.." This is the trick though, God never explains the process of how He is going to bless you. He doesn't explain every step that you will go through, the tough times, the temptations and the hardships. He knows that if He lets you take a glimpse at the process, you will never take a step towards your destiny. If God had told the Israelites that they would wander in the desert for 40 years and struggle the way they did, they would have never left Egypt. If David Knew that he would be a target of Saul, he would have chosen not to be King. If Abraham knew the problems he would face when he left his home, he would have never left. The reason why the Bible calls these men "The warriors of faith" is because no matter what they went through, no matter what the situation was, no matter how bad things were, they only had one thing going for them FAITH. They believed God. They never looked back at where they had come from. Going back was never an option.<strong> They realized that it was not by might, not by power, but by His spirit</strong>. Today we can learn from these men. God has given us promises. He has plans for us. A lot of times<strong> He shows us the promise, but He doesn't tell us the process</strong>. He may have promised you a good job, but He will not let you know that maybe at some point you will have to leave your current place, either voluntarily or otherwise and go through some financial struggles. He may have promised you a ministry, but He won’t let you know that maybe you will suffer some setbacks. He may have promised you a good husband or wife, but He won’t let you know that there are times that things will be so bad between you and your partner, big fights, even break ups. It is up to us to say, "<strong>Lord, you promised, and I will stay faithful until it comes to pass. No matter what I go through, no matter how rough it is, no matter how much I want to give up, help me keep the faith</strong>". Paul says,<strong> "I have fought a good fight, I have ran the race, I have kept the faith, and now I await the crown."</strong>
<p dir="ltr">No matter what the situation is, we should remember that nothing can separate us from the love of God. Neither death, nor principalities nor trials and tribulations. When he has tried us, we shall come forth as gold. Blessings Jimmy</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Matthew 25:34, "Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."</strong></p>
It's nice to be rewarded for a job well done. Who doesn't appreciate a promotion, a raise, a bonus, to show recognition for the work ethic and value that one has established? The one that does the promoting is the supervisor, the boss, the "head honcho." In this verse the King tells speaks a blessing to the sheep which he places on His right, which is the position of blessing.<!--more-->

The previous verses speak of Christ's return in glory with His holy angels. “<strong>He shall sit upon the throne of His glory: And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left” </strong>
<p dir="ltr">It is the King who is inviting those sheep (God's people) to inherit the blessing. What was the criterion for those that inherit the blessing, because the goats (the false converts) do not inherit the blessing?</p>
1. One must live in divine order "<strong>Then the King say unto them on His right hand, Come".</strong> When one proclaims that one is a Christian it is assumed that there is a declaration of allegiance to Christ. A Christian means a follower of Christ. He is our "head honcho" that goes before us, He is in charge and you and I are not. Who looks like the leader of your life, you or Jesus? Examine your priorities: How do you spend your time, does it speak divine authority? Does your TV get more of you than Jesus? Are your finances used more to build His Kingdom or yours? Do the gifts God gave you bring about your glory or His?

2. The inheritance is actualized "<strong>Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you</strong>". Esau was the firstborn of Isaac and therefore he had the birthright to the blessing of his father. Unfortunately he sold his birthright to his manipulating brother Jacob. Although he had the right of the firstborn, he did not value it over a small bowl of soup. Esau lost his birthright and consequently his blessing because he did not want the birthright. He despised it. Genesis 27:27-30 are the words of blessing spoken over Jacob. Beyond the words, one day Jacob would receive the inheritance of his father that was spoken over him. Like Jacob we were once deceivers, manipulators, but while we were yet sinners Christ died for us, and upon our repentance toward God and faith toward Jesus Christ our sin debt was paid for and we became children of the King. Paul writes, "<strong>Now if we are children, then we are heirs-heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory (Rom 8:17</strong>)."

3. God's Kingdom will become our Kingdom! "...<strong>the Kingdom prepared for you</strong>." There are only two kingdoms, the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of darkness. When the King does the separating of His sheep from the goats, the sheep will enter into the Kingdom that has been prepared for them from the foundation of the world.

Are you living in divine order? Do you realize that you if you are His sheep that you are an heir of the Kingdom of God, and that His Kingdom will one day be your Kingdom and "<strong>we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is</strong>," and worship for all eternity? "<strong>Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as He is pure (1 John 3:2-3)."</strong> Until the nets are filled...Blessing, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>John 15:5, "I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.”</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5960" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image.jpg?w=280" alt="image" width="280" height="300" /></a> </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This account takes place after the disciples had spent three years with Jesus just prior to going to the cross. Jesus is the Vine and Christians are the branches which gives us a picture of the relationship He desires us to understand. You see Jesus wants a flourishing family. He could have picked up anything to illustrate His heart, like a sword, a bucket of water, but His chose grapes as His illustration. Being hours from His death, Jesus wanted to leave a graphic picture of what He desired to come forth from the lives of the disciples, and that was fruit. Christ desired to have His character developed in His followers, and for those followers to be fishers of men.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">Jesus said that “<strong>If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit</strong>.” To bear Godly fruit one must be connected to God. One cannot produce Godly fruit any other way. God created us to be fruit bearing, and not barren branches. Consider the words by Christian song artist Rebecca St. James in her song “Me Without You<em>.” Like a band without a drummer, That's me without you. Like a year without a summer, That's me without you. Like a king without a country. Like a room without a view; Like an empty gun, Like a fatherless son, That's me without you, Like a ship without a rudder, That's me without you; Like a child without a mother, That's me without you; Like a story with no ending, Like a foot without a shoe; Like a wasted feast, Like a faithless priest; That's me without you, Chorus: Me without you, A pitiful sight, Me without you, It ain't never gonna feel right… Like a war without an enemy, That's me without you; A disease without a remedy, That's me without you; Like a crime without a victim, Like a sleuth without a clue; Like an empty gun, Like a fatherless son, That's me without you, Without you...</em> Repeat</p>
<p dir="ltr">Do you feel hopeless and helpless without Christ? Do you feel that you can truly live apart from Him? He is my only bridge to heaven. <strong>Ephesians 4:23-24 that you are “to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness</strong>…" Do you see you truly can’t put on the Lord Jesus Christ and separate yourself from Him? We need Christ as bad as someone jumping out of an airplane needs a parachute.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Consider this as well. Two men are seated on a plane. The first is given a parachute and told to put it on as it would improve his flight. He’s a little skeptical at first, since he can’t see how wearing a parachute on a plane could possibly improve his flight. He experiments to see if the claims are true. As he puts it on, he notices the weight of it upon his shoulders and he finds he has difficulty in sitting upright. However, he consoles himself with the fact he was told that the parachute would improve his flight. So he decides to give it a little time. As he waits he notices that some of the other passengers are laughing at him for wearing a parachute on a plane. He begins to feel somewhat humiliated. As they continue to point and laugh at him, he can stand it no longer. He slinks in his seat, unstraps the parachute and throws it to the floor. Disillusionment and bitterness fill his heart, because as far as he was concerned he was told an outright lie. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The second man is given a parachute, but listen to what he is told. He’s told to put it on because at any moment he’ll be jumping 25,000 feet out of the plane. He gratefully puts the parachute on. He doesn’t notice the weight of it upon his shoulders, nor that he can’t sit upright. His mind is consumed with the thought of what would happen to him if he jumped without the parachute. Instead of preaching, or thinking that Jesus improves the flight, we should be warning sinners and being aware that all will jump out of the plane.</em><strong><em> “It’s appointed for man to die once and then face judgment (Hebrews 9:27</em></strong><em>). </em><strong><em>The issue isn’t one of happiness, but one of righteousness”,</em></strong> Ray Comfort<em>.</em> Can you really live apart from Christ and have a fruitful life of righteousness, or have you accepted His words, “Apart from me you can do nothing?”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Application: Think about it. </strong></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Joshua 24:15, "But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD." </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Joshua was calling Israel to honesty and commitment. He wanted them to have one heart focus. He desired to see his people fear God and serve Him with an undivided heart.<strong> James 1:8 tells us that "a double-minded man is unstable in all he does"</strong> Joshua wanted stable committed followers, not those who jumped on the bandwagon. Joshua desired Israel therefore to make a declaration of allegiance to the Lord in his midst.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">He stared by saying<strong> "If it seem evil to you to serve the Lord".</strong> He basically asked them, if you think that it is a waste of time, undesirable, unfulfilling, unworthy, or too hard then speak up now to who will be your god. Joshua was not condoning nor encouraging idolatry, but rather explaining that all must serve something as their god. It is innate that we worship something; the only question is who or who. Joshua drew the line in the sand of commitment, and allowed them the opportunity to which side they would stand on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is why the US military has boot camp, to weed or sift out the uncommitted, unfit ones. Titus explained it this way "<strong>They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny Him</strong>". They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good. Joshua didn’t want a bunch of half-hearted followers, and neither does God.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Look at Joshua’s declarative statement. Here is a man that is focused, and committed, and a leader not only among Israel, but also he takes seriously his role as the spiritual priest of his home (family). He declares, "<strong>But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord".</strong> Notice he doesn’t say we might serve the Lord, we will try and serve the Lord, or even we will probable, we intend, to follow the Lord. No he stakes his claim and he stands strong upon his statement. We read nothing of a family discussion on the matter, he didn’t appear to take family votes on this issue - NO! Joshua knew that the spiritual direction and atmosphere of his family was his responsibility.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, in this day and age, there are too many husband and fathers that don’t take their priestly role seriously. They let their kids decide If they want to go to church. They don’t have daily devotions with their wives or children. Many church attending parents rely on the Sunday school teacher or Children’s Pastor to be the only teacher of the kids on the truths of the Lord. I know this because I was a Children’s Pastor for four years. Do your children have a say on what they want to eat or not? Then why do we allow our kids to choose if they want to spiritually eat or not. The state would have parents behind bars if they did not feed their children, yet many allow their families to spiritually starve and spiritually die. Many wives and children are not being spiritually nourished at home. Why is this? Husbands are too busy to take their family responsibility seriously. Exodus 4:24 states At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met Moses and was about to kill him! "<strong>Because Moses didn’t circumcise his children, God was going to kill Moses</strong>. Joshua was leading a huge number of people; he had taken over for Moses. He filled some pretty big shoes, so much so that God constantly told him,<strong> "Be strong and courageous</strong>" Joshua was the leader of a whole nation, yet he made it his business to lead his family faithfully in the thing of God.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Application: How committed to the Lord are you? If you are single and not committed what makes you think you can lead a family spiritually? If you are married, are you and your household (family) following the Lord, because of your leadership? If you are leading well, be encouraged, "Lead On!"</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blessings,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pastor Phil</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>John 1:14, "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth"</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In the world , there is a constant search for "truth".<strong> Somebody said, there is nothing as powerful as "truth</strong>", I agree. If it's that powerful and has such a great weight, why has it been soiled? In courts we hear,<strong> "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth,</strong>" but many of the testimonies are a pack of lies as they discover later. Don't we all hate dealing with liars? what they say, it's hard to extract some truth. Their lies may appear to be truth. Liars can never be trusted and we all know that.<strong> Standing for the truth may often times call for you to stand alone</strong>. <!--more-->To be honest, facing the truth in the eye is not easy, it reveals what you don't want to see, hear or deal with. It's easier to live a lie and in denial than to live a truthful life. The only difference is a lie almost always needs another lie to cover it until it backfires. On the other hand, the truth stands without blinking, compromising or bending. In our day where people make truth what they want it to be, where will absolute truth come from? I am not married to my truth, if I find or someone points me to the scriptures to show me where I missed telling the truth, I will abandon what I embraced and embrace the truth of God’s word. This is why it’s important to study the word which goes beyond feelings and experiences we may elevate on the same level with God’s word. I have seen a lot of messes done in the name of the Lord through feelings and experiences which were contrary to the Word of God and it was embraced because someone believed God told them. We are going to have to ask ourselves some tough questions, do we want truth or do we want our ears tickled by what we want to hear.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Truth does not change its stand to accommodate your needs</strong>, either you are for it or against it. David says in<strong> Psalm 138:2, “I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your lovingkindness and Your truth; FOR YOU HAVE MAGNIFIED YOUR WORD ABOVE ALL YOUR NAME”</strong> WOW, The Lord has magnified His truthful word above His name.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>John 1:14</strong> tells us about Jesus the "Word" becoming flesh and dwelling among us. I am fascinated by the fact that Jesus had to come on the face of the earth as a Man yet not losing His status as "God". We understand that you cannot redeem what you are not related to. This is one side. Here is another side I see, in the Old testament, failing to live by the truth called for heavy punishment. And being that God never brought Himself to the level of a man to fully understand the nature of man, Jesus had to come. This is why I believe when we pray in "Jesus name", Jesus presents our case to the Father by saying something like this, "I know how it feels to be tempted, to go without, to lose someone, to be mocked etc., let my grace prevail. Therefore He sends Jesus to experience what man experiences. This is where I see a balance, the Bible says He came full of GRACE and TRUTH.<strong> If the truth had a final say in our lives, we would all be in trouble</strong>. Thank God for GRACE.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The attributes of grace are love, kindness, gentleness, patience, mercy, forgiveness, peace and joy. Righteousness, holiness, wrath, justice are all summed up in one word, truth. We need to understand that God is a God of grace but also the God of truth. If you thought grace replaced the truth, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Jesus came full of both grace and truth.<strong> In our time we teach and preach more "grace" than "truth", we can tell that grace has been taken to the extreme, denying the truth to have a say. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">It is hard to confront people with truth for fear of hurting their feelings and withdrawing. Speaking the truth may make you feel like you know it all and better than the person who is receiving it. As mentioned, Jesus had a balance on both. For instant, when He met the Samaritan woman at the well, He spoke truth and grace. Both are on different sides but work well if applied correctly.<strong> Ephesians 4:15, "but, speaking the truth in love".</strong> How easy it is to speak the truth and leave someone wounded and broken; Speaking the truth to expose without caring, speaking the truth to show you are right. Paul in writing added an element of "love" in speaking the truth. This is what I call,<strong> speaking the truth in grace. Truth should be seasoned with grace</strong>. Confronting not with an aim to destroy but to reveal then heal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Truth dwells on faults and weakness, it's more of a now thing, grace senses potential in a person, it sees far beyond the faults. The Samaritan woman had to know the truth and the truth did hurt but grace saw far beyond and gave her a chance to become what she was not. Truth sometimes might break us but then we have to follow it up with grace to heal. To continue Evans</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>John 1:14, "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth"</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Living a lie as mentioned last time is very easy and we see this many times. When Solomon was faced with his first judgment, he encountered with two prostitutes who had both given birth. Two women, two babies the only difference at the time of this meeting with the king, one baby had died as the mother laid on him and she could not live with the reality that her baby was dead. So she took all her love, passion, desire and planted it on this other woman's baby. She claimed that this other baby was hers. This is what deception is, trying to be what you are not. Trying to live a life God never designed for you. Deceiving yourself that everything is alright when in actuality it's wrong.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">God does not anoint lies so until you come clean, honest with yourself and stop deceiving yourself and other people you are not ready for progress. Trying to live someone's life the way one of the prostitutes tried to do will rob you of time you should have had to run in your own lane. Be yourself, be what God wants you to be.<strong> Your progress is not measured by someone else life.</strong> You have no competition, so why live a lie? The prodigal son could not live a lie anymore, he drank a glass of truth and realized he had a problem and sought for help. Jesus said in<strong> John 8:32, "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."</strong> I could take that verse and apply it the way it is yet how many know the truth but it has not set them free? If anything they have taken the truth and push it aside. It's in the process of knowing the truth and desiring to work truth into your life even when it's hard that the truth begins to set you free. Truth works its way through the excessive baggage's pushing through the lies in order to liberate. This is where even the true worship begins to flow<strong> John 4:23, "But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and TRUTH; ...".</strong> When truth is given an opportunity to prevail, grace follows to even the tracks.<strong> James 4:6, "God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble."</strong> Can you balance grace and truth in your life? Would you face truth in the eye even when it seems so hard? Can you come to the Lord just as you are and be real as you desire change? Let this hymn reminds us that we need to be true and real with God if we want to grow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Just as I am, without one plea,</p>
<p dir="ltr">but that thy blood was shed for me,</p>
<p dir="ltr">and that thou bidst me come to thee,</p>
<p dir="ltr">O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Just as I am, and waiting not</p>
<p dir="ltr">to rid my soul of one dark blot,</p>
<p dir="ltr">to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,</p>
<p dir="ltr">O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Just as I am, though tossed about</p>
<p dir="ltr">with many a conflict, many a doubt,</p>
<p dir="ltr">fightings and fears within, without,</p>
<p dir="ltr">O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;</p>
<p dir="ltr">sight, riches, healing of the mind,</p>
<p dir="ltr">yea, all I need in thee to find,</p>
<p dir="ltr">O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. Just as I am, thou wilt receive,</p>
<p dir="ltr">wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;</p>
<p dir="ltr">because thy promise I believe,</p>
<p dir="ltr">O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p dir="ltr">6. Just as I am, thy love unknown</p>
<p dir="ltr">hath broken every barrier down;</p>
<p dir="ltr">now, to be thine, yea thine alone,</p>
<p dir="ltr">O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blessings Ev</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>1Kings 12:6-16, “ Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. "How would you advise me to answer these people?" he asked. 7 They replied, "If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants." 8 But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. 9 He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, `Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?" 10 The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Tell these people who have said to you, `Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'--tell them, `My little finger is thicker than my father's waist. <!--more-->11 My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.' " 12 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, "Come back to me in three days." 13 The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders, 14 he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions." 15 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite. 16 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: "What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!" So the Israelites went home.”</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Who do you seek advice from? It’s interesting to note that Rehoboam went to two groups of people for advice, the elders (older men) and the young men (his contemporaries). The elders told him what he needed to hear, while the young men told him what he wanted to hear. The elders told him to grant the request of Israel, while the young men told him to lay the heavy yoke on Israel, over and above what Solomon laid upon them. Even though ultimately this was the Sovereign will of God, just like Judas the betrayer, we should be careful who we take counsel from. Each of us needs advice at times, but who do you turn to? I often advise teens not to go to other teens to help them with their problems for the most part, because their friends are going through the same things, but rather to those that are older who have gone through many of the issues that they face, just with “<strong>different clothing</strong>” if you will. So I ask who is your “advisory committee”? Do you have people close to you that can provide godly counsel to you? I have often heard it said you should always have a Paul who builds into you (an inlet), a Timothy that you are building into (an outlet), and a Barnabas to encourage you along the way. Do you have these three kinds of people in your life? The wisdom you are given from your Paul, will be passed on to your Timothy and encouraged by your Barnabas.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Application: Do you have faithful “counselors?” Are you hearing from those who tell you what you want to hear or what you need to hear? Who is your Paul, Timothy, and Barnabas?</strong> Blessings, Pastor Phil</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Galatians 2:20, "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me"</strong> I would like to share with you about the nature of regeneration, and the life that follows as described by the Apostle Paul here in his letter to the Galatians. He speaks of an experience that one must truly enter into, this is not something God forces us to do, but we willingly enter into. The KJV renders the beginning of this verse “I am”, which more directly points to something we must daily enter into. I am daily crucified with Jesus, daily I die to myself, daily I live by faith. I cannot say enough that Christianity does not consist in church attendance, nor in bible reading, not in evangelism or good deeds, not even in the sacraments, for without a true work of grace within the heart, all of those things mean nothing. I must be crucified with Him, I must enter in to His death. I must repent of my sin, I must be born again.<!--more--> The root of regeneration is ‘gene’, meaning the gene of Christ, the Holy Spirit, is planted within my heart upon my conversion, and where Christ is planted, Christ grows, But like any other living organism, that right conditions must be present. The seed must be watered and fed, it must be given plenty of sun, it must be cared for and nurtured, but above all, for the seed of Christ to grow in my life, <strong>Christ must truly be planted within me</strong>. What do we each see growing in our lives? Do we see Christ? Do we see the fruits of Godliness and holiness? Or do we see worldliness and carnal desires? Is Christ living in me, or do I still live? Paul says that the life we now live, this crucified life where I have died to myself and have ceased to live, this life where Christ now lives, not I, I live by faith, a continual, ongoing faith, whereby I offer myself wholly to God as a living sacrifice each day, desiring Him above all else, and forsaking all that I may have Him alone. This is the nature of regeneration, the nature of Christ now dwells within me, I am a new creature, desiring nothing but perfect love and devotion unto God. This is the fruit of Christ living in me, I now obey Him and live by His word. <strong>No one has to tell me to read my Bible and pray, no one has to tell me to bear fruit, for I do it naturally, in sweetest harmony with the nature of Christ now living within me.</strong> I no longer live, Christ lives. This is the life all are called to live, the door is open, one that no man can shut, will we not enter in? God is calling friends, do you hear His voice? Will you respond today, will you respond now as you read? For Reflection: I<strong>I Peter 3:10-11, Ephesians 5:26-27</strong>, In the love of Jesus Christ, Brother Benjamen

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 30:1-30, “…But David encouraged himself in the Lord”</strong>

David has just come back to Ziklag a place where he and his men’s families camped for some time. During this time, David had been anointed to be the next king while Saul was still ruling at this time. David’s reign was just around the corner, however his reign was not going to come easy. Saul was out to kill him, the philistines to who he had destroyed their champion had an issue with him and now the Amalekites had descended right into their camping site while David and his 600 men were away to team up with the Philistines to fight Israel. The Philistines did not trust David for they feared that David was in a position of turning against them while in the battle field to join the Philistine enemy. So they refused to allow him to team up with them and David and his men came back to their camping site.<!--more-->

One thing I want to point out, there is always an enemy against the people of God. Just because you are anointed and walking victoriously does not mean you are exempt from attacks from the enemy. If you defeated him once, surely enough he will leave you for a season and then come back at a later time. When Jesus was in the wilderness after being tried of the devil, the bible says that the devil left him for a SEASON. The Amalekites were David’s enemies and David had fought them before and won and therefore left him for a season. When they knew David and his men were not at home (camping site), they came in and attacked the place. We need to be on the lookout at all times, the bible says <strong>1Peter 5:8, “Be sober, be vigilant; for your adversary the devil as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour”</strong>. Mark the word, he roams like a lion, he is not the lion, Jesus Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. <strong>Isaiah 62:6</strong>, says “<strong>I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day or night”. </strong>These two verses alone show us that we have an enemy constantly checking whether we are sober and vigilant, he is also trying to see if we have watchmen on the walls. Are you well covered in these areas?

While men were absent, the enemy descended. Where are men today who are watching their camps in prayer and in the word? Majority have exposed their wives and children to danger because they are not watching their camps. If you are driving and you have your family in the car, you would not fall asleep on the wheel would you? If you did, you will have put the lives of your family in danger leave alone yours. Being married has driven me to pray more and be in the word, why, because I need my camp safe. The enemy is out to destroy my spiritual life, my marriage, my home, my ministry etc. the thought drives me to watch and pray.

Since David and his men were missing in action, the Amalekites came in and took their wives, children and possessions. They went as far as burning the entire place down, what does this remind us of the mission of the enemy,<strong> John 10:10, “The thief cometh not but for to steal, kill and destroy”. </strong>Already two of his missions have been fulfilled, he has stolen and destroyed. When David and his men came and saw everything that had happened, they wept until there was no more strength left in them. It’s ok to weep over what you’ve lost but there comes a time when we have to pronounce benediction over what we have been weeping over and take a stand, encourage ourselves in the Lord and trust God. God is bringing us from a place of being victims to place of being victors for His own glory. What the enemy meant for evil, God will turn it around for our good for His own glory. To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 30:1-30, “…But David encouraged himself in the Lord”</strong>

The challenge with life is that there are times you go through things thinking you are the only one. Then there are those times you are going through them with other people especially those who are looking up to you. In these times, you don’t need those who add more pressure to your life, but those who are there to help you ease your burden. That was not with David.
<!--more-->

Under these terrible circumstances, David’s men were so angry at him that they conspired to stone him, their leader. The bible says ”<strong>we wrestle not against flesh and blood</strong>”, <strong>Ephesians 6:12</strong>, here we see men operating in the flesh, for one second, they had forgotten how good David was a leader to them and how they had won many victories through his leadership. They even forgot that God had seen them through thick and thin. This was not the first time they were facing challenges together. I am not surprised because even today men change their views and opinion about people when something bad hits. Have you ever been blamed for something simply because you were heading it?, I can imagine David’s men beginning to blame him for their predicaments. They could have sounded something like this, “it’s your fault we are in this mess, you are the reason we lost all; you should have listened to us when we told you it wouldn’t work; I knew that one day this thing will bring disaster but you never listened to me.”

It’s very easy to yield to the accusations and be a victim of despair simply because of what men see in you at a given time. Remember that they all wept together until there was no more strength left in them. Instead of embarking on a new plan as to what to do next, his men were making decision under pressure to get rid of their leader, making the situation worse than it already was. Be careful that you do not make decisions under anger, as <strong>Anger</strong> is just one word short for <strong>Danger</strong>. Many make quick decisions while angry and they mess things up big time when they should have made it better. Calm yourself down like David and begin to encourage yourself in the Lord, strengthen yourself in the Lord, speak peace. As long as everyone is hysterical, everything comes to a dead end but the moment one begins to have a clear mind, then he is in a position to channel others in the right direction. Encourage yourself in the word, prayer and reaching out to others in the same situation as you. The more you encourage, the more you will be encouraged. The more you charge someone else’ battery, the more yours will be charged. I have come to learn that sometimes when you are in the worst shape, God sends someone your way with situations similar to yours or even worse. And they don’t come to give, they come expecting to be given. That when you are discouraged, God sends someone your way for you to encourage them.

Because David encouraged himself in the Lord, he was now in a position to encourage his men who were making decision out of anger and frustrations. <strong>You cannot give out what you don’t have within. </strong>The bible says, “<strong>Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks”</strong>, if you have abundant peace inside, you will speak peace outside; if you have abundance encouragement inside, you will speak the same. This is what I call, the outworking of the internal what David is teaching us today. When David encouraged himself and encouraged others, he was able to think through what he needs to do about their situation with a clear mind. To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 30:1-30, “…And David encouraged himself in the Lord”</strong>

There are people who may be present but not present to encourage you. That is why we always have to know who we turn to for encouragement and for strength to encourage ourselves in Him.

<strong>Psalm 27:13, “I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living” </strong>Believe me very few people will encourage you to the level you need to be encouraged. When you know what you are going through, encourage yourself in the Lord, bring back to memory the good things the Lord has done in your life before, let them be a stepping stone for what you are trusting God for. Remember someone would wish to be in your situation since theirs may be worse than yours. Don’t sit and have a pity party, speak like Paul who said, “…<strong>for I know whom I have believed and I am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day”, 2Timothy 1:12</strong>. I’m not talking about positive thinking or positive outlook; I’m talking about speaking God’s word that is able to defeat the enemy of our souls. Jesus defeated the enemy in the desert by the word.<!--more-->

After David encouraged himself, was sober and had clear mind, the bible says, <strong>vs. 7, “Then David said to Abithar the priest, Abimelech’s son, “Please bring the ephod here to me”. And Biathar brought the ephod to David. Vs. 8 So David inquired of the Lord, saying, “shall I pursue after my enemies?”</strong> It all comes back to seeking God for a new direction. <strong>Psalm 37:23</strong> tells us, <strong>“The good steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord</strong>”. “Order” is to give directions, to command; that is what we need. Seek God’s direction in what you are dealing with, it’s through seeking Him that you are led as you become obedient, wise, and have faith as you realize that without Him, you can do nothing.

David needed to know from the Lord if he could go after his enemies and if victory would accompany them. <strong>Vs. 8, “And He answered Him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all”</strong>, Amen. When God gives us an okay to go after our enemies, regardless of how the battle may look or sound one thing we need to keep in the back of our minds, we have won. It’s like you already have an “A” for an exam you are about to sit for. It may be so difficult, you may not have the answers and time may be running out. We need to remember in the back of our minds the victory is already won.

David and his men left to pursue after their enemies. Out of the 600 men, 200 men became feeble and tired on the way and couldn’t move anymore after their enemies. Don’t be discouraged when some people who were to help you fight became feeble and stopped pursuing,<strong> the battle is not ours but the Lords</strong>. In <strong>Vs. 16-19, they finally caught up with the enemy, David and his now 400 men fought the battle and won. Vs 18, “So David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives. 19 and nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons and daughter, spoil or anything which they had taken from them, David recovered all”</strong>. What a great recovery to everything from the smallest to the greatest. I could stop at the restoration however God did much more than that, He also gave them ”DOUBLE FOR TROUBLE” Vs. 15, the Amalekites did not only invade Ziklag, they invaded Philistine and Judah and they took their goods and besides that, the enemy was already rich for this was a strong army. David and his men recovered what belonged to them and took all that the enemy had gathered from Philistine and Judah and also what belonged to the enemy.

I now know that God does give us double for our trouble, more than what we have lost. They had so much that they ended up giving some to friends and relatives. How it is a blessing to be used by God to reach others after you have gone through so much. What they went through humbled them and brought them closer to one another. Though the four hundred men did not want to share what they had gathered with the two hundred left behind, David once again steps in and encourages them to share. After this episode, I would say their faith increased, they saw how their leader handles things under pressure <strong>when he turned disappointments into appointments</strong>. Some of us would not be where we are if we never had major setbacks in our lives and how God turned our disappointments into appointments. He continues to use situations to build us and bless us that we may in turn advance His kingdom for His glory. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Isaiah 26:3-6, “You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in you. Trust in the Lord for ever, for the Lord, the Lord is the Rock eternal. He humbles those who dwell on high, he lays the lofty city low; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust. Feet trample it down—the feet of the oppressed, the footsteps of the poor.”</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">What does the word steadfast mean? It means unchanging, loyal, fixed, or constant etc. Have you ever been in situations or gone through life where you felt like you were between a rock and a hard place? You felt like the ground was sinking beneath your feet? You felt like the walls of this world were closing in on you and you are panicking and feeling like running out of air? Have you ever felt like you are the only one in this world going through difficulties and challenges that you feel like no one else has any idea what it’s like? Have you ever felt like the devil was sitting right on top of you and you were suffocating and everything you do and touch is messed up, nothing is working right? I will join you in saying YES! Even us as saved Christians go through all the above but what we do after we encounter hardships and challenges of this world is what matters most. I have seen so many professed Christians cuss God and leave their faith because life did not go their way and so they feel entitled to take matters into their own hands instead of looking up to God for help and strength and understanding. And Isaiah tells us very perfectly that when we fix our eyes on God, he will keep us in his perfect peace, that no matter what is going on around us we will be intact because we trust in him.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">We need to channel our life line straight with God so that when troubles of this world come our way, we don’t lose focus, we don’t doubt. Let them find us steadfast/loyal/fixed on God and that is the one life line that the devil cannot and will not break. BUT if we have our life lines here on earth guess what? They will be broken and vanish never to be seen again. The one constant that never changes and is always there no matter what, is the mighty God we serve. When my father died 14 yrs. ago, I was turning 17 yrs. old in a month’s time, my world came crushing down. I started thinking of how our lives were basically over for me, my siblings and my mother. I did not see how we were going to survive without my dad as our major bread winner and as a father. In my eyes we were finished, very bitter and angry at the Lord for a while because before my father died we were facing a lot of hardships. Sometimes we did not even have food to put on the table, we went to bed hungry and sometimes my parents could not afford school fees and we would be home and no one really knew what was happening out there. They would see us and think we had a wonderful life but we didn’t. Anyhow, so when dad died a horrific sudden death, you bet I was angry with God but I remember my Pastor talking to me and encouraging me and something he said that I have always remembered and will was he asked me where my life line was connected. I realized then that I had my life line connected to my dad and that was not the way to go. So even though dad was never coming back I knew I would see him again and I reconnected my life line to God.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Has life been easier since then? NO, but, I thank God for the many other blessings in my life and the provision he has constantly given us at his perfect timing. When I see how far we as a family have come there is no way we would have made it if it wasn’t for a higher power which is God. So when life throws a curve ball at me, I know even if I’m hit, I find my strength in the Lord for<strong> Luke 10:19 “I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.”</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I would therefore encourage you with this, be steadfast in the Lord, don’t be lukewarm or like a chameleon (changes color depending on the surrounding) that when life is good that’s when you praise God and when life is going down the drain you cuss God and leave him. Let’s take a stand and I kid you not if you choose the Lord’s side, you will never be disappointed. So I leave you with this<strong> Psalm 37:7, “Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes<em>.”</em></strong> And remember, unlike parents, God will not give you what you want just because you throw a temper tantrum, no, he does not work that way! Have a temper tantrum free day. Blessings Judy Olang</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Revelation 22:1-21, "And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give everyone according to has work"</b>

We are living in the end times believe it or not. A man by the name of Harold Camping confidently predicted the Second Coming of the Lord on May 21, 2011, he thinks he knows Jesus’ timing better than Christ does. While these claims have been made in the past by different people who claimed Christ was coming on a particular date, all failed and so shall this one. Again we have to be reminded that the end times prophesies in the old and the new testament are being fulfilled before our eyes. Jesus said that He does not know the day or the hour of His coming but when we see these signs, we ought to know He is coming soon.<!--more-->

Now many have said where is He? They say they’ve been talking about His second coming for years starting from the days of the disciples. Read what Peter writes to the people of his time in <b>2Peter 3:1, “Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder), 2 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets</span>, and of the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior, 3 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, 4 and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming?</span> ... 8 But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 9 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness</span>, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night</span>, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up” </b>

As Paul was writing to Timothy in <b>2Timothy 3:1-9</b>, I would sum up all the seven verses to these, a world of lawlessness and Godlessness in the last days. Listen to what he says, <b>1"But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 2, "People will be <span style="text-decoration:underline;">lovers of themselves</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">lovers of money</span>, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">unholy</span>, 3, "without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not lovers of the good</span>, 4, "<span style="text-decoration:underline;">treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God</span>-- 5, "<span style="text-decoration:underline;">having a form of godliness but denying its power</span>...6, "They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires</span>, 7, "<span style="text-decoration:underline;">always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth(NIV</span>)</b>. Do we see this in our world today? I'm not sure if Paul was prophesying., I think he may have gazed into the future and made an observation based on how things were happening in his time. I believe he knew that instead of things getting better, they would get worse and here we are seeing them. Things are getting more worse in our world and I don’t think they will stop.

Listen to Jesus speaking about the end times in <b>Mathew 24:3-7, "And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? </span>4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Take heed that no man deceive you</span>. 5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places:” </b>What a time we are living in.

No man knows the day or the hour of His return except the Father. Are we getting ourselves ready like the five wise virgins who had oil in their lamps burning waiting for the coming of the groom? They did not know when He would come but they were ready. We too may not know but we ought to be ready. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Revelation 22:1-21, "And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give everyone according to has work"</b></p><p>In the light of God’s word that reminds us that Jesus is coming back again quickly, why are people rejecting the real truth and establishing their own, <b>John 3:19-21, </b>tells us why<b>, "19 And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil</span>. 20, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed</span>. 21But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God." </b>It's not about what you feel is the truth but knowing the truth. You establish your own righteousness and you will continue to stay in darkness, but remember tomorrow is promised to no one.</p><p><!--more--><br /> Because people have not repented and turned to God, here are the results, <b>Romans 1:18-32,"18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness; ...19since what may be known about God is plain to them; because God has made it plain to them. 20For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen; being understood from what has been made; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">so that men are without excuse</span>.; 21For although they knew God; they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him; but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">22Although they claimed to be wise; they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another</span>. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie; and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.; 26Because of this; God gave them over to shameful lusts. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones</span>. 27In <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust. The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness</span>; 28Furthermore; since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God; he gave them over to a depraved mind; to do what ought not to be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness; evil; greed and depravity. They are full of envy; murder; strife; deceit and malice. They are gossips; 30slanderers; God-haters; insolent; arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they are senseless; faithless; heartless; ruthless. 32Although <span style="text-decoration:underline;">they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death; they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them." </span></b> (NIV). These are not my words but His words, read it for yourself.</p><p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Three times</span></b> in <b>Revelation 22</b> does the word "<b>I am coming quickly</b>" is recorded, to me this is a trumpet sounding the coming of Christ soon.<b> Revelation 22:12, "And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give everyone according to his work". </b>He is coming to reward according to everyone's deeds, if you did good, your reward will be good, if you did evil and you were never forgiven of it, that would be your pay. Being good before God means being perfect, no one has and never will be perfect. It's only by grace that we are saved, <b>Ephesians 2:8</b>, “<b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Grace is only given to the one who has been shown mercy, and mercy is given to the one who is humbled and humility comes to the one who has acknowledged to have broken His laws and needs a Savior to save him/her from the wrath to come.”</span></b> Salvation is the key and I believe God will also reward on how faithful we were here on earth especially in reaching the lost. The bible says, "<b>It's appointed for a man once to die and after this judgment</b>" what a tragedy it will be that when He comes and finds you not ready when He has given you signs of His coming. I love you so much to tell you that you need to escape hell if you have not. A certain group sang a song with part of this lyrics, ".....<b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">When The Big One (Death) Finds You May This Song Remind You That They Don't Serve Breakfast In Hell</span></b>" <b>Revelation 22:13-14, "13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last." 14, "<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city "</span></b></p><p>He is coming quickly, are you ready? are you also preparing other people, family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances to be ready for His coming? The bible says, "<b>Now is our salvation much nearer than when we first believed</b>" This is your time. Blessings Evans</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Hebrews 9:27, “And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment"</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Statistics show ten of ten people die. The number one killer in the world is not AIDS or cancer, the number one killer is death. We are all on death row whether we believe it or not. We are one beat away from death and the bible says, "<strong>It's appointed for men to DIE ONCE</strong>", one life to live on this earth then after this is judgment. The question to ask, what would you preach to someone who has little or no time left before they pass into eternity? Would you tell them "<strong>Jesus loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life?"</strong> or a soldier who is about to face a fierce battle and could lose his life, would you instruct him on "<strong>How to live his best life now"?</strong> Do we realize we are running out of time to reach the lost day by day by? Jesus' last command ought to be our first priority. Is it?

<!--more-->

</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whenever I get an opportunity, I share my faith, I desire to go out of my way especially on the streets as I have done in the past to reach the lost (unconverted). I have personally shared with many people one on one in the last 10 years. It's interesting to hear what people believe and put their faith in. Some are living as though they will be in this world forever and then there are those who "HOPE" they are good enough to go to heaven.<strong> Romans 10:3 says, "For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God"</strong>. Then there are those who constantly wonder what is out there when they walk out of this world. I have met people who would have never thought of going to church because they felt unworthy (we all are) and had no Christian friends to invite them but were glad that someone took time to be out there to tell them the truth and point them to the cross to meet the Savior. I have testimonies after testimonies of what happens out there. Self-righteous people get humbled by the law and the<strong> Holy Spirit John 16:8, " ….when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:".</strong> How would they know they running out of time without us telling them? Are we waiting for them to come to church before we can tell them?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A couple of things that motivates me to step out and do what I do, One, my love for God and for Him to be glorified. He deserves it, He SAVED ME! A chief of sinners, He has done everything to save mankind. Two, my dad received his salvation on the streets over 30 years ago. Some people stepped out on the streets to preach the gospel and he happened to be on the streets that day, he heard the gospel, repented of his sins and trusted in Christ to save him. He had no reason being in church but that day some people gave him a reason to go to church and glorify God. Had he not been saved, who knows whether I would be saved today leave alone alive. Three, what if I was the one who was unsaved and someone never bothered to preach the gospel to me, I will definitely be going to hell, thank God I heard the gospel just in time and He saved me and I want others to be saved. What motivates you to want to share your faith? The bible says,<strong> "freely you have received, freely give</strong>".</p>
<p dir="ltr">A gentleman by the name of Mark Cahill who has such a great burden for the lost always asks Christians "Do you care" (in reference to those dying in sin) then he asks a much tougher question, "<strong>Do you care enough to do something</strong>" <strong>Romans 10:13-15, “13 For “whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved.” 14 How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “ How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!” </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Lord give us a burden, such a great burden to win souls. Blessings Ev</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Matthew 2:3, “When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.”</strong></p>
What causes you to get angry? Perhaps there are certain situations or people that seem to cause anger to rise up in you. According to the Scriptures anger alone is not a sin. The Scriptures says, be angry and sin not or in your anger do not sin. One thing that seems to make most people excited however is the birth of a child. When a child is born many come to see the newborn and rejoice with the family to whom the child has been born. However, can you picture any reason why one would become angry because of a newborn? This was the response of King Herod to the news of the birth of Jesus Christ.<!--more-->

Matthew tells us, “<strong>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, 2 saying, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.”</strong> Why would these Magi which had had traveled from the East, most likely from Persia, first go to King Herod the Roman King to inquire of the newborn Jewish King? Where else would one go to find a King but in a palace? However, God in His Divine Providence moved Christ to safety because God knew of the mutiny that Herod plotted against Jesus. Matthew describes the response of Herod about the news of Jesus’ birth, “<strong>When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him”.</strong> What was it that caused King Herod to become angry and troubled and ALL JERUSALEM WITH HIM?!?! At this time Herod was the King, although he himself was not Jewish he was the King of the Jews as the Jewish people were under Roman authority.

The Expositor’s Bible Commentary explains that,<em> “In contrast with the Magi's desire to worship the King of the Jews, Herod is deeply troubled. In this "all Jerusalem" joins him, not because most of the people would have been sorry to see Herod replaced or because they were reluctant to see the coming of King Messiah, but because they well knew that any question like the Magi's would result in more cruelty from the ailing Herod, whose paranoia had led him to murder his favorite wife and two sons</em>.” WOW, a King that murdered his own wife and sons, no wonder he had no problem desiring to murder the new born King, the Son of God!. Hatred is murder of the heart according to God as John wrote, “<strong>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.”</strong> Herod did not want to be replaced, and the people did not wish to experience Herod’s killing tirade as he played no favorites when it came to murder. If Christ were to take the throne and be crowned King, what would that mean for Herod? 1. Herod would no longer be King, 2. The Jews would now look to their own King, 3. The authority Herod had over the Jews would now be passed to Jesus 4. Jerusalem would no longer be under the rule of Herod but under the rule of Jesus

In the natural I can see why Herod was troubled and angry of this newborn King. This would mean King Herod would be out, and King Jesus would sit on the throne in Jerusalem.

Christ’s desires to have the natural sinful Herod heart off the throne, and for Him to have rule and reign over your life. Do you worship like the Magi or become troubled, angry and rebellious like Herod as Christ assumes Kingship over your life. Perhaps today is a day of humble repentance for you. As you examine your response to King Jesus, is it truly one of worship or is Herod’s heart beating in your life?

Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Timothy 1:5-6, "I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well. For this reason I remind you to FAN INTO FLAME the GIFT of GOD, which is in you through the laying on of my hands." -</strong>

I pray that this day my message finds you and that you'll be boldly strengthened by the LORD. That the fear of God (<strong>Proverbs 1:7</strong>) will lead you as the shoes of Christ's gospel confidently tread forward. We should not be ashamed of HIS testimony, but rather we should share in the SUFFERING for the Gospel by the power of God<strong> (2 Timothy 1:8).<!--more--></strong>

Recently, I've been encouraged and spiritually sharpened (<strong>Proverbs 27:17</strong>) by the preacher, Keith Daniels. I know many of you, as Godly men and women, have heard of this man of God. I say that 3 word phrase with complete and utter understanding. MAN. OF. GOD. So few people today who take the name PASTOR are truly living as such. Keith Daniels is one of those very few on the narrow road that are PRESSING forward as we all run the race to God. I encourage all of you to hear his sermons, and I guarantee that you'll tremble at the awesome power of God that spews like rushing water from his mouth. He sincerely loves the LORD, and desires nothing BUT to serve Him.

Amen, thank you LORD. Paul addresses his spiritual son, Timothy, while Paul knows that his time on earth is at its end, and his first step into eternity with the LORD awaits past the prison cell that he presently found himself in. Notice how Paul lets Timothy understand that he is only telling him this spiritual secret because of his sincere faith. The faith that his grandmother, his mother, and now Timothy had. That is the ONLY reason why Paul continues. I wonder, where is your faith? WHERE IS YOUR FAITH? "<strong>Without faith it is IMPOSSIBLE to please God" (Hebrews 11:6)</strong>. If you know about Jesus and the work of the Cross, but have not the faith to live the life He's called you to-WHERE is your faith?! When you're at work, and the Holy Spirit tugs at your heart to speak the LIFE of the Gospel into the dead and lost souls at the office, are you responding? Or is your faith not up to par? In <strong>Ezekiel 16:1-6</strong>, did the LORD leave Israel wallowing in its own blood, completely defenseless to its enemy's? Why then should we walk by souls wallowing in their SIN while CHRIST bore the sin that WE were wallowing in on the CROSS!?

"FAN INTO FLAME THE GIFT!" The gift. What gift? Some say the Holy Spirit while others say Timothy had a special calling as a pastor, teacher or evangelist. But I challenge you to think that shouldn't we as vessels of the Gospel and of the Holy Spirit Himself be called to all three? FAN into FLAME men and women of God!. In today's society it is so easy to slip into the lie of comfort. As Christians we are not called to comfort. We have comfort to know that our souls are saved, but we live in agony for the souls of the lost! Go forth now, as ministers and disciples of the LORD Jesus Christ today, and continue on your walk. I pray you've been encouraged, and I pray that we take seriously the things of God. From the smallest to the biggest. Take seriously the things of God. May God equip you.

Sincerely,

Brother Christopher.

Christopher J. Keck

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Genesis 32:26, "And He said, "Let Me go, for the day breaks. " But he said, "I will not let you go unless You bless me!"</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We serve a God of too much</strong>, God of abundance, God of no limitations. If I look at the story of Jacob and Esau, Jacob deceived his brother and took away his birthright. He then deceived his father to take away his brother's intended blessing. He also deceived his father in-law and made the best for himself, the only one he could not deceive was God. For what he desired, he had to come clean. Who does not want blessings?<!--more--> people bring their children to church to be dedicated and blessed, who does not want a blessed marriage, blessed home, blessed children to mention a few? Who can say that they have enough blessings to want more? Jacob had been blessed with one beautiful wife and one fruitful wife, he had children, possessions, servants, maid servants. He was blessed as you can see but God brought him to a place where he would desire more blessings but not in terms of material blessings.<strong> Genesis 32:24, "The Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the breaking day".</strong> Alone in His presence, where the former life did not dictate what God would do in his life. Despite the fact that you have things to make you comfortable, there is more to desire. I don't know why he wrestled with the Man (God), maybe he wanted to manipulate his way like he always did only to fail.<strong> This is a blessing not worth fighting (he was not worthy to fight for it in the first place), it was a blessing worth asking for</strong>. Why fight to be blessed when all you can do is ask?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Genesis 32:26, "And He said, "Let Me go, for the day breaks. " But he said, "I will not let you go unless You bless me!"</strong> I have been blessed over and over again yet I still need more blessings. The fact He has continued to bless me is an indication I will blessed till my time on this earth expires. I will not let Him go unless He blesses me, when He does, I will not let Him go unless He has blessed me some more. Jacob had been called names, he had a history, but this time He desired a true blessing from above. Yes God might have blessed him through other people even in his failures but this time He wanted the best from above.<strong> vs. 29, "...And He blessed Him</strong>". All we need is ask for a blessing and all He desires is to give it to us. Are you afraid of asking for a blessing because you failed yesterday, last week or long time ago? Jacob had his past failures but that did not stop him from asking for a blessing. To show that he really needed the blessing, he held on to God till He blessed him. On that day, Jacob's name, the deceiver, the conman was blessed with a name change from Jacob to Israel. The name change shows a nation of Israel, blessed beyond what he could have imagined or thought. He did not specify the kind of blessings he desired, he let God bless Him with what God had reserved for him. I have blessings put on layaway, has my name on it, no one can take it for Jesus paid it all. I will not leave the counter until that which the Lord had put on layaway has been released to me. Of all the blessings through gifts that we receive from people, there is no greater blessing than the one from the Father. His blessings are not disappointing because He knows what I need.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What are the blessings you desire? I’m going to go with Paul on this one, I desire more spiritual blessing than anything else. Paul says in<strong> Ephesian 1:3-14, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, 4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, 5 having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved. 7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace 8 which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 9 having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself, 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth—in Him. 11 In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will, 12 that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory. 13 In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory”</strong>. BLESS ME LORD. Blessings Evans</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 12:1&amp;2, "1...and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, 2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; ..." (KJV)</strong>

I recently shared on the subject of “patience”, it is vital for me to share more as there are some folks battling. Our patience is tested while on traffic; check out lines at the stores, at an entrance gate to a game etc. We struggle with patience because we would rather be the ones in front of everyone else, which makes us selfish if you think about it. In as much as you would like to be the one the front, the person on the front also deserves a chance. Is it about me? (just an input but not the direction for the message today).

<!--more-->

The word "patience" appears 33 times in NT. God is referred in <strong>Romans 15:5</strong> as the God of patience. Would we say that the generation after the OT struggled with patience? To some extent yes. In OT, Moses, David, Abraham, Jacob, Isaac, Esther, Jeremiah, David, Naomi and others endured with patience to see God’s promises fulfilled. Some did not see those promises come to pass in their lifetime yet at a distance, they embraced them.

The writer of Hebrews (not known) reminded believers including himself to run with patience the race set before them (us). Sometime back while watching the Olympics marathon, it was a 26-mile participated by many. If you know marathon, it is the kind of race that requires proper practice/preparation, patience and endurance. It took the winner 2hrs 05 Mins to complete the race. As I was watching it, there were times the runners were running on plain ground, at times up a hill. The hot sun made them slow down at times. The person who was at one point leading was pushed off his truck by one of the spectators. It did affect his speed and left him shaken but he would not quit the race. They were all running with patience, grabbing water to quench their thirst. They were looking forward to the finish line. To some it did not matter if they were not first on the finish line, all that mattered was that they finished the race.

Our race with and in Christ is no different, it requires patience and endurance. It is a long journey but we are getting closer and closer to the finish line, <strong>Romans 13:11, "...for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed".</strong> Our finish line is Jesus, we look to Him. You know of those who you started the race with in Christ, some quit running and some reduced their speed tremendously but you have continued to run the race with your eyes fixed on Jesus. You and I are like the marathon runners running a race with endurance. Jesus ran His race here on earth with patience and a beautiful example is the process of His crucifixion. He could have just had someone spear Him to death and still He would have died for mankind but the bible says, "<strong>Christ must suffer"</strong>, that involves patience and endurance. Paul went through patience and endurance facing difficult times yet he would not quit why? because His eyes were fixed on Jesus the author and the finisher of his faith. Did he finish his marathon race even after all the hardships? Yes, he did <strong>2Timothy 4:7, "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</strong>” <b>Despite the battles, he fought a good fight; despite the obstacles, he finished the race; despite the trials, he kept the faith</b> and that is what I am looking forward to. It's about being faithful till the end. I know of those times when this race gets so hard, so tiring, obstacles, barriers, trials. Like the rest, the feeling of quitting presents itself, the enemy keeps reminding you to quit. Didn't he whisper the same to Jesus? All I know is that I am getting closer and closer as I run the race with patience. <strong>I am far from where I started and I am closer to where I am going.</strong><strong> If I can just hang on a little while and keep looking to the One who can give me strength to finish the race, I will join Paul and many saints who finished the race with joy. We ought to be persevering saints, let us keep running</strong>. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Timothy 4:8, "For bodily exercise profits a little, ..."</strong>

When you work so hard in the day, you feel tired and worn out. Any activity you add to it is expected to make you even more tired. The body which is suppose to be the temple of God ought to be looked after. This goes with what you do with it and what you put in it. We ought to do everything to maintain it, not only will we be doing what is right before God, it will also be to our benefit. How often do you see people abuse their bodies? They drink their heads off, inject drugs into their body system and not care for their body at all. How many know smoking is bad for their health but still do it? There are Christians who can't quit smoking, some struggle and some don’t want to. If you thought that God only cares about your spiritual being, think again. God cares about our spirit, soul and body, emphasis in that order. Though the body is not the number one, He formed it and gave everything needed to care for it. They say cleanliness (healthy) is next to Godliness.

<!--more-->

Paul writes to Timothy by saying bodily exercise profits a little. So we can say that bodily exercise does profit. Sometimes back I started to exercise and found that it had such great benefit and impact to my body. I thought leaving work tired and going to the gym to work out was going to make me more tired only to realize that it increased my mental alertness, left me refreshed, created good eating habit and made me stronger. It's been profiting, it's causing my body to relax and be in good health. Not only that, it has created a balance, spiritual and physical. When your body is weak and tired, it becomes hard to work your spiritual life. Remember when the bible says, <strong>the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak</strong>, tired, worn out? If you can get the body strong, the spirit will not work overtime to get the body in tune with it. I have found that my prayer life has increased as the common feeling of always being tired has reduced. I now have the strength to wake up early and pray. This has revived my spiritual life even more.<strong> I believe that how you treat your body has away of impacting your spiritual life</strong>. It may just be a little thing, but it's significant. God's children ought to be in good health resulting from exercise and proper nutrition and not being careless, overweight and sloppy. All this calls for discipline as you set yourself to do things you would not normally do, but because you care about your physical health, you will do it anyway. No one wants to have conditions of heart problems, high blood pressures etc this is why physical exercise reduces the intensity of many illnesses or the risk of developing them. But how, you can start by doing some walking, running, press ups, in other words, exercise.

Did you ever think that bodily exercise does profit? The bible says yes, <strong>the willing spirit needs a disciplined body </strong> <strong>for health, strength and endurance to make it</strong>. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Timothy 6:12, "Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses"</strong>.

Christians fight battles every day. If you are not fighting battles, you may need to examine yourself and see if you are in the faith. I'm yet to meet someone who has no battles to fight. Every one will tell us of some types battle they are engaged in. People don’t engage themselves in battles to be losers, they battle because they want to win. The devil hopes you will throw down your weapons and surrender. Who in their right mind would do that?

<!--more-->

<strong> I have come to realize that our winning strategy in a battle is not necessarily based on how strong we are but how willing we are to fight our way through.</strong> In a boxing match, the boxers are tough, trained to fight to win and so is in wrestling. For us believers, we are reminded that <strong>the battle is not for the strong neither is the race for the swift but for those who endure.</strong>

Fight is to strive vigorously and resolutely or to contend with a struggle against or a confrontation between opposing groups in which they attempt to harm or gain power over. Fight involves force, tactics and skills to over overcome. To continue to live for Christ requires fights everyday and that means fighting temptations, fears, depression etc. In <strong>2Timothy 2:3, says, "You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ".</strong> This reminds us that for us to maintain the free gift of eternal life, we must by all means fight to endure all things that try to take it off our hands. As soldiers we go to the battle field to fight and not just fight but fight to win. Fighting to win will require endurance as we push our enemy back. It's our responsibility to fight for the truth.

<strong>1Timothy 6:12, "Fight the good fight of faith..."</strong>. We can fight but the question is, are we fighting the good fight? the good fight is fighting that which we know is right in the sight of the Lord. While writing to Timothy, Paul tells him to fight the good fight of faith meaning fight for your salvation, defend it, nurture it because there will be things that will come around to terminate it. Then he tells him, ".<b>..l</b><strong>ay hold on eternal life"</strong>, to remind him to cling on to the gift of eternal life he had received to which he made the declaration in the presence of many witnesses. Paul is advising Timothy all these that in the long run, he may look back at the many battles he endured and rejoice over them. Many terminate their salvation because the fight is fierce but who said it will be an easy journey? Salvation is free, maintaining it requires a fight.

<strong>2Timothy 4:7, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith</strong>". Think about Paul speaking these things and look at the battles in his life. They took away his freedom, they stoned and left him for dead, they took away his possessions, his future, churches he ministered in, his life. <b>One</b><strong> thing they could not take away from him was his faith</strong>. He fought a good fight by enduring life obstacles, he finished his race without giving up or fainting on the way. I can't tell what speed he was doing but the speed did not matter, the fact that he finished the race shows how faithful he was. And most definitely, he kept the faith (salvation).

It's worth fighting the good fight of faith even when everything around you is falling apart. Everything can be taken away but your faith unless you give it away in other words let go. It's not how you start that matters, it's how you fight, endure and finish. Any one can start a marathon but who will endure to the finish line? Can you say in the long run, "<strong>I fought a good fight, I finished the race, I kept the faith?". </strong>Fight the good fight till the end. Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Isaiah 60:1, "Arise, shine; For your light has come! and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you"</strong>

Three key things to share with us are on the scripture introduced above. When we get saved, it is like a new born baby. The birth of he baby is not the end but the beginning. Often times those some who have been in Christ for a while tend to lose the fire and become regular people meaning everything else is normal. No zeal to grow, no zeal to witness, no zeal to pray effectively, or zeal to even read the word with passion. It's very easy to lose fruits without knowing, we need to therefore constantly do spiritual evaluation to see where we are. I know of people who used to talk about the Lord strongly, they had such a joy and enthusiasm but something somewhere happened and the zeal began to fade away only to be left with a form of godliness and deny the power.

<!--more-->

“<strong>Arise, shine”</strong> are the first two keys to bring to our attention. Let's define the word ARISE, this is a simple word to mean get up or rise up. Anyone who is getting ready for a greater move has to be in a position ready to get up and will do whatever it takes to get up. You cannot move from point A to point B unless there is something that causes you to desire to relocate. “Shine” is to glow, excel, sparkle, glitter. Interestingly, shinning requires some effort. Normally when polishing my shoes, once I apply the shoe polish, it does not make it shine when application is done until I begin to work on it by shining it with the brush and dry cloth. It takes time to shine as desire, determination and patience are put into practice. Paul advising Timothy on how to arise and shine, shared with him in <strong>1Timothy 4:12, "Let no man despise your youth (point of rising by not allowing anyone to despise his youth), but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity (all these were to be his way of shinning)".</strong> If he worked on all these, he was definitely going to shine and not for himself but for the Lord for the bible says that <strong>whatsoever you do, do it unto the Lord</strong>. Yes the light had already come, but he needed work on it and put it somewhere where all could see, <strong>Matthew 5:14-15, "You are the light of the world. A city set on the hill cannot be hidden nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lamp stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house".</strong> <strong>We are called to rise up and shine for we are the candles God will use to light other people who either their candles were blown off by the winds of the world or the ones who have never had their candles lit up.</strong>

The number three key is <strong>"...and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you</strong>", this is the gas that keeps the light shinning for when we begin to talk about the glory of the Lord, we are talking about a divine light, it's the light that shines in the middle of the darkness, it's the light that nothing can dim and what a blessing to be connected to that source of power and when I feel like my light is gonna go off, the gas of the glory boosts my lamp that I may keep burning, shinning, glowing. Someone said that the smallest light can be seen in the middle of darkness therefore we are not intimidated to think our light is small, it can be seen in the middle of darkness. Be encouraged the way Paul encouraged Timothy and know that He has called you to rise, shine for His glory fuels your existence. He who called you to rise and shine, knew you could do it as long as His glory is present. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jeremiah 33:3, “Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know”</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Not too long ago I was watching a DVD entitled “extreme engineering”. It was a DVD about how some mega structures have been built. One mega structure that caught my attention was one about building a railroad. They surveyed the area by which the rail would pass. There were different obstacles, a major one being a mountain in front of them. Instead of going around it which was impossible, they only had one choice, to make a way through the mountain however hard it was going to be, attempting the impossible with what they had. With the mountain before them, they had to bring in the right equipment to break through to the other side. They used explosives to create a path.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">We too are building roads to our futures and there are obstacles everyday small and big. We have mountains standing in the way, the question is, what do we do about them?<strong> Without prayers as your explosive device, there is no way you will breakthrough</strong>. There is something about prayers that should not be taken lightly.<strong> Prayers pave a way for God to move</strong>.<strong> Prayer works because God works through prayers</strong>. There are things God wills and then waits for His children to call on Him. It shows we trust Him with what we are facing; it’s bringing the right tools (Person) into your situation. When we pray, we are bringing God into our situations for we know we can do nothing without Him. He is like the explosive that breaks through obstacles and making way for us<strong>. Psalm 18:32, “It is God who arms me with strength, And makes my way perfect”, 2Samuel 22:33, “God is my strength and power, And He makes my way perfect”</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Prayer affects three different Spheres of existence as E.M. Bounds puts it, “<strong>The Divine, the angelic and the human. It puts God to work, it puts the angels to work and it puts people to work.”</strong> Prayer puts everyone to work.<strong> "Prayer is simply faith resting in, acting with, leaning on and obeying God.”</strong> Those who know their God will value prayers, their lives fully depend on it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In our tough economic times and other things happening, who would you rather put your trust in, in God or the government, stocks and bond or faith in God? The bible says<strong>, Psalm 20:7, “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God.” Psalm 118:8, “It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.” </strong>How will you and I show the Lord we trust Him if we don’t call upon Him in our prayers to answer us?</p>
<p dir="ltr">This quote continues to bless my heart because it’s the heart of prayers by great missionary<strong> Hudson Taylor,</strong> who said<strong>,</strong> "<strong>The prayer power has never been tried to its full capacity. If we want to see Divine power wrought in the place of weakness, failure, and disappointment, let us answer God's standing challenge</strong>,<strong> Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.”</strong> We bring Him into the picture by praying and He will do great and mighty things we cannot do. Arise O God, demonstrate your power.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With what is happening, we need God now more than ever; we need to pray like we’ve never done before. The more we pray, the more we show God we are not depending on ourselves, we are depending on Him. He is our explosive through the obstacles of life. He is the way maker. Blessings Ev</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:29-30, “29For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son, … 30And those he predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified” (NIV)</strong>

Ever sat down to wonder why The Almighty God who has better things to do has something to do with your life? That He is concerned with your daily affairs. That He takes keen interest of your day-to-day walk, that He loves you in spite of your flaws. That He forgives you when you find it hard to forgive yourself. That He has a plan for your life when all you can see is a future clouded with failures. David says, “<strong>LORD, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?," Psalm 144:3</strong>. I wish you would grasp and embrace this thought that the Lord knows your beginning, your middle, and your end, and nothing that happens in your life and mine has any threat to what He wants to do. You can beat yourself up daily because of what you face and struggle with, or like Paul, you can encourage yourself with these words, <strong>2Timothy 1:12, …, FOR I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED and am PERSUADED that HE IS ABLE to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day”.<!--more--></strong>

How often do we feel God has forsaken us or does not know us? His word to us this day is that He FOREKNEW us even before we knew ourselves, He tells Jeremiah, “<strong>Before I formed thee, I KNEW thee</strong>”, in other words, "I created you for a purpose". God did not create you then found something for you to do, He created you for a purpose He had in mind FOR YOU for His own glory. For this reason He predestined us to be conformed to the likeness of His Son. We were created with a destiny, Jesus being the picture of what we would be. <strong>John 1:12,</strong> tells us “<strong>But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right (power) to BECOME children of God…”</strong> The end result, the final product, is to be like Jesus, and the process, we are BECOMING (getting there), the fuel to become is the power through receiving Him. Even though we are still “becoming”, we are glad to know what we will be like (our end result).

When God predestined you, the calling was part of it. Either you have received it or you are yet to receive it. To some it has been revealed what God requires of them, to some, God is about to. <strong>Ephesians 1:17-19, “17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; THAT YOU MAY KNOW WHAT IS THE HOPE OF HIS CALLING, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power</strong>”. We can be revived today knowing that God is not done with us regardless of how cold, rigid, rugged, dormant we are. God has taken knowledge of us and He is mindful of our beginning, middle and our end. Our future may be clouded but we know that God is the Pilot who will help us land safely. Thank God that even though we are not there yet, we are becoming, “…<strong>for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed” Romans</strong> <strong>13:11.</strong>. <strong>We are saved, we are being saved and we shall be saved</strong>. <strong>1John 3:2, “Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.”</strong> blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:29-30, “For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son, … 30And those he predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified” (NIV).</strong>
 
Our journey in and with Christ is one day at a time, this ought to be our prayer every day. God does not get us to our destiny fast because He is in the business of forming and filling. We realize that forming takes time compared to filling. If we can withstand the forming, filling will be no problem. How can we expect to be filled without being formed? In our text, we can see a continuous forming as we become. Look at the potter with the clay in His hand, even though the clay does not look like what He has in mind, in the mind of the potter, it’s a done deal. He only needs to form it into what he wants to form into. Someone wrote a book entitled, “God is not in a hurry,” I agree.

<!--more-->

The bible says, “<strong>..those he called, He also JUSTIFIED“</strong>, how hard to feel justified when sometimes we don’t even understand what justification is all about. According to the dictionary, one of the definitions of “justify” is to “DECLARE FREE OF BLAME”. Can we say we are free of blame? what have we done to be justified anyway? how hard have we tried in our own efforts to do things that will make us justified? <strong>Romans 3:23,says “for ALL have sinned and FALL SHORT of the glory of God“</strong>. We’ve quoted this scripture many times but the question to ask, how short have we fallen? maybe we have fallen short enough to make if for the shortage to be justified. There is nothing in our own strength that can make us justified. Some religion teach that we have to make our way to God. The bible teaches that God has made a way for us to Himself. This is where <strong>Romans 5:1</strong> comes in , “<strong>Therefore, having been JUSTIFIED by FAITH, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ“.</strong> How I praise God that we are not justified by works otherwise we would all be in trouble for we have fallen SHORT, very short of His glory. He has taken all the blame, guilt and shame away because of our faith in Christ. <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9, “8For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast</strong>.” Our spirit is made new, not our body. Now the body is being formed that it might become; being transformed.
 
What blows my mind is that God did not leave us at justification to which I am ok with, He has gone a step further to glorify them that He justified. How can we grasp this? we cease from being just children of God to sons and daughters. Listen to how God glorified Job, <strong>Job 1:8, “Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?”</strong> Are you glad that the Father brags about you to the enemy? yes, you may be weak, failed, and miserable yet He turns and calls those things, which are not as though they were simply because He has clothed each of us with garments of righteousness, and instead of the enemy seeing us, he sees God’s justification in our lives. In addition, God says, “He is my son or she is my daughter, have you considered them?”.
 
May our minds be renewed (transformed) to see ourselves the way the Father sees us and become what the Father wants us to become. If you are not saved yet, you have no covering and should do something about it. Do you see yourself becoming more and more like Jesus? I do. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 15:11-31, "12 And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.’ So he divided to them his livelihood… 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, 19 and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”’</strong>

The parable of the prodigal son is the most familiar of all Christ's parables. It has more than one lesson if you study it carefully. The prodigal son is an example of sound repentance having lived a life of self.

<!--more-->

To glean some truth from this passage, let us look at how his story begins. <strong>Vs. 12” And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me”.</strong> I find this request to be very strange and here is why, no one would ask for inheritance when the father was still alive. It is like asking for the will to be executed when the person who wrote the will is still alive. Is not this request by this young man suggests he wished his father was dead so as to gain his inheritance? It was like the father was taking too long to die and since he could not wait to get his hands on the inheritance (on the blessing), he chose to act now. The tragedy of today is that most want blessings now but do not want God of the blessings. This is the same picture of those who want to go to heaven not so that they can be with God and worship Him for eternity but that they would escape the nasty place called hell and not suffer there for eternity. This act also pictures all sinners (related to God the Father by creation), who waste their potentials, privileges and refuse any relationship with God, choosing instead a life of sinful self-indulgence suppressing truth in unrighteousness so as to get rid of the thought of God in their minds. If they have a god, it’s god in their making to suit themselves. Paul says in <strong>Romans 1:21-23, “21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man—and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things”</strong>

The root of all sin as well stated by John Wesley, is “<em>… A desire of disposing of ourselves of independency on God”</em>. The sin nature is to take off God’s hand of covering in our lives, our family, our nation only to leave us vulnerable to all attacks. The prodigal son went far away, eliminating that connection with his father that would allow protection, guidance, continued provision and most important, relationship. On 09/11/2001 that fateful day when two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in NYC claiming lives, the following few weeks many people returned to church and some even for the first time. Over 10 years later, many many people have forgotten God, stopped going to church, stopped seeking God’s blessings, guidance, wisdom, protection, and like the prodigal son gone far away from Him. In 2011, the mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg banned clergy and prayer at tenth anniversary commemoration ceremony of 9/11. This is a clear indication of not wanting God’s hands in the lives of people, government, nation etc,

How can we stand without the hand of God? And more so, do we want God more than we want His blessings? The question we each should wrestle with,<strong> “Is God an end or is He a means”?</strong> Do we love our freedom that we would choose to distance ourselves from Him even wishing He was dead whether we say it or not, or wished He did not exist to therefore live the way you want to? Now we may think this is applicable only to those who have not been saved, but come to think of it, we could have an idol in our own lives. What is an idol? <strong>Anything that takes precedence over your life in the place of God</strong>. Is your marriage, children, job, business your idol or is God supreme and sovereign over all? The prodigal son had a lifestyle he wanted to live and take precedence over his life, he therefore chose to go to his father and say “GIVE ME…”. I will share on his return to the father. May the Lord help us. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 15:11-31, "21 And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.’ So he divided to them his livelihood… 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, 19 and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”’
</strong>
While we know the story of the prodigal son having taken his inheritance and gone to a far country and wasted it all, I would like to dwell on his coming back home because it’s a powerful message most churches have forgotten. <strong>Repentance is the forgotten doctrine in most churches, foreign to many coming to God</strong>, no wonder General William Booth the founder of Salvation Army said, “<em>The Chief danger of Christianity in 20th century will be…Religion without the Holy Ghost; Christianity without Christ; Forgiveness without repentance; Salvation without regeneration; Politics without God; And heaven without hell”.</em>

<!--more-->

&nbsp;

One prominent preacher (I use that title loosely in talking about him) said in an interview not too long ago that “<em>People come alive when they realize ‘God is for ME. He’s got a plan for MY life, and I can do something GREAT. I can be who He wants ME to be… We should be happy every day</em>”. The late Keith Green in response to such a gospel said, “ <em>It’s Me-Centered Instead of Christ-Centered. First and foremost, it is the gospel that appeals to the selfish. Instead of honoring God, it places the sinner at the center of God’s love and plan. But the Bible places Jesus at the center of God’s plan, not the sinner”.</em>

What picture do we see with the prodigal son? when he came to his senses he said <strong>vs. 18 “I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you”</strong>. In the state of being broken and crushed, and hungry, and open, and yielded, and abandoned, he arose, and came to his father to repent towards God and to his earthly father. In preaching about repentance, Paris Reidhead said, “<em>Repentance is not just “being sorry” – that is only conviction. Repentance is not merely a change of heart and a change of mind; it is a change of action, change of direction.”</em> Repentance is here pictured as a journey.<strong> It is more than a mere emotion or impulse</strong>

<strong> Vs. "19 and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants” </strong><em>"The church used to confess its sins, now it confesses its rights", David Wilkerson</em> We live as though God owes us and we continue to hear it promised to us in one way or another from some pulpits. This young man was not coming back to claim any inheritance, no, he had nothing. The one he was going back to is the same one he wished was dead. Oh how we would see how wretched and miserable we are in need of God, not because we are worthy but because He is. A stanza on this hymn Rock of Ages is what I see in this young man’s attitude and ours ought to be, “<em><strong>Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to the cross I cling</strong>; Naked, come to Thee for dress; Helpless look to Thee for grace; Foul, I to the fountain fly; Wash me, Savior, or I die”</em>. <strong>He came seeking to be made what his flesh hated in the beginning"</strong>

Those who are coming are those who are done with self, done with living the way they want to, done with rejecting the Savior who loves them and are coming not to claim any rights but simply to cling. These are the people who have been called by Him, called to Him, called from the world. They been broken in His presence, and now the only desire is to be made servants living only to the glory, and the honor, and the praise of His name, such God will not deny. <strong>James 4:6, “God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble”</strong>, to finish. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 15:20-22, “20 And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 21 And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ 22 “But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.”</strong>

This is the magnificent attribute of God that sets Him apart from all the false gods invented by men. He is not indifferent or hostile, but a Savior by nature, longing to see sinners repent and rejoicing when they do. We see this kind of love demonstrated by the father of the prodigal son, who when he saw his son coming he had compassion on him, ran, fell on his neck, kissed him. The son did not even finish his rehearsed words of repentance before the father intercepted to grant forgiveness. <strong>This is a picture of God’s eagerness to forgive.<!--more--></strong>

Then here comes three things he instructs his servants to do for this son, Clothe him in ROBE which is reserved for guest of honor and also to cover his nakedness. He is also given a RING, a symbol of authority, and SANDALS, slaves did not wear sandals. In other words, his father MADE HIM a son again; full restoration to sonship.

Let me side track here and talk about the believers, unlike the prodigal son who had a biological father which gave him some rights, we are not sons and daughters of God by RIGHT but by ADOPTION. According to the Bible dictionary, “<em>Adoption is the giving to any one the name and place and privileges of a son who is not a son by birth”</em>. Those who are adopted now belong and are called blessed. In <strong>Ephesians 1:3,5,6</strong>, Paul writes “<strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ… 5 having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved”</strong>. Blessed God has blessed us with spiritual blessings because He has adopted us through Jesus Christ to Himself. “<em>Human parents can bestow their love, resources, and inheritance on adopted child, but not their own distinct characteristics. But God miraculously gives His own nature to those whom He has elected and who have trusted Christ. He makes them His children in the image of His divine Son, giving them not just Christ’s riches and blessings but also His very nature</em>”, John MacArthur, amen

<strong>Romans 8:14-16, “14For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” 16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God</strong>. To quote Barton W. Johnson, “<em>Paul was writing to the Romans, among whom the adoption of children, not their own by nature, was common. They would understand this to mean that those converted, or born again, are adopted as children of God; upon those thus adopted he bestows his Spirit; this Spirit in their hearts produces a loving trust that enables them to address God as Father.”
</em>
Adoption is a parent choosing the baby to adopt, not the other way round. When the adoption takes place, the nature of the relationship changes. For this reason, God has made us to be partakers of the divine nature. God had one only-begotten Son, and He was pleased for His own glory, to choose out of a lost world many to become His adopted sons. He also made us heirs, <strong>Romans 8:17,”… and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified togethe</strong>r

One who comes with the heart of a servant is made a son yet with a servant’s heart. He knows he does not deserve it, he knows he is been adopted. He did not work hard to earn this position, he was only made. The prodigal son’s father showed him grace and mercy out of the love he had for his son. The same God does for us who come to Him. He gives us what He has set aside for His Son for us whom He has adopted. This is love, perfecting love. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:28, "And we know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose”, NJKV</strong>

Many times when “bad” things happen to “good” people, the first thing that is said about the situation is “That’s just not fair!” or “Such and Such was a good person.” But you know what? We won’t get it. It’s not our place to try and figure out God’s reasoning behind letting something “bad” happen to a “good” person. “<strong>For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways”, says the Lord. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts”, Isaiah 55:8-9 NJKV</strong> I don’t know about you but the last time I checked the earth was pretty far from heaven. Since this is the case, we cannot possibly completely understand God’s thoughts. And you’ll just get a headache trying to force the issue.<!--more-->

Did you know that the word ‘<strong>Fair</strong>’ is never used in the Bible to describe God’s character? ‘Fair” appears only as a description for beauty. Now "<strong>Just</strong>” on the other hand is used over 50 times to describe God. When something is fair, it is limited by our own experiences thereby justifying the event/action. When something is just, it is justified by God’s understanding.

God’s justice may not make a lot of sense to us, but know that He makes it all work out in the end, because He has seen it all from beginning to end. “<strong>And we know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose”, Romans 8:28 NJKV</strong>

To close I would like to share a thought in light of Lisette’s wonderful message. There is no place more clear to deal with the issue of justice and fairness than looking to the cross of Calvary. If God were merely fair, was it fair to allow His sinless Son to die for sinful, undeserving people? If ever a man could say, “it’s not fair,” it would have been Jesus Christ. It wasn’t fair for Him to go to the cross for you, or for me. Yet, “<strong>While we were yet sinners Christ died for us.</strong>” It is to our benefit that He is not fair, because we would all end up in Hell, because there is no one good, no not even one, Jesus said as He spoke to the rich young ruler. “<strong>Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone, (Mark 10:18).</strong>” This man called Jesus good, apart from calling Him God, and only God is good. In civil law, a good judge must punish crime. If he turns a blind eye to injustice, then he is corrupt and he himself should be punished. “<strong>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; mercy and truth go before your face” (Psalm 89:14)</strong>. God is rich in mercy to all that call upon him <strong>“But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us…” (Ephesians 2:4)</strong>. Eternal life is in Jesus Christ, that is why Jesus said, ”<strong>He who hears My word and believes on Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life”, (John 5:24)</strong>. “<strong>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness, (1 John 1:9).” “We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands, (1 John 2:3).</strong>”Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Lisette Rivera &amp; Pastor Phil &lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 1:19-28, “21 Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow. 22 But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will take him, that he may appear before the Lord and remain there forever.”</strong>

I believe by far that to be a mother is one of the most special callings with greater rewards in heaven than that of an evangelist or pastor who may have reached hundreds or even thousands. A mother may take care of one, two, five or even ten children and gain such great rewards because God has a special place in His heart for mothers.<!--more-->

While this is true, many mothers do not consider this to be one of the greatest ministries. I can understand why when we address it in the light of the time we are living in where success by far is measured in numbers. In God’s economy, success is measured in faithfulness and obedience. We all start the race, it’s not who finishes the race first that receives a crown, it’s all who finish the race regardless of the time.

Looking at motherhood as a very special calling, I draw our attention to Hannah, Samuel’s mother. Her story is simple, she received a promise of birth having prayed for a son. Elkanah her husband and his household <strong>vs. 3, “…went up from his city yearly to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Shiloh” </strong>As the priest of his own home, he set the spiritual temperature to foster his family in the things of God. <strong>vs. 7 …So it was, year by year, when she (Hannah) went up to the house of the Lord”. </strong>Though it was not required for the women as a command to go and worship in the city, she accompanied her husband and used that opportunity to seek God for a miracle.

After Samuel is born, the next time comes and Elkanah as always gathers his family to lead them to worship and sacrifice, Hannah requests leave not to accompany him<strong>, vs. 21. … for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will take him, that he may appear before the Lord and remain there forever” </strong>You might say, going to the temple to worship and sacrifice was more important than her being at home with the child or you might even question her priorities. The response from her husband shows he was in favor of her request because it was godly. All she ever desired was to please her Lord by caring for what God gave her, and when the right time comes, she would present him to the Lord for His service. She knew it was an important ministry to wean which means to accustom a child to food other than its mother's milk. I believe it was more than natural food but also spiritual in readiness for his service in the temple. Samuel’s first base to learn faith was at home. The same can be seen with Moses’ parents, <strong>Hebrews 11:23, “By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s command.</strong>” The faith of Moses began with his parents, the faith of Samuel would be the same. Both were preparing them for God’s call, what a ministry.

<strong>Vs. 23,” So Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him. Only let the Lord establish His word.” Then the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.”</strong> “<em>Hannah, though she felt a warm regard for the courts of God's house, begged to stay at home. God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Those who are detained from public ordinances, by the nursing and tending of little children, may take comfort from this instance, and believe, that if they do that duty in a right spirit, God will graciously accept them therein.”,</em> Matthew Henry.

We ought to take care of our children, not only with an eye to the law of nature as they are ours, but with an eye to the covenant of grace as they are given up to God. This sanctifies the nursing of them, when it is done as unto the Lord. The nurturing, the prayers, the teachings of the mother is preparing the child (children) for greater task in life. And while a mother may think she is only ministering to one child or a handful, she needs to be encouraged that she is ministering to many many more by preparation of their children. In that when the time comes for God to use them like He did with Samuel,<strong> it was Hannah indirectly impacting the world through a son she prepared and offered to the Lord</strong>. Those that have in sincerity devoted their children to God may with comfort pray for them, that God will establish the word sealed to them at the same time that they were sealed for him.

So mothers, your children are one of the greatest blessings from the Lord in need of your ministry, <strong>find fulfillment in serving them because you are doing it for the Lord. Their faith begins with you (nurturing, praying, teaching), you will reach more people through how you raise your children. </strong>There is greater reward in this service than the ministry you may be eyeing right now . Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Samuel 9:1-20, "3 Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, “Please take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys. 4 So he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.”</strong>

I recently spent time studying this passage to see it’s parallel to salvation. In preaching the gospel, we must have a starting point. The starting point is crucial to the outcome of the message. The gospel message that starts with man will ultimately put God on the stand and judge Him as the bad one. The gospel message that starts with God will definitely put man on the stand, this is the way it should be.

<!--more-->

To make this message clear, I draw our attention to <strong>1Samuel 9</strong> where we are told of Saul. In vs. 1 we meet his father, followed by who Saul was and his stature. In vs.3 we learn of an assignment given to him by his father which involved taking a servant on a journey. From vs. 4 onwards, he and his servant embark on a journey to find his father's lost donkeys. In vs. 5, indicates their unsuccessful journey which would push them to want to quit and go back home lest his father be worried of what became of him. In vs. 6 his servant came up with an idea, "<strong>6 And he said to him, “Look now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he says surely comes to pass. So let us go there; perhaps he can show us the way that we should go.” …vs."10 Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was." </strong>Up to this point, you see moves made by Saul and his servant. It started with his father's request, their reasoning, and their quest to find these missing donkeys.

In vs. 15, the story takes a huge turn and changes everything, it says, <strong>"15 Now the Lord <span style="text-decoration:underline;">HAD</span> told Samuel in his ear <span style="text-decoration:underline;">THE DAY BEFORE</span> Saul came, saying, 16 “TOMORROW ABOUT THIS TIME <span style="text-decoration:underline;">I WILL</span> SEND YOU A MAN from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him commander over My people Israel...". </strong>What amazes me in this story, the revelation of God is concealed until an appointed time. When the appointed time is revealed, it’s clear to us who was behind every move and every decision Saul made. God told Samuel a day before that He will send Saul. From the beginning it appeared Saul was orchestrating every plan and move, vs. 15 reveals that it was God at work. <strong>Philippians 2:13, “for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure</strong>”.

Jesus said to His disciples,<strong> “You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit…”, John 15:16. </strong>While it appears Saul chose to go and meet the prophet, it’s God who chose him and led him through circumstances to the right place. When I became a believer, it all started with me or as it appeared. I thought I was the one who got tired of living for self; I thought I was the one who began to have a desire for God. Now I know it was entirely the Lord’s doing, He put the desire, the drive, the repentance, and faith to believe in Him.

We did not choose God, God chose us. The Lord does the choosing, the saving, the keeping and He gets all the glory. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 5:33, “Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband”</strong>

Often times when we travel, we sometimes bring air mattress to sleep on. When the time to go to sleep comes, we blow it up until its firm then go to sleep. I have realized many times that in the middle of the night or by early morning when we wake up, the mattress that was firm when we went to sleep is no longer firm. The mattress feels wobbly and uncomfortable; very frustrating. The next day we look for holes to seal only to repeat the same cycle as we discover there are more holes in this mattress to seal.

<!--more-->

The above analogy is a good example to what we encounter with marriages that start airtight, very firm only to find out down the road that it is not firm as it should be or how it was from the beginning. There are things leaking out leaving this thing called marriage wobbling in every direction. For the last few days, God has given my prayer partner and I a burden to pray for marriages, as there are many under <strong>silent frustrations</strong>. The smile is there on the outside but on the inside people are fed up, they feel pressure, very insecure, and resentful. The Love that was to keep their marriage airtight is silently leaking out day by day because there are things that are poking holes in it.

We see people who have been successful in building corporations; great CEO’s, manages successful corporations with thousands of employees but failed in one thing, marriage which involves two people. How will we stand when what we hoped and dreamed of is not what it became when we got there? In addition, where do we go from here? God must help us airtight our marriages to sleep through the nights and days.

<strong>I believe God created marriage primarily to conform us to the image of Christ.</strong> This is to show us that it’s more than happiness. I know we are programmed to ask ourselves, “<i>what's in it for me, what will I gain out of it, how will it benefit me?”</i> but that’s the wrong order of things. It becomes easy to give when you have received, and no one finds it easy to be the first one to give when they feel the other person does not deserve it. When we encounter these roadblocks, what happens, we go through unending cycle of silent frustrations that leads nowhere and before long, it drives some to divorce.

It all begins with LOVE and RESPECT, <strong>Ephesians 5:22-33, vs. “Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband”</strong> Marriages are tough, we can’t make them work on our own. Like Mary and Joseph who received instructions from heaven as to how to raise baby Jesus, we too need instructions from heaven on how to grow and maintain love and respect in the light of what God has joined. My dad always says, “<em>Marriages are made in heaven, they are perfected here on earth</em>”. We have to be in God’s will, ready for change and ready to grow. I know not of any other place that I can grow more especially in my spiritual walk than in my God given marriage. May the Lord help us keep our marriages airtight. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Philippians 1:9-10, “9 And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in knowledge and all discernment</span>, 10 that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6184" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image1.jpg?w=300" alt="image" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong>

Biblical discernment is one of the most neglected areas of teaching in our churches, yet it is one of the most important areas to address especially if you want your flock to know, learn, approve, love and also protect themselves from wolves in sheep skins. In our time, some believers say, <strong>“</strong><em>we don’t want doctrine, doctrine divides and what divides does not cultivate love. We just want to love and worship Jesus</em><strong>” </strong>While this may sound very spiritual, it is not correct, <strong>to love and worship God does not devoid truth</strong>. Your mind (intellect) is not to be disengaged at all in worshipping God, <strong>Matthew 22:37, “Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your MIND”.</strong>

<!--more-->In continuing to talk about love<strong>, John 1:14</strong>, highlights GRACE and TRUTH side by side, <strong>vs. “14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of GRACE and TRUTH”. </strong>As Jesus talked to the woman at the well in <strong>John 4:21-24</strong>, Jesus highlighted the element of spirit (human spirit), the excitement to do something to be accompanied by truth otherwise it lacks backbone, <strong>vs. “24 God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”</strong> He did it with grace and truth.

And here in <strong>Philippians 1:9-11</strong> Paul does the same in speaking of love and knowledge (truth) and all discernment. <strong>Vs. “9 And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment</strong>” As a proof of his great affection for them, he puts up this petition on their account; which supposes that they had love, since the good work of grace begun in them; for wherever the work of the Spirit of God is, there is love, which is a fruit of the Spirit. I believe he is praying that their love which was already there to abound more, the “more” here would be fueled by knowledge. Again both standing side by side so that their knowledge might be increased, and their discernment (judgment) in spiritual things be better informed and established. “<em>Some Christians are more affectionate, and less knowing; others are more knowing, and less affectionate;” </em>In missing the biblical knowledge, those who may be more affectionate than others find it easy to conclude that those who have knowledge and discernment, and apply spiritual maturity in many areas including resisting what is unbiblical are less or not loving. They may even want to say, “<em>if you love, you will not judge</em>”.

<em>“It is well when love and knowledge go and keep pace together, that love is increased thereby, which is true; for the more saints know of God and Christ, the more they love and the more they know of one another's grace and experience, the more they love each other because of what Christ has done”, </em>John Gill<em>. </em>

The gospel message that centers on love and excludes truth is not the gospel of love at all and has no power. The person ready to receive the gospel is compared to the ground (soil) that is well prepared for planting. Jesus says, that is equivalent to "...<strong>he who hears and understands the truth", Matthew 13:23</strong>. The gospel must be rightly preached, rightly understood and rightly received, for there lies in the power of God because it is all TRUTH. <strong>Ephesians 1:13-14, “13 In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise”. </strong>We are not called to a blind faith.

Paul shows what thing we ought to chiefly desire, that is, first of all that we may increase in the true knowledge of God so that we may be able to discern things that differ from one another, and also in love, that even to the end we may give ourselves to truly good works, to the glory of God by Jesus Christ. <strong>Ephesians 4:12-15, ”12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, 15 but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ—", </strong>Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Timothy 4:3-4, “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away<em> their</em> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables”. </strong>

There is a great need for discernment in the 21ST century church. In the Pentecostal movement where souls are being added to the kingdom of God in thousands every day, there is a great need for INTEGRITY and CREDIBILITY demonstrated by pastors, preachers, teachers, prophets to mention a few. The reason for this is because as the Pentecostal movement continues to rise and great things are happening, we are also seeing a lot of damage being done in the name of Christianity and integrity and credibility are lacking in some of the lives of the individuals who call themselves Christians especially in the leadership arena. The integrity of the word is compromised through twist and manipulation of the word of God causing many to live in error and heresy.<!--more-->

As born again believers we must have discernment (the ability to distinguish between right and wrong), especially when conditions are obscure, ambiguous or even misrepresented. Of all the things Solomon asked for when God gave him a blank check to ask for anything he wanted, he asked for wisdom to discern, <strong>1Kings 3:9, “Therefore give to Your servant an understanding (wisdom) heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil”. </strong>Three more scriptures to strengthen the discerning spirit, <strong>Ezekiel 44:23, Luke 12:56, and Hebrews 5:12-14</strong>. Why is discernment so key to our Christian lives? We want to live in TRUTH. <strong>John 8:32, "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” </strong>No one likes to be deceived by anyone, and what a tragedy it is when you discover you have been deceived just because you couldn't discern what was presented to you especially when you did not know the word. Eve was deceived because the serpent manipulated God's word and she could not discern, <strong>Genesis 3:1, “Now the serpent was more crafty ... He said to the woman, "Did God REALLY say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?" </strong>

In the light of too many preaching going on in our land, we have to be very careful what we feed to our spirit and mind because many of today’s preaching may appear sound until you apply wisdom that brings about discernment through the word of God you find that there may be SOME truths and a lot of errors, misinterpretation and manipulation that comes with it.

Four areas where great discernment is needed are; 1. Discern <strong>CHARACTER</strong> over <strong>CHARISMA, </strong>2. Discern <strong>DOCTRINE</strong> over <strong>DECEPTION, </strong>3. Discern <strong>PROPHESY</strong> over <strong>PRESUMPTION, 4. </strong>Discern <strong>MIRACLES</strong> over <strong>MANIPULATION. </strong>I only have time to share on the first two.

1. Discern <strong>CHARACTER</strong> over <strong>CHARISMA</strong>. A person of charisma could be a person with gifts, talents even good looks. Charisma appeals to the flesh. Remember Saul who was appointed king when the Israelites demanded for a king? They did not receive a king with character but a king with charisma to be like other nations, <strong>1Samuel 9:2, “And he had a choice and handsome son whose name was Saul. There was not a more handsome person than he among the children of Israel. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people”</strong>. Absalom the son of David was another man with charisma who tried to elevate himself. Is it not true today that we have many preachers with charisma (likeable, articulate, charming, good looking) but the big question is, do they have character? There is nothing wrong with Charisma yet Character should supersede charisma. Charisma can put anyone on top, Character will keep them there. In this age, many prefer what they like to hear rather than what they should hear<strong>. </strong>You know the end of Saul and Absalom. <strong>2Timothy 4:3-4, “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away<em> their</em> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables”. </strong>

2. Discern <strong>DOCTRINE</strong> over <strong>DECEPTION. </strong>Paul addresses this with his spiritual son Timothy in <strong>1Timothy 4:1</strong> where he says <strong>“Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons</strong>” Which means, moving away from preaching the essential doctrines of Christianity and the whole counsel of God. Teachings appearing to be powerful but lacking the power fueled through the truth of God’s word. It's easy to catch something that is wide open, when you talk about deception, it's subtle, covered with some truths or may appear to be truth. Paul tells Timothy to be grounded in the word and teach the word, then says In vs. 6 “<strong>If you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that you have followed (NRSV). </strong>Without discernment, many Christians are being led by doctrines that are not sound<strong>.</strong> Remember all teachings are judged by its agreement with the words of our Lord Jesus Christ. Read <strong>1Timothy 6</strong> and the entire <strong>2 Peter</strong> which are eye opening to discerning between Doctrine and Deception. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Thessalonians 5:21-22, "But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good; abstain from every form of evil"</strong>

A scripture often quoted in<strong> Matthew 7:1, </strong>says, <strong>"Judge not, that you be not judged</strong>" and this could be thought to mean being silent and receiving all things in the name of Christ asking no questions or else you may be labeled judgmental. The same chapter vs. 15, says, <strong>“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16 You will know them by their fruits"</strong>. How can you then know false prophets without judging first? The One who said do not judge at the beginning is giving indication that it's ok to judge. I think the "judge not" is in reference to someone's salvation. There could be 101 clear signs suggesting someone is not saved, the ultimate judge of their souls is God. We can share the gospel and let them examine themselves to see if they are in the faith. The judging I am still addressing today is discernment, what is going into my system must be evaluated. I hate to be deceived, deception is lethal the reason we have to judge everything preached and said by the word of God.<!--more-->

There is a lot of preaching and teachings out here especially coming from the West that must be received with a lot of discernment. As <strong>Pastor Gregg Johnson </strong>(my pastor) previously shared on the “Need For Discernment” preached along those lines where in Africa the west is influencing their Christianity, there are four areas he preached on that I present to you again because they are very important. As believers, we must be very careful on what we feed our spirit and mind because many of today’s preaching may appear sound, but if you applying discernment through the word of God, you will find that there are alot of errors buried in SOME truths that must be exposed if you are to overcome deception in your life. You will also find alot of misinterpretation and manipulation that comes with it. Four areas where great discernment is needed are. <em>1. Discern </em><strong><em>CHARACTER</em></strong><em> over </em><strong><em>CHARISMA, </em></strong><em>2. Discern </em><strong><em>DOCTRINE</em></strong><em> over </em><strong><em>DECEPTION, </em></strong><em>3. Discern </em><strong><em>PROPHESY</em></strong><em> over </em><strong><em>PRESUMPTION, 4. </em></strong><em>Discern </em><strong><em>MIRACLES</em></strong><em> over </em><strong><em>MANIPULATION</em>.</strong>

What is discernment and why is this important<strong><em>? </em>Pastor John MacArthur </strong>shares with us on this<em>, </em><strong><em>"</em></strong><em>In its simplest definition, discernment is nothing more than the ability to decide between truth and error, right and wrong. Discernment is the process of making careful distinctions in our thinking about truth. </em>

<em>1</em><strong><em>Thessalonians 5:21-22 teaches that it is the responsibility of every Christian to be discerning: "But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good; abstain from every form of evil."</em></strong><em> The apostle John issues a similar warning when he says, </em><strong><em>"Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world" (1John 4:1)</em></strong><em>. </em><strong><em>According to the New Testament, discernment is not optional for the believer-it is required. </em></strong>
<em>The key to living an uncompromising life lies in one's ability to exercise discernment in every area of his or her life. For example, failure to distinguish between truth and error leaves the Christian subject to all manner of false teaching. False teaching then leads to an unbiblical mindset, which results in unfruitful and disobedient living--a certain recipe for compromise. </em>

<em>Unfortunately, discernment is an area where most Christians stumble. They exhibit little ability to measure the things they are taught against the infallible standard of God's Word, and they unwittingly engage in all kinds of unbiblical decision-making and behavior. In short, they are not armed to take a decidedly biblical stand against the onslaught of unbiblical thinking and attitudes that face them throughout their day. </em>

<em>Discernment intersects the Christian life at every point. And God's Word provides us with the needed discernment about every issue of life. According to Peter</em><strong><em>, God "has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence" ( 2Peter 1:3).</em></strong><em> You see, it is through the"true knowledge of Him," that we have been given everything we need to live a Christian life in this fallen world. And how else do we have true knowledge of God but through the pages of His Word, the Bible? In fact, Peter goes on to say that such knowledge comes through God's granting"</em><strong><em>to us His precious and magnificent promises" (2Peter 1:4). </em></strong>

<em>Discernment-the ability to think biblically about all areas of life-is indispensable to an uncompromising life. It is incumbent upon the Christian to seize upon the discernment that God has provided for in His precious truth! Without it, Christians are at risk of being"tossed here and there by waves, and carried about by every wind of doctrine" (</em><strong><em>Ephesians 4:14</em></strong><em>)."</em>

If you value sound doctrine, then be like the Bereans, <strong>Acts 17:10-11, "10 Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. 11 These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so</strong>.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 18:34, “He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms”.
</strong>
My dad was one you would call a handy man. If it was broken then my dad would fix it. As a matter of fact he had been known to create very unique ways of fixing things or building things. I recall that he always tried to build things strong and solid to keep things lasting long. However when he was a young boy he didn’t know how to use his hands in this regards, he had to learn it. One moves from not knowing to knowing through learning, and he learned to use his hands from his dad.
<!--more-->
David wrote, He [God] teaches my hands to war…”

1. <strong>Warrior Engage in War</strong>

David was a warrior from his youth. As a young boy he said <b>“35 t</b><strong>here came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: 35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear…</strong>” Of course David defeated the famous Goliath as well. The Lord seemed to teach David’s hands to war. David would become a military leader in Saul’s Army. As Christians we are in the Kings army and there is certainly a war at hand, one that is not of flesh and blood, but one against rulers, principalities and powers of darkness.

2. <strong>Warriors have hands of war “He teaches my hands to war.”</strong>

It’s not enough to dress for battle and admire ones armor in front of a mirror. <strong>Ephesians 6</strong> also tells us after one has put on the full armor of God to take a stand against the Devil’s schemes, the warrior must battle in prayer (<strong>Ephesians 6:18 – 19</strong>). Open your mouth boldly, Make known the mystery of the Gospel, Pray always with all prayer in the Spirit, Pray with supplication in the Spirit, Watch with perseverance – Jesus said in the Garden of Gethsemane, “<strong>watch and pray…</strong>” Make supplication for the saints (fellow believers, not dead people), Pray for laborers <b>(Matthew 9:36-37)</b>

3. <b>Warriors make breakthroughs </b>“…<strong>a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.”</strong>

Not everyone in the military is considered a warrior. One prerequisite one needs to be considered a warrior is the fact that warriors have won some significant battles that could have been lost. We think of warriors winning many more times than losing. David wrote that he broke a bow of steel in my hands. <strong>Acts 12:5</strong> states, “<strong>So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.</strong>” Then something happened, Peter actually was broken free from jail by an angel of the Lord (<strong>Acts 12:6–16</strong>). Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, "<strong>thy will be done,</strong>” then He went to the cross and put “legs” to his prayers. Don’t just pray for the saints, “encourage them as well,” don’t just pray for the unsaved, go out and reach the lost by preaching the gospel the way Jesus did. If we are warriors for Christ, breakthroughs MUST take place. Learn how to engage in war through prayer, and as one prays in the will of God, one should experience breakthroughs as the church did in Acts. Are you a warrior? If you feel you have been engaged in the spiritual war at hand are you experiencing breakthroughs? Engage, fight, pray, do, and breakthrough by the power and will of God! Blessings, Phil the Evangelist]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 7:11, "If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!”</strong>

Our lives can never be complete without God being part of it. In as much as it’s easy to run around thinking that your life is complete, the truth of the matter is, you need a bigger hand and a bigger mind to guide, provide, protect, and lead you whichever way you go. As the children of God, we pray for a hand bigger than ours to guide and direct us to the safe harbor.<!--more-->

Calling on God ought to be our first priority and not our last option. Often we find that we panic first which leads to fear that leaves us disoriented. It is easy to assume that God will just handle what you are dealing with. Yes there are times He will do things without us even calling on Him and there are times we would be required to call on Him.

King Hezekiah, a God fearing king was sick, he received a message from God by Prophet Isaiah that he was not going to live. The first thing he did was not fear or panic, he went straight into the house of the Lord to cry out to Him (intercede). He desired to live and with that he had to do something about it. He understood that prayer changes things and therefore he did not want to conclude that there was nothing that could happen if he prayed. <strong>2Kings 20:2-3, "2 Then he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying, 3″Remember now, O LORD, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done what was good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly”</strong>. When you feel it’s too late to bring it before God, that could be the right time it needed to be brought to the Lord. In my case I would have thought, a prophet has spoken, it is a message from God, this is it, let me pack my bags and wait for my time to go. Not with Hezekiah, he was not ready to go easily, he still needed a bigger hand in his situation. A hand that was able to reverse the sentence. It was not a hand that “would” but a hand that was “able”, big difference. “Would” means you definitely know what He will do, “Able” means, you know He can and the outcome is in His hands.

<strong>Matthew 7:-11, "7 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent? 11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!”</strong>

When we cry out to God, heaven goes in motion while hell goes in chaos. It is like a telegram sent to the throne room of God, and God goes to work with His angels because He has promised to fulfill His word. Prayer changes how heaven responds, it moves things on top of the list of the agendas. Hezekiah’s prayer was like a telegram so was Daniel’s prayer, answers were released immediately because Prayer changes things. Do you believe that your prayers to God could change a situation? Do you call on Him first as a priority or call on Him as the last option? To add the most important part in all this,<strong> prayer does more than change things, prayer changes us</strong>. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <title><![CDATA[God’s Purpose In Peter’s Failure, Zac Poonen]]></title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In <strong>Luke chapter 22 verse 31</strong>.We read of Jesus warning Peter of a danger that lay ahead of him. He told him “<strong>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat; but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers</strong>.” We all know that Peter denied the Lord three times that very night. In verse 34, we read that Jesus told Peter,<strong> “I say to you, Peter, the cock will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.</strong>” Does God allow failure? Does He permit it? Is there a purpose in failure? Or is failure something that has no purpose at all in God’s perfect will and something that God cannot use to further his purposes!<!--more-->

When we read this passage, we see that God did not prevent Peter from denying Him. Why didn’t Jesus say “<em>Simon I have prayed for you that you will not deny Me even once.</em>” Why did the Lord pray only that Peter’s faith may not fail, even if Peter himself fell?? Isn’t it interesting that the Lord did not pray that Peter might not fall? Some of us would like the Lord to pray for us that we might never fall. We would like the Lord to say to us “<em>My son, my daughter, I have prayed for you that you will never fall and never fail.</em>” But interestingly enough, our Lord doesn’t pray such a prayer for us. What did Jesus pray for Simon? That when Satan tempted him, his faith would not fail. He didn’t pray that Peter should not fall in temptation, but that when he did fall, his faith in God’s perfect love would not fail him – so that even when Peter reached the bottom of the pit of failure, he would confess, “God still loves me”. That is faith – and that is the confession we must always have on our lips and in our hearts – no matter how low we may have sunk or fallen – that God still loves us, JUST AS WE ARE. That was the confession of the prodigal son. When he had reached so low that he could not go any lower, he still believed that his father loved him. I can’t imagine anyone reaching any lower than the prodigal son had reached – eating what the pigs ate. That boy was at rock-bottom. But when he reached rock-bottom, he remembered one thing: That his father still loved him. Otherwise he would never have returned home. Supposing he’d heard that his father had died and that his elder brother was now running the house, do you think he would have come back home? No. He knew what his elder brother was like. And knowing that, he would never have come back.

There’s hope for all who’ve failed thoroughly, who’ve made a mess of their lives, and who’ve reached rock bottom. From there the Lord can pick you up and take you to the heights of glory. His prayer for us is that our faith in God’s love should not fail at any time. When you hit rock bottom, remember one thing that God still loves you, no matter where you are, or how low you have fallen. May your faith in God’s love not fail in that hour.

It was with a purpose that God allowed Peter to fail. That purpose was to sift Peter. What Satan really wanted was to destroy Peter altogether, but God would not allow him to do that. God does not allow us to be tested or tried beyond our ability. So Satan was allowed to sift Peter. As a result of his failure, Peter was cleansed of a whole lot of chaff in his life. That is the real purpose with which God allows us to fail too. Isn’t it a good thing for the chaff to be removed from our lives? Certainly. When a farmer harvests the wheat, he has to sift it before he can use it. Only then will the chaff be removed from it.

The Lord uses Satan to remove the chaff from our lives. Amazingly enough, God accomplishes this purpose by allowing us to fail repeatedly!! God used Satan to fulfill that purpose in Peter and He will use Satan to fulfill that purpose in our lives too. There’s a lot of chaff in all of us – the chaff of pride, self-confidence and self-righteousness. And God uses Satan to make us fail repeatedly, in order to remove that chaff from us completely. Whether the Lord is succeeding in fulfilling this purpose in your life or not, you alone know. But if the chaff is being removed, you will be humbler and less self-righteous. You won’t look down on others who fail. You won’t consider yourself better than anyone else. As I said, God permits Satan to remove the chaff from us, by allowing us to fail repeatedly. So don’t get discouraged if you fail. You are still in God’s hand. There is a glorious purpose that’s being fulfilled through your repeated failures. But your faith in God’s love for you must not fail at such times.

That was what Jesus prayed for Peter and what He’s praying for us today. He’s not praying that we may never fail, but He’s praying that when we do reach rock-bottom, our confidence in God’s love will still be unshaken. Only through many experiences of failure do we finally reach a “zero point”, where we’re truly broken. It was when Peter reached that point, that he had a second “conversion” (Lk.22:32 – KJV). He turned around. The proof that Jesus’ prayer for Peter was answered is seen in the fact that when Peter hit rock-bottom, he turned around. He didn’t just lie down there discouraged. He didn’t lose his faith. He got up. God had let him go on a long leash. But when Peter reached the end of that rope, God pulled him back. It’s a wonderful thing to be a child of God. When God lays hold of us, He puts a rope around us to protect us. There’s a lot of slack in that rope, and you may slip up and fall many thousands of times and even drift away from the Lord. But one day, you’ll reach the end of that rope. And then God will pull you right back to Him. Of course, you can decide at that point, to cut off the rope and run away. Or you can choose to be broken by God’s kindness and mourn and return to Him. That’s what Peter did. He wept and turned back to the Lord. But Judas Iscariot didn’t do that. He cut away the rope – in rebellion against God’s authority over his life – and was eternally lost. But I trust you’ll do what Peter did. Jesus then told Peter, “<strong>When you turn back and are strong once again, strengthen your brothers</strong> “. It is only when we are broken that we can be strong enough to strengthen others. It was only when Peter was weak and broken, that he became really strong – so strong that he was able to strengthen his brothers and sisters. We could say that Peter’s preparation for Spirit-filled service came through his experience of failure. If he had been filled with the Holy Spirit, without this experience of failure, he would have stood up on the day of Pentecost as a proud man, as a man who had never failed, who could look down despisingly at the poor lost sinners in front of him. And God would have become his enemy, for God resists the proud!! Blessings]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1Peter 1:16-, "Because it is written, “Be ye holy, for I am holy.”</strong>

Holiness is the very essence and nature of God. It is the description of who He is. Time and time again, both in the Old and New Testament, God is proclaimed as holy, both by men and angels, all of His creation declares His holiness. Here, God speaks through the anointed word of Peter, declaring a truth that is as pertinent in the New testament as it was in the Old Testament, we are to be holy, for He is holy. This is what God demands of His people. This is not an option, just as sin is not an option. We are to forsake sin, and to be holy, partakers of the very divine nature of God.<!--more-->

It is my opinion that holiness is the most ignored teaching in our time. What was once the common condition of a Christian has now been relegated to nothing more than a passing thought. But look deeper now, who does Jesus say will see God? The pure in heart (<strong>Matthew 5:8</strong>). What does Hebrews tell us, that without holiness, no one shall see the Lord (<strong>Hebrews 12:14</strong>). What has become an afterthought in modern “Christendom” has always been the central focus of Christianity, a pure and holy heart. Think of it, would an earthly king be made to dwell in the midst of filthiness? not at all. They are secured in the finest of everything, comforts of life we can’t even imagine. Yet we expect the King of Glory to come and live within a filthy heart, filled with idolatry, pride, anger, and all other sorts.

God sent His Son to make us holy, to cleanse us of our inner corruption, that He may reign within us in glorious beauty and splendor. Does He deserve any less? So the question is, am I holy as He is holy? Or am I in love with the world, am I too fascinated with sport and entertainment, the devil’s best friends, to even give God the time of day? Is my heart truly the holy habitation of God? Does my heart belong fully to Him? Is Jesus the central focus of my life, the center of my affections, or do I give Him fifteen minutes a few times a week? When you fell in love with your spouse, remember how much time you spent with them. You couldn’t wait to see them each day. Do you feel that way about Jesus? God is a jealous God, He desires all of us, and He desires holiness. Seek for Him until you find Him friends, till He fills every part of your life.

That our hearts may be stirred, Blessings Brother Ben]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Luke 21:1-4, “1 Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box, 2 and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. 3 And he said, “Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them. 4 For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.” </strong></p><p>When I went to the jewelers I was looking at some rings for my wife. The Jeweler explained to me the four C's to look for when looking at a diamond. The Jeweler looks at the <strong>C</strong>arat weight, diamond <strong>C</strong>olor, <strong>C</strong>ut, and <strong>C</strong>larity. However, when I look at a diamond I usually see the <strong>S</strong>hape, and the <strong>S</strong>hine, oh and the <strong>S</strong>acrifice (aka the cost). Although myself and my Jeweler look at the same ring, we see different things. I see my three S's and he sees his four C's. He looks through a magnifying glass, and his judgment is aligned with the standards of the properly rating diamonds, and that determines the price. The reality of looking at the exact same thing, but seeing two different things applies to jewelry, and perhaps almost any given field of discipline.<!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--></p><p><!--more--><!--more-->Jesus had spoken to the Sadducees and left them feeling foolish when they could not catch Jesus in their foolish questions. Jesus speaks to His disciples, in the presence of both the people at the temple, as well as the Sadducees concerning the giving of offerings in the treasury at the temple. Everyone saw the same thing, a poor widow putting in two copper coins, and rich men placing their gifts into the offering box. Both the people and Jesus saw the giving of the offerings, but both saw with very different eyes. Luke writes that the scribes we're those "who devour widows’ houses." The IVP NT Commentary states, "<em>Widows had little means of support, were socially powerless and were to be protected under Jewish law. Jesus could mean that these teachers exploit widows’ resources by seeking extensive tithes (which they could set at 20–30 percent, on top of the heavy land taxes levied by the government); or he could mean that they follow the letter of the law in legal decisions, rather than showing mercy to the poor as the law required</em>.". Jesus often had a way of explaining how the last would be first in the kingdom of God, and showing how the most despised of society that truly tried to honor God were those God would exalt, as the prideful religious leaders would lift themselves up, and put others down. Jesus commended the poor widow saying, "<strong>For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on</strong>.” The Greek expression signifies extreme poverty. The smallest copper coins in use in Palestine, worth about one-eighth of a cent, but representing her total livelihood, hence all she had to live on. Yet what she deposits Jesus exalts, and He is the only One that saw this as pleasing to God, as opposed to everyone else that measured in certain amounts. How is the amount the widow offered going to make a bit of difference? This woman was desperately poor, she was more fit to be a recipient of charity than a donor mites (MacArthur Study Bible). It made a difference to the One in whom the money was supposed to be a blessing toward, God Himself. It was the God man Christ Jesus that it made a difference to. Peter and James both wrote, "<strong>God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble</strong>."</p><p>Christ sees through His holy lens that which pleases Him. He gets pleasure in seeing what pleases Him, and not what pleases man. Paul wrote, "<strong>For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ</strong>. Serve the Lord with that which pleases Him. To find out what pleases Him look to His Word, and bath your decisions in prayer by the Word of God.</p><p>Until the nets are filled...</p><p>Blessings, Phil, the evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:35&amp;36, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, vs. 36 As it is written “For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter”</strong>

A while back a lady emailed me to share her concerns in regards to the messages I share. she felt many of them were too strong to which i replied, it’s good to have baby food, but there comes a time when we have to have meat, this is to our growth and maturity. Imagine if we don’t start preparing our children for life, how will they make it when the time comes? If you prepared them, they may not like you now but eventually appreciate you. If someone is sick, the medicine they need to cure them might not taste or feel good but it’s effective. Therefore, some of the devotionals may not taste sweet but God is using them to cure, grow and prepare us for the things to come. Life is not fair but God is good. Praise His name.<!--more-->

<strong>Romans 8:31, “What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</strong> This is the end result that should always ring in our minds and hearts as believers. Look at where Paul puts the vs. at 31, and then follows with hard truths in vs. 35.

We are in a fast forward mentality era. By this I mean we want everything either ready or can be ready in a short time (the microwave generation). We are in a hurry and can’t wait to make the next move, if we could get rid of patience we would. The mentality we have, my way or no way, or like burger king, “have it your way” (sad but true), trickles down to relationships and marriages. Easy come, easy go and so are many marriages today, the Hollywood style. People are in a hurry to be in relationships and also in a hurry to be in marriage. We love convenient things even when it asks for more. We are in a hurry to get new appliances to work without reading instructions. In a hurry to sign a contract, get a promotion, and even in a hurry to be used of God. The same drive we had before salvation we find it still very present even after we get saved. Things are not happening fast as they should or as they were anticipated. Someone received a word from the Lord that He was going to do something, they find that they can’t wait to see the Lord do it, constantly checking, being anxious as though the Lord forgot His word. Kids are in a hurry to grow and can’t wait to be adults. We are all guilty at some point of being in a hurry to do something or be in something. The problem of being in a hurry, many times it does more damage than good. Hurrying does not allow you to look before you leap to see if that is the path you want to follow and if you are ready to take it no matter the cost. The Bible says, “<strong>He who is going to build must first count the cost”</strong> and this is not the case in our time. There are a lot of exits on the highway in our days so that if we don’t like it anymore, we don’t have to struggle to work on it, just take the next exit.

Another thing that does damage apart from hurrying is the order of affection, for example; being interested in what someone else has rather than what you have. The problem with this is that things can easily come and go, whereas people and values last. I have seen people leave because what they based their relationship on was no more. Last but not least, the Bible puts emphasis on Soul, Spirit, and Body, man has changed it to body, soul, and spirit. God is the lover of my soul. It doesn’t matter what I look like, God loves my soul first. Today body gets the first priority and we know the body is always in a hurry. I believe the order of the affection has a way of affecting us in this life and we need to be very careful not to put emphasis on the wrong thing. Having set the ground for sharing, I will dig into this passage in the next message. blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:35&amp;36, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, vs. 36 As it is written “For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter”</strong>

In my continuous study of God’s word, I am utterly convinced (persuaded) that God is not in a hurry. To prove it, read about Moses, Elisha, David, Paul, Gideon, Samuel, Eli and many in the bible that encountered with God. We need to get saved because tomorrow is promised to no one, the walk after salvation requires patience. Patience is accompanied by endurance. Paul writes in <strong>Romans 12:2, “Run this race with patience looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith“.</strong> He was persuaded that God was not in a hurry to do things. God is such a Master craftsman working on what He has started step by step. If you watch a potter working on clay, you will notice that he is not in hurry to finish working on whatever he is working on until it looks perfect. Be patient with God, He is not in a hurry.<!--more-->

If there is any man who counted the cost of living for Christ it was Paul. Remember that Paul did not physically walk with Jesus like the other disciples. He was not there when Jesus started His ministry, when He chose His disciples, when He taught the people, or healed and provided for them. Paul was not there when He was transfigured, not even when they took Him, whipped Him and later nailed Him on the cross. Paul was not there when they buried Him and then came back to life on the third day. And Paul was not there when He ascended to the heavens. Regardless of missing all that, Paul is and will be there when He calls the justified. This started when he encountered with the truth while on his way to Damascus to persecute Christians. What he experienced that day persuaded him of the truth and with the calling, he purposed in his heart to live and serve Christ. This is a man who counted the cost yet he wasn't there like the rest of the disciples to see Him face to face.

<strong>Romans 8:35&amp;36, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword" </strong> A man who is not in a hurry to leave will be conformed to the image of Christ. Think of the life of Paul, many times he was beaten, stoned and left for dead, he survived shipwrecks, imprisoned, made fun of, ridiculed but he had been persuaded that he was on the right track. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Have you ever asked yourself that question? The “who” here is not just referring to people but situations too. It’s like saying, "<em>I have made up my mind to stay on this road come rain or sunshine, come hell or high water, I am going to stick with this road. It has hills and valleys, pot holes, what shall separate me from this love that I have attained? This means what I am dealing with cannot be compared to the love that He has bestowed upon me</em>". If you are on death row and your time has come to be executed and someone appears from nowhere and says, “Let me be executed in your place“. Your question to him might be, “why are doing this?”, and if he responded by saying, “because I love you,” wouldn’t that change everything in your life?

Paul is now writing to us and asking us, what shall make us take an exit? shall it be all those things he has written of among others? In countries like China there are many people dying for their faith, the love of Christ compels them to stand. And this is because they are persuaded/ convinced that Jesus Christ is the only way and that He is love. The word persuaded means to take time to learn and experience it, patience is the word for it. Persuaded is to induce to believe by appealing to reason or understanding. God has persuaded us in His word that He loves us, He demonstrated by sacrificing His son on the cross for us, He has persuaded us that He can be trusted and continues to. Persuasion is not for hurried people, it’s for people who want to know more and live connected regardless of what happens, God’s word continues to convince them. To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:35&amp;36, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, vs. 36 As it is written “For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter”</strong>

We concluded our devotion with this thought, “Persuasion is not for hurried people but people who want to know more and live connected regardless”

Two things to bring to us from <strong>Romans 8</strong> concerning the question asked by Paul about who shall separate us, the <strong>natural</strong> and the <strong>supernatural</strong>. Looking at verse 35&amp;36, you can see that he is referring to the natural (tribulation, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, and sword) and then he concludes it by saying that for His sake we are killed all day long. I would take this to mean, in the process of dying to self and crucifying the flesh, we face these things that have separated many from God's love but we are compelled to love Him because He loved us first. We know that His love is better than life and in turn we are telling Him that our love for Him is better than whatever thing we go through therefore we would rather suffer and die to these things than loose our love for Him.<!--more-->

<strong>Romans 8:37, “Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us”.</strong> We need to understand that even though we have made a choice to love Him in spite of, these things we are dealing with will still be painful, yet we are reminded that we are more than conquerors. Being more than a conqueror is conquering what God has already conquered. He has conquered for us because He loves us and we have refused to be separated because we love Him. With this understanding, Paul goes far ahead to say, the natural will not separate him and so is the supernatural.<strong> Romans 8:35&amp;36, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, vs. 36 As it is written “For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter” </strong>These two verses addresses what we face in the natural, then the next verse addresses what we face in the supernatural, <strong>Romans 8:38, “For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come vs. 39, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord”</strong> <strong>yet in all these we are more than conqueror both in the natural and the supernatural because of Him"
</strong>
Looking at it closely, I can see a love reciprocated, <strong>Romans 5:8, “But God demonstrated His love, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us</strong>“, then Paul responds to this love by saying,<strong> “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?”</strong>, Paul concludes, <strong>“I am persuaded that the natural and the supernatural will not stop me from His love,”.</strong> Listen to what Paul says again in <strong>2Timothy 1:12, “For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not a shamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day“</strong>. Read Paul’s story and you will discover that everything he mentioned he experienced but none of them separated him from His love and it’s all because He was persuaded in every minute in his life that Christ sure loved him. If you are facing some challenges mentioned above and doubting Christ’s love for you, look to the cross where He demonstrated His own love by dying for you. This should be your point of encouragement to believe that He knows where you are and where you are going. You have to be persuaded that you are in His will and be a conqueror in every state in natural or supernatural even when you don’t see it or feel it. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ephesians 2:8-, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,"</strong>

Here the inspired apostle gives a simple formula for salvation; by grace, through faith. Not by grace alone, nor by faith alone, but these working together to bring the soul into harmony with God. It is only through the shed blood of Jesus that we can be saved, He alone is the author of salvation. No man can earn this, no amount of good can cleanse us, only the precious blood of Jesus. God has prepared for all mankind the means of salvation.

<!--more-->

But what of faith? This is our part, and the part often most ignored. We receive by His grace the ability to believe, but the act of faith whereby we trust in Jesus for salvation is ours. God does not forcibly save anyone, nor does He keep us against our will, He allows us a free will, for He desires a people that truly love Him, and obey Him out of this love. In the Greek language, the word faith throughout the NT depicts an ongoing action, present tense word. We do not one time put our faith in Jesus, but we daily live by faith, pursuing a holy life, forsaking all sin, enabled continually by His grace. This does not just happen automatically, it is a daily walk by faith, for the just shall live by faith. God alone saves, He alone sanctifies, but we must take the initiative, we must be diligent to maintain our part.

We must daily work out our salvation with fear and trembling, all the while knowing it is God who works in us. God will not do for us what He has commanded us to do, He will not force us to walk in His ways, nor will He overlook our sin, but He will give us the ability we need to overcome sin as we yield our lives to Him. We cannot neglect our responsibility, neglecting to care for our physical body results in death the same way neglecting the spiritual responsibilities results in spiritual death and backsliding. If you hear His voice, harden not your hearts, for God is truly desiring to do a work in each of our lives, he desires that we would be holy as He is holy, that Christ would be formed within us, His very righteousness, not merely imputed to us, but imparted within us, this is the ongoing work of salvation in our lives as we remain in Christ. Let us look unto Jesus, the author and finisher, the originator and perfector, of our faith.

All for the glory of His wonderful Name, blessings Brother Ben]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Life has many obstacles. We all face them every day. The obstacles hinder us from being where we are supposed to be or want to be. Overcoming obstacles of any kind is not easy, especially when you are trying on your own. Naturally, as human beings, we have limited power, strength, knowledge, abilities, and many other resources that can and should be used to overcome obstacles.<!--more-->

There are many ways and approaches that have been advanced by professionals, philosophers, or even lay people throughout all generations for dealing with obstacles in life. To some extent, some people have overcome great obstacles in their personal life using their own ways, methods, or even tactics and strategies. Many have also failed and some have even died without experiencing any breakthroughs with their life’s obstacles. And even today, there are countless peoples who are trapped and have been stopped from moving any further because they face insurmountable obstacles that they cannot go through or past. Such people need help! I HAPPEN TO BE AMONG THOSE THAT NEED HELP. Do you?

WELL, I do not know what your answer to that question is; I also do not know what your situation is either. But I do know that if you are like all of us, living here on earth, where there are countless problems and challenges that people face every day, then you need help. And help is available!

There is an enemy- a common enemy of mankind who is busy building obstacles: gates, walls etc to stop you and I from experiencing the victorious and abundant life God meant for all of us. We are all God’s creation. We were created, formed and made by God for a purpose greater than ourselves, and with unlimited potential to become anything He wanted us to be. But mankind lost it through wrong choice. Choosing to be independent, and live a life of self without God. This deviation from God’s plan is one reason we have problems, difficulties and obstacles we cannot overcome on our own. It is also the reason why we are cached and limited and powerless, so that we cannot live victorious lives.

I would like to share with you some insights and strategies that you can use as a Christian to help you overcome any obstacle you may be facing right now or in the future. Here are some Seven Strategies for Overcoming Obstacles.

1. Plow Through the obstacle:
2. Go round it:
3. Climb over it:
4. Change the route:
5. Re-position yourself:
6. Review the situation:
7. Break the obstacle in pieces and deal with the pieces one by one.

To continue, Have a great day. Blessings Bro Boaz]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[There are seven strategies or approaches to dealing with obstacles that I would like to share. They are not the only ones, nor are they the super strategies for overcoming all of life’s obstacles we face daily. <strong>But they are good and godly, and are time tested, as the Bible will prove and as some of us will confirm from our testimonies and past experiences and victories God have given us. I will begin today by examining the first strategy or approach:<!--more--></strong>

<strong>Plowing Through The Obstacle, </strong>When faced with an obstacle, small or big, our common reaction is usually a response or a reaction. Reaction seems to be the option most of us prefer because, I guess, it is cheap since no much thought or consideration or concentration or efforts are necessary. For instance, if you are facing a disappointment as an obstacle, you can simply deal with it by deciding to give up or quit or cry afoul or curse. Worse, you can choose to sink and drown in the deep ocean of depression, where hopelessness and frustration are manifested in large quantity free of charge. Now that’s very dangerous, because most people don’t get out of that sea senile or at, worse, a live. You know that. Don’t you? Try not to be a statistic. Don’t go there.

But what about “response” to an obstacle? I mean in a positive manner that is likely to produce the best and most desirable and victorious result? That may demand a lot more than any reactions I have already mentioned. It may mean making a conscious decision, however risky or painful or hard or challenging the obstacle may be, that you are going to “plow” right through it. Your choices and decisions determine the outcome. Your dependence on God for help guarantees the victory, which is usually accompanied by a lot of joy and celebrations. Listen to what the Psalmist wrote: <strong><em>“ Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy comes in the morning (Psalms 30:5). </em></strong>

There is a morning that always comes for those who decide to go through their obstacle, even when they are weeping so hard. They know that the weeping is just but for a night. Don't let Satan lie to you that your obstacle is unique and special, just newly invented and that you do not have the ability and capacity to overcome it. Our God is able. His specialty is deliverance. His presence alone, even without doing anything or saying anything, melts any obstacle or problem. He is also a good road constructor. He makes ways where roads never existed and no Engineer could ever imagine a road could be constructed. Come with me to the Bank of the Red Sea and see how He did that to Moses and the children of Israel, when they faced the impossible to “plow” through -The Red Sea. Read Exodus 14, and see what God can do. It records one of the most spectacular and incredible miracle of victory over and a gigantic and life threatening obstacle. <strong>The first thing God said to the Israelites was “ stand still” and see my “ salvation which I am going to show you today.”</strong> In other words, don’t panic or be scared. I am with you and I am in control of the situation. The reality was they were scared to death, because Pharaoh's soldiers were behind them ready to kill them or recapture them and take them the back to slavery and the Red Sea was in front of them. Now, look, these guys were in a” fix”. But God was not scared! <strong>Anytime you face an obstacle, stand still. You will see God’s hand and power melting your problems, fears, doubts, and all those things that are frustrating you and causing pain and at the same time stopping you from reaching your maximum potential God intended for you.</strong>

<strong>The second thing God did was “He told Moses to stretch his rod over the Red Sea, and divide the sea.”</strong> A dry way opened up right before their eyes and they were commanded to walk through it to the other side. Wow! What a miracle! <strong>You see, God gave Moses an idea and a plan for overcoming the impossible. He acted on them and they worked. You too need a plan and an idea from God for overcoming. You can thrive on God’s ideas, thoughts, plans and wisdom.</strong> Seek them from His word. You will never overcome successfully on your own, no matter how much you try. If you don’t want to drown and die, then you must decide to dedicate yourself to God and depend on Him absolutely without if, or, but, or maybe etc. If you want to sing today and have a happy celebration, then make a decision to go through any of your present or future obstacles with God. <strong>Use what you have to make what you need happen. </strong>

After the Israelites plowed through their obstacle, they sang a song of praise and worship to God. Praise and worship are inevitable, when facing obstacles, and after victory is won. <strong><em>“Then sang Moses and the children of Israel unto the Lord this song, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously…” Exodus 15:1</em></strong>

Read the rest of the song for yourself. <strong>You really need to read, later on if you can’t now these two chapters from Bible.</strong> With open heart and willingness to learn, hear from God, and adopt the lessons or strategies revealed, your life will never be the same again.

<strong>Let us pray</strong>: Our father in Heaven, we thank you for being there for us when we don’t know what to do. We ask you to help us face our obstacles with courage and trust in your power, for victory and deliverance, whenever we face an obstacle. In Jesus name. Amen Boaz]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“ And the Lord said to Joshua, see, I have given into your hand Jericho…and you shall compass the city…and go round about the city once. this you will do six days, and you shall compass the city seven times…” Joshua 6:2-3, 5.</strong>

We shared on <strong>Plowing through the obstacles</strong>, this morning he will be sharing on <strong>Going Round the obstacles</strong> as we continue to learn how to overcome life obstacles.

Our main text, from the Bible, is found in the book of <strong>Joshua 6: 1-27.</strong> I recommend that you read the whole chapter, after work, quietly and meditate on it. God will reveal more great things to you.<!--more-->

First, let me say that in life, there are obstacles that will not be easily plowed through or problems that will be solved quickly or instantly. But they can be solved and will be resolved, if the right strategy or approach is used. In most cases, a great deal of spiritual weapons and personal qualities or virtues are necessary for overcoming deeply rooted, and tough to move, change or plow through. One of these virtues that anybody hopping to go the long haul with an obstacle is: <strong>Patience</strong>. Let me repeat it: Patieeeeeeeence! Someone once said, <strong>“Patience is a tree whose roots are bitter, but its fruits are sweet.” </strong>It is also said that, <strong>“Patience it the Queen of virtues.” </strong>When this queen is joined together with,<strong> “Faith”, king of virtues</strong>, there is no obstacle or problem or difficulty or circumstance that can stand on their way. Everything bows before them, and departs with great regrets, sorrow and disappointment. They turn <strong>disappointment into appointment</strong> with God for achievement of your dreams and arrival at your destiny. In order to develop these virtues, you must get accustomed to doing three things consistently:<strong> 1.) You must trust God, 2.) You must communicate (prayer) with God, 1.) You must listen to God, mostly, through His word-the Bible. </strong>

In our today’s text, Joshua, who was leading the Israelites to their conquest faced an impossible obstacle- Jericho City. They could not move ahead without passing through Jericho. The wall of Jericho was very high and firm. The foundation of the wall was carefully and strongly laid, reinforced such that the children of Israel could not, whatsoever, enter to attack and destroy and loot the good stuff that was locked in there. Can you imagine the frustration of Joshua and the Israelites?

If you have faced some things that just blocked you so that no matter what you did or didn’t do, you couldn’t move on or make progress or have breakthrough, then you may empathize with these children of God. Remember, I didn’t say “sympathize.” (Personally I don’t like that word that much. Sympathy is one of those commodities I don’t consume that much and I don’t enjoy very much the company of people who offer me sympathy for whatever reason). Anyway, that is beside the point.

Anyway, how did Joshua and his people overcome the wall of Jericho? The Bible says that God gave them a strategy. He told them to gather together and quietly go round the city seven times for seven days. And on the seventh day, they would shout with a big shout, blowing their trumpets. And when they did that, the scripture says “ …<strong>, the people shouted…and it came to pass, when the people heard, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell flat, so that the people went up into the city…and the took the city.” (vs.20). </strong>Amen!

What a simple, stupid, senseless, childish and irrational strategy God gave Joshua. How could he and his troop, as intelligent and sensible as all of them were, believe what God said? Well, they didn’t care whether it made sense or not, they just acted it and got the result. Sometimes God will say things to you that don’t make sense. <strong>Victory from God is won by faith not by understanding or working hard or by use of powerful things or even people</strong>. <strong>The just shall live by faith…not by works</strong>. Today many of you are probably facing obstacles that you have tried to overcome for a long time but you have not been able. Listen to God and start going round the obstacle. You may have to do that continuously for a long time. May be seven hours, or seven days, or weeks or months or even years. Don’t give up. Each time you go round it, you are weakening the walls of your obstacles. They will soon fall down, never again to be seen. Have a blessed going around your wall day!!! Blessings Bro Boaz]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1John 5:4, "He that is born of God overcomes the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith".</strong>

<strong>Overcoming an obstacle by climbing on top of its roof and tearing it down courageously by faith, and with great determination, pushing on until you reach Jesus for your miracle</strong>, is the subject of today’s devotion.

I hope and pray that we can learn some more on things that will help grow our faith so we can be more prepared to overcome many of life’s hindrances we face every day.<!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more-->

In yesterday’s message, I emphasized two virtues that are necessary for overcoming an obstacle that may require going round it for a long time. These virtues are Faith and Patience.<strong> Today, I would like to emphasize again the virtue of faith, in addition to determination, and courage, as necessary tools for tearing down the roof tops of any obstacle that may stand in the way, between you and Jesus, hindering you from receiving your desired miracle. </strong>

Have you ever been excited about something you had been promised and were expecting? I mean something you really would love to have or see and then all over sudden, something happens and you couldn’t have it or see it?. That usually triggers disappointment that can degenerate into discouragement and serious depression. Is there anything that can be done before getting that far? That depends on what choices and decisions you make. You can let obstacles get over your roof and tear you down or you can chose to climb over the rooftops of your obstacles, tear them down, and zoom right into the presence of Christ for your miracle. <strong>“… I have set before you this day life and death, blessings and cursing, chose life…”(Deut.30-30).</strong>

There are four people the Bible talks about in the Gospel of Mark 2, who could not allow anything to stop them from reaching Jesus so they could fulfill a promise they had given to a paralytic man they had picked from the street where he was begging. These four men had faith in Jesus. They believed that Jesus could heal the paralytic and set him free so he could move on with a normal and productive happy life. They told the paralytic about Jesus and the man liked the idea. So, they trekked down the dusty road, and finally reached the house where Jesus was teaching and preaching the kingdom of God. When they arrived, the house was full to capacity and the crowd could not allow them to pass through to Jesus. What did they do? <strong>They made a faith decision, no obstacle was going to stop them from seeing Jesus. They climbed the rooftop, tore the roof, tied the paralytic man’s bed with a rope and lowered him as fast as they could right in front of Jesus.</strong>

<strong>When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.” </strong>Note what he saw-<strong>their faith</strong>. That made him stop what He was doing to give the men who had faith what they badly needed-the restoration of the paralytic’s health and extension of his life. He saw and honored their faith. He didn’t even bother to ask them who they were and where they had come from or why they had committed a property damage crime. He didn’t yell at them for disturbing his meeting and changing His program. He gave them what they came for and claimed by faith and by all means.

The decisions taken by the four men and the paralytic exhibits faith, courage and determination, without which they could not have gone passed the crowed to Jesus. If we also want to see Jesus, and bring all our cares to Him, we must make up our mind that we will climb over the rooftops of anything, including: doubts, fear, ignorance, pride, confusion, disappointment, poverty or wealth, laziness, lies, un-forgiveness, bitterness, racism, religion, traditions, etc. And tear them down and lower ourselves in God’s presence. Then, we will receive whatever we have need of according to His will. The Bible says that if we humble ourselves under the mighty hands of God, He will lift us up in due season. That won’t happen if we are not decided, determined, and courageous enough to take drastic steps of faith for overcoming any obstacle we may face in life. Blessings Boaz]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 2:22, “Then because of Divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by a different route”. (Modern Language), </strong>

<strong>Luke 2:22, “And being warned of God, in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. King James</strong>

<strong>Today’s word, Change course, if necessary. </strong>Everyone dreams of becoming something, or having success or loving someone and or marrying that someone or going somewhere or achieving some goals etc. These are some of the dreams and desires which, when fulfilled, add excitement, joy and happiness in our lives. God, our Heavenly Father wants us to joyous, successful and happy. However, most of the time, we don’t actualize these. We often face unpredictable challenges, traps and even danger that in some cases kill our dreams and us.<!--more--><!--more-->

<strong>We have an enemy whose mission is to steal, kill and destroy (John 10:10). </strong>He does not care who we are or where we are. He will make every attempt to kill us. He schemes plans every day to track us down to either stop us from being what God meant for us to be or kill us. But, the good news is, <strong>“we are safe with God, even in the valley of the shadow of death…we shall fear no evil because God is with us.” (Psalms 23) He also will guide our way</strong>. At times, He will change our plans or routes that we intended to take. For instance, He may let you go to a career you never wanted or marry someone you never thought you could marry or lead you to a town or city you never wanted to live in. He may at times instruct you to move from somewhere or out of a relationship with someone you feel you love for or care about. But whatever He does or instruct you to do, His intention is always good. <strong>He will only change your plans that may not fit in with His will for you</strong>. <strong>He will also change routes if He sees danger a head on the way you are going</strong>. He will instruct or warn you not to do something or head another way. It is important, therefore, for us the children of God to be flexible and willing to change route or our plans when God tells us to. How then can we know His will? Well His will is His word. Listen to the word. Listen to good counsel. Listen to yourself and, align what you are listening to the word. If you obey, you may save yourself from future pain, failure or hardship or death. Don’t insist on your ways always. Don’t have the mentality most people have “<strong> my way or no way.” </strong>Don’t compromise to please people or pride yourself to death. And don’t think that you are very “mature” and “strong” and that you can make it alone. None of us is, we all need God’s leading because he, alone, knows the way that we take.

Job said <strong>“ He knows the way that I take, after He has tried me, I shall come forth like gold” (Job 23:10). </strong>Do you believe that God knows the way or road or path that you need to follow into your future dreams? Do you believe that God has a good plan for you to give you your expectation (Jeremiah 29:11)? If you believe God and all His promises, then let go of yourself and let God change your plans and lead you to any path He may choose whether you understand it or not. Heed to his warnings and you shall live and stay out of a lot of troubles and traps of Satan.
If you don’t, you may miss or lose something. For example:
<ol>
	<li>Samson lost his divine power, eyes and finally died tragically, because he didn’t heed God’s and his parent's warning and advise not to love and marry Philistine women;</li>
	<li>Saul lost his kingship career, was rejected by God and died in battle, a tragic death</li>
	<li>Many children of Israelites died in the wilderness because they ignored God’s instruction, and his servant Moses’ leadership:</li>
</ol>
If you heed God’s warnings, and follow, His instructions, be willing to change route yourself or let Him do so at will, you will avoid a lot of, if not all, obstacles in life including premature death or evil Satan may bring your way and mine. For example:
<ol start="4">
	<li>The Wise men, who announced the good news of Jesus’ birth, went back to their country through a different route. God warned them not to go to Herod. They escaped death!</li>
	<li>Joseph and his young wife and infant (baby Jesus) escaped to Egypt, through a different route, and had their baby escape infanticide by the hand of Herod. <strong>“…Rise, take your child and his mother and escape to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you …And he arose and took the child and his mother by night. And departed to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod.” (Mathew 2:13-15)</strong></li>
</ol>
Is there anything, issue or problem that is or has really been an obstacle in your life? Review carefully, honestly and prayerfully on your beliefs, attitudes, motivations, associations, plans, dreams and desires etc., and if you are convinced and convicted that you need to change route, then do it. And do it today.<strong> You shall live and have good success (Josh: 1:8), blessings Boaz</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>James 3:1-18, "But no man can tame the tongue..."</b>

The tongue has landed so many people into trouble. As much as what people do destroy, what people say can do even a greater damage and it's because what has been done may quickly heal unlike what has been said stays in the memory. Friendships have been broken due to what came out of the tongue. Husbands and wives have ended up in great fights because of the tongue. <!--more-->

<b>Proverbs 18:22, says "Death and life is in the power of the tongue...", </b>as you can see, the tongue is a very small instrument in our bodies but has power. James gives us an example of how powerful the tongue is vs. 4 where he says, <b>"...ships: although they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires" </b>and so is the tongue, it has power to control the entire body. The tongue can start fire and spread it like wild fire fast. The fire is never satisfied when it is consuming and so is the tongue. In school as a teenager, my mouth always landed me in trouble. I never had strength to physically fight so I fought with my tongue. I always got beaten because of my mouth. <b>James </b>again says in <b>vs. 6, "And the tongue is a fire of world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature"</b>. It's by the tongue that cussing and swearing comes about; backbiting and gossip; all lies are spread by the tongue; deception and misleading mostly come through the tongue; persuasion and manipulations are other results of what the tongue can do. There is so much that the tongue can do and yet <b>James 3:8, says "But no man can tame the tongue". </b>We use the tongue to scold, to nag, to slander, to quarrel. No man can tame the tongue. Under pressure and anger, people have said things that should have not come out of their mouths at all. What was released by the tongue damaged big time in small amount of time.

The bible does not say that the tongue cannot be tamed, it only tells us man cannot tame it. This instrument of speech can be used <b>DESTRUCTIVELY</b> or employed <b>CONSTRUCTIVELY</b>. <b>James 3:9, "With it (tongue) we bless our God, and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God" vs. 10 "Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing". </b>

I am not just talking about what you say that affect others but what you also say that affects you. Many speak,  defeat, curses in their lives. Instead of being an encouragement to themselves like David for the sake of God’s destiny, hope and courage for them, they use it as knife to cut their own throats. No wonder many fall in depression and sickness for they have taken their tongue and used it as a lethal weapon to bring destruction to themselves. You can tell the outworking of the internal by what someone has inside. <b>Luke 6:45, says "...of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks</b>" and with this verse you can tell what someone has inside as that is what will come out. <b>The tongue is the manifestation of what is inside, it brings out what is harbored inside.</b> As said earlier, man cannot tame the tongue but God can for what gets out of men's control does not get out of God's control. My tongue and your tongue ought to be used to build and not tear; bless and not curse; promote and not demote; uplift and not bring down. It's in the process of yielding to the Lordship of Jesus Christ that we learn the art of using our tongue to glorify God.

You will never bring your tongue under God's control until you realize you need it controlled. <b>Isaiah 6:5, "So I said, woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips (tongue), And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts"</b>. Isaiah could not see the damage his tongue was doing until his eyes saw the Lord of hosts and how Holy He is and then realized who he was. <b>Isaiah 6:7, "And he touched my mouth with it (live coal), and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged". </b>With his admission and confession, he humbled himself and the Lord touched his lips (tongue) with a live coal. Live coal will burn however it will do you and I good. Isaiah was not ready for service until a transformation took place in his life. Where are you with your tongue? what damages has your tongue done? have you asked for forgiveness from those that you hurt with your words? are you gossiping behind someone's back? "<b>Remember that he/she who tells you about others, also tells others about you</b>". In short, is your tongue under God's control, <b>BRING IT UNDER HIS CONTROL. Blessings Ev</b>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 5:1-20, "3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope”</strong>

In order to function effectively as Christians, we constantly need to remind ourselves that we are nomadic people here on earth. God is working on us climbing us from glory to glory.

<strong>Romans 5:1</strong> says "<strong>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God</strong>", this verse opens the door for us to be saved, the beginning of growth as we move (grow). This is justification which God does for us and none of us have a part in our justification by faith. It’s like we’ve passed an exam we did not sit for and could not pass it on our own regardless of how prepared we were. Because we are justified, we have peace with God meaning the war God had with us through our wicked mind has been settled by Christ on the cross.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 2, “Through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God”</strong>. Grace is what we don’t deserve, it is God’s unmerited favor. When you understand that you are favored, you rejoice, but this is not the end but the beginning and so your faith is elevated because you know who is holding your life.

These two verses about sanctification is where we struggle to embrace<strong>, Vs. 3&amp;4, “3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope</strong>.“ If we rejoice and glory in favor, we need to remember that we can also rejoice and glory in tribulation. I know not of a great tool to grow one than the school master of tribulations. It’s through it that people pray more, it’s an agent of purification, if channeled properly it helps you see God in ways you could never imagine or think. David in <strong>Psalm 119:71 </strong>tells us how beneficial tribulations were to him<strong>, “It is good for me that I have been afflicted, That I may learn Your statutes”. </strong>Affliction, tribulation of any kind acts as a wholesome discipline in leading the pious more highly to value the truth and promises of God.

When we glory in tribulation, we understand that tribulations are just for a season and joy is eternal. <strong>Tribulation</strong> <strong>(hardships) </strong>tailors one into <strong>patience (perseverance),</strong> as patience is not something that is taught in a classroom setting, it is learnt and mastered in the sea of life. <strong>Patience </strong>builds <strong>experience (character)</strong>. Having gone through hardships and patience, you become wise and experienced in giving advice, counsel, make wise decisions in regards to where you get your help. <strong>Character </strong>produces <strong>Hope</strong> and hope does not a shame. It’s in tribulation that a saint should hold on to Christ tight and hope for the life to come. God knows how to take us through the process of life that He may make us be like Jesus, people of character, people who can be at peace in tough times in the midst of a chaotic world. All this work is to make us bear fruit, more fruit and much fruit. The gardener has to prune, dig around the tree, remove the weeds that hinder that tree from bearing fruits. And if the tree is bearing fruit's, He still works on it to bear more and much. There are certain tough things the Lord has allowed in our lives to teach us patience in our work places, friends. As we go through them, our character is being enlarged. We learn to love the unlovely, we learn to forgive and even pray for those who despitefully use us, we learn to put ourselves in someone else shoes to feel their pain.

I thank God that <strong>He moves me </strong>from stage to stage with His hands upon my life. Even in the midst of tribulations, I know that it’s working for His purpose and I’m learning things I could not learn in any other way, bearing fruit, more fruit and much fruit. The more He moves me, <strong>the more he grows me in Him. Blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 3:21, “21 And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them,” (TRSV).</strong>

Adam and Eve disobeyed God, Eve was deceived and Adam listened to his wife and disobeyed God. Immediately they went into hiding because they were naked and a shamed of what they did. They tried to cover themselves with leaves, which did not do a good job as they were bound to dry and fall off.<!--more-->

Instead of taking responsibility for what they had done, they began to find excuses to blame for their fall. Adam blamed his wife, his wife blamed the serpent. Is this not true with us today, always finding it easy to blame something or someone for our mistakes?<i> "She betrayed me, he tricked me, he made me do it etc.".</i> People even blame God today for their mistakes saying <i>“it’s God’s fault, He made me like this”</i>. Shifting blames began in the first marriage and it's still affecting us even today.

Out of what they had done, there came consequences but in the midst of it all, God was merciful to clothe them. The first animals shade their blood for these two when God slew them. The Lord furnished the skins, fashioned the garments, and clothed Adam and Eve. God did it all; they did nothing. After divine condemnation and judgment for this first sin, God acted in mercy to provide a way of salvation, and He demonstrated His grace to cover the shame of man.

<strong>Romans 4:7, "Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, And whose sins are covered;"</strong> This does not mean God over looks our sins and neither did he overlook Adam and Eve's sin by covering it up, this is God taking that which is naked and shameful and clothes it with Christ's Righteousness. The first physical death should have been that of this man and his wife, but it was an animal—a shadow of the reality that God would someday kill a substitute to redeem sinners. Didn't the Lord clothe us in our sin that rendered us naked and ashamed? What a kind God He is.

<strong>Romans 13:14, "But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts".</strong> Putting on the Lord Jesus not only covers our sins but it also protects us from exposing ourselves to sin and the desire to fulfill it. To put on the Lord Jesus also is to put on humility. We try to find ways to be worthy by trying to cover ourselves with leaves of self-righteousness however those leaves need to come down so that the God of grace and mercy can provide us with garments. The prodigal son in <strong>Luke 15</strong> having lost and found his way back home received a different treatment from what he had expected. The bible says,<strong>Vs. 20-22, “20 And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 21 And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ 22 “But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the BEST ROBE (GARMENT) and PUT IT ON HIM, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</strong> He uncovered himself by taking off the leaves by admitting his sin, and his father demonstrated his love and compassion by putting on him the best robe. Notice that the prodigal son did not blame his age, the country he went to, what he got involved in, or what had happened to him. He took responsibility for what he had done and cried for mercy.<strong>Proverbs 28:13</strong>

<b>"He who covers his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy."</b> We praise God for clothing us in spite of it all, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 21:16, “…Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants, You have perfected praise</strong>”

I have come to believe that to know someone really well, see how they deal with pressure. I try to void being stressed out for it is not healthy. I refuse cuss or swear when things come my way because cussing and swearing don’t help anyway, it’s not a mark of a Christian and out of cussing mouth can no sweet praises come.<!--more-->

We need to understand that we are responsible for our actions and therefore we need to be very careful how we deal with overwhelming situations and circumstances. One of the greatest tools to help overcome tough times is praise.  Praise is not a matter of how we feel but a choice we make. The bible tells us from the verse above that “<strong>out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants, You have perfected praise”</strong>.  This is not for some people of a certain class but for everyone. The moment you make this choice, the Lord will perfect it for Himself.<strong>Psalms 150:6, “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord”.
</strong>
<strong>Isaiah 61:3, “…To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for the mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they maybe called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified”</strong>. There is a time to mourn, be down, even get discouraged, but you can never be in the same place forever, you have to rise up, the Lord is changing you to fit in the atmosphere and giving you what you do not have to so as to praise Him. Number one, He is giving us beauty for ashes. Other translations says a crown of beauty instead of ashes. Number two, He gives us oil of joy for the mourning. No joy, no praise, and there is a difference between being happy and being joyful. Being happy goes with the mood, being joyful goes with what is given and choosing to make it work regardless of what you have to face. The bible says that the <strong>joy of the Lord is my strength</strong>, His joy gives you strength to endure. Number three, He gives us the garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness. In my judgement this is the main thing, though it is made, you and I have to pick it up and put it on after taking off garments of heaviness. Garments of heaviness in this case could be stress, frustrations, pressure, overwhelmed by what you have to deal with. You have a choice to remove the garments of heaviness and put on the garments of praise. "<em>Thank You for grace to endure, I praise You for the best You have deposited in me can now come out under all these pressure. This enables me to be calm in the midst of my storm. Many see me deal with things differently and it’s not because I have everything together but because You have given me a new garment</em>” This ought to be our attitude, for the same God who has allowed a lot to come our way is the same God who will give us enough grace and strength to make it. The only way we will make it is by adjusting our attitudes and taking what He has set aside to help us make it through the day, the garments of praise.

In <strong>2chronicles 20</strong> King Jehoshaphat was faced by a great army, he proclaimed a fast throughout the land and all people cried to God. In vs. 15, a word comes to them saying they didn’t need to fight in this battle for the battle was the Lord’s. Therefore they thought to themselves, if the Lord is going to fight for us, we can do something else, we can praise Him. The moment they began to praise the Lord, The Lord  was moved by their praises that He set an ambush on the enemy. The king and his people did not see God fight but they saw the results. You praise Him and you will not see Him fight, you will only see results. Walls of Jericho came down under the power of praises and shouts. Put on the garments of praise today and let the praise go before you as you start the day. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 3:1-21, "The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them"</strong>

The book of Genesis is known as the book of the beginnings, it's the book that reveals creation and the purpose of God for humanity. It presents us with the picture of God being a skillful Creator who does things in skillful ways. If that is not enough, we see things working and moving systematically in the order of creation. Everything God created was done step by step and each step He looked back and concluded it was good. I'm amazed at His creativity, the thinking and planning in the sense that He did not create man on the first day otherwise where would He put him? Many other things begin to make sense when you look at the structure in which He took to make things come out. To continue my amazement at His work, He called things into existence and everything He spoke into existence had no choice but to obey the voice of the Creator, the bible says in <strong>Isaiah 55:11, "So shall My Word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it". <!--more--></strong>

When He speaks, living and none living things hears and act according to His voice. When it came to making man, He reached to the ground and formed man. He did not speak man into existence, He created and formed man into existence and ever since, the Lord is concerned about man because He created human being with a desire that He will live and fellowship with Him. Man had no need to be a shamed of anything for He was covered by the glory of God. Adam and Eve were not led by their own wisdom and knowledge, they were led by the auspicious presence of God, always showering them day and night. Man was complete, perfect, in place until he made a choice. In as much as God created man and showered him with everything, He gave him a will to make choices, but not before He told them of what would happen if they made certain choices. If the Lord did not tell them of the outcomes, we would say they did not know and shouldn't be blamed but there was explanation for every choice. <strong>The bible says that behold I have set blessings and curses before you, choose. Choose ye this day whom you will serve either be God or mammon.</strong>

The fall of man stripped him of the covering he had and all of a sudden, man began living in shame, feeling naked running away from the Lord. He started shifting blames and since then, it’s hard for man to be healed while living in deception. Listen to this, <strong>1John 1:8 says, "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us", 1John 1:10, "If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His words is not in us". </strong>It’s hard for man to take responsibility for his actions and therefore healing becomes hard. One thing I believe is that we will not be healed if we are living in lies, we cannot force wrong things to be right, we cannot justify what is not accepted. If the Lord hated it then, He still hates it today and there is no shortcut or any way around it, the only way is, repent and be ye saved.

Praise to His name, He has so many ways to raise us up when we fail, but we have to be willing to admit that we have failed. No one can lead someone who feels that they know the way, You and I do not know the way for if we know Him not, we know not the way. <strong>John 14:6, "...I Am the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh to the Father, but by Me". </strong>Mark the way it puts it, I Am “<strong>THE”</strong> way not I Am “<strong>A” </strong>way. If He said “I Am” “A” way, it would have messed everything up for that implies that He is one of the ways and so there must be other ways. He distinguished and made Himself the command factor by saying He is “The way” meaning the only way and He is THE truth and THE life. Choose you this day by whose way you will go. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 3:1-21, "The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them"</strong>

A garment is a type of coat or robe especially used for official purposes. In Genesis after the fall of man, Adam and Eve having had knowledge of their nakedness moved to cover themselves by making for themselves clothing out of leaves. When men fell, 1. Immediately they knew they had failed God, 2. They discovered they were naked and 3. They developed a need to hide. We understand that there are things as human beings we can do on our own and might work but the truth is, it will not last for long. They had leaves covering them not realizing that leaves would soon dry up and fall off. So man tries so hard to cover his nakedness only for it to work but for a season. The bible tells me that there are things that if God does not do, anything someone else will do will be in vain.<strong> Psalm 127:1, "Except the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain that build it: Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh in vain". </strong>I would say that this verse means that anything you are going to do if the Lord is not involved in it, however hard you try and do it, it will never work.<!--more-->

<strong>Genesis 3:21, "The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them". </strong>Here comes the Lord who knows that whatever man will do, will not work unless He steps in. He made garments of skin for Adam and his wife. I paused here for a sec, the Lord did not tell them what to do and how to do it, He stepped in and did it for them. We see the first death of an animal, the first sacrifice. Even in the midst of their failure, God still knew how vulnerable man was without Him therefore He reached the poor material “man” and did something for him. Remember the scripture we just looked at, “<strong>Except or unless the Lord does it, man will be doing it in vain”</strong>. Whatever the Lord does comes already blessed, He can only bless what His hands are on.

I also wondered why garments and nothing else, let's look at why the Lord loves garments, In <strong>Exodus 28:1-5</strong>, God is giving instructions to Moses on what to do for the priests He had appointed (Aaron and his sons). <strong>Exodus 28:2-3, "2 Make sacred garments for your brother Aaron, to give him dignity and honor, vs. 3, "Tell all the skilled men to whom I have given wisdom in such matters that they are to make garments for Aaron, for his consecration, so he may serve me as a priest".</strong> Can you see that the garments were to give him dignity and honor and then for his consecration. In the olden times, the priests ministered to the Lord and brought messages from the Lord to the people. There were people who were given special tasks to do this kind of service. When Jesus died on the cross, the ones who received Him, <strong>He gave them power to become, </strong>and now we are priests who minister to the Lord daily. Only God could clothe us again with dignity and honor by sending His Son to the cross to die for the shamed human race and Paul writes in <strong>Romans 13:14, "Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ … ", </strong>putting on the Lord Jesus gives us dignity and honor and we get consecrated which is to say being set apart for the Master. God had to clothe us with Jesus to remove all our guilt and shame.<strong> NOT ONLY DID HE PROVIDE THE GARMENTS, HE ALSO CLOTHED THEM.</strong>

The garments were not made of cheap imitated materials, let’s go back to <strong>Exodus 28:4-5, "4 These are garments they are to make: a breast piece, an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban and a sash. 5, "have them use gold, and blue, and purple and scarlet yarn, and the fine linen". </strong>We said God is skillful in making things, everything is done systematically and goes through different stages. <strong>Because this was a special project ordained by Him, the skilled men could not make the garments outside His instructions (Except the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain), </strong>it was as if <strong>God is giving them the architectural plan executed in heaven in readiness for the building down here</strong>. The plan, the structure, what kind of materials to be used were budgeted for in heaven by God. He gave the final architectural plan as a sign that He has built it already. Yes it may still look like it's ink and paper but it's a done job. <strong>He calls those things which are not as though they are.</strong> Our garments are skillfully designed in heaven and God is executing that plan here on earth through His Son by the power of the Holy Spirit. Garments reserved for us are not made of cheap materials and they are not just made, they are skillfully designed by the Creator of all. It's a blessing to know that my garments is <strong>CUSTOM MADE </strong>and has the label “JESUS”, He is the reason for the garment. Let's look at different garments in the next session. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 3:1-21, "The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them"</strong>

We looked at God the Creator stepping in making Adam and Eve garments and not only making them garments, but He also clothed them. We also saw how the plans of God are executed in heaven to be performed and perfected here on earth. We pray “<strong>let Your will be done here on earth as it is done in heaven”, </strong>in other words, let you Your architectural plan for our lives be performed and perfected here on earth.<!--more-->

When the prodigal son went to a far country and squandered everything, he came back home as a slave however his father had a different plan for his son<strong> Luke 15:21-22, “21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. 22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him;…”. </strong>The one that deserved to be punished received the best robe (garment), a chance to become what he blew. His father's love, his attitude of humility and repentance opened a door for restoration. In <strong>Isaiah 61:3, "And provide for those who grieve in Zion-to bestow on them a crown of beauty, instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and garment of praise instead of spirit of despair" (NIV). </strong>Amen, the Lord already has a covering for those who are mourning, He structured it in heaven and He is commanding His chosen ones to execute them here on earth by telling them to provide unto the grieving in Zion a crown of beauty, oil of gladness and the garments of praise. Many are struggling to worship because they are wearing garments of heaviness leading to depression, confusion, broken, have no joy but the Lord would have His word come to you who is struggling today, <i>"I have a garment of praise for the spirit of despair to give to you, I will take what you have and replace it with what I have, garments of praise". </i>

Joseph in the book of Genesis had a father who loved him so much so he made him something special, <strong>Genesis 37:3, "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age. Also he made him a tunic (coat, robe) of many colors</strong>". Jacob had a reason for making his son a coat of many colors. I see it this way, though Joseph had a coat of many colors, he did not know that was symbolic for when he was sold into Egypt and later became the number 2 man, he was able to serve everyone without discrimination, he was able to serve all races, colors, all personalities, all genders in other words, he served everyone equally. We’ve received Jesus, the coat of many colors, we can now serve anyone and everyone for what we were not we are now because we’ve been made.

Time fails me for there so much about the garments we could learn from, example, Jesus wore garments while here on earth and we see a woman with the issue of blood touching the hem of His garments in <strong>Matthew 9:20</strong>. At His crucifixion, the soldiers parted His garments among them. There is something about the garments and we are blessed to have God prepare and clothe us with them.

I’m glad He has me covered,. My needs, desires dreams, ambitions and goals are covered. When you think that nothing is happening, just remember that He has you covered. You may not feel it, it is not a matter of feeling, it's a matter of knowing and believing that He has His garments on you. Prayer covers us; and just like the paint covers the surface when applied, the blood of Jesus has covered us. <strong>"The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them", NOT ONLY DOES HE MAKE THE GARMENTS FOR US, HE HAS US COVERED WITH THEM. Blessings Ev</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Philippians 4:6&amp;7, "... and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your heart and minds through Christ Jesus"</strong>

One of the things that has taught me how the Lord grants us peace is while being driven by someone who I know. Of all my brothers, only Kefa I trust his driving. When he is driving, I can doze off and relax. Because I know his ways, <strong>that knowledge gives me peace in side to ride with him</strong>.<!--more-->

The world craves for peace. You can give love but I don't think you can give peace, you can speak it. This is one of the greatest tools people need in their life. Many suicides take place because the victims most of the time have no peace within. Peace in the home, at work, in marriage. But what is peace? <strong>Peace is to be calm, quiet, still, silence, harmony</strong>. In other words, peace is the absence of war. Without peace, chaos, frustrations and confusion erupt and the devil is the enemy against peace. If he can steal away your peace, he knows he would have stripped you of something very important and powerful.

True peace originates from God. Let's look at three aspects of Peace. <strong>PEACE WITH GOD, PEACE IN GOD, and PEACE OF GOD</strong>. <strong>Romans 5:1, "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have PEACE WITH GOD through our Lord Jesus Christ</strong>". This is experienced when we receive Christ. We are no longer children under His wrath, we have made peace with God in that regards. When I am not in Christ, I am an enemy of God and the only way to settle it is repentance and faith.

<strong>Romans 15:13, "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and PEACE IN BELIEVING, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost". </strong>This is peace in God knowing that I have hope and joy for I have escaped the wrath to come, having passed from death to life. This is also peace knowing that I am no longer alone, He lives in me. My peace comes from knowing that one day when this life is over, I will be with Him in heaven and not spend eternity in hell.

The message today dwells on <strong>PEACE OF GOD</strong>, <strong>Philippians 4:7, "... and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your heart and minds through Christ Jesus". </strong>This is the kind of peace we need every day to sustain us through life. I don't see how one can truly have the peace of God without first having “peace with God” and “peace in God”. The peace of God is what we need when we have overwhelming and out of control situations. The Lord taking over as the driver and you sleep through His driving is “peace of God”. Your knowledge of who He is and what He is cable of gives you peace inside. <strong>Psalm 34:8, "O, taste and see that the Lord is good, blessed is the man who trusts in Him</strong>". <strong>Peace comes through trusting</strong>. This is not even your peace but the peace of God. The funny thing is that you can sense it but not explain it because it surpasses all understanding.

How do I get this peace, <strong>Philippians 4:6, "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make your request be known to God</strong>", stop worrying and trying to dictate God and believe that He's has it covered. Surrender everything to Him through prayers and take the back seat. Don't forget to thank Him for what He is doing and what He will do, then go to sleep, rest, relax, be calm, <strong>Psalms 46:10, "Be still (be at peace) and know He is God". </strong>How do I maintain this peace, <strong>Isaiah 26:3, "You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You</strong>". This is meditation on God’s truth about Himself. Paul continues to write in <strong>Philippians 4:8, "whatsoever things are true...noble...just...pure...lovely...good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy, meditate on this things</strong>". You keep the peace by meditating on the things of God. If you have no “peace with God” and “peace in God” ask yourself, where are you heading to? If you lack “peace of God” in what you are going through, ask of Him and when it comes, by all means maintain it. The peace of God will sustain you through everything, some situations may not change immediately but having peace to go through it will bring you joy. Peace of God will pull you together while chaos from the devil will tear you into pieces. Without the peace of God, you will be torn into pieces. Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 37:4, "Delight yourself also in the LORD, And He shall give you the desires of your heart" </strong>

I received an email some time back with this question, "How to find God's will for your life". This is one of those topics I have no direct answer to. Walking with the Lord has led me to know what His will is for my life. I still don't know what His will is in certain areas but I can see the direction He is leading me to. I have shared from this topic before but for the sake of the new people and those who are struggling, may this word ignite something in your spirit.<!--more-->

I believe that for someone to know the will of God they must first know God, I don't mean know "about God" but actually "know God". When you see things that He responds to, what brings glory to His name, things He disapproves etc. then you know what to do. All these are revealed in His word. His word becomes the manual book<strong>. Romans 10:17, "Faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word of God</strong>". This is the beginning to understanding the will of God (Seek ye first) before knowing the will of God for your life (and all these other things shall be added unto you). His word teaches us what God is like so us to respond according to His word. When you know God, you begin to learn your position in His kingdom; you begin to look for opportunities to operate in your position. Knowing God brings a massive change as in all about yourself is sifted and He fills you with more of Him and less of you.

<strong>Proverbs 10:32, "The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable</strong>”. This vs. talks about the "righteous", those who Christ lives in their lives. Those who have been made new creatures know what pleases Christ because of what they have learnt from Him. These are the ones with new appetites stirred up by Christ living inside. Anything that comes at this time is no longer for selfish desires but seeking opportunities to make Him shine.

<strong>Psalm 37:4 "Delight yourself also in the LORD…". </strong>The word <strong>"DELIGHT"</strong> means to take great pleasure. This as an opportunity to please the Lord with my life style because of what I have learnt from Him. In the book of Genesis, Cain and Abel brought sacrifices before God. Cain brought what he had done by himself and God did not receive it, Abel on the other hand brought that which the Lord required, a blood sacrifice. He was bringing to God what would please Him and he was offering it to God by faith. Remember again, "<strong>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God</strong>". Abel was delighting himself in the Lord, God had showed them what pleased Him. How did I know what God required? I learnt it from His word and I began to seek opportunities to glorify Him in all that I was doing. How did I know His will? Through promptings also confirmed by other people, through gifts given I never had, by thought He dropped in my mind in light of His word. What do all these have in common? They are to bring GLORY TO HIS NAME. This has been my way of delighting in the Lord. God is faithful because when you recognize that it's not about you, He raises you to greater levels, gives you blessings you were never qualified for simply because you delight in Him.

<strong>"…And He shall give you the desires of your heart</strong>", this scripture can be misapplied. Anyone can have ugly, selfish or wrong desires of their heart but here is the key, when you delight yourself in the Lord, He will show you things He has stored for you in His vault. You begin to have an appetite for them, those becomes the desires of your heart and God gives them to you as His will for your life. There are many who will never progress because they are waiting to hear God speak audibly. At times God will open a door and you will need to walk through it. At times He will give you a thought and expect you to begin to develop on that thought as He works with you, it all begins with delighting in the Lord. I have learnt that the more I sought opportunities to glorify Him in what I do, the more He blessed me. That is how I have progressed to be a prayer warrior, a teacher of the word, a minister through devotions, a preacher, witnessing on the streets, encouraging others and even counseling etc., I know because I know Him and more are to come, it's all about glorifying Him .

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 5:25-34, "...For she said, if I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole..."</strong>

Desperate people do desperate things if they know that whatever they've have to do will make an impact and a difference in their lives. When you know your restoration depends on something extraordinary, bigger than you, you will not care about what people say or think. A woman with the issue of blood was in a situation where she spent everything trying to fix her condition. For 12years she had spent money, visited worthless physicians with no improvement only to be left hopeless.<!--more-->

Her condition had robbed her of freedom, relationships, comfort, joy, peace and even money, nevertheless she was determined to get well. At times you just need assurance that there is still hope in the midst of hopelessness and knowing that whatever is impossible with man is possible with God. She heard about many miracles Jesus had performed (Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God (Jesus) and she perceived in herself that her health will only come back through Jesus Christ. Ashamed of herself and her condition, she encouraged herself, <strong>"... if I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole...". </strong>Her faith is so much boosted to the extent that she knows that if just His name is a strong tower, then even power would flow through what He is wearing. I see her telling herself how she didn’t even have to talk to Him or get noticed after all no one wanted her around or be around her anyway.

In my life I have seen areas that I really needed to touch the hem of His garment because I knew what I was going through not everyone would understand my situation. A desperation propelled me to find Jesus and touch His garment. You will not always have someone help you find Him but yourself, and you have to be strong enough to encourage yourself.<strong> “It shall be well” ought to be your attitude</strong>. <strong>She encouraged herself in the midst of hell and her encouragement helped her make the first move</strong>. Crawling under people trying to find her way to Jesus was a move she made. We don't hear her telling people how she is too sick and needs special help to reach the Master, she decided to move looking unto Jesus. When there is no one to carry you to the Master, calm and encourage yourself, crawl if need be, push the obstacles aside and make it to the Master.

Something amazing, everyone who had been walking with Jesus some at distance and some very close to Him. With that in mind, at least people touched Him whether they wanted to or not and Jesus never questioned them, but when this woman touched Him, He felt power leave Him and He stopped, looked around and asked, <strong>"WHO TOUCHED ME?"</strong>. Isn't it funny that many people can walk around the Lord and even touch Him but there is no great impact than for someone with extraordinary faith in the midst of pain encourages herself just to touch His clothes and be made whole? <strong>When I have a desperate situation it calls for desperate measure</strong>. <strong>Make prayers that causes heaven to be in motion and hell to be in chaos. </strong>Prayers that shows your total dependence on the grace and mercy of God.

All of sudden all attention is on a woman of faith. She was not even supposed to be there, she wasn't even looking for attention. Even more interesting, she wasn't even expecting Jesus to look around and be concerned with her life but there she was. She had touched His garments, she was made whole according to her faith and now the process is about to end. When she confessed that she was the one who touched Him, He turned around and said, <strong>"Daughter, your faith has made you well, go in peace and be healed of your affliction". </strong>Can you imagine being called son or daughter when you were hopeless at one point? His love goes beyond our afflictions and He does care about what we go through. If He was able to pause for a second when He was on a journey and attend to this hopeless lady, don't you think He will do the same for you? One last thing, if she touched His garment and was healed, why would Jesus tell her again to be healed? This was to let her know that it wasn't only a physical healing but eternal also, her sins were forgiven and complete restoration. <strong>Hebrews 11:6, “but without faith, it’s impossible to please Him…”, SHE TOUCHED MORE THAN HIS GARMENT, SHE TOUCHED THE HEART OF THE LORD BY HER FAITH.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Romans 8:31, “What then shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?"</strong>

There is nothing exciting as seeing God display His power in situations we have no control over. In the process of God displaying His power, the old silly devil does the same. We often get terrified of his power and find that we are not progressing. I want us to understand that the devil is powerful, no doubt. He has his way of performing magic tricks, no doubt. We cannot render him powerless but we sure can render powerless what he sends our way because of who is for us. God is amazing, He is not going about rendering the enemy powerless, He goes about showing greater power than the devil’s.<!--more-->

<strong>Exodus 4:2, “So the Lord said to him (Moses),” “What is that in your hand?” He said , A rod”</strong>. Pastor Phil in the past has talked about the foolishness of God being wiser than men’s wisdom, here we see God giving Moses a rod to use to deliver the children of Israel. Instead of God giving him an army, He gives him a simple shepherds' rod. Why is the rod so important, because <strong>Exodus 4:20 reads </strong>“<strong>And Moses took the rod of God in his hands</strong>”. In other words, he carried the power of God in his hands for every situation. Aaron being Moses’ spokesman sometimes carried the rod of God for Moses. <strong>Exodus 7:10, “So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as the Lord commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent</strong>”. If God is going to go against the works of the enemy, He will device something that the enemy tends to use and use it against him. God had told Moses that He would harden Pharaoh’s heart that He may display His greater power in those times. He cast the rod and it turned into a serpent, however the enemy also has power,<strong> vs. 11, “But Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers; so the magicians of Egypt, …for everyone threw down his rod, and they became serpents”</strong>. Many stop at this point because the power of God comes first and then the power of the enemy comes second, and both powers look equal. Here is the difference <strong>vs. 12, “…but Aaron’s rod (God’s rod) swallowed up their rods”</strong>. God’s power went far beyond the enemies’ powers and swallowed everything that had been presented. That is what God does for His children, as He is displaying His power, He will allow the enemy to display his and then swallow his. Instead of chasing and wounding the serpents, He took them out of the picture. What then shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us.

Here is another encounter. In <strong>Numbers 21</strong>, the children of Israel had been complaining to Moses about leaving Egypt, God gets tired of their complaints and in <strong>Numbers 21:6, “So the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, and many of the people of Israel died”.</strong> This is what happens when Lord if not for us, we get bit by the enemy. As usual Moses gathered courage to go before God to repent on behalf of his people and in <strong>vs. 8, “Then the Lord said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live”.</strong> What a picture of the cross, God doing something big that renders the works of the enemy powerless. In the beginning they were powerful killers, but then God gives orders for a serpent to be made and put on the pole, a picture of Christ taking a form of sinful man yet without sin. This is a picture of Christ being the Savior of every mankind from death. As long as our eyes are on the cross, yes the serpents may be around and we can see them and encounter with them, but their power’s have nothing against us. Christ on the cross rendered his works powerless, <strong>1John 3:8, “…for this purpose was the Son of God manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil”</strong>. A time to destroy his works is now, a time to destroy him will come later. So when the enemy comes against you, don’t freak out because of his power, just let him know that God will knock him out and swallow him, God is setting him up for that. When he reminds you of your past, remind him of his future. IF GOD BE FOR US, WHO CAN BE AGAINST US FOR OUR GOD IS POWERFUL!!. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Corinthians 10:5, “Casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ”</strong>

<strong><a href="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5969" src="https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/blog.jpg" alt="blog" width="236" height="258" /></a></strong>

Have you seen on TV “Police chase videos”. It’s interesting to watch and sad at the same time. People trying to run away from the law because of what they have done. Instead of surrendering peacefully, they think they can outrun the law. The more they try to, the more they break other laws making it worse for them. You find that they are exposing other people to great danger by their reckless behaviors. Something fascinating, the police will not give up chasing until they have apprehended the suspects. It doesn’t matter how long it takes, they will add more force to the chase if need be until they’ve arrested the culprits. Let’s swing this to the spiritual.<!--more-->

The mind is powerful. The mind can create, form, imagine, expound, retain things. The eyes most of the time fuel the mind and the mind in turn retains what it has received and even make more to it than what was received or is already there. Murder, lust, depressions, confusions, fear have their roots in the mind because the mind is very powerful. It’s one of the hardest things to control just like the tongue. The mind becomes the battle field and the target for the enemy. The scriptures talks about renewing the mind which is to take something evil out and replace it with something good. A mind left to wander, is A WILD MIND ON THE LOOSE running from the law without yielding to the Holy Spirit to arrest it. As fast as it may try to run from the Holy Sprit, the more it damages by numbing the conscience. When Jesus spoke about lust as being adultery, it showed how the mind has also power to commit sin. Also it’s recorded in the 6th commandment, you shall not murder, but if you hate your brother or have in your mind to murder, you have already done it in your mind/heart even if you don’t do it physically. The mind creates a god it’s more comfortable with. A god who has no sense of moral and justice. Once again you can see that the mind is very powerful and needs control.

<strong>2Corinthians 10:5, “Casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God</strong>”. Every thought that is not of God should be cast down. I would describe casting down as being able to sit on what is trying to control you. You may NOT stop some imaginations from appearing but you sure can stop them from living there. Martin Luther said, “<em>You can’t stop birds from flying above your head, but you sure can stop them from building a nest on your head</em>”. "<em>IMAGINE you are driving down the hill at 120MPH, suddenly you try stepping on your brakes, you discover they are not working, a head of you is a big truck you see yourself colliding with"</em>. How can you stop yourself from being killed? think about it for a sec, what options do you have to escape this horrible accident from happening? here is how to stop this accident, “STOP IMAGINING”. Remember I started with the word, “IMAGINE”. Imaginations creates worse things that haven’t even happened yet or building things that are not pure, it’s cure is to cast it down by stopping to imagine. It’s work is to try and take the place of truth about God’s word. <strong>Fear exalts itself in the mind and pushes God’s knowledge about victory out, lust exalts itself and takes out the knowledge of God on morals. </strong>The mind creates another image of God which is the false impression of who God is and that has to be cast down.

“<strong>...And bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ”</strong>, you are your own police to arrest your mind (thought) from getting away. The police chasing will not rest until the person on the loose is apprehended so are the Christians, the mind on the loose has to be chased however far it goes, arrested, taken captive under the obedience of Christ. The mind that lusts, builds fear, confusion, frustrations has to be arrested to have a sound mind. A mind on the loose without control will do more damage not just to self but to others also <strong>2Timothy 1:7</strong>, "<strong>For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" </strong>The Bible does not just talk about having a mind, but a sound mind, a mind under control, a mind that meditates on good things accepted by God. We all have warranty to arrest the mind, what are you doing about it? Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Chronicles 19:5-7, "5Then he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, 6 and said to the judges, “Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment. Now therefore, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take care and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, no  partiality, nor taking of bribes</strong>."

Have you ever stood before a judge? This can be quite an intimidating thing, knowing a judge can make a decision that will affect you being innocent or guilty on a matter. A judge is to base their decision on the law. King Jehoshaphat made a real mess of things during his reign. Therefore, “…<strong>Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King Jehoshaphat (king of Judah), “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord? Therefore the wrath of the Lord is upon you. 3Nevertheless good things are found in you, in that you have removed the wooden images from the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God.</strong>” The prophet condemned the alliance of King Jehoshaphat with King Ahab (King of Israel) as Israel was divided into north and south. In the days following King Ahab’s evil rule in Israel, God raised up Jehu (see <strong>2Kings 9:2</strong>) to completely destroy Ahab’s descendants. Jehoshaphat upon hearing from the Prophet Jehu set up judges, and instructed them to focus on three things:<!--more-->

First he instructed them, “<strong>Take heed to what you are doing”</strong> They were judges who were given the jurisdiction to make judgments concerning the people of the land. They were given an awesome responsibility of power. To quote Uncle Ben from Spider Man, “<em>with great power comes great responsibility</em>.” A judge can literally have the power of life and death in his hand. His decision is final and therefore cannot be reversed. If a person is found guilty of a crime worthy of death, once the sentence is carried out, the verdict cannot be reversed as the person is dead! Hence to be commissioned as a judge is no small task.

Secondly, he instructed them in their legal source and status stating, “<strong>…for you do not judge for man but for the Lord</strong>.” These judges were to judge others on behalf of God Himself. Hence their final decision (verdict), was in a sense God’s decision, therefore it was crucial to make right decisions. The Bible states of God, that He is no respecter of persons (<strong>Acts 10) </strong>meaning He is not biased because of one’s social status, etc…, God cannot be bribed. What could someone give God anyhow, money, power, authority, He has it all in perfection! They were to make right judgments, or better said, righteous judgments (<strong>John 7:24</strong>). How would they accomplish this? Check out the next point.

Thirdly, he instructed them about the Lord being with them, “<strong>who is with you in the (matter of ) judgment.”</strong> It is crucial to base a judgment not on one’s own feelings, intuition, social status, ethnicity, or mood, but on the law. There is no law higher or greater in all the land than God’s Law. The judges had to stay near to God and His Law in order to carry out their great responsibility of judging others and therefore make righteous judgments. Jesus said “<strong>Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment” (John 7:24)</strong>. This is why when we share our faith with others; we take them through God’s Law, not our own personal ideas or opinions of righteousness. I can’t walk up to someone that I don’t know and tell them if they are going to heaven or hell based on my eyesight. However, I can tell them what God’s Word says about the matter, and then agreeing with God’s Word tell them only those that repent and put their trust in Jesus will enter in the narrow way of Heaven, while all the rest will enter the broad way of Hell’s destruction. In doing so, I make a judgment, but I make a righteous one, because it is based on God’s Word, and not man’s word. We would do well to heed the instruction given to the judges by Jehoshaphat, and take heed to them in our evangelistic endeavors. Jesus instructed His disciples, “<strong>Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20  teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age</strong>.” Amen.

Fourthly, he instructed them, <strong>“let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take care and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.</strong>” The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, which one needs to make a righteous judgment. When one fears God, wisdom will guide one not to show partiality or accept bribes. One cannot sugar coat the gospel for fear of losing a job, losing a friend, nor with hold the gospel because of ethnic prejudice. Sin is upon all (<strong>Romans 3:23</strong>), and there is only One remedy for all (<strong>Romans 6:23</strong>), hence we must bring thus great gospel to all, in the fear of the Lord, by His wisdom.

Realize that you have been given a great responsibility to take this Great Gospel into all the world, walking in the fear of God and by wisdom help people know the very judgment of God, who they will one day (sooner or later) stand before. This God will sentence them to Heaven or Hell, so the time to help people see God’s final judgment is now not later. Now go and be faithful to the call!

Until the nets are filled…

Phil The Evangelist &lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 3:3, "For thou O Lord are a shield for me, the glory and the lifter of my head"</strong>

After talking to different people and looking at my life, I see that we are all fighting battles. This is not an occasional thing but a daily thing. It may be fought at different degrees and levels but the fact remains we are battling. Often times I sit and wonder whether what I am battling will ever come to an end. At times I feel like there is victory and then right after getting victory in one battle, another surfaces and the battle continues. If we could avoid battles, believe me, I would be the first one to avoid them yet we are not called to avoid but face them.<strong> I believe you can survive battles without offensive weapons as long as you have defensive weapons</strong>. If you just have the offensive weapons, I guarantee you will be exposed to more dangers because offensive will tackle mostly what you see while defensive tackles all corners seen and unseen.<!--more-->

Joshua fought battle after battle as God gave him victory. There was no indication that there would be no battles to fight, all that God told him in <strong>Joshua 1:5 was, "No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you" </strong>The Lord would strength him to battle while He was a shield for him the rest of his life. An assurance "<strong>no man shall be able to stand before you</strong>" is like a sneak preview of the end of a movie you are about to watch about your life. Moses had been given the rod of God (shepherd which symbolized power) to deliver the Israelites but he said "<strong>If Your (that is God) presence is not going with us, do not let us go from here</strong>" I can see a man who had offensive weapon but would rather have defensive than offensive. How many times do we want the battle to stop when it's too much, instead of the Lord stopping it, He becomes the shield to protect us from all the fiery darts. <strong>Shields are not offensive weapons but defensive weapons</strong>. At times when you get weary from fighting, all you need is a shield. Let the enemy continue to throw his spears, swords, punches whatever the case until he gets weary. On the other hand, you will be resting under the shield getting your strength back to face the enemy. From the movie "Rocky", Rocky Balboa had something going for him. He would shield part of his body his opponent was punching. His opponent would use all the force and energy to punch his shield, and yes it did shake him a little but wasn't doing a greater damage. When the opponent was beginning to lose strength, that is when Rocky would retaliate. In the process of shielding, he was gaining strength and strategy. <strong>Psalm 62:2, "He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved" </strong>

<strong>Ephesians 6</strong> talks about putting on the whole armor of God. We have guarding your waist with truth, breastplate of righteousness, shoding your feet with the preparation for the gospel of peace then in <strong>verse 16, "ABOVE ALL taking the SHIELD OF FAITH with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one</strong>" Assurance that God is present to protect us is our shield of faith. Having the confidence and trust in no one but God to save us. Nowadays people's first question when looking for a car is how safe is it? Yes they value the power, the fancy stuff but they would rather know the safety gargets that can shield them from serious accidents and save their lives. What do you prefer, more power or more safety? I want to wake up each morning knowing the Lord is my shield, He encourages me to know that He would be with me. When I run from the battle ground with my face looking down because of the disappointments, He will lift my head up with an assurance that He is present. If you've been craving for just the offensive weapons, be assured of how much you need the defensive above the offensive. <strong>Isn't it amazing how the Lord would give us offensive weapons but not defensive for He is that to us already<em>? “</em></strong><em>If Your presence will not help me start my day, Lord I'm positive I won't make it”</em>. Blessings Evans

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>James 4:8, “Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</strong>

What is the presence of God all about that Moses desired and so was David and the rest? There is something about His presence that makes one to see and deal with Him and things differently. In Genesis, Jacob had a vision, upon waking up, he said,<strong> “The presence of the Lord was here and I knew it not.”</strong> Moses said”, “<strong>If Your presence is not going with us, do not let us move from here (paraphrased)”.</strong> The children of Israel had the ARK of the Covenant which represented the presence of God. The bible calls Him<strong> Jehovah Shammah</strong> which means<strong> Jehovah Present</strong> and not absent. He is not coming or going, He is here, now, available, ready.<!--more-->

What is the ARK in the bible?<strong> An Ark is something that affords protection and safety</strong>, therefore the ARK of God (Covenant) is<strong> a throne where Yahweh Himself was present in the midst of His people</strong>. The children of Israel cherished the ARK, it was a sign of God's presence with them. No enemy could subdue them in the presence of the ARK. <strong>To learn about the ARK of the Covenant eliminates one from thinking or treating it like a lucky charm or a holy object that you can rub and get whatever you want</strong>. He is present and He has His dwelling in our midst, and though people who do not know Him think that we are using Him as a lucky charm, they have a wrong understanding. <strong>We don’t worship God because of what He can do for us, we worship Him because of who He is. </strong>

<strong>In 1Samuel 4:10, 11, “So the Philistine fought, and Israel was defeated… Also the Ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, died.” </strong>The Philistines fought to capture this thing that had always been with the Israelites. They did not understand what they were messing with. All they cared about was capturing the ARK and having it positioned in their camp as a lucky charm. If it worked for the Israelites, they were destined to have it work for them. The problem was, they were treating the ARK as an “IT” while the Israelites treated the ARK as Him, a sign of reverence and respect. What finally brought about Eli’s death is the fact that the Ark of the Covenant was captured. He heard that his two sons had died but that did not nearly affect him like when he heard that the ARK was captured which meant that the presence of God had departed. His daughter in law was pregnant at that time, when she heard Israel was defeated, her husband and her brother in law killed and the ARK captured, she immediately gave birth to a child and died. She named the child<strong> Ichabod, saying, “the glory of God has departed from Israel."</strong> I've always wondered why God’s presence departed from Israel until I read this chapter in <strong>1Chronicles.</strong>
<strong>1Chronicles 13:4, “And let us bring again the ARK of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.”</strong> David desired the<strong> presence</strong> of God while Saul desired<strong> position</strong>. During those times, people desired more of the Spirit, desiring the presence of God, having God fight for them and<strong> the more they gained positions (things), the more they began to lose focus</strong> and that is why they lost the ARK. Look at Paul speaking,<strong> Galatians 3:3, Are you foolish? having begun in the Spirit, and now are made perfect by the flesh?”</strong> You lost it because you moved from the Sprit to the flesh, from the presence to the position. David desired to bring back the ARK for they saw where they messed up big time and he desired to fulfill<strong> James 4:8, “Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.” </strong>You and I need to draw nigh to God by seeking Him and He will do the same. For us to do so, we need to cleanse our hands, and purify our hearts and choose whether we want the presence or the position. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1Chronicles 13:14, "The ARK of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And the Lord blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had"</strong></p><p>David while he had a high position thought he could do things his way including handling the things of God. Our position should not dictate how we handle the things of God, our obedience through submission is what opens doors for His blessings. We can gain positions without letting positions steal the presence of God by starting in the Spirit and staying in the Spirit regardless of whether we have positions or not. <strong>Positions are temporal but God's presence is eternal whether in our lives or not</strong>.<!--more--></p><p>It happened that as David and his men were bringing the ARK of the covenant home, he did not follow the proper procedure of handling the ARK. The Levites were the priests chosen to carry the ARK and be worshippers however David decided to continue to carry the ARK on a new cart as the Philistines had surrendered it to them on a new cart. David instead of disbanding how the Philistines handled the ARK, he continued with it. One man by the name of Uzza was struck dead by God when he reached to help the ARK that had stumbled while on the cart. Because David did not follow the proper way of handling the ARK, one man died. <strong>1Chronicles 13:12, "David was afraid of God that day, saying, "How can I bring the ARK of God to me?" </strong>David recognized the mistake he had made, God wasn't going to be handled the philistine’s ways who abused the ARK since they brought it in for their personal gain. God has His way of being served and in as much as we may try to do it our way, it will not work. It’s <strong>His way or no way, His will and not ours</strong>. They were excited from the beginning about bringing home the presence of God, all of a sudden, the joy turned into mourning. David decided to leave the ARK in Obed-Edom's house who I believe was a Levite, meanwhile David went back home to inquire of how the ARK should be handled and this time to bring home the ARK the right way.</p><p><strong>1Chronicles 13:14, "The ARK of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And the Lord blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had". </strong>What a blessing to know that when His presence is handled right, He opens the windows of heaven and pours us blessings that we will not even have enough room to contain them all. <strong>This was not an earned blessing, this was a bestowed blessing</strong>. A man opened his house for the presence of God to dwell in inform of the ARK of God, which opened ways for blessings. The Lord says, <strong>"Blessings, I will bless you" </strong>but we have to allow Him to come in and dwell with us for the blessings to flow. Obed-Edom might have not had a great position but the presence of the ARK sure made him be blessed<strong>. Proverbs 10:22, “The blessings of the Lord makes rich, and adds no sorrow with it"</strong>. This is more than the material richness, this goes for spiritual stuff, wisdom, understanding, discernment, character enlargement. The blessings of the Lord touches on every part of our lives.</p><p>Are you worried about position or His presence? Is the position more important to you than His presence? Do you want the blessings without the presence? As long as the ARK of God remained in Obed-Edom's house, God blessed him and his home abundantly. I desire the ARK always in my life, which means desiring God's presence every day. The Israelites did not enquire of the Lord during the times of Saul; I have purposed to go back to inquiring of the Lord even more because I need Him and I need more blessings.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Psalm 23:1-6, “ The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. 2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever”. </strong>

Precursor: David wrote this Psalm when he was an old man and reflecting back upon his life. After killing Goliath, getting chased by Saul, being King of Israel, committing adultery with Bathsheba, he reflected back upon all that he had been through in his life and penned the most famous Psalm, as a summation of the Lord in his life. This is written from a shepherd that shepherded sheep and then the nation of Israel.<!--more-->

<strong>“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want”</strong>- David was well versed in the life of a shepherd for that was his first role as a boy. He personalizes it by saying “my shepherd”. It was God who was leading him. The shepherd always provided all the sheep needed and the Lord was certainly no different.

<strong>“He maketh me to lie down in green pastures”.</strong> A shepherd brings the sheep to green pastures because that is where the food is and they can lay down there comfortably. The Lord nourishes our spirit and hearts with His love and truth, which is more valuable than food.

<strong>“He leadeth me besides still waters”.</strong> Shepherds would always bring the sheep to still waters because if they drink from running, rushing water the sheep could get swept away by the current. If the sheep fell, their wool would act as a sponge and drown the sheep. Surely our Shepherd leads us to places that we can spiritually drink of His living water that are still, and healthy. Jesus said if we drink of the water He gives we shall never thirst again, because the source never runs dry - praise God!

<strong>“He restores my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake”</strong>. The shepherd cares for the sheep and helps them when they are sick or overwhelmed.

<strong>“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me”</strong> The shepherd is there with the sheep through the most horrific times. <strong>God is certainly there because there is a shadow, which can only be cast from the light</strong>. His rod is there to count and discipline the sheep. God needs to discipline, and He only disciplines those he loves. The staff was to pull the sheep up when they ended up wondering away and the shepherd would find it hanging off a ledge. He would reach down and pull the helpless sheep up to safety.

<strong>“Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over”.</strong> God can set a feast in the presence of our very enemies. The shepherd would anoint the nose of the sheep to keep a certain kind of parasite from burrowing up the nose of the sheep into the brain. WOW! We are anointed with God’s precious Holy Spirit to keep the enemy from getting into our head with things.

<strong>“Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever”</strong>. All in all because the Shepherd stayed with David his whole life, all that God had to offer: His goodness, and mercy never left David. He was a man in the palace of the Lord, and would dwell in the house of the Lord (heaven) all the days of his life (eternally).

Application: Don’t focus on Death Valley, but rather the presence of the Lord in Death Valley.

Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 6:8-23, "And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them"
</strong>
Our God is a great God, something we need not to forget. He knows how to battle His enemies in the battlefield. He does not fight according to men's ways but His. There are days He battles for us and there are days He equips and teaches us to battle. Many times we may not be prepared for the battle but He is. We may be caught unaware, He is always aware. <strong>Psalm 46:1, "...He is a very PRESENT help in trouble".</strong><!--more-->

 
Elisha in our text was a prophet of God and not a warrior. I’m positive  he even knew how to use an arrow but he was feared of men in every land. In this text we see him as a prophet in Israel especially a time Syria and Israel were at war. What made a difference in Israel is that God was on their side which made Syria fear Israel greatly. Now I understand why Moses would not go anywhere without the presence of God,<strong> Exodus 33:14</strong>. God had made a covenant with Israel that He would fight and defend them. <strong>He would go before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire</strong>. Everywhere they went, they concurred lands because God was with them. Can you imagine everywhere you go and everything you deal with, your enemies become subject to you simply because the presence of God in you? I believe that I can go anywhere, be anyone God wants me to be and survive anything as long as His presence goes with me for without Him, I can do nothing, <strong>John 15:5.</strong>
 
We completely trust and submit ourselves to God’s sovereign will for His presence to accompany us everywhere we go; He is Lord of our lives. The bible says in <strong>Psalm 37:23, "The good steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord."</strong> How can one order our steps and direct our paths if He is not with us? We constantly need to seek His presence that we may overcome, <strong>Proverbs 3:5-8, " Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; 6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. 7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and depart from evil. 8 It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones. "
</strong> 
Moses could only deliver the children of Israel because the presence of God was with him. He was not a warrior, he did not have an army, all he had was a rod of a shepherd and the Lord. That is all God needed  to deliver the Israelites from their enemies. If you are ever going to do the impossible, it will happen because the Lord is with you. To continue, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

1John 4:4, "Ye are of God ye little children for you have overcome them, for greater is He that is in you that he that is in the world</strong>". Elisha was an ordinary man with an extraordinary anointing. There was nothing good in him but the Power and the presence of God, and so when you begin to see enemies scattered and put to shame, it is not because they are threatened by you, it is because of the One greater in you. The bible says, in <strong>Psalm 68:1, “Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered”.</strong><!--more-->

 
In the passage on <strong>2Kings 6</strong>, the king of Syria discovered that Elisha did not have an army, just his servant. Why would a king who learns that Elisha has no army send an army on horses and chariots to pursue  him? Of course they knew Elisha was not even wearing combat gear to face the Syria's army. They could have sent less than 10 people and they would captured him without any problem. I believe the reason why they sent an army is because of what they had seen in Elisha. The enemy had no chance as they knew whose Elisha was.

We face situations, facing the enemy of our soul and because we know  Him, we are at peace. It amazes me how we constantly bind an enemy whose existence is already threatened by the presence of our Savior. What did Jesus tell Peter, “<strong>upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it”</strong>. He said upon his confession, this truth, I will build my church and my people and the gates of hell yes will come, but it will not prevail.  Let's not forget who we are, whose we are and where we are planted.
 
In the morning in vs. 15 Elisha’s servant  wakes up, goes out  and behold there was a great army surrounding the place where he and Elisha camped. Now let's back up here for a minute, if you look in the previous vs. you find that Elisha knew things done or said in secret, he was a prophet. I believe he already aware they would be pursued and now surrounded yet he was still able to sleep peacefully till morning. What an amazing thing, the presence of God made him comfortable in a situation that would make his servant terrified if he was made aware a head of time. I saw this with Peter who was able to sleep peacefully in jail and so was Daniel in the lion’s den. This is where we are different from the unsaved, they can only sleep peacefully or be calm when they know for sure that everything is okay. Their peace comes when everything is going the right way, for us believers we get it in both ways whether things are good or bad for it's not even us but God within. God with us is God within us. 

The bible says that <strong>"the peace of God surpasses all human understanding</strong>". Mark the word the “<strong>peace of God</strong>”, it's not even our peace but His peace. That is why I don't get surprised when I see some Christians go through things and yet they are still maintain peace, they should be worrying about it but they are not, in fact they sleep through it. I see the peace in them but I know it’s not their peace. My blood brother Andrew is in peace despite being on a wheel chair with spinal injury he suffered in January 2013. They told him that he may never walk again, that did not shake his peace. We visit with him to encourage him and we find him encouraging others at the rehab. A couple years ago my friend Pastor Paul had brain surgery and during that time, he was the most peaceful man I had ever met. He still had to go through treatments that were affecting him. When they told 10% tumor left in his brain and was dangerous to remove, he told the doctors, "my God will heal me", God with him and in Him gave him peace to ride it out. Today, that 10% is gone completely.
 
Hysterical people use too much energy trying to worry and fix stuff, however someone who has the peace of God inside has nothing to worry about. He can speak out peace because he has it in. Someone once said, "NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MAN WHO DOES NOT HAVE TO DO IT HIMSELF". I see that in Elisha and that is comfort to me. God is with us, to continue blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 6:8-23, "And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them"</strong>

To add to the last previous part, let me add in <strong>Mark 4:35-38</strong>, vs. 35, Jesus had been teaching on parables, He then told His disciples to cross with Him to the other side. As they sailed by boat, <strong>“…a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. 38 But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow” </strong>

Comparable to Elisha, Jesus was aware that the moment they began crossing to the other side there was going to be a great windstorm. And knowing life threatening experience awaited them, He went down at the bottom of the boat and fell fast asleep. In the midst of the storm beating the boat and the water beginning to fill the boat, He was very comfortable in the storm and slept through it. Instead of His disciples remaining encouraged by the presence of the creator (Jesus) in the boat, they panicked and became hysterical.<!--more-->

Here is something for us to ponder on, how would you have dealt in the same situation? You have the storm beating and filling the boat with water while Jesus is in the boat? Would you have been like the disciples? Here are some things if they had considered would have made them comfortable in the storm. 1. Jesus (God with us) was present in the boat, which alone should have been comfort to make them comfortable. 2. Did they think Jesus could drown? He was (is) God. 3. Did they think the wind had power over Him? Their reaction indicate that was not in their mind, they went to find Jesus where He was a sleep and launched a complaint by saying <strong>Mark 4:38, “…“Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?” </strong>In the midst of the storm they felt left alone, hopeless and helpless with the assumption that Jesus did not care. Jesus cared that’s why He was present right in the midst of the storm with them. <strong>His presence alone was enough even if He did not act</strong>.When they woke Him up from His sleep, He dealt with the situation, He said, “<strong>Peace, be still</strong>”. <strong>The storm was not defeated when He spoke, it was defeated the moment He was present in the boat with them.</strong>

This should be an encouragement to us that when Jesus is in this boat (US), we can never sink and drown simply because He cannot drown. I know for myself when the windstorm comes the first thing is panic then try to find ways to calm the storm instead of calming my nerves and encouraging myself that Jesus is present in this boat. What a comfort we have that Jesus is ever present even the times we feel we are facing storms suggesting His absence. He has said that “<strong>He will never leave us, nor forsake us</strong>”, what a promise. “<strong>Greater is He that lives in us than he that is in the world”</strong>

Coming back to Elisha handling his servant vs. 16 <strong>"And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them".</strong> See how God works, He revealed to Elisha the army backing them up but He did not reveal the same to Syria the enemy. I believe that revealing to Elisha the army with them was to show him that God’s army (God) is ever present, <strong>He reveals and shows Himself so strong to those who trust in Him</strong>. God is with us and God is in control, we ask in His name, He acts according to His will, to continue, Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>2Kings 6:8-23, "And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them" </strong>

And Elisha called on God to cause the Syrian men on chariots and horses be blind vs. 18. If someone was pursuing you then all of a sudden something happens to them, they will stop pursuing you and begin to worry or attend to what has just happened to them. Here we see men pursuing Elisha and because they became blind, their priorities changed, they needed to be led by someone. Elisha prayed his servant’s eyes would be opened and then he prayed that the Syrians Armies eyes would be made blind.<!--more-->

<strong>Vs. 19, "Now Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek". But he led them to Samaria"</strong>. Very interesting if you think about it. The army knew of no man except Elisha and his servant were the only ones present with them. They knew who Elisha was and his voice the reason they came down from the mountain to capture him. When their condition changed, the eyes they could see by was gone. All blind, helpless and confused seeking help, Elisha offered to bring them to the one they were seeking, the one who happens to be offering them help. Once again I believe Elisha saw beyond the natural to see that these were misguided men who needed help and direction. May be no one had ever showed them kindness, love and acceptance, maybe where they came from they were trained to hate but here is an enemy who first brings them to a place where they discover they can do nothing of themselves and then offers to help them. We meet many people who at times are tough to handle or relate to, some are family members. Their attitude, character and the like makes it hard to work or be around them, they became our enemies in one way or another. If we were to see beyond the present to see that some are not actually enemies but poor misguided people looking for acceptance, affirmation, encouragements and love. I would rather not fight them but pray that God would blind their eyes from seeing the bad things they want to see in me and reach to that place where they become helpless and need someone to show them the way, kindness and love. <strong>Love covers multitude of sins</strong> the bible tells us. This where we ought to be different, Christ is with us and in us.

<strong>Vs. 21, "Now when the King of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, "My father, shall I kill them? shall I kill them?.</strong>.. Finally Elisha led these men to Samaria to meet the king of Israel, what happens when an enemy after you is handed over to you in a helpless state? revenge comes to mind. You have a chance to gossip, be mean, do evil and desire something worse to happen to the ones you would call your enemy, however you chose not to. You may have had those days when you had a chance to destroy your enemies and you came under conviction to drop your charges against them. <strong>The bible says love your enemies </strong>and that is true but at the same time we need to know the enemy we can love and the devil is not one of them. Vs. 22 So Elisha told the king not kill them. I would imagine the king’s his disappointment with Elisha, he may have thought something like this, "<em>well if we can't kill them, we will make them our slaves or we will make them pay for having troubled us; how about making them suffer until they wished they were dead</em>". <strong>Matthew 5:44, "But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you"</strong>. What a word!!

Is it easy to forgive and love your enemies? Of course not, however it is a key to release. Elisha at his disposal could have destroyed these men. After all they came to capture him to destroy him. Instead of rending evil for evil, he chose to do something out of the ordinary, I will share the final piece in the last part. God with us enables us to see what we were blind to see and deal with people in ways our natural sense would not allow. Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a><strong>2Kings 6:8-23, "And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them" </strong></a>

As we conclude, we see Elisha pursued and God causing his enemies to be blind, and instead of taking advantage of the situation to revenge, he chose to be different.

Without releasing and letting them go as they came, the king was encouraged to show kindness to them. They set food before them, and not tiny little food but a great feast as the bible puts it. Read and you will discover, they ate, drank and had a good time and thereafter they were released to go back to their master and so the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel. Here is what we are encouraged to do, <strong>Romans 12:20, "Therefore if thine enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him a drink: for in doing so thou shall heap coals of fire on his head". </strong>Elisha was able to treat these men well because of God, and the more he also showed kindness the more the people around him became affected and they changed their ways too.<!--more-->

Don’t we want to desire Him more so as to make a difference in people’s lives especially those we would have wanted to put in the enemy column? If the Lord’s presence was not with Elisha, he would have treated them the way the world would. If the Lord was not with us, we would be no different from the world. I see the same with Jesus as recorded in <strong>Acts 10:38, "How God anointed Jesus Christ of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with Him" </strong>Jesus had more enemies than anyone on earth, to make the matters worse, He knew them and yet He still showed them kindness and goodness. He had all the power He needed to destroy them yet He used the power to serve them why? because<strong> Acts 10:38 says, “…for God was with Him</strong>”

<strong>Luke 6:27-36 “27 But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28 bless those who curse you, and pray for those who spitefully use you. 29 To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either. 30 Give to everyone who asks of you. And from him who takes away your goods do not ask them back. 31 And just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise. 32 “But if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. 33 And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. 34 And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much back. 35 But love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and evil. 36 Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful”. </strong>Elisha did all these expecting nothing in return for God was with him, may the Lord’s presence make a difference in our lives<strong>. </strong>Blessings Ev

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 29:18, “Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keeps the law, happy is he.” </strong>

My wife and I sometime back had some dear friends of ours over and in the midst of our conversations my friend Steve shared that he liked to read things that talk about the BIG picture.  Think of a puzzle for a moment.  Perhaps when you were growing up, you, like I did, found recreation in putting puzzles together.  My father taught me to set up the puzzle box in a way that I can always see the picture, and to always begin by laying out the boarder of the puzzle first and then to fill in the middle.  Each piece is important and living out the BIG picture takes time.  What can we learn about the BIG picture from putting together puzzles?<!--more-->

 
1.   Always have the BIG picture in view.  “<strong>Where there is no vision people perish.”</strong>
 
What is our life supposed to look like?  My dad instructed me through puzzle box, so I could have a point of reference to go by.  When one starts and finishes a puzzle it should start to look like the picture on the box.  To the sports fans, the scoreboard becomes the point of reference when the goal is winning.  Many have quoted the famous verse from <strong>Jeremiah 29:11, “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future…</strong>”  We have a God that always sees the BIG picture, a God that has a plan, a blueprint for our lives. Can we even see a glimpse of that plan in our lives?  Helen Keller the famous American author and educator who was blind and deaf, 1880-1968, said, “<em>The most pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight but has no vision.</em>"  When we don’t have a vision, the BIG picture of things in mind, Proverbs tells us people perish.  The cross was a BIG picture of Noah’s ark, Jesus on the cross was the BIG picture of Isaac on the altar; Jesus’ sacrifice was the BIG picture of Yom Kippur “the day of atonement, etc…  Since the beginning (<strong>Genesis 3:15</strong>) God had redemption as the BIG picture.  Our point of reference, our “box to look at”, is Jesus Himself, and every facet of our lives should reflect the BIG picture. Thank God He sent us an example (<strong>John 13:15</strong>).  
 
2.   Each piece is important, designed, and shaped to fit somewhere in the BIG picture “<strong>In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps", Proverbs 16:9
 </strong>
You have an important place in this world, but the level of appropriating that is in your consultation of God’s will, and walking obedient to His plan. Your life successes or failures have a ripple effect on the BIG picture that God is trying to accomplish in and through your life.  <strong>Ephesians 2:10</strong> reminds us “<strong>For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</strong>”  God prepared in advance our place in the BIG picture of His plan.  An important question is “where do I fit in?”  For those of you that know, are you staying on that road, and can you see the BIG picture, looking back, and looking where you are now?  For those of you that haven’t answered the question, this is the very question, when answered which will give your life purpose and meaning.  Who wants to live a meaningless life?  “<strong>Thy will be done</strong>,” should spill from our hearts as it did from heart of Christ.  His will for you is in His Word, read it for yourself. 
To be continued…
 
Application:  Do you have a vision, a BIG picture mentality?  How does God’s will fit into your plans, or how do your plans fit into God’s will?  Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 29:18, “Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keeps the law, happy is he.” </strong>
 
3.   Start with the boarder first of the BIG picture - “<strong>Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and your plans will succeed", Proverbs 16:3</strong><!--more-->

 
If we commit our plans to God, they will succeed because God will have His say in them, and they will succeed based on our obedience to Him.  He may not agree with all of our plans, and after all He is the plan maker, we are to be His plan followers.  When we can make plans within His plans then they will succeed.  Because out BIG GOD has the BIG picture in mind.  God put the Old Testament like the border of puzzle.  Think of all the OT prophecies and laws and how the New Testament, FUL-FILS them, fully fills them.  But many people, like Peter, didn't see it.  Jesus told Peter, “<strong>Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men</strong>”.  Peter didn’t have redemption of the world, BIG picture in mind; he didn’t want Jesus to die.  Consider the Transfiguration, where Jesus was transformed, before the eyes of Peter, James and John the brother of James.  Peter said, <strong>“I will put up three shelters-one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.</strong>” While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, “<strong>This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!”</strong>  Moses represented the Law and Elijah the prophets, but Christ previously said <strong>Matthew 5:17 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.</strong>”  God spoke the BIG picture out of heaven not with the emphasis on Moses, Elijah, and Jesus, but only on Jesus as He is the BIG picture of both of them, as both of them pointed to Jesus.  Peter focused on all three of them, because Peter didn’t see the BIG picture of things.  It’s easy to get sidetracked in life when our eyes do not stay focused on the BIG picture of things.  Do the roles and responsibilities that you have point to Jesus?  How do you treat your family, what kind of student are you, what kind of character do you emanate as an employer or an employee, etc…?  Those people in the Tsunami disaster were going to die anyway one day, it was tragic because so many died perhaps earlier than they would have and all at once.  The BIG picture is that whichever way we die; we will all stand in judgment before the KING.    
 
4.   God has called us to live within the BIG picture in mind- Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed - <strong>Proverbs 15:22</strong>
 
Plans fail for lack of counsel, because many people don’t receive counsel or advisors in their lives.  Do you have a board of directors of mature believers in your life who advise you about your life?  Can these see the purposes of God connected to your life?  God’s purposes are:  to give God pleasure in worship, to be part of God’s family in fellowship with other believers (genuine care), to become like Jesus and be discipled and make disciples, to use our gift and abilities to serve God in ministry, and to fulfill out His mission to evangelize the lost.  Are you doing these things?  Is the life you are living answering the question:  What on earth am I here for? 
 
These purposes should be connected to your family, job, school, relationship, recreation, entertainment, etc….  Why, because living God’s purpose as the focal point, gives your whole life meaning and purpose.   
 
Application:  Is your life within the borders of God’s plan for your life?  Are you living each of God’s purposes in your life?  Are there advisors in your life to ask if that is true?  Give yourself an honest self-evaluation and ask your advisors what they see. Blessings Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>James 5:16, “…The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”</strong>

Many times I’m asked to keep someone in prayers for financial breakthrough, healing, salvation, protection among others. And what a blessing to bring such needs before the Lord and I always do. A few years back the Lord began to deal with me about praying for needs, something bigger than what I was used to praying. Hope I can lay some groundwork first and then give examples from the bible about effective praying that avails much.<!--more-->

<strong>I am constantly reminded that prayer is not so much about what I get but how I am changed by it and in it</strong>. And because prayer changes me, it changes how I approach God too for my needs and needs of others. For example, if you were to pray for someone’s salvation, how would you pray? You may pray something like this, “<em>Lord save my loved one, so that he can know you and go to heaven when he dies</em>” Nothing wrong with that, what I call an effective prayer for a lost one would be something like this, “<em>Lord awaken my loved ones lost in sin and rebelling against you, Lord help them see their sin, wound  their pride and ego, take away anything that cloud their minds and blocks their eyes even if it’s a good thing, that they may surrender to you in repentance and faith. Lord I’m not praying that you save my loved ones so that they can go to heaven, I’m praying that you save my loved ones for your glory, so that they can serve You, live for You, walk with You, and one day be with  You in heaven</em>” . The emphasis is more on who the prayer is all about, in this case, it’s about the glory of God through Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. It’s easy to pray for salvation when you see how it will benefit you, “<em>if my loved ones are saved, I will see them in heaven; oh and the fights at home will stop; at least we can raise our children in the things of God as we would be in agreement; he can be better husband, treating me right etc.</em>”, all these are ok prayers, but not effective to avail much, why? <strong>James 4:3, “You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures</strong>”, either we do not ask for the right ends or not in a right manner, not in faith or fervency. There is amiss in those prayers that takes God off the focus and places the focus on the person you are interceding for. <strong>Where there is amiss, there is a drift.</strong>

How about praying for someone else who has a need. Instead of first praying that God provide the need, how about you pray that God establish their faith. If you are praying for them and they are doubting, how will that be effective? Jesus performed miracles based on the individual’s faith, God given faith. <strong>Matthew 9:22, “But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, “Be of good cheer, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour”</strong>. <strong>Matthew 9:29, “Then He touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be to you.” </strong>Their faith gave God the glory. In praying also, why not sometimes pray that in that situation God would grow them more in holiness, patience, establish their character, integrity, that the blessing may be more to His glory than for what it means to them and to you. Praying that His will may to prevail.

In our own needs we could be praying “<em>God get me out of this</em>” or pray effectively, “<em>Lord teach me to endure, teach me self- denial, help me learn all that I need to learn in my situation. Help me see the bigger picture than what I desire for you to do in my life</em>”. We often hear declarations in prayers “<em>claim it and receive it, blab it and grab it</em>”, that can be dangerous and this is why, you may not have any character and integrity to maintain the blessing. So what was supposed to be a blessing turns into a curse. How about we pray, “<em>Lord prepare me, show me my pride, my stinginess, build a strong foundation in me, help me grow in the fruit of the spirit, perform what is best  for Your glory</em>”. How you pray will reveal more of your motives, many times our motives are for selfish reasons. We therefore need to learn to pray effectively for ourselves and those we pray for. I will share on examples in the bible of effective prayers. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>James 5:16, “…The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”</strong>

What comes out of our mouths in prayer reveals what’s in our mind and heart when we pray. Have you ever asked yourself while praying, how would Jesus pray in and for a situation like the one you are praying for? <strong>Philippians 2:5, “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus</strong>,” to have the mind of Christ will drive away any of our selfish desires that we may pray the heart of God in a situation rather than our own.<!--more-->

<strong>John 11</strong> is the story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead. John tells us of Jesus' relationship to Lazarus, Mary and Martha (sisters and brother). John says, Mary is the one who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil. And when Lazarus was sick<strong>, vs. 3. “...the sisters sent to Him, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.” ... Vs. 5. “Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus</strong>”. John stresses the word “love” for a reason. There was such a bond, such connection. Anything they may have needed the One who loved them would provide if they asked. Lazarus is now sick, they ask (pray) the Lord to come and heal. We would expect Jesus to rise up and rush to the aid of His friends He loved. Well, we are told He stayed where He was for two more days. Jesus knew Lazarus would die and He let him die, He did not even make it to the burial. What was the mind of Christ in this situation and how would others have processed all these according to His mind?

Let’s find out why He did not respond to their prayer when they needed Him the most. He had a bigger picture in mind than what Lazarus’ sisters and others would have thought. For them a brother alive and well was good enough while Jesus had a different way of looking at it<strong>, </strong>Point 1. This was a situation that would allow God the Father to be glorified in it and so was His Son glorified through it, <strong>vs. 4. “When Jesus heard that, He said, “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.</strong> Point 2. He wanted the situation to build the disciples faith far beyond healing <strong>vs. 15, “And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe”. </strong>Point <strong>3. </strong>He wanted to show those who were present that He was sent of God and had the power to resurrect the ones He loves (salvation) <strong>vs. 41,</strong> “<strong>Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. 42 And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the people who are standing by I said this, that they may believe that You sent Me.” </strong>The sisters and the people who came to mourn did not have the mind of Christ otherwise they would have seen the bigger picture. Mary and Martha both said “<strong>Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died” </strong>at different times, <strong>vs. 36, “Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!” 37 And some of them said, “Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, also have kept this man from dying?” </strong>minds limited to the natural human thinking.

Jesus on the other hand wanted to pray the heart of the Father in the situation. How about when the devil desired to sift Simon Peter as wheat, the Lord did not rebuke the devil, what did He tell Peter, <strong>Luke 22:31, “31 And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.”, </strong>Again we see the Lord addressing a bigger picture. The bigger picture shows that it's way bigger than us and our needs. When we have the mind of Christ, our approach to effective praying would be through His eyes and not ours. Making prayers that are Christ centered and for it to be Christ centered, it has to begin with the mind of Christ because it’s all for His glory. To continue, Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>James 5:16, “…The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”</strong>

I believe that some people God has honored the most are the people who did not waste their trying times. Instead of blaming God or asking themselves and the Lord why they were in such situations, they began to praise and thank God for counting them worthy to go through it. Their prayers in situations like these changed as they saw an opportunity to pray to God to do something greater for Himself while they were in the situation. This is why I say, “<strong><em>don’t waste your trying moments</em></strong>”.<!--more-->

There has been great persecution of believers in some parts of India. While we would want to pray for persecution to stop, you know what most of them are praying? That they will be bold to stand firm in their walk and in their preaching. What an effective prayer.  Why pray in this manner? they understand that through adversities, the gospel spreads like wild fire. The more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites and even killed them, the more they multiplied and grew <strong>Exodus 1:12</strong> and so is India and many other countries where there is great persecution yet it’s not silencing the gospel.

<strong>Acts 4</strong>, Peter and John are arrested for preaching Christ. They had just performed a miracle that started the trouble. They were then brought before the high priest and their family members, and with boldness, Peter preached Christ. Even with greater threat they still preached Jesus, (<strong>Acts 4:17-21)</strong>. How would you have prayed in this situation? probably for the persecution to stop, but they prayed in this way <strong>vs. 29, “Now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word”. </strong>They were not going to let adversities dictate what they could and could not do. They saw it as an opportunity to preach the word and their cry to God was for boldness. They refused to waste their trying period.

Then we see Paul and Silas in <strong>Acts 16</strong> perform a miracle by casting out demonic forces out of a girl who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling (<strong>Acts 16:16)</strong>. The girl’s masters seeing their lost means of income, dragged Paul and Silas before the magistrate, falsely accusing them of many things. They were beaten severely, thrown in prison, their feet locked, and even having guards to securely watch them. In their situation, the bible says<strong> Acts 16:25</strong>, “<strong>At midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them”. </strong>What did they pray for, to get out? I doubt it. I believe they preached Christ and then prayed for the prisoners’ hearts to be softened to receive the gospel. Then <strong>“Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were loosed.</strong>” , <b>Acts 16:26.</b> It appears their work there was almost done until the prison keeper awoke from his sleep, almost killed himself because he thought all the prisoners had escaped, but Paul assured him that they were all present. <strong>Vs. 30, “And he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” 31 So they said, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household</strong>.” Imagine if they just sat there nursing their pain and complaining to God, they would have wasted their trial moments. Instead they maximized the opportunity to preach, pray, give praise to God through singing in which they led the prison keeper and his family to the Lord. They too refused to waste their trying moments. After it was said and done, I could see them saying, "<em>it was worth the experience</em>".

You could be sick and may end up in hospital, or are facing the worst trying time and feel like asking God the “Why” question, or feeling persecuted at work to name a few. What is your prayer when you feel like you are between a rock and a hard place? Are you going to waste your trying moments by complaining or pray to God to show you how to maximize every opportunity in that trying moment? <strong>James 5:16, “…The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”</strong> , your effective prayer will avails much. To finish, blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>James 5:16, "...The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much</strong>

Hannah in our text this morning had a loving and caring husband. She was married to Elkanah who also had another wife called Peninnah. We are not told who was the first wife of the two, we are only told Elkanah loved Hannah more than Peninnah for we see how they each got treated when it came to getting gifts <strong>Vs. 4&amp;5, "And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife... vs. 4 But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah"</strong>. God had blessed Peninnah with the fruit of the womb, she had children while Hannah was barren for the Lord had closed her womb. You would think her joy would come from all these gifts. In life we always assume that people who have riches are happy because they can afford to have anything they want, but truth is many are very miserable.<!--more-->

Hannah may have been ok with her situation until her rival Peninnah began to provoke her severely to make her miserable according to <strong>1Samuel 1:6, </strong>and I am not surprised for I saw this between Leah and Rachel, Jacob’s wives who had the same rival. Leah had children, Rachel did not, Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and therefore Leah provoked her daily and that made Rachel desire a child. Hannah was provoked so much that she desired a child of her own too. We too can be provoked by people around us to desire bigger cars, bigger houses, bigger promotions, bigger ministries or anything you could be provoked to want but the question is,<strong> what is the motive that drives you to pray</strong>. Yes they are good things you can desire to have but the motive for desiring them can be wrong. Do you want to be big to fit in, or feel better than someone else, or not feel rejected, or that let your pride get the best of you? Remember <strong>James 4:3, "Ye ask and receive not, because you ask a miss, that you may consume it upon your lusts". </strong>In other words, at times when we ask, it's for the wrong reasons, even something good. Hannah desired a child, question is, what was her motive? Did she want a child to get back at her rival, or did she want a child so that she could feel blessed too, or that she would not be attacked anymore? Any of the above could have been her motive and therefore year in year out she prayed but God would not answer her prayers. Don't blame God for not answering your prayers when you know for sure that if He answered them, you will not go to church anymore, you will not give Him glory, you will be prideful. God will not give you something He knows will destroy you until you begin to get your act together. Some people desire to be in a relationship, married, used of God, etc., the question is what is your motive?

Hannah may have revisited her year in year out prayers and saw how selfish her prayers were the reason God would not respond to such prayers. Then she prayed an effective prayer <strong>1Samuel 1:11, "Then She made a vow and said, "O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maid servant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, no razor shall come upon his head". This is not about eloquent praying but effective praying</strong>. This is the type of prayer that supersedes our selfish desires and ambitions as we begin to see that anything God is going to bring our way is not for us but for many. He may entrust it in our custody but it's not for us. Her vow was for her son to be God's servant all the days of his life, I could imagine God saying "<em>I’ve waited for you to pray this way for I now know for sure that honor and glory will come back to me</em>". After she prayed this prayer, her desire was granted and more than she had asked for. She asked for a male child, God gave her a prophet <strong>Ephesians 3:20, "Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us”</strong>

Now I understand why many people cannot be used of God, they will love the praises of men and God will not get any of it. <strong>2Corrinthians 4:7, "But we have this treasure in the earthen vessels that the excellence of the power maybe of God and not of us". </strong>The bible says that our God <strong>is a jealous God </strong>and He will not share His glory with anyone. About 12 years ago God could not use me fully for every time He did something through me, I took the credit in the sense that when people thanked me, I responded "you are welcome" instead of saying “give God all the glory”. He began to work in me and then trusted me with the work again and the more I gave Him glory, the more He used me; the more I decreased, the more He increased because my motives were now right.

When I pray now for a promotion, a better place to live, and to be used more is because I want to glorify Him in all things and others be blessed through the elevation for it's all about Him. My motive is to build a testimony that many may know that God is able. John the Baptist was told that Jesus was doing the work that John should have been doing, his response, <strong>John 3:30, "He must increase, that I may decrease". </strong>Because of Hannah's change of prayer attitude, Samuel is born to become one of the greatest prophets for he served many. Yes the mother rejoiced to have received a male child (prophet), God used His gift to the woman to reach many, God also blessed her some more <strong>1Samuel 2:21, “And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile the child Samuel grew before the LORD”</strong>. Rachel bore Joseph who became the No. 2 man in Egypt. What is that thing you have desire and prayed about? what is your motive? <strong>The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much"</strong>. This concludes the series.

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 1:35, “And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed”</strong>

Do you pray? When do you go to the Father in prayer, is it when you need something, when you are out of solutions, or perhaps when you have exhausted all your other resources and options? I think we can all testify that we are guilty at some level of a lack of prayer for one reason or another. Can the man that has a busy work schedule, or a mother busy with her children, or an athlete busy with his or her schedule use the excuse that there is simply not enough time?<!--more--><!--more--><!--more--> Funny isn't it how people can use the provisions of God, the job He provided, the talents He showered upon us, the relationships He blessed us with yet would He provide these things all at the expense of being in relationship with the very ones He calls His own children? We must pray, and I am not referencing those that claim that they pray all day long, whole driving, while at work, while walking, etc... Imagine having a relationship like that with your spouse, children, or a dear friend, how intimate is that relationship going to be if you are not actually sitting down apart from distractions together? If there was anyone that did not need to pray, but that certainly modeled prayer it was certainly our Lord Jesus. Mark records the routine prayer life of Christ in the first chapter and verse thirty-five of the book bearing his name. <strong>The ESV study Bible states, there are four verbs (rising/departed/went/prayed) [and thus might I add modeled which] emphasize Jesus’ resolve to have fellowship with his Father. </strong>

<strong>Rising-Prayer begins with desire and manifests in discipline. </strong>First, Jesus rises at a very early hour while it was still dark. He had just endured a rigorous day of ministry the previous day, but He nevertheless arises early to refresh Himself in prayer. Why? One must establish a discipline of waking up early, at a time free from distractions to enter into an atmosphere to get alone with God and get refreshed from labor whether it is ministry specific or not. Christ desired to be alone with His Father to be in intimate relationship with Him. Consider this: Christ never lost something that He needed to pray to find, He was never sick (as far as Scripture records) so He did not need to be healed from an infirmity, He didn't seek a prestigious occupation, actually He left His carpentry shop for the road ministry. He did not own His own home that He needed to beautify. He yearned however to be in intimate fellowship with His Father, and made provision in His life to do just that. Oh that I would have that same constant desire and yearning.

<strong>Departing</strong>-<strong>Prayer begins with departing from others to enter into fellowship with the Father. </strong>Christ left His twelve disciples for a time being, the same ones that the Father gave Him (<strong>John 17)</strong> to raise up, and departed from their company so He could get alone with the Father. Perhaps if He would have stayed there He would have been distracted by the sounds of sleeping or perhaps, if I may use some preaching license here, snoring disciples. Perhaps He would have thought about the activity and even the shenanigans they displayed throughout the previous day as He looked upon them as they slept. Do you ever get distracted by attempting to pray where you are, perhaps in a room with a television, computer, or some other hobby or pastime your enjoy? Do you find yourself being drawn toward those other things rather than to the Lord? I ask these questions because I have been there. <em>“I just wanted to check my email real quick, to the neglect then of my "knee mail".</em> Would I prefer hearing from another or from the Lord? When Jesus asked the twelve if they were going to leave Him and depart like the false converts of <strong>John 6:66</strong>, Peter replied, “<strong>Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, 69 and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.”</strong> Do you and I believe that? If we believe He has the words of eternal life then why would we not depart to be with Him to glean those Words from the Father Himself in prayer through His Word? To continue Blessing Pastor Phil

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 1:35, “And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed”</strong>

<strong>Going- Prayer causes one to go to where one can be alone with God. </strong>Businessmen take trips to meet with important people to be with than individual because some things cannot be handled through email, on the phone, or even through video chat. How much more important is the God that we serve, to get alone with Him, and seek him. It is true that one can meet with God anywhere, but one should establish a place as free from distraction as possible. It was Susanna Wesley mother of John and Charles Wesley that had nineteen children, but still would make it a point to get alone with God.<!--more--> Her kids knew when mom threw her apron over her head, you do not to disturb her because she was meeting with God. <strong>Jeremiah 29:12-14</strong> states, <strong><em>"12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. 13 You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. 14I will be found by you, declares the Lord...”. </em>We must seek him, because if we do we will find Him!</strong>

<strong>Praying-Christ centered prayer. </strong>Again if there was one that could have forsaken prayer, one would certainly think that Christ would be the one. After all He knew the will of the Father, and walked perfectly in His will. Yet He loved the Father and desired, departed, and went to have intimate fellowship with Him. One might set up one’s life in discipline, and then end up doing something other than praying.

Christ was the Word of God in the flesh, yet still prayed. He showed the perfect balance of prayer and the Word of God. <strong>John 17</strong> records the high priestly prayer of Christ. However just prior to this, E.M. Bounds reminds us "<strong><em>Jesus had just finished instructing His disciples (John 13-16)</em></strong><em>. Now He prayed for them, because prayer and the Word of God go together. If we have all Bible but no prayer, we may have a great deal of truth but no power. It would be "light without heat." On the other hand, if we have all prayer but no Bible teaching, we are in danger of becoming fanatics-heat without light! Zeal is a good thing, but zeal without knowledge is usually destructive. A proper balance of Bible study and prayer is important to a balanced Christian life. "Moreover, as for me," said the godly prophet Samuel, "<strong>far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way</strong>" <strong>(1 Samuel 12:23).</strong> Note the balance of prayer and the Word of God. "And now I commend you to God [that’s prayer] and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up..</em>."

When you are in prayer, you must be guided be the Holy Spirit but of course the Holy Spirit will certainly move and flow in perfect alignment with the Word of God. George Wood stated, "<em>The Holy Spirit is like a river, and the sword of God is like the banks of the river. The river will never overflow beyond the banks of the river</em>” Make sure that your prayer life is bathed in the Word of God. I heard it nice said, "<strong><em>if you read the Word if God you will have something to say. If you pray you still have the power to say it, and if you spend time with the lost, you will have an audience to say it to</em></strong>”, To finish, blessings Pastor Phil

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark 1:35, “And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed”</strong>

<strong>Modeling the discipline of prayer</strong>. How was Mark able to write this verse when it is clear that everyone was sleeping when Jesus entered in this prayer discipline? In the succeeding verses is our main verse in <strong>Mark 1:35 </strong>we read, "<strong><em>And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, 37 and they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you.” <!--more--></em></strong>How did they know where He was? Imagine that this was a routine of the Lord, and that there was a particular place that He would go to pray and they knew therefore where to find him at that time. However, what about, or perhaps this was the first time He did this? They searched and found Him in prayer, or to say another way, they caught Him praying. R.C. Sproul shares, "<em>The verb used for their search is more better conveyed as the disciples were hunting high and low to find Jesus. And when they do find him they question Him in the form of a thinly veiled rebuke as if to say to Him, 'there is no time for you to pray, your fame is spreading and many seekers are awaiting you to minister to them, there is much ministry to do</em>.'" The people wanting to meet with Jesus could care less about His prayer time with the Father and realize there are times when many will not care about your prayer life either. This unfortunately includes some leaders in the local church. Do you care more of using your gifts and talents that God gave you, even if your private spiritual disciplines of prayer and Bible reading are neglected? <strong>Oh how I have seen pastors place new believers quickly into leadership when there is no prayer life...what a tragedy!</strong> <strong>Many are more interested in what you can do, than who you are in Christ.</strong> This is gravely unbalanced.

Christ modeled that ministry toward others, must begin with being ministered to by being alone with God you, prior to being effective for Him. What would someone catch you doing in secret? Would your children catch you on your knees in fellowship with the Lord? Would those in your church, or your discipleship group, when searching for you, discover you in communion with the Lord? Oh what an act to be found in, prayer! Oh that this would be me and that would be you. What an impact this makes upon others.

May you heed the realities of these initial four verbs (rising/departed/went/prayed and modeling) as exemplified by Christ, and may you too exemplify them as well.

Until the nets are filled...

Blessings, Phil (God's evangelist and servant)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Acts 3:1-16, "16 And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all"</b>

Why do we make faith complicated? Many preachers especially those of Word Faith make faith so complicated and so hard to reach. It is so complicated that it sounds like you have to do it right, you have to follow a recipe or a formula to get it right. This is often crowned with sow a seed faith to get your prayers answered. In other words, how you sow indicates what kind of faith you have. It almost sounds like you must have faith in your faith if anything is to happen in your life and many are miserable because they have been told their faith is not strong to receive.

<!--more-->

The lame man in <b>Acts 3</b> believed and was healed, he gave nothing for his faith, if anything, even that faith to believe was a gift as we see later in the same chapter.

<b>Faith in simple definition is trust or confidence in something or someone</b>. If you board a plane, how much faith do you need? The moment I board, I have already entrusted my destiny to the pilot because I have confidence in his ability to fly the plane. I don't have to see him, interview him, see his credentials etc. I just have to trust that he knows what he is doing. That is the faith that comes from knowing that the pilot’s mission is not to do evil but good and so is with our heavenly Father, <b>Genesis 18:25</b> tells us <b>“… Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (NIV</b>).

Look at Joseph dealing with two of Pharaoh’s servants in jail with him. One day they both had dreams and believed the dreams had deeper meaning. Joseph seeing them asked why they looked sad, <b> “And they said to him, “We each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter of it.” So Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please.”, Genesis 40:8. </b>Joseph had such confidence, trust, faith in his God to interpret dreams for others even when his was not revealed yet. Nothing could sway or taint his faith in his God.

Peter explained how this faith works, he says vs. <b>"16 And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know…”. </b>Christ name and through faith, indicating that the faith to believe is not something that just happens, it begins with Him and through Him<b>. </b>This is why<b> JESUS IS THE GIVER, AS WELL AS THE OBJECT OF OUR FAITH </b>and<b> </b>“<b>Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust…”, Psalm 40:4.</b>

He continues, “…<b>. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all", </b>Christ is the author and perfecter of our faith. If by and through Him do we have faith to be saved, then by and through Him do we have faith to be healed, to be provided for, to be cared for etc., This is because we have confidence in God and that confidence is demonstrated when we pray to Him<b>. </b>

We therefore must pray by faith and entrust all in the care of our Lord then quit trying to build faith in our faith, robbing ourselves the ability to rest in the Lord because we are constantly wondering whether we are believing right. It was E.M Bound who wrote, “<b><i>Prayer is simply faith resting in, acting with, leaning on and obeying God</i></b><b>”. Pray, have faith, then rest in the Lord. Blessings, Ev</b>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 12:5-18, 5 "Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church" </strong>

Peter in prison! What a jolt! We are too far removed from the actual scene to catch the atmosphere of dismay the Christians of that day felt.

Peter had moved from Pentecost to prison, from jeers to spears. He was guarded by sixteen soldiers. One wonders why such a defenseless man needed such a group to watch him. Could it be that Herod feared the supernatural, seeing he knew that Jesus escaped such a group that guarded Him?<!--more-->

Had Peter been hedged in by sixteen hundred soldiers, the problem would not have been increased nor the escape less sure. Peter was bound not only by two chains, but also by the thick walls of the prison, by the three wards of the prison, and finally by an iron gate.

When Peter is in prison, does the church organize a plan to get him released? No. When Peter is jailed, do the believers offer a plea to Herod or suggest a price to offer the lawmakers for his freedom<strong>? No. Peter had released others at the hour of prayer; now others must believe for his release.</strong>

Right through the book of Acts, which might be called The Acts of Prayer, we find prayer and more prayer. Dig into the book and discover this power that motivated the early church. In the twelfth chapter of Acts we find a group that prayed. <strong>Though a host encamped against Peter, in this were these believers confident: there was a God who could and would deliver</strong>. The <strong>one never-failing rescue operation was prayer</strong>. There was no hedging about in the prayers of those who made intercession for Peter. Prayer was made without ceasing by the church unto God for him. They did not seem to be concerned whether Herod should die or not. They did not pray that they might escape Peter's fate. They were not asking that they have another exodus to a more hospitable country. <strong>They prayed for one person: Peter. They prayed for one thing: his release. The answer proves the point: "Whatsoever ye shall ask,... that will I do"</strong>

Some shabby interpreters of this story have said that when the pray-ers heard that Peter was at the door, they were unbelieving. I cannot accept this assumption. I am sure that they prayed with expectation<strong>. I like to think that they were for the moment staggered by the immediacy of the answer</strong>. They could be excused if they raised their eyebrows when Peter said, "I got out quite easily with an angel escort " (Next time you pass through the magic self-opening door at your supermarket, remember that the first door to open of its own accord was operated from above!)

Angel deliverances seem to find no place in our modern theology. Perhaps we would like the Lord to answer our prayers with the least embarrassment to us. After all, who expects that the angelic ranks should be disturbed just to bring deliverance to a praying soul? <strong>But supernatural results came for many of the praying saints of apostolic days. The Lord geared a property-damaging earthquake to get deliverance for an apostle. Prayer is dynamite.</strong>

There is no weapon formed against prayer that can neutralize it. Some things can delay answers to prayer, but nothing can stop the full purpose of God. "Though it tarry, wait for it."]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 12:5-18, 5 "Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church"</strong>

The first requirement in prayer is to believe.
-Believe that God is and that "he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."

-Believe that God is alive and therefore has power-not only for Peter's deliverance, but for ours.

-Believe that God is love and that He cares for His own.

-Believe that God is power and therefore no power can stand against Him.

-Believe that God is truth and therefore cannot lie.

-Believe that God is kind and that He will never abdicate His throne or fail in His promise.<!--more-->

Reflecting on the story of Peter, I am rebuked, humiliated, chagrined, stung. Why? Because there are some great modern saints, Watchman Nee for one, who for years have suffered and been held captive by communists and others. Many of the saints today are shut up in prison. The same fate has befallen some of God's choice witnesses in Vietnam and in the Congo.

Such perils to other members of the Body demand concern, concentration, and consecration to a committed plan of prayer on their behalf. I fear that prayer has not been made to God without ceasing for these suffering kinsmen.

Mr. Bunyan shows us his Christian held captive by the Giant Despair in Doubting Castle. The key to his deliverance was Promise. <strong>We Christians are in captivity on many levels today personal, domestic, church, and missionary enterprise. But fetters break and dungeons fall when prayer is made by the church unto God-
</strong>-Prayer without ceasing;

-Prayer that might shatter our status quo;

-Prayer that drains us of every other interest;

-Prayer that excites us by its immense possibilities;

-Prayer that sees God as the One that rules on high, almighty to save;

-<strong>Prayer that laughs at impossibilities and cries, "It shall be done";
</strong>-Prayer that sees all things beneath His feet;

-<strong>Prayer that is motivated with desire for God's glory.</strong>

The praying of the believer can become a ritual. The place of prayer is more than a dumping ground for all our anxieties, frets, and fears. The place of prayer is not a place to drop a shopping list before the throne of a God with endless supplies and limitless power.

I believe the place of prayer is not only a place where I lose my burdens, but also a place where I get a burden. He shares my burden and I share His burden. "<strong>My yoke is easy and my burden is light</strong>." <strong>To know that burden, we must hear the voice of the Spirit. To hear that voice, we must be still and know that He is God.</strong>

This calamitous hour in the affairs of men demands a church healthier than the one we have. This blatant manifestation of evil in the youth and in the violation of God's commandments throughout the world calls for a faith that will not shrink.

Can we let our prayer swords rust in the scabbards of doubt? Shall our prayer harps hang tuneless on the willows of unbelief

-If God is a god of matchless power and incredible might,

-If the Bible is the unchangeable Word of the living God,

-If the virtue of Christ is as fresh today as when He first made the offering of Himself to God after His resurrection,

-If He is the one and only mediator today,

-If the Holy Spirit can quicken us as He did our spiritual fathers, Then all things are possible today.

The seas were boiling, the winds were howling, the sails were tearing, the spars were flying, the stars were hiding, Euroclydon was blasting. The people were cringing and crying, sobbing and sighing. One man alone was praising. All were expecting death save Paul. Amidst a scene of hopelessness, if ever there was one, Paul cries, "Sirs, I believe God" (Acts 27).

As things seem to fall apart these days, I am going to join Paul. I am going to say in faith, "Sirs, I believe God." Will you join me?]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hebrews 12:1, "Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance (patience) the race that is set before us</strong>"
 
I believe that one of the greatest tests for a Christian is to be identified with Christ and maintain the identity. The moment you are labeled a Christian or identified with Christ, the moment  eyes are watching you. To this end it becomes difficult to identify with Christ when your words and actions ado not line up. We live in a world where bad news sells faster than good news and it takes one bad news to override all the good.<!--more-->

 
As believers, there will be those times we will stumble, get weak, weary, tired and even fall, however, we are overcomers because we identify with Him. When you know there are people on the lookout, you will strive to please God knowing that it’s by Him and through Him. Everywhere we go, we are to be Christians, Christ like. Yes we will have people waiting for us to fall but that shouldn't change how we feel about ourselves a in Christ. We are not out to please men, but God who raised us from things we couldn't raise ourselves from. Our display of His glory is not even to show that we are better than the unsaved, it is to show that we have found a Treasure. We ought not to be ashamed of who we are in Christ. When I look back where He pulled me from, I cannot but brag of Him before people. John the Baptist identified with Him and actually bragged about Christ, he said, <strong>Matthew 3:11, “ I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire”</strong>. How many waited to see John stumble? How about Jesus Himself? The Pharisees kept on trying to find fault with Him, tested Him but still they could not. How much more will we be faced with the Pharisees of today?
 
The bible says, "<strong>Let us lay aside every weight"</strong>, what are the weights that weigh a believer down, guilt, fear, doubt, failing to please people like you want to. Our aim is to please God through our (<strong>3W) Worship, Walk and Work</strong>. Anything we do, we do it to please Him, we shine to please Him as we also salt to please Him. We eliminate anything standing in the way of serving Him. God knows how to bring you where He wants you because He has confidence in His hands. People will only tell you of what they think but not do anything about it, God will do the opposite. "...<strong>And the sin which so easily ensnares us</strong>", we know of those sins that are easy to fall into over and over again that we got to deal with. Sin is simply doing what God does not approve off. Very easy to sin than to stay pure but God's standard still remains. What are we doing to deal with those sins that easily ensnares us?
 
"<strong>And let us run with endurance the race that is set before us".</strong> God is not in a hurry. Yes there is a rush to get the sinners saved but when it comes to worshipping, walking and working with Him, He is not in a hurry. Ask Jeremiah who went to the Potter's house. The Potter was busy working on clay on the wheel. He happened to have noticed the Potter taking His sweet time working on that vessel. This is a long journey that requires patience in the race, fighting obstacles and barriers on the way looking towards the mark of the high calling. It is not a race to see who will get to the finish line first, it is a race that requires faithfulness till the end. Look at it this way, the marathon runners do not allow themselves to be distracted by the people lining by the road watching them, they have a number on the chest that identifies them in the race, they keep their eyes on the finish line. Do not allow yourself to be distracted on your race by the Pharisees. Lay aside what weighs you down, repent of the sins that easily ensnares you and then continue to run with endurance the race set before you as identify with Him. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Acts 10:5 , “And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname in Peter.” (Acts 10:5 - Full text all of Acts 10)</strong>

You’ve heard it said, never send a boy to do a man’s job. Well God says never send an angel to do a disciple’s job. Cornelius was a Roman Centurion responsible for the band of 100 men under his authority. The Scripture says that, “<strong>He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly (v.2</strong>).” Yet despite all of these great qualities he still needed to hear and know the way of salvation through Christ alone.

<!--more-->

<!--more-->So what did God do to reach this devout Roman Centurion? An angel of God spoke to him in a vision and said, <strong>“Cornelius!” Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked. The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. 5 Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. 6 He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea</strong>.” WOW, this man’s efforts toward godliness were noticed by God, and God wishing for none to perish was going to make sure this man and his family knew what the real deal with reaching God was. Despite all of his efforts, none qualified this man to earn a seat in the Kingdom of Heaven, because those seats can’t be earned<strong>. “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9 not by works, so that no one can boast.”</strong> The gift this man needed was Christ.

My question is, why didn’t the angel of the Lord give this man the Gospel, but instead told him to send for Peter. Doesn’t that seem like a lot of unnecessary hoops to jump through when it would seem that it would have been much simpler to have the angel give Cornelius the Gospel? Who did Christ give the responsibility to bring the gospel to others to, His disciples or His angels? This account shows us the great responsibility Christ places on you and I to fulfill the Great Commission. In the movie Spider Man, Uncle Ben says, “<em>With great power comes great responsibility</em>.” If we have the Great power of the Holy Spirit in us, then we need to fulfill the great responsibility of the Great Commission. God could have saved Cornelius apart from Peter, but Peter was the mailman that was called to do his job, that of bringing the Gospel to this Gentile man. This should send a wakeup call to the Disciples of Christ to be active in going out to seek and save the lost by being witnesses unto Him and making disciples. Christ didn’t tell us to pray for the power of the Gospel to do its work, but for laborers to take the gospel to those that need it. And if they’re breathing and without Christ then they need Him! A farmer doesn’t sit inside the farm and only pray for a harvest. He goes out to sow seed so that he may reap a harvest. Peter went to sow the seed of the Gospel in Cornelius’ life and family, because the soil of Cornelius’ heart had been prepared for the Gospel.

Thank God the disciples didn’t stay in the Upper Room and just pray for the unsaved, but they obeyed the mandate to Go and seek and save the lost. Jesus last command should be our first priority. Is that true in your life? Paul reminds us, “But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.”

<strong>Application: Lord send, not Peter but the one who is reading this devotion to someone that is ready for the seed of the Gospel to be planted in an unsaved life. </strong>

<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>John 1:46, “Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked. “Come and see,” said Philip. (NIV)</b>

It is troubling to know you can be misjudged, misunderstood, misquoted. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The word "miss" is referred to when something is absent in the whole picture</span>. Not being able to hit the target or accomplish what one had in mind. It could be a piece of information or a piece of puzzle. What might not make sense to you could make sense to someone else simply because they have the other piece of information you don't have. You can type a whole sentence, a word missing or how you punctuate could change the whole meaning of the message you are trying to pass across. The other thing is to know the history of something and misjudge what it is capable of by looking at its history.<!--more-->

It's fascinating to know that Jesus was referred to as Jesus of Nazareth. The King of kings was not even born in an earthly kingdom though he qualified. He was raised up in a normal town called Nazareth the home of Joseph and Mary.  Nowhere in Old Testament do you hear of Nazareth until you get to the gospels. Tying the pieces together as to how Nazareth would have been, it was no place for a king to be born, because it had no class and the people had no great fear of God. And to think that the person who would come out of it and call Himself the King was no other than Joseph's Son, a carpenter.

Philip finds Nathanael and he gives him the good <b>news vs. 45, "..."we have found him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</b> would you be excited if you heard that the person you grew up with or watched their life style could become someone extra ordinary? I would dismiss that too. When you know someone in and out and knowing where they came from, it can be hard to see far beyond because you've already dismissed them. Even today and I am guilty of this, I look at some people I know and dismiss what they can do. Ladies can look at men and dismiss them as not being good husbands (husband material), the same can happen to men. You look at a child who is growing up and all you see is a disaster and your comments, "<i>you will never amount to anything</i>", you have already dismissed anything they could be.

We have to be very careful not to dismiss people and things based on the little knowledge or information we have. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">As mentioned, one little tiny piece of information is enough to change the destination of what you see. </span>Nathanael could not see anything good coming out of an ordinary place even after Phillip told him. He was missing a very important piece to complete the puzzle. Are we not like Nazareth where Christ would come out of? Instead of sitting on the throne, He has chosen to dwell in our hearts (Nazareth)? He came right where we were in Nazareth to redeem us. He has chosen to be born in our hearts (Nazareth) the ordinary city. Did you ever think that one day you would be saved? Did you ever know that you would be used of God one day? Did you have people dismiss you and right out of you, Christ Jesus, Jesus of Nazareth comes out of you? You were dismissed because the piece, "Christ in you" was not seen. <b>Philippians 4:13, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"</b> could not be seen either. You might have been dismissed, that ought to humble you and I, God raises the least likely, the stones the builders rejected. He fills that life with His presence and lives His own life through a broken vessel. <b>1Corinthians 1:27, "But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong".</b> You always have to watch out for the one who has been dismissed because there is an anointing in his life and God uses such. Though Nathaniel dismissed Nazareth, when he met Jesus, he was not the same again.  Blessings Evans]]></content:encoded>

As I shared the other day, we all love compliments, someone speaking good things about us before people. There is always a word that tends to erase every good thing someone has spoken. The word is "BUT". As long as good things are spoken without the "BUT", we tend to be ok with it but the moment it comes in the middle, then you become troubled by it. Your concentration on it erases all the good that has been said.<!--more-->

In the workforce, there are people who are hard workers, they do the best they can, and they are good at what they do. They give a 110% but no one ever notices, no words of appreciation, no pat on the back in fact most people concentrate on their mistakes and what has not been done more than anything else. With this they feel their presence is not significant. <strong>You have to understand that your presence is a present (gift) to your job</strong>. It may not be your dream job, you have to remember that God has called you there as a gift to that company, job, position, department to be faithful in it. Who knows, it could be a training ground to mature your character, leadership qualities, integrity, foundation, and be a blessing to others. God sent you there for a reason. <strong>Until you see it in a new way, you will be depressed instead of being in deep rest,</strong>. I remember a job I had before, I did not like it, I wished I could move away from it. I knew God had placed me there for a reason. I therefore chose to take the opportunity to serve and be the best at it, I did ministry there and it was a blessing. With time, the Lord moved. Your continuous complaints and whining will mess up every victory God had channeled your way. <strong>We forget many times that the world crowns success, God crowns faithfulness</strong>.

Look at Joseph, his dream job was to be a ruler, people bowing before him including his family. As a young lad, that is the thought that consumed his mind. In our times maybe his dream was to be a CEO of a company. The thought of it and speaking of it almost cost him his life. He finally finds himself in a house of an officer serving as a servant (slave). Not his dream job but he is there, no one to talk well of him but he is there. He should be complaining and murmuring but he becomes faithful in his job. I believe that instead of asking "why", He was thanking God for the opportunity to serve in any capacity. As I shared recently, you ought to be your best encourager. If they don't say nice things about you, speak nice things to yourself. Applaud yourself for job well done. Look yourself in the mirror and say, "<i>He loves me in spite of and He will use me to be a blessing in my job".</i> "It may not be where I want to be but if I can be faithful with the little, He will make me ruler over much". <strong>You don't have to be liked and applauded to be successful, you got to know who you are, where you are going and who is in control to be one. </strong>That is what Joseph knew<strong>. A slave with a dream to someday be great yet beginning that greatness by laying a foundation of faithfulness</strong>." A slave with a dream but yet looking at his current situation as a stepping stone. If God promised him a dream, temporary setbacks does not mean denial. The bible says, “<strong>Do not despise the days of humble beginnings" paraphrased. </strong>Faithfulness with time, resources, in responsibilities is what you and I need. Going an extra mile beyond the required duty. Extra mile is what I will call excellence mile, the mile that distinguishes you from others.

<strong>Genesis 39:5, "So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house and in the field". </strong>Can you see your job being blessed because your presence is significant? I believe my department, my boss, my colleagues; my surrounding is blessed because of my presence. I know that I am making an impact, it may be small but it's significant. Joseph's boss was blessed because of Joseph. <strong>If you are faithful over little, God will make you ruler over much</strong>. If you don't like what you do, I'm not saying be happy and relax, I'm saying be faithful in it as you trust God for greater things.<strong> </strong>I would stop for a moment and say, “what a privilege to be entrusted with a position like this”<strong>, Matthew 5:16, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven". </strong>Your presence is Significant, therefore trust God and be faithful.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 13:34-35, “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.” </strong>

How can one tell if someone is a fan of a particular sports team? Perhaps if one wears a
teams clothing, jersey, hat, etc…. However if I put on a NY Yankee jersey does that mean that I am on the NY Yankees? Of course not! How then can one know if one is a disciple of Christ? Well one way to know Jesus said is that His disciples would have love one to another.

<!--more-->

This sounds very quaint, loving, caring, and mushy. Love as many have said is perhaps the most abused word in language. Jesus spoke to His disciples and gave them a new commandment, and that was to love one another as Jesus had loved them. Many feel that the love Jesus was speaking of here, is the demonstration of love that Jesus had shown them up to this point He was speaking to them. Jesus had shown them love, but He did not display His greatest act of love at the time He was instructing them to love on another. That display would be shown at the cross. Jesus would die for His twelve and for the whole world. This was the love that He was commanding them to love one another with. He said a new command, not a new idea, suggestion, or option I give you, but a new command. Jesus further said, “<strong><em>Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends</em></strong>.” Jesus was calling them to lay their lives down for one another. What is the reason that Jesus wanted His disciples to love one another as He had loved them?

1. <strong>Christ’s Love is pure</strong>. John wrote, “<strong><em>How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God</em></strong>!” God is the source of love, and He lavishes that love upon His children as a mother lavishes love upon her child. His pure love, not love as the world gives, needed to be in their hearts if they were going to be Christ-like.

<strong>2. Christ’s Love is demonstrative</strong>. The world sits in condemnation and judgment. The world is guilty of breaking God’s Law, they love darkness and hate the light. Jesus said that when His disciples shine their love toward one another, that the world would see it and know who Christ’s disciples are. The world can only see this kind of love if Christians step out of the four walls of the church building and live it out among all men. Many non-Christians have seen televangelists manipulate people for their money. Christ didn’t die in a church, He died in plain view of the people, in the sight of all men. Oh that we would die to ourselves that He would live in us, and we would be His feet and hands extended. I laugh when people say I love God, it’s the church I have a problem with. That is like saying I love you but I hate your husband or wife. Husbands and wives are one, and so is Christ and His body. His body must love one another, the church needs that love to flourish, and the world needs to see it as a living tangible witness.

<strong>3. Christ’s Love is evidential evidence</strong>. Jesus said “…by this all men will know that you are my disciples….” When you live His love out loud, it shows that Jesus is real. Why would you go out of your way to help, give, bless, provide, even sacrifice for another brother or sister in Christ? because Christ is real. Why would you display the fruit of the spirit, bless those who persecute you, love your enemies? Practical Christian lives points to the reality that Christ is real, and the Savior of the world. Demonstrate His pure love today as evidence that Jesus is Savior, Lord, and soon and coming King!

<strong>Until the nets are filled</strong>…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Matthew 10:40-42, “He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me. Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward. 42 And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward.” </strong>

In part one of Marks of a Disciple; we examined the new commandment Jesus gave to His disciples, to love one another as He has loved them. In light of that, Jesus speaks again about another mark being His disciple. Jesus starts off by talking about receiving Him.<!--more-->


1. <strong>Whoever receives a disciple receives Christ</strong>. Those who treat His disciples bad, treat Jesus bad. Remember when the Apostle Paul, formally called Saul, was persecuting Christians? Jesus showed up on the road to Damascus, knocked him down and said, “<strong>Saul, Saul we do you persecute Me [Jesus]</strong>.” It was clear from the lips of Christ that those who come against Christ’s disciples are coming against Him, and those that receive His disciples, welcome Christ.

<strong>2. Whoever receives Jesus receives God</strong>. God was the One that sent Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. Many Jewish people and others as well, want to reject Jesus but receive God. This simply can’t take place because Jesus is God. “<strong>Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” John 14:9 Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.</strong>” Jesus also said to the Pharisees, “<strong>’I tell you the truth,’ Jesus answered, ‘before Abraham was born, I Am!’ At this, they picked up stones to stone him</strong>,”

<strong>3. Whoever gives a cup of cold water to the little ones is Christ’s disciple</strong>. Jesus is the living water that brings satisfaction to the thirsty. He said, “<strong>13</strong> <strong>Everyone who drinks this water [natural physical water] will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst, and “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. Vs. 38 Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.”</strong> In context of the prophet’s reward, and the righteous man’s rewards, there is the disciples’ reward here. Those that refresh Christ’s disciples will not lose their reward. Disciples of course have the living water in them, but even they need to be refreshed. The reason Jesus said that those who drink of the living water will NEVER thirst again is because the source will never run dry. Abraham’s well could run dry (<strong>John 4)</strong>, but Christ’s well can never run dry, because His well has always been full to overflowing with eternal life sustaining water. Will you share that water with another disciple today and so refresh their spirit. Please pray, encourage, and minister to at least one before the day is through. As God uses you to bring His living water to others, He will make sure you too are filled. Receive His disciples, receive Christ and therefore God Himself, and give some refreshing water of refreshment to one that is thirsty today.

<strong>Until the nets are filled</strong>…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 8:31–32, “Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” </strong>

I often hear that all one needs to do when it comes to salvation is to simply believe. Some take it a step further and use <strong>Romans 10:9 </strong>which Paul writes, <strong><em>“</em>That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” </strong>If one quoted this verse alone as the means of salvation, then it sounds like Paul is saying all one must do is to confess sin, believe Jesus and salvation is bestowed. However the key in this whole thing, Jesus is Lord. This confession was made publicly among other disciples. Then this new convert was disciple into Christian maturity.<!--more-->


When the Apostle Paul was on his way to kill Christians, Christ met him on the road to Damascus and “…<strong>suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?", Acts 9:3-6. </strong>Did Paul confess Jesus as Lord? yes. Did he believe in his heart?, yes. Did he tremble with conviction of his sin? yes. Jesus confronted him with the Law, the sixth commandment, “thou shall not murder,” for that in fact was what Paul was doing to Christians. After this conversion took place, Paul said to Jesus, “<strong>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do</strong>.” Paul seemed to instantly know that he must now be a doer of God’s word and not simply one that hears, believes and confesses Jesus as Lord. Now he would have to live under the Lordship of Jesus Christ from this day forward.

The problem in many churches today is that preaching takes place, the pastor has people close their eyes and repeat a prayer of confession for sin after him. Then many times the person’s life does not change, and many times the person doesn’t return to the church even for a second visit. We call this type of person a false convert, because they have made stake to claims of salvation unto Jesus, but they wanted a Savior but not Lord. However the two cannot be separated, Jesus is Savior and Lord of my life.

In light of this, in the above key Scripture verse, Jesus spoke to the Jews who had believed Him. Therefore belief in Jesus was already present. Jesus then went on to say, “<strong>If you hold to my teaching, then you are my disciples indeed</strong>.” This is called a conditional statement because it uses “IF” and “THEN”, meaning IF you do this, THEN this will be the result. However IF one does not do this, THEN one will not get the same result. Jesus said one must continue in His word. The Expositors Bible Commentary says, “<em>Receiving his teaching would mark them as genuine disciples and would lead them into a deeper experience of truth</em>.” This learned truth then would liberate from legalism, superstition, and dead works of tradition which had developed over the years. Jesus felt the necessity of making perfectly clear the conditions of discipleship.

Are you reading the Scriptures daily (continuing in His Word)? Are you obeying what you reading and showing Him to be Lord over your life? If you are then you are His disciple, you know the truth and have been set free, therefore REJOICE! If not then repent quickly, today, right now, and make the change that Jesus is calling you to make. If you are lord then He is not, but if He is Lord then you are not. Choose the latter. <strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Proverbs 24:16,"for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again,.." (NIV)</strong>

One of the most frustrating things is dealing with failures. There is no joy in knowing you have fallen or failed. Competitions have winners and losers, that is how it is set up. We cheer up for winners and we rejoice when we are winners but what do we do when we fall and or fail? You may be frustrated with yourself right now over failing to meet a deadline, or failing an exam, or failing to win what you hoped to win. What about failing to please the Lord with your life, fell in sin or sinned so bad again that you wondered if there was any more mercy left for you.

<!--more-->

You have fallen many times and each time you asked for forgiveness and mercy and they were granted each time. This time you feel you have fallen too hard and too far and you do not believe any mercy is left on your God reserved personal account to be released to you. I have encountered some people who were so mad at themselves over how they failed, they would not even forgive themselves over the past failures. It is not like God had not forgiven them, God had and moved on but they found it so hard to forgive themselves over what they did. God forgot about it, but they keep reminding God of what they did. That is what is pulling them down and hindering their progression with God. Failing is part of life, we don't want to fail yes but at times it comes and we can either use it to advance ourselves by learning from it or use it to put ourselves down.

<strong>Proverbs 24:16,"for though a righteous man falls seven times, ". </strong>"<strong>Though</strong>" indicates that there is possibility, an indication that a righteous man may and will fall, and not ones but several times. We can trace its origin from Adam and all who came after him failed the test even before taking it. <strong>Falling is not an option</strong> however it does happen as you grow and as you walk to your destination, making choices that will lead you there. There are some things you have no control over that will either make you win or lose. The key is to realize that there are possibilities and what you do when you fall or fail matters a lot. Jesus understood that though His disciples were strong while He was with them, there was going to come a time when they would face challenges and even fail. In <strong>Luke 22:31, “31 And the Lord said, "Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32, But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren."</strong> Peter was not planning on failing but the devil was determined make him fail and Jesus knew it yet He did not even stop the situation from happening. All He did was to let Peter know what awaited him and what He had done for him in the situation. Jesus said to him, "<strong>But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail</strong>". In other words, everything can and may fail but when you have faith in God, that faith will cause you to rise up again and keep moving. <strong>You have enough faith in God to work with when the flesh fails</strong> and even when all you hoped and dreamed for fails. A righteous man falls seven times and he rises again because He has enough faith to work with. When one falls or fails, what happens? They still have enough pieces of things they need to assemble themselves back together again. Jesus told him, "<strong>when you have returned to me</strong>", this was an indication that his failure would move him further from the Lord but his faith in Christ will somehow bring him back to find the Lord and encounter with him again. God would use his experience to strength other brothers who would face situations like his.

Have you fallen or failed? the bible says the "righteous" man not the "wicked" falls seven times but he keeps on rising because he has faith to pick him/herself up again. You can't keep crying over spilled milk, don't you understand you have enough to work with to get you back on your feet again? You have faith to believe that God can forgive you and faith to believe God can help you rise again and give you new avenues for progression. <strong>1John 2:1-2, “1 My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 2 And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world</strong>”. John writes that we should not sin however if we do, we have Jesus to advocate for us before the Father. You only fail when you don't rise, therefore RISE, you have enough to work with, faith in God. Blessings Ev, God's servant

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Genesis 37:23, “So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors that was on him."</strong>

People can take temporal things from us such as houses, cars, jobs, money, etc..., but there are some things that nobody can take. In the blockbuster movie Braveheart, William Wallace played by Mel Gibson Director of the Passion of the Christ was speaking to the people of Scotland that he was rallying together. He said, "<em>Aye, fight and you may die, run, and you'll live... at least for a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing' to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!"<!--more--></em>

Our enemies will try and take things from us sometimes those enemies may be our own family members or those that are close to us. This is precisely the predicament that Joseph found himself in twice during his life. Joseph was the favored son, and jealousy brewed among his brothers toward him. Eventually his brothers sold him as a slave and took the robe he was wearing. Joseph was unlike his brothers both in his attitude and character. Although they took his robe, they couldn't take Joseph's character or attitude from him. People can take the temporal things, but they cannot take the eternal things, such as our character from us.

Then Joseph is brought to Egypt as a slave and his gift and godly character cause him to rise up in Pharaoh's ranks, second only to Pharaoh. He found himself in a compromising position with the Potiphar’s wife who wanted to have sex with him. <strong>Genesis 39:10</strong> reads "<strong>And it came about as she spoke to Joseph day after day, that he didn't listen to her to lie beside her, or be with her</strong>." <strong>However, one day "She caught him by his cloak and said, "Come to bed with me!" But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house."</strong>

Like Joseph's brothers, she took a piece of clothing from Joseph. When he ran from her he had his character and integrity fully intact, because she couldn't take that away, because it was not for the taking in Joseph's estimation. The only way she could have received it, was if Joseph gave it away, not an option in his mind. This is a lesson to take from Joseph. He was not giving up the character

that had been developed within him through his trials. I've heard it rightly said, "<strong>Character is what you are in the dark, when no one is looking.</strong>"

Joseph teaches us:

1. People (even those close to us) will try to take things from us.

2. People may and can take temporal material things from us, but they cannot take eternal things.

3. People can't take our character unless we give it away!

4. God is more concerned with our character than our possessions.

5. Our godly character is a staple of God working through our lives despite situations, status, or earthly possessions.

6. God allows trials to build character.

7. Your response to trials will reveal your character!

Until the nets are filled...

Blessings, Pastor Phil]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Luke 7:1-9, “And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was WORTHY for whom he should do this:” (KJV)</strong>

A story is told of a little girl who looked outside the window of her house and saw a sheep and wondered how that sheep looked so white and clean. While still looking at the sheep, it began snowing. Before long, the sheep that looked white and clean did not appear clean anymore because the white crystal snow overshadowed the whiteness of the sheep and the girl thought how dirty that sheep looked in the light of the snow. Looking at it closely, you can see that she sheep did not change, the girl saw it under a different background, that is what made the difference.<!--more-->

In line with the story above, Jesus entered Capernaum and we are told a certain centurion had a servant who was sick. As you read more into the story, you discover that the centurion was a man in authority and under authority. He had servants he commanded and they listened and responded to him. He loved his nation and had built a synagogue making his resume impressive. When he sent elders of the Jews to speak to Jesus about his sick servant, the elders did not hesitate. They went to Jesus and even gave Jesus a good report about him. They talked highly of him and felt that he was WORTHY to receive healing for his servant. What strikes me is that they felt that he DESERVED Jesus' attention because of who he was, a man of reputation and what he had done. People were elevating him. In the background of his nation, he was a worthy man.

<strong>Vs. “6 Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not WORTHY that You should enter under my roof”</strong>. How is it that a man who everyone deemed worthy considered himself unworthy? Simple, the background of the presence of the Son of God overshadowed his worthiness. He saw himself as that dirty sheep which looked clean before the snow came about. Of all the people, only Jesus was worthy. <strong>Revelation 5:2-5, “2 Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is WORTHY to open the scroll and to loose its seals?” 3 And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it. 4 So I wept much, because no one was found WORTHY to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. 5 But one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed (WORTHY) to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals.” </strong>When no one was found worthy, He was. The centurion knew that he did not deserve to have Jesus, the worthy One come to him or his house. The centurion continues to speak of his unworthiness, in verse “7 <strong>Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You”.</strong> His unworthiness humbled him to develop such a great faith on the One who was worthy. And we know his servant was healed because of the faith he had.

When I think about my life and how so unworthy I was, reduced to worthless in His sight, I'm humbled. People buy things that are worth something, He bought me with the highest price when I was worthless. Now I am worth something, not because of me but because of Him who is WORTHY living in me. I will enter into heaven not on the basis of my worthiness but His. I thank Him for the chance to see myself in His background and not the background of men that I might repent and put my trust in Him alone for my eternal salvation. Blessings Ev]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John 8:31–32, “Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” </strong>

I often hear that all one needs to do when it comes to salvation is to simply believe. Some take it a step further and use <strong>Romans 10:9 </strong>which Paul writes, <strong><em>“</em>That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” </strong>If one quoted this verse alone as the means of salvation, then it sounds like Paul is saying all one must do is to confess sin, believe Jesus and salvation is bestowed. However the key in this whole thing, Jesus is Lord. This confession was made publicly among other disciples. Then this new convert was disciple into Christian maturity.

<!--more-->

When the Apostle Paul was on his way to kill Christians, Christ met him on the road to Damascus and “…<strong>suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?", Acts 9:3-6. </strong>Did Paul confess Jesus as Lord? yes. Did he believe in his heart?, yes. Did he tremble with conviction of his sin? yes. Jesus confronted him with the Law, the sixth commandment, “thou shall not murder,” for that in fact was what Paul was doing to Christians. After this conversion took place, Paul said to Jesus, “<strong>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do</strong>.” Paul seemed to instantly know that he must now be a doer of God’s word and not simply one that hears, believes and confesses Jesus as Lord. Now he would have to live under the Lordship of Jesus Christ from this day forward.

The problem in many churches today is that preaching takes place, the pastor has people close their eyes and repeat a prayer of confession for sin after him. Then many times the person’s life does not change, and many times the person doesn’t return to the church even for a second visit. We call this type of person a false convert, because they have made stake to claims of salvation unto Jesus, but they wanted a Savior but not Lord. However the two cannot be separated, Jesus is Savior and Lord of my life.

In light of this, in the above key Scripture verse, Jesus spoke to the Jews who had believed Him. Therefore belief in Jesus was already present. Jesus then went on to say, “<strong>If you hold to my teaching, then you are my disciples indeed</strong>.” This is called a conditional statement because it uses “IF” and “THEN”, meaning IF you do this, THEN this will be the result. However IF one does not do this, THEN one will not get the same result. Jesus said one must continue in His word. The Expositors Bible Commentary says, “<em>Receiving his teaching would mark them as genuine disciples and would lead them into a deeper experience of truth</em>.” This learned truth then would liberate from legalism, superstition, and dead works of tradition which had developed over the years. Jesus felt the necessity of making perfectly clear the conditions of discipleship.

Are you reading the Scriptures daily (continuing in His Word)? Are you obeying what you reading and showing Him to be Lord over your life? If you are then you are His disciple, you know the truth and have been set free, therefore REJOICE! If not then repent quickly, today, right now, and make the change that Jesus is calling you to make. If you are lord then He is not, but if He is Lord then you are not. Choose the latter. <strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>]]></content:encoded>

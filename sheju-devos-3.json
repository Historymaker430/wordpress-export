His announcement convinced multitudes that Aliens from Mars were attacking New York and New Jersey. His compelling broadcast had scores of people shaken. Harlem in NYC was one of those places that were severely shaken. &#8220;The parlor churches in the Negro district, congregations of the smaller sects meeting on the ground floors of brownstone houses, took the &#8220;news&#8221; in stride as less faithful parishioners rushed in with it, seeking spiritual consolation. Evening services became &#8220;end of the world&#8221; prayer meetings in some (New York Times, Oct. 31, 1938.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:58 writes too of what perhaps sounds like a &#8220;War of the Worlds&#8221; type broadcast as he describes the rapture (the snatching up quickly) of the church at the <span style=\"color:#366388;\">sound of the trumpet<\/span>. However <span style=\"color:#366388;\">God&#8217;s Word<\/span> is not a science fiction broadcast but a true account of what happened &#8220;In the beginning,&#8221; and what will take place in the future. Therefore, as we, the Church wait for this Great Day, Paul doesn&#8217;t instruct us to run around like lunatics with a big sign reading &#8220;The end is near&#8221; while we scream &#8220;Repent while you still have time.&#8221; Paul rather gives sound down to earth applicable instruction of what the <span style=\"color:#366388;\">Body of Christ<\/span> is to do as it waits for the <span style=\"color:#366388;\">return of Christ<\/span>. He writes, &#8220;Therefore&#8221; hence because this is going to take place, &#8220;my beloved brethren&#8221; those that I love listen to me. Then he touches on three characteristics for believers to have in place as they actively wait for Christ&#8217;s return as they are as follows: <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">1. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Be steadfast<\/span>. The Christian life is not a sprint but a marathon, as Solomon reminds us <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;The race is not to the swift&#8230; (Eccl. 9:11)&#8221;<\/span> As believers we need to embrace and exhibit a stick-to-itiveness spirit, an attitude of perseverance. The word quit should not be in the vocabulary of a Christian as it pertains to following the Lord. Paul said &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me<\/span>.&#8221; Run the race and refuse to give up. When the going gets tough, and your spiritual leg muscles are weary <span style=\"color:#366388;\">wait on the Lord<\/span> to renew your strength (Isa. 40:31)&#8221; and <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;&#8230;be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus (2 Tim2:1).&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">2. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">[Be] Unmovable.

They returned after a powerful time of team ministry, and their highlight was seeing that they were used to deliver demonized people by the name of Jesus. As Jesus hears the words of the disciples he shares what I imagine initially took them by surprise, He states<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201cI beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. 19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.\u201d <\/span>Jesus\u2019 focus here was most likely not the fall of Satan from Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28, but rather spoke hyperbolically here, pointing out that the ministry of the disciples was a direct assault on Satan\u2019s authority and influence upon those that were just delivered. Satan has been a problem for humanity since the Garden of Eden, with all his influential lies and deceptive tactics, which is why he is called the Father of Lies (John 8:44), who masquerades himself as an angel of light (2 Cor. 11:14) roaming around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8 ).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Jesus continues sharing what he sees having happened by saying: \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Look I have given you the authority in My name to trample on snakes and scorpions and over all power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.\u201d<\/span> Jesus was saying that the authority to do these miraculous exploits did not originate with the disciples, but originated with Jesus and His authority. Jesus promised protection to His disciples that are in His keeping power which is greater than Satan\u2019s influence (Psalm 91:13).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">A flee would have a better chance of defeating a heard of stampeding elephants, than Satan would have of defeating Christ and the Church by his evil influence. Jesus said, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled (John 17).\u201d<\/span> The son of perdition is a reference to Judas, which was a false convert, and I believe is a representative of false converts, which are those that sit among God\u2019s people but are really not Christian, but are goats, or wolves in sheep clothing. He was under the influence of Satan as one recalls Jesus\u2019 words to His disciples, \u201c\u2026one of you is a devil.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:14pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">Jesus says, \u201c\u2026<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">nothing will ever harm you<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">.\u201d How encouraging are those words toward the genuine follower of Christ? Nothing will EVER harm you, hence wickedness from the kingdom of Satan will NEVER overtake you. Paul writes in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">Romans 8, \u201cWhat shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> The real reason to rejoice is not that the demonic spirits are submitting to you, but rather because your name in engraved in heaven! Rejoice because this Name demons submit to, the same Name that purchased your salvation! Luke writes, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">Acts 4, \u201cNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">.\u201d How wonderful it is that God\u2019s children have their names written in His Book of Life (Rev. 20:15). It is not that God\u2019s children will not experience the effects of Satan\u2019s storms, but that they will never overtake the Christian. Remember Job when Satan attacked him. God allowed him to be attacked, but He would not let Satan kill Job (Job 1:12). After going through all that Job went through he cried out, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">but I will maintain\ufeff mine own ways before him (13:15) <\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">\u2026<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 26 And though after\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff my skin worms destroy this body, yet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">in my flesh shall I see God<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\"> (19:25<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">).\u201dWhen one considers all of life\u2019s experiences ultimately what could match seeing God! The disciples saw the demons submitting to them, but Jesus said their names are engraved in heaven; they would see God the Father, as they have seen the Jesus the Son. I look forward to seeing the Lord one day, even though He has done ministry exploits through my life, nothing will match seeing Him as He is.

As a Christian, we have the authority of the scripture to speak what it says rather than our own opinions and beliefs. Today people want to live by their own created beliefs, assumptions, ideas and the like. And the question that tends to run into my mind is, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">by whose authority do you speak of these things?\u201d<\/span> Satan came to tempt Jesus in the wilderness and Jesus took the authority of the scripture, quoted it and stood by it. He told Satan,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201cIt is written&#8230;\u201d.<\/span> The written word of God gives us the authority to speak it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">Many have a problem believing the story of Jonah and the whale, Jesus had no problem believing it because it was true and He was there when it happened, He quoted it Matthew<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> 12:40, &#8221; For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\u201d.<\/span> In as much as we have our own ideas and thoughts of how things should be or should be dealt with, the Holy Scripture ought to be our final authority. And we cannot pick and choose what we want to believe and agree with. We cannot also go around trying to find loop holes in the bible to support what we want to justify or smash our thinking as to what we believe the author meant. If I&#8217;m looking at a painting, my interpretation of the painting has no authority over what the painter meant for it to be when he painted it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">The Bible has been banned, burned, and, to some, supposedly \u201cdebunked,\u201d yet still its truth stands. It remains the test of orthodoxy for all who claim to be of God or speak of God\u2019s ways.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> 2 Tim 3:16, \u201cAll Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,<\/span>\u201d The most important thing about Scripture is not just that we read it or study it, but that we live it, that we obey the Lord (James 1:22).<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> God did not give us His Word merely to inform us, but to change our lives<\/span> therefore we receive it as it is even when we find certain verses hard to accept and follow. . As Mark Twain aptly put it, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">it is not the things in the Bible that people can\u2019t understand that prove troublesome, but the things they can understand. Even if people are convinced that the Bible is true from cover to cover, will they heed its message<\/span>?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">Today the Bible\u2019s credibility and authority are still attacked. Yet how many of its critics have carefully studied its teaching? How many have even looked at the story of how it came to be written? A careful reader will recognize that the Bible is not so much a single book as a library of sixty-six books. It contains a variety of literary genres: history, poetry, narrative, exposition, parable, and \u201capocalyptic\u201d <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">The writers in the bible though different unified their stories, they offer the same understanding of God throughout. He is one God, Creator, Savior, and Judge. He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and eternal. His character is holy, good, loving, and just. They tell us of the human nature. People are made in God\u2019s image and are capable of great good. Yet they are also sinful rendering man helpless under the weight of sin and only God made a way of escape through His Son Jesus. They offer a common understanding of Jesus Christ. He is both God and Man. He became a real human being in order to show the world the God it could not otherwise perceive. Something deeply significant happened as a result of His death on the cross, making it possible for God and humanity to be reconciled. They offer the same hope. God will accomplish His purposes for His creation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Hebrews 10:7, &#8220;Then I said, \u2018Behold, I have come\u2014In the volume of the book it is written of Me\u2014To do Your will, O God.\u2019<\/span> Jesus came in the volume written of Him, quoted it as the truth because He is truth, the same reason the scripture should be our final authority.

The Lord had said to Samuel, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature;&#8230;for the Lord sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart<\/span>.&#8221; Samuel asked Jessie if he had called all of his Sons, but there was still one more in the field seemingly unaware of what was taking place at his home. David was faithfully tending his sheep and God would call David from the pasture to the palace, from shepherding sheep, to shepherding God&#8217;s people. David didn&#8217;t fill out an application and interview for the position of a king. God looked and God simply choose him. Why does it seem that God chose him? I love the lyrics of one of Christian artist Carmen&#8217;s song, &#8220;W<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">hen others see a shepherd boy God may see a king.<\/span>&#8221; At this time God did in fact see a king, and a great one at that. God didn&#8217;t call David initially because he was a great military leader, but because he was faithful in the small things. He took care of the little that was entrusted to him, his sheep, and since he was faithful in the small God would raise him up to be faithful of much. What would happen to David&#8217;s sheep if he left to be king? God has a unique way of working things out as Paul said in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:28,<\/span> &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&#8221;<\/span> Perhaps God would send another person to care for the sheep David loved. God would now use David to be a King after God&#8217;s own heart, and that is a heart that David seemed to have beating in his life from the pasture to the palace. From pasture to palace teaches us that:<\/small><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><small>&nbsp;<\/small><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><small>1. God has not forgotten about you &#8220;in some shepherd&#8217;s field&#8221;<\/small><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><small>2. God chooses whosoever He desires<\/small><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><small>3. God&#8217;s choices are not based on man&#8217;s outward assessment of a person<\/small><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><small>4. God is looking at how faithful we are in what He has currently given to us<\/small><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><small>5. God will send a &#8220;Samuel&#8221; to confirm your call (others will see your call)<\/small><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><small>6. God anoints people for His ministry<\/small><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><small>&nbsp;<\/small><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\"><small>Application: What is God calling you to do? In what way is he raising you up? Are you being faithful at the little things, so that he can trust you with greater things, or trying to claw our way to the top? Your talent may take you to the top but only your character will keep you there. Be faithful in your pasture (that which He has entrusted to you) so that God can place you in his way, and in His time in the palace He has for you. Your family, friends, co-workers, boss, etc.., need to see a shining testimony of you being faithful in the little things.

Although he had the right of the firstborn, he did not value it over a small bowl of soup. Esau lost his birthright and consequently his blessing because he did not want the birthright. He despised it. Genesis 27:27-30 are the words of blessing spoken over Jacob. Beyond the words, one day Jacob would receive the inheritance of his father that was spoken over him. Like Jacob we were once deceivers, manipulators, but while we were yet sinners Christ died for us, and upon our repentance toward God and faith toward Jesus Christ our sin debt was paid for and we became children of the King. Paul writes, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Now if we are children, then we are heirs-heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory (Rom 8:17<\/span>).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">3.

If you read from the time when the plagues started in Egypt, the children of Israel were also in the land only that, down in Goshen where they lived, God had put a hedge of protection around them that none of the plagues affected them. When the ninth plague was executed, it affected the land for three days. This was no ordinary darkness, this was thick darkens both in the day and at night. For three days the Egyptians were paralyzed. The bible gives us a glimpse of how it was in Goshen, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">the children of Israel had light in their dwellings\u201d.<\/span>&nbsp;Weird things happen in the darkness, but God allows us to be in the light. Fear comes in the dark, wrong direction can be a result of being in darkness, many bad things happen in darkness but when we are all in the light, we see clearly. We are living in a world full of darkness that&#8217;s why we hear about rapes, murder, kidnapping, immorality, divorce and many crazy things happening but thank God for Jesus, the Light of the world in us. He says in&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">John 9:5, &#8220;As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world&#8221;,<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2Corinthians 6:17, &#8220;Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord&#8221;<\/span>, The children of Israel were to live a separate life, we see the light showing separation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again living this separate life was not to make them any better than the Egyptians but to allow the Egyptians to see that they were different, God made a difference in their lives. We need to be separate too and allow the light of Christ to shine in our little Goshen that many may see the Christ in us. This goes with our talk, what we listen to, what we watch, what and who we associate ourselves with, places we go to and the rest. We need to examine our ways and see if we are allowing things to dim our light.

The NKJV translates this verse saying \u2018we were buried\u2019. As I read such wording, I see an event named that I once entered into, much like many Christians once went forward at a service, or raised their hands in response to an invitation to accept Christ, which we will talk about in a bit. The KJV, however, translates this verse as \u2018we&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">are&nbsp;<\/span>buried,\u2019 which better brings out the meaning of what Paul is talking about. Here, the understanding comes across as the Christian is currently buried, being&nbsp;they&nbsp;continually enter into this death. Not one time, but each day, the true follower dies with Christ.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Too many today who profess Christ are very much alive to&nbsp;themselves, to the flesh, and to the world. They live to satisfy themselves, neglecting the cross they are to be carrying, these are not disciples. Christ calls us to come and die, that we might truly live. To be one with Him in His death, that we might be truly partakers of His holiness. When I come to Christ, I do not merely \u2018accept\u2019 Him as some casual visitor to my life, this is a wrong understanding. When I enter into Christ, I cease to exist, and He becomes all in all. I daily become more and more like&nbsp;Him,&nbsp;I die to sin and to myself. I cringe to think of the theologies and teachings that allow for someone to remain in their sin and to call&nbsp;themselves&nbsp;a Christian. Christ has shed His precious blood to give us victory over sin, to free us from its grasp, as we will willingly die to it. I give up my right to myself, and give Jesus complete control and reign, and He enables me to truly live in the world, but not of it. Are we of the world? Are we alive to sin? I encourage each one, as I do, to examine our hearts, to see if we truly be in the faith. Many today have been deceived, worldly pastors preach a worldly message, and multitudes remain in their sin, unconfessed and unforgiven. We are to be holy as He is holy, to be buried with Him, to walk in newness of life, completely transformed. A change takes place in the heart. It may start as a conscious decision to respond, but from there something happens, far deeper than the intellect, we are truly born again.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">In Christ, and all for His glory, Brother Benjamen<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 6:3, \u201cTherefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we should walk in newness of life\u201d I find it important to point out one thing about this verse before I&nbsp;share,&nbsp;it is paramount to [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2477","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-DX","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2477","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=2477"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2477\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2479,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2477\/revisions\/2479"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=2477"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=2477"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=2477"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":2474,"date":"2011-11-29T19:41:00","date_gmt":"2011-11-29T14:11:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=2474"},"modified":"2011-11-30T07:30:19","modified_gmt":"2011-11-30T02:00:19","slug":"joel-bianchi-sad-news","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2011\/11\/29\/joel-bianchi-sad-news\/","title":{"rendered":"Joel Bianchi, Sad&nbsp;News"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:tahoma;\">From:<\/span><span style=\"font-family:tahoma;\">&nbsp;Phil Sessa &nbsp;

In the blockbuster movie&nbsp;Braveheart,&nbsp;William Wallace&nbsp;played by&nbsp;Mel Gibson<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Director&nbsp;of the Passion of the Christ was speaking to the people of Scotland that he was rallying together. He said, &#8220;Aye, fight and you may die, run, and you&#8217;ll live&#8230; at least for a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing&#8217; to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they&#8217;ll never take&#8230;&nbsp;OUR FREEDOM!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Our enemies will try and take things from us sometimes those enemies may be our own family members or those that are close to us. This is precisely the predicament that Joseph found himself in twice during his life. Joseph was the favored son, and jealousy brewed among his brothers toward him. Eventually his brothers sold him as a slave and took the robe he was wearing. Joseph was unlike his brothers both in<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">his&nbsp;attitude and character. Although they took his robe, they couldn&#8217;t take Joseph&#8217;s character or attitude from him. People can take the temporal things, but they cannot take the eternal things, such as our character from us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Then Joseph is brought to&nbsp;Egypt&nbsp;as a slave and his gift and godly character cause him to rise up in Pharaoh&#8217;s ranks, second only to&nbsp;Pharaoh. He found himself in a compromising position with&nbsp;the&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Pharaoh&#8217;s&nbsp;wife who wanted to have sex with him. Genesis 39:10 reads &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And it came about as she spoke to Joseph day after&nbsp;day, that&nbsp;he didn&#8217;t listen to her to lie beside her, or be with her<\/span>.&#8221;&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">However, one day &#8220;She caught him by his cloak and said, &#8220;Come to bed with me!&#8221; But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Like Joseph&#8217;s brothers, she took a piece of clothing from Joseph. When he ran from her he had his character and integrity fully intact, because she couldn&#8217;t take that away, because it was not for the taking in Joseph&#8217;s estimation. The only way she could have received it, was if Joseph gave it away, not an option in his mind. This is a lesson to take from Joseph. He was not giving up the character<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">that&nbsp;had been developed within him through his trials. I&#8217;ve heard it rightly said, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Character is what you are in the dark, when no one is looking.<\/span>&#8220;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Joseph teaches us:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;color:black;margin:0;\">1.

She was involved in accident 3 weeks ago with an injury that left her left hand mangled in need of surgery. As we talked about what happened and how God had brought her through, she mentioned about this teenage girl of 16 in the same hospital room with brain injury. She too had been in an accident&nbsp;&nbsp;and has been unconscious state for about a month now. Doctors did not think she was going to make it. There are small signs of her beginning to respond to a few motions. Keep her in prayers, her name is Lizbeth Velasquez. I also met her dad Raul who continues to be beside her bed 12 hours every day not even able to talk to his daughter because she cannot respond and guess what, she will not be home for thanksgiving this year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">I bring this up because as I was driving back home, I was thinking how easily we take things for granted. A musician in a song penned these words, \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">we take a lot of things for granted, one day it all be taken away, that\u2019s when you realize how important it was. You will never miss your water until your well runs dry, give thanks and praise all the time<\/span>\u201d. In other words, we take many things that are vital in our lives and we sense their impact when they are affected and they affect us. I was just imagining that this 16 year Old\u2019s life had been interrupted due an injury and wondered how many of us went through that stage with no major just minor or no injuries. Then I got to thinking about something I have been doing for some time now, recognizing what God has done in my life both small and big and having set a day each week not to ask but to thank Him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">In this week of thanksgiving, what are you thankful for and who do you thank? When was the last time you thanked God for the air you breath, the freedom of worship, your hands, legs, ability to think, ability to smell, ability to taste, your internal organs, the roof over your head, food on the table, family members, protection from accidents and incidents etc. Everyone has something to be thankful for and if you don\u2019t think you do, just take a trip to one of the hospitals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">The verse above tells of how David was thankful to God for many things. Before, he tried to bring the Ark of the Covenant back home from the Philistines who had captured it in the days of Eli the priest. And because the Ark was not handled properly (God\u2019s ways) when David was bringing it back home, God killed Uzzah. David&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore stationed the Ark in the house of Obed-Edom while he went to seek God on how to handle the Ark. Upon learning and handling it properly, David had every reason to give thanks to the Lord the reason he wrote this psalm,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs., 8\u201cOh, give thanks to the LORD! Call upon His name; Make known His deeds among the peoples!\u201d.&nbsp;<\/span>Thanksgiving is about making God\u2019s name great and making known His deeds among the people. It\u2019s very important, the question is, do you have a thanksgiving to bring to make His name great and make known His deeds among His people<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">? Psalm 100:4, \u201cEnter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:1pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">I love messages in the hymns and one that is appropriate for this season is \u201cCount your blessings\u201d, lyrics \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">&nbsp;1.&nbsp;When upon life\u2019s billows you are tempest-tossed, When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost, Count your many blessings, name them one by one, And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Chorus<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">: Count your blessings, name them one by one, Count your blessings, see what God hath done!

When you look at others with their lands and gold, Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold; Count your many blessings\u2014wealth can never buy Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high. 4. So, amid the conflict whether great or small, Do not be discouraged, God is over all; Count your many blessings, angels will attend, Help and comfort give you to your journey\u2019s end\u201d<\/span>.

Instead of Joshua blaming the spies or trying to analyze what strategy he could have executed better or should chose now, he chooses to cry out to God, the whole place he should have started from.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Joshua 7:6 \u201cThen Joshua&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">tore his clothes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads\u201d.&nbsp;<\/span>Over and over again in the bible men who were distressed by what was going on tore their clothes and put on sack clothes as a token of mourning. A man to be defeated was not pleasant. And here we see Joshua do the same, he tore his clothes, reducing himself to nothing for a few reasons I can think of, 1. He was distressed that he did not involve God in the planning the way they did when they attacked Jericho, 2. He desperately needed God\u2019s intervention so that they would not be wiped out, 3. The most important, He was desperate for God\u2019s name to be made great in vs. 9.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">It is interesting to note also that he is not sending elders, spies, armed men to pray, he begins it and then you see the elders of Israel join. These are the kind of leaders our generation desperately need to turn us back to the Almighty God when what we tried failed without seeking new ways to battle. We have to come to that place where we realize that the battle is the Lord\u2019s and it will have to be fought God\u2019s way with Him present or we will be left with casualties. It begins with seeking God and trusting in Him.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 3: 5, \u201cTrust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 In all your ways acknowledge Him,&nbsp;&nbsp;And He shall direct your paths. 7&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and depart from evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;8 It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Prayer is the never-failing resource of the tempted Christian, whether struggling with outward difficulties or inward foes. At the mercy-seat of the Almighty God in humility and brokenness, the seeker opens his heart, spreads his case, and makes his appeal. When he can discern that the glory of God is engaged on his side, faith gains the victory, and he rejoices that he shall never be moved. The best pleas in prayer are taken from God&#8217;s delight in meeting His children\u2019s need for His own glory<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. 2 Chronicles 16:9, \u201cFor the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth,&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Joshua sought God, God revealed the sin in the camp and Joshua dealt with it. In chapter 8, you read how God began to speak to Joshua again the same He did when He spoke to them about Jericho, encouraging him of what He will do for them.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Joshua&nbsp;8:1, \u201cNow the LORD said to Joshua: \u201cDo not be afraid, nor be dismayed; take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land. 2 And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king.

and they put dust on their heads\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">A little boy had been helped by his father cross a busy highway successfully without being hit by cars and killed. The next time the boy thought he could do it on his own in a small road. Instead of calling on the father to help him cross like he did before, he decided to cross it himself without the guidance and supervision of his father. Without the covering of the father, tragedy awaited him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">This analogy fits in with Joshua and the Israelites. In the previous chapter, Joshua sent spies to Jericho and they discovered that Jericho was fortified and only God could help them overcome this city. The Lord chose a plan we all would despise to fight the battle however we need to remember the battle is the Lord\u2019s. He can chose to fight it his own way. Anyway in Jericho, the Lord was with them, giving direction&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Joshua 6: 2,\u201dAnd the LORD said to Joshua: \u201cSee! I have given Jericho into your hand, its king,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the mighty men of valor. 3 You shall march around the city, all you men of war; you shall go all around the city once. This you shall do six days. \u20268 So it was, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams\u2019 horns before the LORD advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the LORD 9 The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">You can see clear instructions about the priests advancing blowing the trumpets and the ark of the covenant present, a presentation of the presence of God and then the armed men both front and back. You see great victory as they followed through God\u2019s instructions with His presence being with them, however great victory is not experienced in Ai the next city. Joshua sent spies to spy the land like he did with Jericho, the report they received,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Joshua 7: 3, \u201cAnd they returned to Joshua and said to him, \u201cDo not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not weary all the people there, for&nbsp;the people of Ai are&nbsp;few.\u201d&nbsp;<\/span>You see a different strategy that would lead to tragedy<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.&nbsp;<\/span>Here Joshua who is the leader gets report that the city is small he needed no big troop. He is advised to send only 2 to 3 thousand to attack and what does Joshua do,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;vs. 4 So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai. 5 And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent; therefore the hearts of the people melted and became like water<\/span>\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">You may say, had he sent a bigger troop, they would have won, no, they would have still been defeated&nbsp;&nbsp;and here is why. There is no indication that they sought God as to how to defeat Ai. If anything we know why they were defeated in Ai because of sin in the camp. Had they sought God before advancing, God would have showed them what was in the camp and would have given them direction and gone with them. They chose to battle this out without God because it appeared small. You don\u2019t hear about the priests going before them, you don\u2019t hear about the ark of the covenant also going with them, all you hear is three thousand men are sent.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">This is where many of us feel defeated, like the little boy trying to cross the highway, we feel we can cross the highway of life on our own sometimes. Yes we saw how the Father helped us cross it before and we feel we have mastered it and because what He dealt with was big and what we are facing today is small, how easy it is to be deceived. How foolish it is for us to think we can manage the small things on our own. If you were to look at the times you failed, you will come to realize it was in the small things you thought you could handle.

They wished to be freed from bondage, free from oppression, free from slavery and so on and so forth. 400 hundred years they hoped and waited for a deliverer. And when finally God sent Moses to deliver them, God had a bigger plan for them with Him as the center of His plan. His main goal was to free them that they may serve Him starting at Mt. Sinai. This was more than get them to a nice place free from trouble (land that flows with milk and honey) even though that came with the deliverance. God speaking to Pharaoh through Moses and Aaron said&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Exodus 5: 1, \u201c\u2026 \u2018Let&nbsp;My&nbsp;people&nbsp;go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness\u201d, Exodus 10:3, \u201cLet My people go, that they may serve Me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">At this Mt. where they were to worship the true God who had brought them this far, they became impatient while Moses was up the mountain for only 40 days compared to 400 years in bondage. They were anxious to get to the promise land that instead of seeking God to continue lead them there, they chose plan B, make gods who would lead them to the promise land Yahweh had promised them.&nbsp;&nbsp;And who did they turn to, Aaron who&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">gladly gave them what they craved<\/span>&nbsp;. We do not find that he said one word to discountenance their proposal. Aaron was a priest and was suppose to exercise his priestly duties even in the absence of Moses the type of Christ in this passage (the mediator between God and man). Aaron chose to heed to the voice of the people to give them what they wanted to which Moses blamed Aaron for&nbsp;&nbsp;Vs. \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">21 And Moses said to Aaron, \u201cWhat did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?\u201d.&nbsp;<\/span>When Moses confronted him, Aaron shifted the blame to the people instead of taking the responsibility vs.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;22 So Aaron said, \u201cDo not let the anger of my lord become hot.

Have become men pleasers rather than God and by that I mean in the house of the Lord where true worship ought to rise, they have become weary and have chosen to yield to the pressure of the people to give them what they want. While that may feel good, the problem is that it\u2019s leading people outside God\u2019s will.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Our generation has forgotten the whole reason we were freed from the bondage of sin and many of our priests instead of turning us back to the true worship with Christ as the center of it, they have helped us build golden calf with what we have provided them, things we worship more than we do Yahweh. We are worshiping materialistic things, health and prosperity and all we care about is not so much freed to come and worship the true God but freed to be rushed to the promise land. And since God is not fast enough, let\u2019s find other pragmatic ways to answer our own prayer. Turn back to the gods of the Egyptians, bring back the things we abandoned to help us in this journey. Borrow from the world and it\u2019s ways and hope to make it. We have to remember that Egypt was successful in prosperity, military, influence etc, the Israelites wanted to tap into that success by trying to serve some of their gods. Sad but true, many churches in our generation are fashioned the Egyptian way, borrowing from Egypt to build a church and Christ is not the center of it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">We are in danger when the Aarons\u2019 of our day will not stand, unmoved, unshaken for the sake of Christ. My prayer and I hope is yours is that God will raise men who are not afraid to call sin what it is whether it\u2019s popular or not. Men who are bold to stand in public, media, in interviews and speak truth like it is without going in circles and can\u2019t make a stand. Men who are not swayed by the voice of people but are faithful to God\u2019s call and are pointing us all who believe to the center of our worship,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cChrist and Him crucified\u201d.&nbsp;<\/span>Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; Exodus 32:1-35, \u201c1 And Moses said to Aaron, \u201cWhat did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?\u201d 22 So Aaron said, \u201cDo not let the anger of my lord become hot.

If we choose the right road it will make all the difference in life for us as well. Life has often been described as the way one lives on a way, a path, a road, or other such words that depict travel, journeying or direction. Isaiah says &#8220;a highway will be there,&#8221; which is to say that there is a certain highway that is ever present. However although the highway can be seen clearly, not all see it. Even all those who do see it do not travel on it. Why not? It is because it is &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">called the way of holiness<\/span>&#8220;, as all highways have a name.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">What kind of terrain does this highway have? Is it smooth, void of bumps, potholes, and sharp turns? No, it has its fair share of all of these and more. God Himself is the architect of this road. It is not an easy road to take, because this is not a highway that one can travel on in their own strength. This is a road that one must &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus (2 Tim 2:1).&nbsp;<\/span>Since this is a road of holiness, only the redeemed of the Lord may journey on it. To redeem (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">exagorazo<\/span>) means &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">to buy out of slavery<\/span>&#8221; by paying a price. Christ paid our sin debt by dying on the cross. The redeemed is an elect family, the body of Christ, which helps one another to walk on. It is hard to know what to do at times on this road because one must &#8220;walk in it by faith and not by sight.&#8221; The road is not a wide road, but a rather narrow one because few find it in (Matt 7:14), and there is none other like it. Although many walk on this road, The Apostle Paul described his travels on this road as a race in which he ran for the prize promised. He said<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, &#8220;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day&#8211;and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing (2 Tim 4:7-8<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Oh yes Christian if you are on this Highway of Holiness it is because you have the power of Christ in you, because, it is&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,&#8217; says the LORD Almighty&#8221;&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp;Oh&nbsp;He knows your every trial and uses them to strengthen and refine your faith in Him, because He has called you to walk by faith and not by sight.

He speaks of an experience that one must truly enter into, this is not something God forces us to do, but we willingly enter into. The KJV renders the beginning of this verse \u201cI am\u201d, which more directly points to something we must daily enter into. I am daily crucified with Jesus, daily I die to myself, daily I live by faith. I cannot say enough that Christianity does not consist in church attendance, nor in bible reading, not in evangelism or good deeds, not even in the sacraments, for without a true work of grace within the heart, all of those things mean nothing. I must be crucified with&nbsp;Him,&nbsp;I must enter in to His death. I must repent of my sin, I must be born again.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">The root of regeneration is \u2018gene\u2019, meaning the gene of Christ, the Holy Spirit, is planted within my heart upon my conversion, and where Christ is planted, Christ grows,&nbsp;But&nbsp;like any other living organism, that right conditions must be present. The seed must be watered and fed, it must be given plenty of sun, it must be cared for and nurtured, but above all, for the seed of Christ to grow in my life, Christ must truly be planted within me. What do&nbsp;we&nbsp;each see growing in our lives? Do we see Christ? Do we see the fruits of Godliness and holiness? Or do we see worldliness and carnal desires? Is Christ living in me, or do I still live?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Paul says that the life we now live, this crucified life where I have died to myself and have ceased to live, this life where Christ now lives, not I, I live by faith, a continual, ongoing faith, whereby I offer myself wholly to God as a living sacrifice each day, desiring Him above all else, and forsaking all that I may have Him alone. This is the nature of regeneration, the nature of Christ now dwells within me,&nbsp;I&nbsp;am a new creature, desiring nothing but perfect love and devotion unto God. This is the fruit of Christ living in&nbsp;me,&nbsp;I now obey Him and live by His word. No one has to tell me to read my Bible and pray, no one has to tell me to bear fruit, for I do it naturally, in sweetest harmony with the nature of Christ now living within me. I no longer live, Christ lives. This is the life all are called to live, the door is open, one that no man can shut,&nbsp;will&nbsp;we not enter in? God is calling friends, do you hear His voice?

If you have goals, you work hard to achieve them and many times within the time frame you have allocated those goals. Often times you find that in pursuit of your goal, there are some things that occur that creates a setback or a delay in what you are working hard towards. The setbacks can be painful and costly but they are there and have to be dealt with. Setbacks will not push you forward but backwards if not stagnant and this could take days, weeks, months and even years. Do we ever sit and wonder why at times we have setbacks in our lives?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">John 15 is a good chapter that paints the picture of how setbacks work. Jesus likened Himself to the True vine and the Father as the vinedresser. As believers we are connected to the True vine as branches and the branches have significant roles of bearing fruit. Jesus says,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;&#8220;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away<\/span>&#8220;. Note how He puts it, &#8220;every branch IN ME&#8221;, in other words, every believer connected to Him should bear fruit and there has to be things within that believer that allows them to stay connected and be fresh to bear fruit. The branches that do not bear fruit are dead branches He takes away because they do not belong to Him. No one can take them away but Him. It is my hope that we do not fall into this category.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit<\/span>&#8220;. This is where many of us are, it&#8217;s not that the branch is not bearing fruit, the reason for the setback. And it&#8217;s not always sin that sets us back, at times it&#8217;s because God wants us to bear more fruit. So He may take away a good thing that is happening in your life and of course that would create a setback but He knows what He is doing. We know the devil loves to whisper in our ears the reason we are going through what we are facing is because we messed up. When David was anointed to be king, for the next 17 years he was running for his life not because he sinned but because He was being pruned to bear more fruit and so was Job, Daniel and many others in the bible. It was not even to teach them a lesson, it was to get them to bear more fruit. The pruning the Lord does is to allow His children to grow and be stronger. You may have seen yourself being married by now and nothing has happened and you wonder whether you sinned or missed God&#8217;s will or you are being taught a lesson and the like.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;The blessing may be delayed but not denied<\/span>. It could be the Lord wants to develop more of the fruit of patience, faith, self-control among others things. You may have worked hard to get a job and you did but then you lost it and it created a setback, you never know, maybe the Lord is developing your character and integrity that will sustain you when he opens the door. You may have desired to be in ministry and nothing has happened yet, could be the Lord is teaching you leadership, submission, humility and more. He is not saying you don\u2019t have fruit in your life, He says<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;&#8220;that it may bear more fruit<\/span>&#8220;, He wants to get more of it out of you. This could also be the grounds of testimonies that despite all that has happened, God knew what He was doing and in His right time, He made all things beautiful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">You and I can look at the setbacks as TEMPORARY situations that delay what we want to achieve<\/span>. It&#8217;s upon us to look at them as some things the Lord is using to get more fruit out of us. We can also look at them as a means of growth. Instead of crying to the Lord asking why we have them, we can pray Lord what can I learn and grow from this. Over the years I have seen setbacks in my life help me grow and I thank God for them. My wife and I have had major setbacks but we chose to see them as a means of growth and they have. If you want to bear more fruit, expect setbacks (Pruning).

While I don\u2019t desire for us to be consumed with the acts of God like the Israelites that went by feeling, I hope you are encouraged as these few devotions come to you as reminders.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">In the verse above, we see David personalizing his relationship with the Lord. While this may be opened to abuse, I want us to look at it differently. Have you been in a huge crowd, or gone somewhere say a church where you felt you just did not belong? You wondered if anyone even took notice of your presence? I have, and in the midst of all these you wondered whether the Lord takes notice of you. Now I am not talking about taking notice of you because you deserve it, no, taking notice of you because you are His child?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">David learnt the secret of personalizing God in every situation he found himself in and over and over we hear him say MY fortress, MY shield, MY comfort, MY salvation, MY horn, MY strength. Sounds selfish but not quite. When God looks at all His people, yes He does see people collectively but right in the midst of it, He can see you exactly where you are. He is concerned about your needs and problems as an individual. The bible says that He has curved us in the palm of His hands, He knows our down sitting and our uprising. He is familiar with our ways.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mathew 10:30, &#8220;But the very hairs in your head are all numbered<\/span>&#8220;, this sums up everything that God knows about us. I can&#8217;t even tell when I lose a hair, He does. I can&#8217;t even count them but He does and knows how many they are,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">He has numbered them<\/span>. That is the God we serve, the God who knows everything about us from day one to the last day of our lives. He is the same God who has set up a destiny for each of us. Can you imagine someone who has already set up a place in history for you to fit in? From the day He thought about bring you into the world before anyone thought about it, He already set up a plan and a purpose for everyone not as a group but as individuals?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Because He knows us and we know Him, we can Join men like Paul, David, Job in saying \u201cMY\u201d ,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Philippians 4:19, &#8220;But&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">MY<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus<\/span>&#8220;.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 3:3, &#8220;For thou oh Lord are a shield for&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">ME<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, the glory and the lifter of&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">MY<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;head<\/span>&#8220;.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm&nbsp;46:1, &#8220;God is&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">MY<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble<\/span>&#8220;.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Job 19:25, &#8220;I know&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">MY<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;Redeemer lives<\/span>&#8220;,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;O Lord&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">MY<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;God, In You I put&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">MY<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;trust<\/span>&#8220;.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 16:5, &#8220;O Lord, You are the portion of MY inheritance and&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">MY<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;cup; You maintain&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">MY<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;lot&#8221;<\/span>.

I love the way this verse starts,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;The Lord Lives (TLL<\/span>)&#8221;, this is powerful, God is not dead, I spoke with Him this morning. He cares, He has compassion, He has feelings. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Blessed be my rock&#8221;,&nbsp;<\/span>David might have been dealing with something that He did not require healing or joy or confidence. All he needed at this particular time was for God to be his rock, he therefore personalized it &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">MY ROCK<\/span>&#8220;. His rock could prevent wind from sweeping him, needed a place to hide and take refuge, the rock that crushes the enemy&#8217;s head, the rock that cannot be moved or shaken. David needed all these so He called His Lord MY ROCK. What are you dealing with today that you will want the Lord to be for you? call on Him!!. David called him a blessed Rock knowing God is in control.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Let the God of MY salvation be exalted<\/span>&#8220;, meanwhile while He is to me what I am dealing with, Let Him be exalted. Who will exalt Him but the person in the situation. The bible says that if we don&#8217;t praise Him, the rocks will cry out in our place. The rocks don&#8217;t need Him. For David in return was to exalt the Lord,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 34:1, &#8220;I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in MY mouth<\/span>&#8220;. Can you see that because He personalized the Lord in His situation, when it came to time of praise Him, He didn&#8217;t have to wait for a crowd to show up to help Him praise Him, he did it himself.

Not performing to the fullest like we should and instead of God throwing us out and saying we are broken, messed up and dead, He reaches out to us and hits reset button.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Jonah in this case committed&nbsp;sin,&nbsp;he disobeyed God like we all do. God sent him to preach to Nineveh, instead of responding to the&nbsp;call,&nbsp;he chose to go a different direction, Tarshish. He was not responding to the call God had for his life. While on the ship to Tarshish, first God interrupted Jonah\u2019s plan. Later we read that he was thrown into the sea. Instead of the Lord letting him drown because of his foolishness, the bible says, &#8220;&#8230;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah&#8221;.&nbsp;<\/span>Someone said,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">&#8220;in the midst of our foolishness, God still remains faithful&#8221;<\/span>. I would take this and say,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">God has a way of resetting (repositioning) our lives even when we sin and make mistakes<\/span>. You may feel for example you married the wrong person and maybe you received the right counsel but chose to go against the wise counsel and go with your own desires. Should you throw that person out now? Of course not, all you need to know is that God can take what was wrong and reset it (forgiving you and giving you a new start). You may have made wrong business decision, wrong turn in life etc, whatever the case might be. God can reset you again if you be willing. It may require patience, prayers and faithfulness for it to happen. I love to hear that God&#8217;s hand is on it rather than the&nbsp;devil&#8217;s. In Jonah&#8217;s case, God prepared a great fish. You might say, \u201cthat is still terrible\u201d, well it may be but not compared to trying to swim in the sea not knowing what other sea creatures would do to him. I thank God that even though it may still seam bad, the truth of the matter is, it could have been worse and compared to what could be awaiting for me out there. With that thought in mind, it\u2019s not so bad being in the belly of a great&nbsp;fish,&nbsp;it\u2019s only for a season.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Here is what gets me about God resetting a life. In the process, what would consume others has no effect on you and that is because God&#8217;s hand is on what He is resetting. Watch this, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights\u201d,&nbsp;<\/span>think about it, three days and three&nbsp;night&nbsp;and the fish could not digest Jonah why? Because it was God&#8217;s prepared fish, a temporary learning chamber, a place of reset. It&#8217;s was the work of God, a preparation chamber for greater things. Remember it was Jonah who messed up, it was Jonah who wanted to drown himself but it was God who looked at the life of Jonah and said, &#8220;though&nbsp;he messed up, and though he deserves to die, I will hit a reset button in his life for I am not done with him&#8221;. He has not lived to the fullest of what I created him&nbsp;for,&nbsp;he has sinned but I Am the God of restoration&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Are you like Jonah who has gone astray?,&nbsp;decided to be involved in what you now know you cannot back out of?, faced by different challenges and even tried to terminate your dreams and desires because you felt you messed so bad?, I am here to tell you, God can reset you again. You can be restored again like Jonah for His glory and Honor.

And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 11 But Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers; so the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 12 For every man threw down his rod, and they became serpents.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">But Aaron\u2019s rod swallowed up their rods<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">In the bible, we see God taking ordinary things to do extraordinary things to show that the power is not in the thing but on whose hands that things is in. And while he takes the ordinary and uses them extraordinarily, we see on the other hand we see the devil at work displaying his magic tricks. The enemy has power no doubt&nbsp;however,&nbsp;God is never intimidated or moved by the tricks of the enemy. The interesting thing is that when God does something, the devil tries to do the same or even top it and God may allow him to display what he can do, the ultimate outcome is what God will go to crash the head of the serpent the devil. God always tops it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">God demonstrated to Moses and Aaron that the rod that they had in their hands by God&#8217;s command if thrown down would turn into a serpent. He then sends them to Egypt to perform that miracle. Of course God knew the Egyptian magicians and sorcerers who represent the devil here would also have the power to turn their rods into serpents. And when every man threw down their rod, they became serpents as the bible tells us. All sounded equal and God let the enemy feel good about his power for a second then something happened, Aaron&#8217;s rod turned into a serpent which was God&#8217;s ordained rod swallowed the magician and sorcerers rods turned into serpents. God had destined to harden Pharaoh\u2019s heart that He would demonstrate His power before him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">What does this tell us, in the process of God demonstrating miracles in your life, don&#8217;t be surprised to see the enemy try to top what God is doing. He will play his magical tricks and many of them may be scary and appear true but don&#8217;t be intimidated by what the enemy does because not long after that, God&#8217;s miracle will swallow the devils little magic tricks. His word says, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2 Chronicles 16:9, &#8220;For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth,&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">to show Himself STRONG on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">&#8220;<\/span>.

The one whom he loved so much, the one to whom he was betrothed was&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">pregnant<\/span>&nbsp;with a child not his. \u201cOh! how could this happen to me? What wrong did I commit? Lord, why did you allow this? She was such a sweet lady, very caring and loving? Oh! what is the need for me to live when my loved one can no longer be mine?&#8221; Such may have been his thoughts having received the news that Mary, his wife to be was pregnant. He always dreamt of building a sweet home in his own time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">He came to a conclusion.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(Matthew 1:19) \u201cThen Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. V 20 But while he thought on these things, &#8230;&#8230;..\u201d&nbsp;<\/span>The Lord revealed HIS plan to Joseph.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">V 21 \u201cAnd she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Our Lord elected Joseph even before the foundation of the world, for fulfilling HIS promise to mankind.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8221; Vs. 22,23 \u201cNow all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. &#8220;<\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph believed the word(scriptures) retold to him through the angel and obeyed HIS word.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">v 24 (Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>Because of his faith, he was honored by God to have personal experience with Jesus.&nbsp;Joseph was able to talk, walk, eat and be with Jesus. He also had the privilege to listen to words of divine wisdom from Jesus everyday.&nbsp;But all this(fulfillment of promise) did not happen in a day(i.e., overnight).&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 25 \u201cAnd knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS\u201d.&nbsp;<\/span>He had to wait till the promise of God was fulfilled by the birth of Jesus. During this period, it is very difficult for us to imagine how much pain he might have undergone explaining to people the reason he married Mary knowing that she was pregnant but yet at peace knowing he was in God\u2019s perfect will.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Dear friends, like Joseph, in our life at this very moment each one of us may be going through many varied experiences which will make us question as Joseph questioned HIM.(Paragraph 1). The problem may be at home, or at office, or with friends, or at studies, or may be a lost golden opportunity, or may be a problem which is pounding your heart since a long time. Our Lord is saying the same to you today as HE told Joseph. HE has chosen you even before the foundations of this world for a very special and unique purpose.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">He wants to reveal Himself through you to others&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp;that HE is &#8220;The Savior&#8221;. He wants you to know that as Joseph obeyed if you trust, obey and have faith in HIS word, you will also be lead into rich personal experience of Jesus as Joseph enjoyed (words in red). Our dear ones, sometimes others will question and may even mock us as we wait patiently for fulfillment of HIS promise. As Joseph waited in faith for the fulfillment of the promise, we need to have faith in our deliverer, so that as HE unleashes HIS power through you and as you rejoice at your deliverance, the whole world will witness the marvelous saving grace of JESUS in you and will glorify HIM.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Have a Christ Centered Day,<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Your brother in Christ,<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">John Solomon<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Praise the Lord!. &nbsp; I thank our Loving Savior for giving me this wonderful message when I was deeply disturbed.

So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, `Look! All these years I&#8217;ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!&#8217; `My son,&#8217; the father said, `you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.&#8217; \u201c(Luke 15:25-32)<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Look at the perspective, and attitude the older brother had, which is similar to the attitude most of the modern church has today. The late Bill Bright reports in his book \u201cThe Coming Revival\u201d that 98% of Christians don\u2019t try and actively reach the lost and only 2% of Christians are doing their job.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest are like the taxi cabs that drive around \u201coff duty\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp;In NYC I see tons of yellow taxi cabs, taxiing people to various destinations. I can\u2019t imagine if only 2% of the taxi cabs drove around on duty, while 98% of them had their sign light up reading \u201coff duty.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be ludicrous because why would they be calling themselves taxi cab drivers if they never try and pick people up to taxi around?&nbsp;&nbsp;They might as well get another job.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">The vast majority are driving around in the nice atmosphere of worship, prayer, and praise (each necessary and important), but neglecting the sober task God has given to us to seek and save the lost. Oswald J. Smith said, &#8220;<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Oh my friends we are loaded down with countless church activities, while the real work of the Church, that of evangelizing the world and winning the lost is almost entirely neglected<\/span>.\u201c&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">The \u201cfaithful son\u201d wasn\u2019t concerned about his lost brother, but focused on himself. He was similar to the Pharisee who compared himself to the tax collector (Luke 18). The Pharisee and the older son shared the same spirit, and we see their attitude in the following: Both focused on&nbsp;themselves, compared themselves with the one they thought less of, and had no concern for the lost. The \u201clost\u201d tax-collector was calling out to God, and the lost son came home to the father, yet neither of the two men cared about the lost. The prodigal\u2019s dad had a heart for his lost son, and rejoiced when the lost now found. The father pleaded with his older son\u2019s, tried to deal with his&nbsp;anger&nbsp;&nbsp;even&nbsp;persuading him to change his perspective, but the older son\u2019s stubborn ways would not be moved.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that grieving the father\u2019s heart, just as that attitude grieves Father God\u2019s heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine if God were a Fire Chief and his firefighters were polishing their fire engine outside a burning building. If they were consumed with the truck\u2019s beauty then they wouldn\u2019t hear the cries of help from terrified people trapped at a top floor window. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with cleaning their truck, but not while people are trapped in a burning building! What would the Fire Chief think and feel about his firefighter?.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Application:&nbsp;&nbsp;We are called to rescue people from a greater fire that is why&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Revelation 19:15<\/span>&nbsp;reads, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">If anyone&#8217;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire<\/span>\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a firefighter on God\u2019s force, where is your focus?, on polishing your engine of worship, prayer, and praise, or running into the burning buildings with the full armor of God, especially the gospel boots of peace to seek and to save the lost?

Be a taxi cab driver that always is on duty to taxi people to Christ. Charles Spurgeon &#8220;<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Have you no wish for others to be saved? Then you are not saved yourself. Be sure of that.<\/span>&#8221; Just imagine, being in heaven with all those you\u2019ve shared the gospel with, and brought to Christ, both knowingly and unknowingly. There is going to be a major Party in heaven called the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, which I believe will be a culmination of all that have been called by God and been active, if they were able, in bringing people to Christ.

The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: `God, I thank you that I am not like other men&#8211;robbers, evildoers, adulterers&#8211;or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&#8217; &#8220;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&#8217; &#8220;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&#8221; (Luke 18:10-14)<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">God loves parties I know that is hard to believe!. God loves to celebrate with His heavenly hosts. But what is it that causes heaven to throw a party? Well let\u2019s look at the prayer of the tax collector. He was right there with the Pharisee in the Temple. This man was on a mission to meet with God. And in the Temple he probably heard the Pharisee put him down, mock him, and compare the Pharisee\u2019s good deeds with the unrighteous deeds of the tax-collector, their hearts were different. The tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven. Why did this man distance himself, and not even lift his head? You may have heard people say things like, &#8220;If I go to church the building will fall down, or God will strike me with lightning&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a jokingly, superstitious expression, but yet it carries with it the connotation (implication) that I can\u2019t be in the presence of God, I am not good enough. And anyone who thinks that they are not good enough is 100% correct.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">We are not good enough for God<\/span>. This is where the Pharisee went wrong, but the tax-collector went right. Look at the repentant attitude and godly sorrow of the tax collector. It says that he &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/span>This seven word prayer was received more than the thirty-three word prayer of the Pharisee! Why, because God is looking for an honest heart, not a self- righteous one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">In Luke 15 Jesus spoke of lost things. He told three parables which are common earthly situations told as a story to explain transcendent heavenly truths. Jesus often swung his listeners from the natural to the spiritual. And in these three parables He speaks about a lost sheep, a lost coin, and a lost son. The shepherd left the ninety-nine sheep to go after the one, the woman swept her whole house to find that precious coin, and the father of the prodigal son ran to his son when he saw him coming home from squandering his wealth in wild living. In each situation when the lost thing was found, what was the result? The shepherd, the woman, and the father ALL had the same response, they threw a party!&nbsp;&nbsp;Verse 6 says of the shepherd, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home<\/span>\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, `<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep<\/span>.&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verse 9 reads of the woman, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, `Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin<\/span>.&#8217; And verse 23 states of the prodigal son,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cBring the fattened calf and kill it. Let&#8217;s have a feast and celebrate<\/span>\u201d&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">This was all over the lost things being found<\/span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But here is the bigger picture. Oh yes there was a party going on down below, but it could not compare with the party going on up above in heaven. Jesus said in&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Luke 15:7, &#8220;I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent<\/span>. And again in&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Luke 15:10 &#8220;In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">We all know what it\u2019s like to lose something for a time, search diligently and the finally to find it. If you are not a Christian then measure your life against the 10 Commandments seeing if your broke them one by one, and then repent of your sin, receive His forgiveness, and live for God, being faithful in prayer, Bible reading and obedience. If you are a Christian then you need to be telling people about the truth of Christ. Has heaven ever thrown a party because you lead someone to Christ, or is heaven disappointed because you have been a party popper, not sharing your faith in Christ with non-believers? Who are you actively sharing the gospel with, and praying that heaven has a party in God\u2019s honor. You share, God saves and He gets all the credit and heaven rejoices over Him who has saved a lost soul. Think about it, and obey the Lord.

Remember someone else would wish to be in your situation since theirs may be worse than yours. Don\u2019t sit and have a pity party, speak like Paul who said,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;\u2026for I know whom I have believed and I am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day&#8221;, 2Tim 1:12.&nbsp;<\/span>I\u2019m not talking about positive thinking or positive outlook; I\u2019m talking about speaking God\u2019s word that is able to defeat the enemy of our souls.

And Biathar brought the ephod to David. Vs. 8 So David inquired of the Lord, saying,&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">\u201cshall I pursue after my enemies?\u201d<\/span>&nbsp;It all comes back to seeking God for a new direction.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 37:23&nbsp;<\/span>tells us<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201cThe good steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord\u201d.&nbsp;<\/span>\u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Order\u201d&nbsp;<\/span>is to give directions, to command; that is what we need. Seek God\u2019s direction in what you are dealing with, it\u2019s through seeking Him that you are led as you become obedient, wise, and have faith as you realize that without Him, you can do nothing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">David needed to know from the Lord if he could go after his enemies and if victory would accompany them.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 8, \u201cAnd He answered Him, \u201cPursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all\u201d<\/span>&nbsp;Amen. When God gives us an okay to go after our enemies, regardless of how the battle may look or sound one thing we need to keep in the back of our minds is that we have won. It\u2019s like you already have an \u201cA\u201d for an exam you are about to sit for. It may be so difficult, you may not have the answers and time may be running out. We need to remember in the back of our minds the victory is already won.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">David and his men left to pursue after their enemies. Out of the 600 men, 200 men got feeble and tired on the way and couldn&#8217;t move anymore after their enemies. Don\u2019t be discouraged when some people who were to help you fight got feeble and stop pursuing,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">for the battle is not ours but the Lords<\/span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;Vs. 16,&nbsp;<\/span>they finally caught up with the enemy, David and his now 400 men fought the battle and won.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 18, \u201cSo David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives. Vs. 19,&#8221;and nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons and daughter, spoil or anything which they had taken from them, David recovered all\u201d<\/span>. What a great recovery to everything from the smallest to the greatest. I could stop at the restoration however God did much more than that, He also gave them \u201d<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">DOUBLE FOR TROUBLE\u201d&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 15<\/span>, the Amalekites did not only invade Ziklag, they invaded Philistine and Judah and they took their goods and besides that, the enemy was already rich for this was a strong army. David and his men recovered what belonged to them and took all that the enemy had gathered from Philistine and Judah and also what belonged to the enemy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">I now know that God does give us double for our trouble, more than what we have lost. They had so much that they ended up giving some to friends and relatives. How it is a blessing to be used by God to reach out to others after you have gone through so much. What they went through humbled them and brought them closer to one another. Though the four hundred men did not want to share what they had gathered with the two hundred left behind, David once again steps in and encourages them to share. After this episode, I would say their faith increased, they saw how their leader handles things under pressure when he turned disappointment into appointment. Some of us would not be where we are if we never had major setbacks in our lives and how God turned our disappointments into appointments. He continues to use situations to build us and bless us that we may in turn advance His kingdom.

During this time, David had been anointed to be the next king while Saul was still ruling at this time. David&#8217;s reign was just around the corner, however his reign was not going to come easy. Saul was out to kill him, the philistines to who he had destroyed their champion had an issue with him and now the Amalekites had descended right into their camping site while the David and his 600 men were away to team up with the Philistines to fight Israel. The Philistines did not trust David for they feared that David was in a position of turning against them while in the battle field to join the Philistine enemy. So they refused to allow him to team up with them and David and his men came back to their camping site.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">One thing I want to point out before we continue, there is always an enemy against the people of God, just because you are anointed and walking victoriously does not mean you are exempt from attacks from the enemy. If you defeated him once, surely enough he will leave you for a season and then come back at a later time. When Jesus was in the wilderness after being tried of the devil, the bible says that the devil left him for a SEASON. The Amalekites were David&#8217;s enemies and David had fought them before and won and therefore left him for a season. When they knew David and his men were not at home (camping site), they came in and attacked the place. We need to be on the lookout at all times, the bible says&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1Peter 5:8, &#8220;Be sober, be vigilant; for your adversary the devil as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour&#8221;.<\/span>&nbsp;Mark the word, he roams like a lion, he is not the lion, Jesus Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah and&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Isaiah 62:6, says &#8220;I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day or night&#8221;.&nbsp;<\/span>These two verses alone show us that we have an enemy constantly checking whether we are sober and vigilant, he is also trying to see if we have watchmen on the walls. Are you well covered in these areas? While men were absent, the enemy descended. Where are men today who are watching their camps in prayer and in the word? Majority have exposed their wives and children to danger because they are not watching their camps by being strong in prayers and the word. If you are driving and you have your family in the car, you would not fall asleep on the wheel would you? If you did, you will have put your family in danger leave alone yours. Being married has driven me to pray more and be in the word, why, because I need my camp safe. The enemy is out to destroy my spiritual life, my marriage, my home, my ministry etc. the thought drives me to watch and pray.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Since David and his men were missing in action, the Amalekites came in took their wives, children and possessions. They went as far as burning the entire place down, what does this remind us of the mission of the enemy,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">John 10:10, &#8220;The thief cometh not but for to steal, kill and destroy&#8221;.&nbsp;<\/span>Already two of his missions have been fulfilled, he has stolen and destroyed. When David and his men came and saw everything that had happened, they wept until there was no more strength left in them.&nbsp;&nbsp;It\u2019s ok to weep over what you\u2019ve lost but there are times when we have to pronounce benediction over what we have been weeping over and take a stand, encourage ourselves in the Lord and trust God. God is bringing us from a place of being victims to place of being victors for His own glory. What the enemy meant for evil, God will turn it around for our good for His own glory.

Success always comes with a price tag. Being blessed can be such hard work. Everything God gives us requires maintenance. When He placed&nbsp;Adam and Eve&nbsp;in the garden, they had to take care of it. Jesus said when you are &#8220;planning to build&#8230;.sit down and figure the cost.&#8221; For example, when God blesses you, don&#8217;t expect everyone around you to be happy for you and congratulate you on being blessed because it doesn&#8217;t happen that way at all. Some people figure that your blessing came at their expense. That&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t want you to move ahead faster than they do, they are envious and jealous of your prosperity and blessings. The real reason why this happens is that they want what God has given to you, but they&#8217;re not prepared to pay the price that you have paid for this\/these blessings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">James says, &#8220;For where envy and self-seeking exists, confusion and every evil thing are there.&#8221; (James 3:16). And it is not just your enemies that you have to watch out for; betrayal often comes from within your own ranks or within your own circle of friend, sisters\/brothers in Christ and the like. Jesus sat at the table with John, the beloved on one side and Judas the betrayer on the other. One was close enough to lay his head on Jesus&#8217; breast while the other had sufficient access to betray Him with a kiss. You need to know who&#8217;s sitting at your table or who&#8217;s in your circle!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">However, as painful or hurtful as it is to be criticized by people you respect and trust, it&#8217;s worst to go astray from the course God&#8217;s made for you to travel in order to gain their acceptance and friendship and such. As good as it feels to be affirmed and recognized, at some point in time, you need to stop and ask yourself, &#8220;How much am I willing to sacrifice to be blessed?&#8221; Your answer will determine your destiny!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Prayer: Lord God, keep me focused and stayed on you for I am humbling myself to be your servant and to stay in this race, help me to not go astray from your purpose and will for my life.

He may never explain the process but definitely we will know the outcome. Being that He is the reason for the outcome causes us to be believers as He is not a man that He should lie neither is He a son of man that He should repent, if He has said it, surely enough, He will do it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Talking about signs is interesting as signs are to show us directions and give us the condition of a place. There are signs that tell us about slowing down, sharp bends, animals around, steep slope, no change of lane, lanes being reduced or increased etc. As you can see all these does show us certain things a head of time. This is how the world in the natural operates and at times when we come to God, many times we desire the same; we want to see first before we can follow. We want to be sure about what is a head of us and so having signs causes us to be confident about what to expect but with God it&#8217;s different. If you do not have the signs a head of time, fear may grip you&nbsp;hence&nbsp;affecting even your speed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Jesus said&#8221;\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And these signs shall follow them that believe<\/span>&#8220;. Jesus knew that for every believer to operate under His power and on a higher level, the believer has to be brought out of the natural into the supernatural. On the supernatural you do not know how to operate in that setting and so calling on God is the greatest thing you can do. This is where if God does not come through for you, there can be nothing good that can happen. If you look at what faith is all about, it&#8217;s not about feeling, it&#8217;s about trusting and it&#8217;s not just about knowing but believing. I may not know the way but because, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I know whom I have believed, \u2026 I am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day&#8221;, 2Tim&nbsp;1:12<\/span>. I may not need to see the signs because I might be tempted to follow the signs by myself without God, if I do not know, He will direct me all the way. Something to keep in mind, we don\u2019t settle for signs, you don\u2019t see a sign and then camp around it because you have seen it, no, signs point to a bigger thing, signs are to lead you to a&nbsp;destiny. In this case, signs are to point us to Jesus, they are a means to an end. Remember the wise men who were led by the stars, the stars were the signs. But they did not look at the signs and became fascinated by them or even worshipped them, the signs were to lead them to this new born baby Jesus the Messiah. Many are out of line because they run after signs and wonders, running from one meeting to another expecting a zap of some kind. \u201cSigns follow them that believe\u201d is a means to a bigger picture, Jesus Christ, but I would put it almost at the bottom, God\u2019s word should be right on top.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalms 23:6,<\/span>&nbsp;&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me&nbsp;all&nbsp;the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord&#8221;<\/span>. I believe that there are things we need not to fight about or even try to fix them as long as we are doing what the Lord requires of us, because good things will follow us if they are in God\u2019s will for our lives. Remember it does not say we shall follow goodness and mercy but they shall follow us. Isn&#8217;t it amazing that we will not just need to hear about what the Lord is doing and can do but actually see some of these things happen in our lives? Then we need to take away our signs that cause us to walk carefully according to the worlds\u2019 ways and desire to see God do greater things that will blow the mind and the mentality of men. After all He is able to make away where their&nbsp;seems&nbsp;to be no way and the crooked paths straight. Only believe, all things are possible with God, the signs point to Him.

Perhaps there are certain situations or people that seem to cause anger to rise up in you. According to the Scriptures anger alone is not a sin.&nbsp;The Scriptures&nbsp;says, be angry and sin not or in your anger do not sin. One thing that seems to make most people excited however is the birth of a child. When a child is born many come to see the newborn and rejoice with the family to whom the child has been born. However, can you picture any reason why one would become angry because of a newborn? This was the response of King Herod to the news of the&nbsp;birth of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Matthew tells us, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Now after \ufeffJesus was born in Bethlehem of&nbsp;Judea&nbsp;in the days of Herod the king, behold, \ufeff\ufeffwise men \ufefffrom the East came to Jerusalem, \ufeff2 saying, \ufeff\ufeff\u201cWhere is He who has been born&nbsp;King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.\u201d<\/span>&nbsp;Why would these&nbsp;Magi&nbsp;which had had traveled from the East, most likely from Persia, first go to&nbsp;King Herod&nbsp;the Roman King to inquire of the newborn Jewish King? Where else would one go to find a King but in a palace? However, God in His&nbsp;Divine Providence&nbsp;moved Christ to safety because God knew of the mutiny that Herod plotted against Jesus. Matthew describes the response of Herod about the news of Jesus\u2019 birth, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him\u201d.&nbsp;<\/span>What was it that caused King Herod to become angry and troubled and ALL JERUSALEM WITH HIM?!?! At this time Herod was the King, although he himself was not Jewish he was the King of the Jews as the Jewish people were under Roman authority.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">The Expositor\u2019s Bible Commentary explains that,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cIn contrast with the Magi&#8217;s desire to worship the King of the Jews, Herod is deeply troubled. In this &#8220;all Jerusalem&#8221; joins him, not because most of the people would have been sorry to see Herod replaced or because they were reluctant to see the coming of King Messiah, but because they well knew that any question like the Magi&#8217;s would result in more cruelty from the ailing Herod, whose paranoia had led him to murder his favorite wife and two sons<\/span>.\u201d WOW, a King that murdered his own wife and sons, no wonder he had no problem desiring to murder the new born King, the Son of God!. Hatred is murder of the heart according to God as John wrote, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.\u201d<\/span>&nbsp;Herod did not want to be replaced, and the people did not wish to experience Herod\u2019s killing tirade as he played no favorites when it came to murder. If Christ were to take the throne and be crowned King, what would that mean for Herod?&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Herod would no longer be King, 2. The Jews would now look to their own King, 3. The authority Herod had over the Jews would now be passed to Jesus 4. Jerusalem would no longer be under the rule of Herod but under the rule of Jesus<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">In the natural I can see why Herod was troubled and angry of this newborn King. This would mean King Herod would be out, and King Jesus would sit on the throne in Jerusalem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Christ\u2019s desires to have the natural sinful Herod heart off the throne, and for Him to have rule and reign over your life. Do you worship like the Magi or become troubled, angry and rebellious&nbsp;like Herod&nbsp;as Christ assumes Kingship over your life. Perhaps today is a day of humble repentance for you. As you examine your response to King Jesus, is it truly one of worship or is Herod\u2019s heart beating in your life?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; Matthew 2:3 \u201cWhen Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all&nbsp;Jerusalem&nbsp;with him.\u201d &nbsp; What causes you to get angry?

The apostles were empowered with the fruit and the gifts of the Holy Spirit of God to fulfill the commission. They understood the commission to be the crowning philosophy given and was most likely to result from believers adhering to the other teachings given by Jesus. By the time readers get to Acts 15, readers have also witnessed wonderful and spectacular things that occurred under the superintendence of the Holy Spirit. Because the lives of the apostles represented an amazing similitude of the life of the Lord, the Spirit was able to bring about the plans and purposes of God in every nation on earth. Through the great commission, believers not only demonstrate their obedience to Christ, but they also join God by and through their efforts in deposing and eclipsing the decay initiated and promoted through sin and the works of the devil. No one can read the Acts narratives without clearly and convincingly observing this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">When looking to Acts 15, world evangelism and missions were experiencing unparalleled success. Every device of the devil to curtail the momentum and the scope of the commission had been absolutely defeated. The devil could not by his outward strength oppose the strength mightily demonstrated by the unleashing of the Spirit through the lives of the apostles who were daily surrendering their lives to Him and closely adhering to the truths of Christ. The outward works were evidence of the inward surrender- and clearly, hell at its best had been undone! Amen? Until\u2026 Acts 15.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Here, a dispute between the Greek and Hebrew ethnicities came to light. The issue involved the proper distribution of wealth and resources. One ethnicity had been clearly overlooked and was disproportionately disadvantaged. This issue was so serious that the humble disciples- now mighty apostles had to come off the front lines of the battlefield. They left the missions and returned home to settle the dispute. The internal strife touched the very heart of the life of the church- body of Christ. The apostles understood that if they failed at properly settling this dispute, they would show that they did not truly know the mind and heart of Christ concerning people, and the blessing of the Spirit would no longer continue with them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">The apostles properly assessed the issue. The problem was that men of similar spiritual substance were not at the head of the project. The people were instructed to elect people with whom they were acquainted and could positively ascertain the depth of their commitment and submission to the things of God. Once these people were appointed to the task, the apostles were able to resume their commission.

I know many of you, as Godly men and women, have heard of this man of God. I say that 3 word phrase with complete and utter understanding. MAN. OF. GOD. So few people today who take the name PASTOR are truly living as such. Keith Daniels is one of those very few on the narrow road that are PRESSING forward as we all run the race to God. I encourage all of you to hear his sermons, and I guarantee you that you&#8217;ll tremble at the awesome power of God that spews like rushing water from his mouth. He sincerely loves the LORD, and desires nothing BUT to serve Him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&#8220;I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well. For this reason I remind you to FAN INTO FLAME the GIFT of GOD, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.&#8221; &#8211; 2 Timothy 1:5-6<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Amen, thank you LORD. Paul addresses his spiritual son, Timothy, while Paul knows that his time on earth is at its end, and his first step into eternity with the LORD awaits past the prison cell that he presently found himself in. Notice how Paul lets Timothy understand that he is only telling him this spiritual secret because of his sincere faith. The faith that his grandmother had, his mother had, and now Timothy had. That is the ONLY reason why Paul continues. I wonder, where is your faith? WHERE IS YOUR FAITH? &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Without faith it is IMPOSSIBLE to please God&#8221; (Hebrews 11:6)<\/span>. If you know about Jesus and the work of the Cross, but have not the faith to live the life He&#8217;s called you to-WHERE is your faith?! When you&#8217;re at work, and the Holy Spirit tugs at your heart to speak the LIFE of the Gospel into the dead and lost souls at the office, are you responding? Or is your faith not up to par? In Ezekiel 16:1-6, did the LORD leave Israel wallowing in its own blood, completely defenseless to its enemy&#8217;s? Why then should we walk by souls wallowing in their SIN while CHRIST bore the sin that WE were wallowing in on the CROSS!?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">&#8220;FAN INTO FLAME THE GIFT!&#8221; The gift. What gift? Some say the Holy Spirit while others say Timothy had a special calling as a pastor, teacher or evangelist. But I challenge you to think that shouldn&#8217;t we as vessels of the Gospel and of the Holy Spirit Himself be called to all three? FAN into FLAME men and women of God!<\/span><span style=\"color:#1F497D;\">.<\/span><span style=\"color:black;\">&nbsp;In today&#8217;s society it is so easy to slip into the lie of comfort. As Christians we are not called to comfort. We have comfort to know that our souls are saved, but we live in agony for the souls of the lost! Go forth now, as ministers and disciples of the LORD Jesus Christ today, and continue on your walk. I pray you&#8217;ve been encouraged, and I pray that we take seriously the things of God. From the smallest to the biggest. Take seriously the things of God.

In its Greek definition, to believe is to think something to be true, to be persuaded of, and to place confidence in someone, to have faith. It means to entrust one\u2019s spiritual wellbeing to Christ. In its usage in the text here, it represents as I said, a belief that is ongoing, that is growing day by day. It is he that goes on believing that shall not perish, for he that ceases to believe ceases to live spiritually, the same way that the man who ceases to breathe ceases to live. This is the essence of faith, it is ongoing and active, the just shall&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">live<\/span>&nbsp;by faith Habakkuk 2:4 says. We&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">walk<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">&nbsp;<\/span>by faith Paul says( II Corinthians 5:7).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">To believe is to continually entrust my life to Jesus, to surrender myself completely to Him each and every day, walking in obedience to His word, it is to give up everything for Him. In John 15 Jesus speaks to us of abiding, and that this is our responsibility. If we abide in Him, v.5 tells us that we bear much fruit, and by this the Father is glorified. If we cease to abide in Him, v.6 says we are cast out and thrown into the fire.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Dear friends, we must be sure of our profession. Paul tells us to test ourselves to see if we are in the faith, to be sure that we have truly believed, and that we daily continue to believe, seeking to love the Lord with all our hearts. our surrender to God&nbsp;must be perfect, simply meaning&nbsp;complete, all of our heart given to God, encompassing all of our life, all of our ambitions and dreams, all of ourselves. We will not be able to hide behind a doctrine, or our own reasoning, we must bring our lives into complete conformity to God\u2019s word, being enabled by His grace. Have I truly believed? Am I continuing to believe? Am I closer to the Lord today than I was yesterday, last week, or last year? If not, something is wrong. Let us do the first works again, repent and turn to Jesus with all your heart. I close with the words of the Savior to the church at Smyrna in&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Revelation 3:11- \u201cBehold I am coming quickly!

In our day of \u201cconfess and believe\u201d, there is a need for an awakening to the true depth of change that takes place in the heart. Responding to an altar call, or raising one\u2019s hand does not constitute one being saved, it is when the Spirit of God takes residence within us, when we are truly born again( John 3:3), or \u201cborn from above.\u201d The Spirit of God comes and lives within us, bringing about a dramatic change. We are made over new, our desires change, our life is no longer self-centered, but Christ centered. Our attitude to sin changes, where the things we once loved we now hate, because God hates them, and His presence now lives within us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">The old things have passed away, they have passed us by, they have perished, they have gone away, like the snow of early spring before the advancing sun. Behold, in a moment, in a flash, all has become new, fresh. We have put off the old man, and his ways, we have turned from the darkness, now walking in the light, forsaking our old lives, our old habits, our old securities. All has become new in Christ, blessed be His holy name. In Galatians 2:20, Paul tells us of a new life, one we did not live before, one we now live, one that is lived by faith in the Son of God. We have now been crucified, being we have died, we no longer live, doing what we want, but Christ lives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">I pray we can understand this, human words are so frail here to try and explain the depth and magnitude of what has happened in the truly regenerated life. The life that once loved sin and the things of the world, that despised God now radically changed, not by a mere confession, but through true, heartfelt repentance and faith, God graciously coming and living within, changing us through and through. This is what Jesus speaks of in John 3:3, of being born again. Adam Clarke states it in this way,\u201d&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">The new birth which is here spoken of comprehends, not only what is termed justification or pardon, but also sanctification or holiness. Sin must be pardoned, and the impurity of the heart washed away, before any soul can possibly enter into the kingdom of God. As this new birth implies the renewing of the whole soul in righteousness and true holiness, it is not a matter that may be dispensed with: heaven is a place of holiness, and nothing but what is like itself can ever enter into it<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">.<\/span>&nbsp;The new birth, the renewing of the whole soul in righteousness and true holiness, the complete metamorphosis of a man, all things have become new. As a caterpillar changes to a butterfly, in no way resembling the old creature, so is the change in the Christian, a supernatural work takes place, one only God can do, no man can duplicate this, no amount of good works can fake this, we must be made new, we must be born again.

Ruth was in no better situation to that of Naomi and Orpah, however, we see a different spirit in her. Her attitude towards life was not based on where she came from, or what happened to her, or even what her future held. Her attitude was based on the fact that she was getting to learn about this amazing Lord she had come to know through Naomi and she couldn\u2019t wait to see where it all started. Naomi tried to discourage her to go back to her gods, to her people, go back to her old ways. Nothing could sway or discourage her to go back, if anything, Naomi a wounded woman of faith, needed another woman of faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen new believers who were vibrant in their walk with the Lord than some who have served for a while.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Ruth clave unto her; hung about her, would not part from her, but cleaved unto her in body and mind; forsaking her own people, and her father&#8217;s house; neither the thought of them, nor of her native country, nor of not having an husband, or any likelihood of it, nor of poverty and distress, had any manner of influence upon her, but determined (resolved) she was to go and abide with her.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">What drove Ruth to want to hang on at crossroads?&nbsp;&nbsp;from Naomi&#8217;s character she concludes certainly that the great Nation was a wise and an understanding people. She judges&nbsp;&nbsp;them all by her good mother who wherever she went, was&nbsp;&nbsp;credit to her country (as all those should study to be who profess relation to the better country, that is, the heavenly), and therefore she will think herself happy if she may be reckoned one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 34:8, \u201cOh, taste and see that the LORD is good; Blessed is the man who trusts in Him\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Are you seeing the true picture of&nbsp;&nbsp;life of a Christian here? Jesus said , \u201cCome Follow Me! Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, take my yoke upon you\u201d. The call is to yoke yourselves to the sovereign will and purpose of Christ. Now, therefore His people are people that have heard His call, it&#8217;s been a call from something, to something. It&#8217;s been a call from self-will, from ruling one\u2019s own life, from living to please one\u2019s self to gratify one\u2019s self. Living under the government and direction of one\u2019s own whim and fancy, to an entirely new government; no longer I but thy, not my will but thy will be done. This is a life that has resolved to come and follow. This is a life of one who has come not for personal gain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">At crossroads, Ruth resolved to go wherever Naomi would go. She resolved to lodge wherever Naomi would lodge. She resolved that Naomi\u2019s people will be her people,&nbsp;&nbsp;She resolved that Naomi\u2019s God will be her God, She resolved&nbsp;&nbsp;that where Naomi would die, there shall she also die, and she resolved that where Naomi would be buried, there shall she also be buried. Now that is the kind of commitment the Lord is looking for from those whom He has called to follow Him.

As you read the story of Naomi, you come to learn that she was caught in between where she came from which reminded her of famine and where she was which reminded her of the loss of her husband and two sons. No husband to care and provide for her and now no sons to do the same. No grandchildren, no one to carry the name of her husband and her children, no land to claim her own. A classic example of&nbsp;&nbsp;people who think they are forgotten by God .<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">In the midst of all these, she is left with two daughters in law who treated her kindly. Naomi showed them kindness which flowed from the outworking of the internal, the God of her life. Though the daughters in law retained an affection for the gods of Moab (v. 15). Naomi was still faithful to the God of Israel, yet that was no hindrance to either side from love and kindness, and all the good offices that the relationship required. She had nothing to offer these two young women who had stuck by her side. Their husbands were dead, there was nothing to hold them together, and they were free by&nbsp;&nbsp;law to either go back to their own mothers or be remarried. They had a place to fall back on but not with Naomi. At a cross road she was about to lose another relationship forever, that of Orpah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">The greatest grievance of that poor condition to which she was reduced was that she was not in a capacity to do for them as she would have loved to: she says, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It grieves me&nbsp;more&nbsp;for your sakes&nbsp;than for my own&nbsp;that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me<\/span>\u201d.&nbsp;But she would have them first consider upon what terms, lest having set their hand to the plow, they should look back.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Would we say the Lord\u2019s hand was against her? I wouldn\u2019t say so unless I did not understand God\u2019s providential will even in what appears to be a mess, tragic and painful. The Israelites rejoiced when God moved but when there was a challenge ahead of them, they became paralyzed, wounded and lost, even thinking that God brought them out to destroy them. Nevertheless, there was something about Moses, he rejoiced in God\u2019s ways. When you know the ways of someone especially trustworthy, faithful person and you expect them to come to your aid when you need them, if they don\u2019t come as expected, you conclude there must be a good explanation behind the action. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t care and are not coming through for you, it\u2019s that there is something beyond what you know and think until he explains to you. There are things God allows that we have no clue what they are and even if He explained, we would not understand. When we know His ways, we take comfort knowing there is more to my pain. At the cross road, I will have to decide to keep trusting that He is at work for something greater and grander for His glory with my life being a means by which He will use. Read David\u2019s prayer in&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 25:4,\u201d Show me Your ways, O LORD; Teach me Your paths. 5 Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation;&nbsp;&nbsp;On You I wait all the day\u2026 9 The humble He guides in justice, And the humble He teaches His way. 10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, To such as keep His covenant and His testimonies. . 12 Who is the man that fears the LORD?&nbsp;&nbsp;Him shall He[a] teach in the way He[b] chooses.&nbsp;&nbsp;13 He himself shall dwell in prosperity, And his descendants shall inherit the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;14 The secret of the LORD is with those who fear Him, And He will show them His covenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;15 My eyes are ever toward the LORD, For He shall pluck my feet out of the net..&nbsp;21&nbsp;Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for You&#8230;\u201d.&nbsp;<\/span>The story of Naomi and Ruth is a clear picture of God\u2019s providential will far greater than their needs.

Within 10 years, the two sons also died and we come to learn about these three women who all widows and we at one point all at cross roads that would redefine their lives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Naomi upon hearing that God had visited Bethlehem and gave them&nbsp;bread,&nbsp;chose to rise and go back home.

The LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.&nbsp;9&nbsp;The LORD&nbsp;grant&nbsp;that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband.\u201d<\/span>&nbsp;There was something that attracted these two women to Naomi perhaps her life style, her life of worship and to that they were kind to her as she was kind to them. In our day, it is hard to see great relationships between mother in laws and daughter in laws. Here we see something beautiful that even when a relationship that tied them together was long gone by death, a friendship, companionship was realized here. Orpah like Ruth had home they could return to and restart a new life again as young women, however they hang on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">At the cross road Naomi pleaded with them to go back&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 9, \u201c\u2026 kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.&nbsp;10&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">And they said to her, \u201cSurely we will return with you to your people.\u201d<\/span>&nbsp;They both wanted to keep the relationship they had with their mother in law even if it meant going back. At the cross road, the condition of hearts were revealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vs. 11-13, Naomi tried to reason with them, showing them that they have better chance of making it in Moab. There was no way she could be remarried and have sons who would marry them again. Naomi talks of her God who had deserted her, perhaps this is the same God Ruth and Orpah had begun to worship since the Moabites were idol worshippers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 14, \u201cThen they lifted up their voices and wept again; and&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Orpah kissed her mother-in-law<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">,\u201d&nbsp;<\/span>Orpah went back, why?<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;<\/span>She was familiar with her land and her people more. She was comfortable with her idols; after all, her idols would not abandon her like the God of Naomi as she heard it. This shows,&nbsp;she would have wanted a move that promised good in the end (future).&nbsp;Where Naomi was going, had a lot of uncertainty.&nbsp;She loved the companionship of both Ruth and Naomi but not at the expense of her future. Her clinging to Naomi though had love in it, yet there was a personal gain tied to it. This was a battle between past, present and future. The past was fully understood, the presence was cloudy, and the future was uncertain and definitely not promising.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;color:black;margin:0;\">This is a presentation of different lives at cross roads. Would you follow Christ and even show your love for Him as long He shows you a promising future? You may be frustrated right now because the relationship you have been holding onto is not producing what you had in mind staying connected. Walking with God, relating to Him calls for faithfulness whether there are things promised or not.&nbsp;Standing strong because the relationship is greater and stronger than the gain.&nbsp;You become like Peter who said, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">68 .., \u201cLord, to whom&nbsp;shall we&nbsp;go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 Also we have come to believe and know that&nbsp;You&nbsp;are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\u201d John 6:68-69,&nbsp;<\/span>when others who followed Jesus turned and went back because they wanted a Messiah who would meet their needs, their following had indeed personal gains tied to it. He&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">said John 6:&nbsp;27&nbsp;Do&nbsp;not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him<\/span>.\u201d In other words if you are coming, you are coming for me and not what I can do for you primarily, Orpah would have gone back if she was in this crowd. Are you identified with Orpah this morning? Are you following hoping for a better future and if you knew the deal that it might not be brighter you may turn and go back? The crossroad is a place to redefine your commitment, to go forward or turn back.

He takes care of that which He has started. I wish many more people would take marriage seriously like He does.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 18:22, &#8220;He who finds a wife finds a good thing,&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">And&nbsp;obtains favor from the LORD<\/span>&#8220;. Let&#8217;s see what favor one obtains from the Lord when he or she is married.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:9.75pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:9.75pt;color:black;margin:0;\">The story of Abraham and his wife fascinates me. The bible talks about Abraham being 75 years old in Genesis 12 and just like women&#8217;s age are not always disclosed, the bible does not disclose Sarah&#8217;s age and all the women said, &#8220;AMEN&#8221;. We can definitely rule out that she wasn&#8217;t very&nbsp;young,&nbsp;her age was not far from Abraham&#8217;s. What amazes me is that even at her age of around 60&#8217;s, she was still pretty, good looking, beautiful, a knock out.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">What does this mean, that which God has&nbsp;started,&nbsp;He preserves the wife of your youth<\/span>.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalms 103:5, &#8220;Who satisfies your mouth with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the&nbsp;eagle&#8217;s<\/span>&#8220;. One thing I\u2019ve seen in my parents is how God has preserved their youth. My dad is 58 but when people see us together they think we are brothers. You will agree with me that there are certain people you went to school with who look aged, why?&nbsp;because&nbsp;worries, drinking their heads off, drugs, and bad choices among others have caused them to age quickly. When you are in the Lord connected to a blessed Vine, your beauty will always shine being renewed everyday. God preserved Caleb.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:9.75pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:9.75pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Abraham in Genesis 12 comes to Egypt with a beautiful wife and he knows that the people of Egypt might kill him and take his&nbsp;wife,&nbsp;there was no fear of God there. He therefore makes an agreement with his wife to pretend to be his sister, exposing his wife to danger to save his skin. Pharaoh then tries to take Sarah to be his wife and God steps in to protect His daughter. He plagued Pharaoh\u2019s&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;calamities.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Another favor, God will protect the married<\/span>. I see Abraham&#8217;s little weakness not being able to stand strong to defend his wife, but God goes ahead to fight for his wife. I know many feel scared that someone may pounce and steal their wife. Scared that someone might snatch her away, I believe God will protect when husbands release their wives in God\u2019s hands. After 15 more years, Abraham is now 90, comes to&nbsp;Gerar,&nbsp;Abimelech&#8217;s&nbsp;territory and Sarah is still referred to as beautiful God still preservingher.&nbsp;Once again Abraham agrees with her to call her his sister.&nbsp;Abimelech&nbsp;desires to take another man&#8217;s wife without knowing who she is. Watch this,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 20:3, &#8220;&#8230;God came to&nbsp;Abimelech&nbsp;in a dream by night, and said to him, &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Indeed you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man&#8217;s wife.&#8221;<\/span>&nbsp;When Abraham could not fight and defend his wife God did and would not allow any man to touch his wife. Someone might say, &#8220;It seems as if God is only fighting for the women, how about those men who also find themselves in situations&nbsp;like&nbsp;&nbsp;Abimelech?. Well&nbsp;Abimelech&nbsp;launched a complaint saying that Abraham deceived him into thinking that Sarah was his sister. Had he known, he would have not desired someone&#8217;s wife so as to land in trouble. I love God&#8217;s response<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, Genesis 20:6, &#8220;And God said to him in a dream, &#8220;Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">For I also withheld you from sinning against&nbsp;Me; therefore I did not let you touch her<\/span>&#8220;. Wives, God will protect your husbands from sinning against&nbsp;God,&nbsp;place him in God\u2019s hands. He will bring His conviction upon&nbsp;him,&nbsp;lead them in the right track that all his attention will be on no one but you. Even if you are not married yet Abraham, know that God is protecting your Sarah somewhere and no man will lay his hands on her for God is saving her for you. If you are Sarah, know that God will protect you from predators like Pharaoh and&nbsp;Abimelech&nbsp;keeping you safe and sound for your Abraham. In this world full of sin, who do we entrust with each other, God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:9.75pt;color:black;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:9.75pt;color:black;margin:0;\">Your youth can be renewed&nbsp;everyday&nbsp;because you&#8217;ve learned to trust God with your companion. Instead of worrying on what could happen to the one you love and who could be eyeing him or her, you keep praying for one another to stay safe and sound.

If we wanted to see crops grow and later harvest, one crucial thing was to get the soil ready. You could not expect a harvest on unprepared ground, we had to plow and plow and plow, dig deep, turn the soil, rake it, remove rocks, pull out weeds, get rid of thorns and bushes. Prepping the ground until it was ready that is when we planted the seed expecting it to grow, do weeding and expect the harvest. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">How is this different from preaching the gospel? The hard heart must be plowed, and plowed in readiness for salvation. The hard heart has suppressed the truth in unrighteousness Romans 1 tells us and is not tender for the gospel. The work of ground preparation could a day for some or days, weeks, months, or even years for others. When the ground is ready, the seed will grow. Today we are eager for results that we do little or eliminate the work of plowing the ground. We rush people into salvation and if they do not say no, we lead them to a prayer and pronounce them saved. Sad but true, 80-90% of them fall away because the bible calls them stony ground hearers and the blame should be on us who present the gospel. The stony ground hearer came lacking repentance and without repentance how can one be saved. A repentant heart is a plowed heart.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">In Luke 18, Jesus deals with a potential convert known as the rich young ruler who out of nowhere came to Jesus and said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 18, \u201cGood Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d<\/span> In our day, this would have been a great catch not to let go. How many would have said, \u201call have sinned and have come short of the glory of God, believe in Jesus, say this prayer and mean it from your heart and you will be saved?\u201d.&nbsp; Not with Jesus, He knew this was a stony ground hearer and the seed of the gospel was not going to do him any good unless his hard ground heart was plowed. Jesus brought the bulldozer, the 10 commandments to prepare the ground for the gospel but as you know, the man went away sad because he wanted the seed on his stony ground.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Paul Washer tells a story, when he was 21 years old and had just been called to preach, he walked into an old store where they sold suits to ministers for \u00bd price in Paducah, Kentucky. As he was in this store, an old man walked into the store and said to him, \u201cBoy, you have been called to preach, haven\u2019t you?\u201d and he said, \u201cYes, sir\u201d. He was an old, old evangelist. The evangelist said, \u201cYou see where that building is right outside this building?\u201d He said, \u201cI used to preach there. The Spirit of God would come down and souls would be saved.\u201d&nbsp; He said, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything like this evangelism today.\u201d He said, \u201cWe would preach for two and three weeks and give no invitation to sinful men. We would plow and plow and plow and plow the hearts of men until the Spirit of God began to work and break their hearts.\u201d So Paul asked, \u201cSir, how did you know when the Spirit of God was coming to break their hearts?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, let me just give you an example.\u201d He said, \u201cMany decades ago I walked into this store to buy a suit. Someone had handed me $30 and said, \u2018Preacher, go buy you a suit tomorrow.\u2019 And when I walked through the door the young clerk taking care of the shop turned around and looked at me and when he looked at me he fell down on the floor and cried out, \u2018<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Who can save a wicked man like me?<\/span>\u2019 And I knew that the Spirit of God had fallen upon the place.\u201d Only God regenerate the soil of a man\u2019s heart.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Paris Reidhead said, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201c&#8217;If I had my way, I would declare a moratorium on public preaching of the \u201cthe plan of salvation\u201d in America for one to two years.

While sowing, some fell by the way side, some on stony places, some fell among the thorns and some fell on good ground. The seed was the same but yielded different results depending on where they fell. While I would like to touch on all the areas where the seeds fell, I will only touch on&nbsp; the stony grounds and the good ground. This is the difference between true and false conversion. Sadly enough, many in the Christian circle are what Jesus referred to as stony ground hearers. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Jesus says in vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">5 \u201cSome fell on stony places, where they did not have much earth; and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of earth. 6 But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away\u201d. <\/span>There was something about this soil that gave an impression that the seed would do well in it. He says it did not \u201chave much earth\u201d, it had something that appeared to cause the seed to grow in. Then something interesting happened, it immediately sprang up because it had no depth of the earth. The ground was so hard and rocky that instead of developing roots and causing the roots to go deeper and stabilize the plants, they grew up fast and appeared to be healthy, only to be tested by the scorching sun that caused it to wither and die. These are the people who hear some gospel message, they get excited about it, they say the sinner\u2019s prayer and immediately crowned as a brother or sister in the Lord, only to be part of the 80-90% who fall away after they make a profession of faith.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Here Jesus explains the meaning of that ground,&nbsp; <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 20 But he who received the seed on stony places, this is he who hears the word and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">immediately receives it with joy<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">; 21 yet he has no root in himself, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">but endures only for a while<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles\u201d.<\/span> The stony ground hearer receives the word with joy and gladness, and it sounds good but there is a problem with that and we will see that when we talk about the good soil. The stony ground hearers\u2019 soil is barren not fit for sowing until it\u2019s prepared. The natural hardness of their hearts continues, and who remain unbroken by the word, and are without any true sense of sin, and repentance for it. <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cWhere they had not much earth, to cover them and take root in: this is expressive of such persons who have slight convictions of sin, and awakenings of the natural conscience; some little, light, and speculative notions of the word, in the understanding and judgment; some flashes of natural affection for it, and outward expressions of delight and pleasure in it; some show of grace, and a form of godliness, but NO REAL HEART WORK\u201d&nbsp; \u2026 And forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth; to strike their roots downwards: and through the reflection of the heat, upon the rocks and stones, they quickly broke through the thin surface of the earth over them, and appeared above ground before the usual time of the springing up of seed: which may not only denote the immediate reception of the word by these hearers, and their quick assent to it; but their sudden and hasty profession of it, without taking due time to consider the nature and importance thereof; and the seeming cheerfulness in which they did both receive and profess it; though it was only outward and hypocritical, and more on account of the manner of preaching it, than the word itself, and through a selfish principle in them; and did not arise from any real experience of the power of it on their souls, or true spiritual pleasure in it: nor could it be otherwise, since their stony hearts were not taken away, nor hearts of flesh given them; wherefore the word had no place in them, and made no real impression on them..\u201d <\/span>John Gill<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">This put\u2019s fear in me because I don\u2019t want to share the gospel and give a stony grounded hearer assurance of salvation if God has not truly saved him because I rushed him through the gospel and got a decision and rejoiced over the decision.

There is nothing in our own strength that can make us justified, some religion teach that we have to make our way to God. The bible teaches that God has made a way for us to Himself. This is where <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 5:1<\/span> comes in , &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Therefore, having been JUSTIFIED by FAITH, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ<\/span>&#8220;. How I praise God that we are not justified by works otherwise we would all be in trouble for we have fallen SHORT, very short of His glory. He has taken all the blame, guilt and shame away because of our faith in Christ. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ephesians 2:8, &#8220;For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast.&#8221;<\/span> Our spirit is made new, not our body. Now the body is being formed that it might become; being transformed<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:14pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">What blows my mind is that God did not leave us at justification to which I am ok with, He has gone a step further to glorify them that He justified. How can we grasp this? we cease from being just children of God to sons and daughters. Listen to how God glorified Job, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:black;\">Job 1:8<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, &#8220;Then the LORD said to Satan, \u201cHave you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?\u201d.<\/span> Are you glad that the Father brags about you to the enemy? yes, you may be weak, failed, and miserable yet He turns and calls those things, which are not as though they were simply because He has clothed each of us with garments of righteousness and instead of the enemy seeing us, he sees God&#8217;s justification in our lives. In addition, God says, &#8220;He is my son or she is my daughter, have you considered them?&#8221;. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:14pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">May our minds be renewed (transformed) to see ourselves the way the Father sees us and become what the Father wants us to become. If you are not saved yet, you have no covering and should do something about it. Do you see yourself becoming more and more like Jesus? I do.

That He is concerned with your daily affairs. That He takes keen interest of your day-to-day walk, that He loves you in spite of your flaws. That He forgives you when you find it hard to forgive yourself. That He has a plan for your life when all you can see is a future clouded with failures.

But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 21 And the son said to him, \u2018Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019 22 \u201cBut the father said to his servants, \u2018Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">This is the magnificent attribute of God that sets Him apart from all the false gods invented by men. He is not indifferent or hostile, but a Savior by nature, longing to see sinners repent and rejoicing when they do. We see this kind of love demonstrated by the father of the prodigal son, who when he saw his son coming he had compassion on him, ran, fell on his neck, kissed him. The son did not even finish his rehearsed words of repentance before the father intercepted to grant forgiveness. This is a picture of God\u2019s eagerness to forgive.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Then here comes three things he instructs his servants to do for this son, Clothe him in ROBE which is reserved for guest of honor and also to cover his nakedness. He is also given a RING, a symbol of authority, and SANDALS, slaves did not wear sandals. In other words, his father MADE HIM a son again; full restoration to son ship.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Let me side track here and talk about the believers, unlike the prodigal son who had a biological father which gave him some rights, we are not sons and daughters of God by RIGHT but by ADOPTION. &nbsp;According to the Bible dictionary, \u201cAdoption is the giving to any one the name and place and privileges of a son who is not a son by birth\u201d. Those who are adopted now belong and are called blessed. In <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ephesians 1:3<\/span>, Paul writes \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ\u2026 5 having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved<\/span>\u201d. Blessed God has blessed us with spiritual blessings because He has adopted us by Jesus Christ to Himself. \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Human parents can bestow their love, resources, and inheritance on adopted child, but not their own distinct characteristics. But God miraculously gives His own nature to those whom He has elected and who have trusted Christ. He makes them His children in the image of His divine Son, giving them not just Christ\u2019s riches and blessings but also His very nature\u201d<\/span> John MacArthur, amen<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:14. \u201cFor as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d 16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 17<\/span>. To quote Barton W. Johnson, \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Paul was writing to the Romans, among whom the adoption of children, not their own by nature, was common. They would understand this to mean that those converted, or born again, are adopted as children of God; upon those thus adopted he bestows his Spirit; this Spirit in their hearts produces a loving trust that enables them to address God as Father<\/span>.\u201d <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Adoption is a parent choosing the baby to adopt, not the other way round and when the adoption takes place, the nature of the relationship changes. For this reason, God has made us to be partakers of the divine nature. God had one only-begotten Son, and He was pleased for His own glory, to choose out of a lost world many to become His adopted sons. He also made us heirs, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:17,\u201d\u2026<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">and if children, then heirs\u2014heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified togethe<\/span>r<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">One who comes with the heart of a servant is made a son yet with a servant\u2019s heart. He knows he does not deserve it, he knows he is been adopted. He did not work hard to earn the position, he was only made. The prodigal son\u2019s father showed him grace and mercy out of the love he had for his son. The same God does for us who come to Him.

It has more than one lesson if you study it carefully. The prodigal son is an example of sound repentance having lived a life of self.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">To glean some truth from this passage, let us look at how his story begins<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. Vs. 12\u201d And the younger of them said to his father, \u2018Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me<\/span>\u201d. I find this request to be very strange and here is why, no one would ask for inheritance when the father was still alive. It is like asking for the will to be executed when the person who wrote the will is still alive. Is not this request by this young man suggests he wished his father was dead to gain his inheritance? It was like the father was taking too long to die and since he could not wait to get his hands on the inheritance (on the blessing), he chose to act now. The tragedy of today is that most want blessings now but do not want God of the blessings. This is the same picture of those who want to go to heaven not so that they can be with God and worship Him for eternity but that they would escape the nasty place called hell and not suffer there for eternity. This act also pictures all sinners (related to God the Father by creation), who waste their potentials, privileges and refuse any relationship with God, choosing instead a life of sinful self-indulgence suppressing truth in unrighteousness so as to get rid of the thought of God in their minds. If they have a god, it\u2019s god in their making to suit themselves. Paul says in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 1: 21, \u201c because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man\u2014and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">The root of all sin as well stated by John Wesley, is \u201c\u2026 <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A desire of disposing of ourselves of independency on God<\/span>\u201d. The sin nature is to take off God\u2019s hand of covering in our lives, our family, our nation only to leave us vulnerable to all attacks. The prodigal son went far away, eliminating that connection with his father that would allow protection, guidance, continued provision and most important, relationship. On 09\/11\/2001 that fateful day when two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in NYC claiming lives. The following few weeks many people returned to church and some even for the first time. 10 years later, many many people have forgotten God, stopped going to church, stopped seeking God\u2019s blessings, guidance, wisdom, protection, and like the prodigal son gone far away from Him. This year\u2019s memorial, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg banned clergy and prayer at tenth anniversary commemoration ceremony of 9\/11, which is a clear indication of not wanting God\u2019s hands in the lives of people, government, nation etc, <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">How can we stand without the hand of God? And more so, do we want God more than we want His blessings? The question we each should wrestle with, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Is God an end or is He a means\u201d? <\/span>Do we love our freedom that we would choose to distance ourselves from Him even wished He was dead whether they say it or not, or wished He did not exist to live the way we want to? Now we may think this may be applicable only to those who have not been saved but come to think about it, we could have an idol in our own lives. What is an idol? Anything that takes precedence over your life in the place of God. Is your marriage, children, job, business your idol or is God supreme and sovereign over all? The prodigal son had a life style he wanted to live take precedence over his life and he chose to go to his father and say \u201cGIVE ME\u2026\u201d. I will share on his return to the father.

I don\u2019t know who these Jews made their vow to, and who it was that would curse them, but they were not going to kill Paul, because God would not allow His servant to die at this time. The thinking of these Jews was so warped because they were willing to come under a curse to kill Paul; however they failed to realize that they were already under a curse, the curse of sin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Deuteronomy 28:15 \u2013 68<\/span> and <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 1<\/span> show this very clearly. Why did these men desire to kill Paul? Paul was boldly preaching Jesus Christ. When we speak boldly and unashamed speak about Jesus, people that are resistant may get very upset, in this case they had murder in their hearts. The truth is painful for those living under a curse, and resistant to it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Picture with me a time when you may have been sleeping, and you wake up because someone has been loud and turned the light on. Although no one poked you in the eye, you feel pain, your eyes actual hurt. The light caused pain because your eyes have adjusted to the darkness during the night. Whoever turned on the light is usually someone that you may want to \u201csend to heaven immediately\u201d or at least you may want to throw something at them.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">These desiring to kill Paul lived in darkness, their hearts were so adjusted to darkness, and they desired to love under a curse until they murdered this Jewish preacher that proclaimed the Jewish Messiah, Jesus Christ. The light of Jesus Christ emanated from Paul and it hurt the darkness of their hearts and they were literally on a manhunt to murder Paul.&nbsp; \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">men loved darkness rather than light<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">because their deeds were evil<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d (John 3:19)<\/span>. Realize that when you as a Christian shine the light of Jesus into the dark heart of the sinner, it will hurt and they may hate you for it, curse you, and even persecute you.

We come for us, we come to receive and if we don&#8217;t get it as expected, frustrations may rise. Some have been so much affected that they left because they were not satisfied by what they received. Do we ever stop and say, &#8220;What is required of me as a form of service?&#8221; in other words, I have always come to receive, but now it is time to give. No one teaches what service and giving is all about like Jesus, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">John 13:4<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;(Jesus)<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. After that, He poured water into a basin and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded&#8221;<\/span>. The King of kings laid aside His Kingship garments (robe) and guarded Himself with a towel to serve those who called Him their Teacher and Master. It&#8217;s easy to wash someone&#8217;s hair, they do it many times and mostly at a fee, but washing someone&#8217;s feet? I mean going down on your knees to wash dusty, unattractive smelly feet? You have to be humbled to do that. A number would do it for money, Jesus was doing it out of love. I\u2019ve seen programs like &#8220;fear factor&#8221; on TV of how low people would go for money. They risk their lives, doing weird things just to get money.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">We love titles like son, daughter, royal priesthood, because it makes us feel important but to be called a servant sounds like an insult. Degrading position in human eyes yet we are called servants by God. Look at how God calls these men <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 26:24, &#8220;&#8230;I will bless you and multiply your descendants for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">My servant <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Abraham&#8217;s sake.&#8221;, Numbers 12:7, &#8220;Not so with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">My servant <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Moses; He is faithful in all My house&#8221;. Numbers 14:24, &#8220;But <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">My servant <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Caleb, because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me fully&#8221;, 2 Samuel 7:5, &#8220;Go and tell <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">My servant <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">David<\/span>&#8220;. What is so common about these men, they were great leaders yet they humbled themselves as servants and they served faithfully. God does not call them great, big, mighty names, He calls them MY SERVANTS. They served people primarily for the Lord. What did Jesus say to the disciples who were disputing as to who is the greatest in the kingdom, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mark 9:35, &#8220;And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, &#8220;If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">servant of all.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">&#8220;<\/span> <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">It&#8217;s not about titles, it&#8217;s about service<\/span>. It&#8217;s about seeing what God has equipped you with and rolling your sleeves to do it faithfully without complaining. Many pastor\u2019s today want to lead like CEO\u2019s rather than lead as a shepherd; a servant God has called them to be. And many want to be in the receiving end without serving.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">God says in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Leviticus 25:55, &#8220;For the children of Israel are <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">servants to Me&#8230;&#8221;,<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <\/span>called to fulfill tasks granted by God. Called to work and fight under the guidance and supervision of the Lord. When they were told about a land flowing with milk and honey, maybe they thought they would just walk in and take it not knowing that there was work involved, (stooping down as a servants and working hard to get to that destination). See the flesh does not like the idea of stooping low and serving. This is the reason why I never pray, &#8220;LET ME BE A SERVANT&#8221;, I pray &#8220;MAKE ME (mold me) A SERVANT\u201d.&nbsp; What will the rest of the people think about us if we call ourselves servants? We shouldn\u2019t care about titles and positions, I would rather have the titles and positions define the office we are serving in and not what we are. All we should care about is serving in any capacity because He has made us servants. On that day I will not be introduced as thy good and faithful preacher, intercessor etc, I will be introduced as <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Matthew 25:2<\/span> puts it<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, &#8220;\u2026, &#8220;Well done, good and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">faithful servant<\/span>&#8220;. Are you a servant at your job, in church, in your community? I&#8217;m not talking about titles, titles come and go, I am talking about service for His glory. Let\u2019s continue to make this our prayer, \u201cLord MAKE ME a servant humble and meek\u201d.

His name is Pastor Nik. He has shared devotions with us in the past. He recently moved there from our church as associate pastor to pastor this church. What a great time we had, sharing and praying together. I felt very refreshed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">I would like to share with you the outline to the devotion. I shared on an area mostly neglected in prayers which I believe is the most important aspect of our prayer life if we want to grow spiritually. See prayers is more than getting stuff from God, it\u2019s about being conformed to the image of Christ as we lay down our lives as His slaves. That does not come naturally, it has to be prayed. We were once slaves to sin, now that we are saved, we are slaves to Christ. I know the term \u201cslave\u201d is not liked because of what we know of it from the world\u2019s perspective but do you know that all over the bible the people of God were called slaves? Of course you will not see it much in our bible translations today because most translations have substituted the word \u201cslave\u201d with \u201cservant\u201d. To an extent a slave is a servant, the big difference I can think of is that, \u201cservants\u201d may chose his master to serve but not with \u201cslaves\u201d. We as slaves are bound to our Lord Jesus Christ. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">When we therefore pray \u201cyour kingdom come\u201d, we are constantly reminded that it\u2019s not about us but Him and we &nbsp;don\u2019t pray that \u201cwe become His servants (slaves)\u201d, we pray that \u201cHe makes His servants (slaves)\u201d. The story of the prodigal son in Luke 15 paints this beautifully. The first time he said \u201cFather <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">GIVE ME<\/span> the portion of the goods that falls for me\u201d,&nbsp; when he came back he said \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">MAKE ME<\/span> like one of your hired servants (slaves). This is something that has revolutionized my prayer life, I want to be His slave and whatever it takes to be His slave without feeling the way the world defines it. Hope you are blessed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,51,0);margin:0;\">Thanks, Ev&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:verdana;margin:0;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;font-size:16pt;color:black;\">Your Kingdom Come<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">, Week 3 Class<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">, by Evans Olang <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Matthew 6:9-15, vs. 10, &#8220;&#8230;your kingdom come, &#8221; Matthew 6:33<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cBut seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness<\/span>&#8220;,<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Praying effectively is not about ABILITY but about AVAILABILITY.

We like the disciples would love the Mount of Transfiguration experience and even stay awake there but fall asleep in the Garden of Gethsemane. We would get bored easily. David Wilkerson said, \u201cwe love the supper room more than we love the upper room\u201d. The enemy does not mind us doing anything else as long as we are not praying.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Acts 12:1-3, &#8220;Now about that time Herod the king stretched his hand to harass some from the church. Then killed James the brother of John with the sword. And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also&#8221;.<\/span> Before Jesus Ascended into heaven, He told His disciples of what was to come ahead<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, John 16:33, &#8220;These things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace, in the world you will have tribulations, but be of good cheer I have overcome the world<\/span>&#8220;. It was a preparation accompanied with a promise. We then we see the disciples experiencing the same things Jesus had prepared them for.&nbsp; Jesus reminded His disciples of what was to come in His absence at the same time He also gave them assurance of how He would be there to stand with them. Soon after His departure, tribulation started, Stephen was stoned to death, James is killed and Peter was next.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Here is my question, why is it easy to wait for something to happen before we do something about it? we wait until we are in a jam before we act. Now that might not have been the case with Peter since we don\u2019t have all the details, all we know is that when Peter was arrested, the home church went to work, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Acts 12:5, &#8220;Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for Him by the church&#8221;. In another version says &#8220;but prayer was made without ceasing&#8221;.<\/span> This is what we call intercession, someone standing in the gap on behalf of someone else. Prayer warriors are like the attorneys in the courts of law fighting for those who cannot fight for themselves. They understand the law well (God&#8217;s word) and the promises in His word. We don\u2019t know if the church stood in the gap on behalf of James like they did with Peter. Perhaps they did and it was God\u2019s will to take James. In spite of what happened to James, that did not stop the believers from crying out to God for Peter. What happened to James did not discourage their faith in God, if anything, it intensified their prayers. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Peter had several attorneys standing in the gap, pleading with God to spare his life and so they prayed without ceasing, continuously, fervently, purposefully, earnestly, and diligently. Praying without ceasing is not praying without stopping but praying without giving up that is the difference. I could pray for something today for half an hour and stop but that does not mean I have given up, I will pray again tomorrow for it and the days to come. That is praying without ceasing<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. 1Thes 5:17&amp;18, &#8220;Pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you&#8221;. <\/span>We understand what it means \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">praying without ceasing\u201d,<\/span> but do we explain, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">in everything give thanks for this is the will of God<\/span>&#8220;? does that mean for my problems I should give thanks and also in my afflictions and frustrations? should I give thanks for this is His will?. No, the will of God is to praise and give Him thanks even in the midst of the situation, giving Him thanks IN IT and not FOR IT. Giving thanks is a sign of &#8220;I have faith that you will bring me out of it&#8221;, I don&#8217;t see it now but I know you will. Giving thanks is appreciating what He is doing even at that given moment. Giving thanks is choosing to believe His report over what you heard, know or what you are in. Giving thanks is knowing that He already had an escape plan for you even before you got into it. I believe that the church that was praying for Peter was giving thanks in advance, pouring their hearts to God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">We all need someone to confide in when it comes to praying for there are times when will be overwhelmed that you will need someone to cover you in prayers. I&#8217;m talking about prayer partners, Peter being weary, tired and in pain bound between two guards may have found it tough to pray but thank God for the church, the saints who prayed for him. The prayer of the saints kept him comfortable in prison, he slept through it. The end of the story, God intervened and Peter was released from prison by an angel.

It is interesting that many that began to use their gifts in the church, at some point used it as a stepping stone to use their gifts toward the world. For example, I believe that Pop singer Britney Spears was raised in the Southern Baptist Convention, and began using her voice to sing in church. However, when one looks at her life now, the talent that God gave her has not been one that it used for the Kingdom of God, but rather for the Kingdom of Darkness. There are a number of people that have done the same thing. Why is that? Perhaps it is because there is certainly more fame and fortune outside the church, than inside. However, I would submit in light of this, it depends on who one looking to serve. Everyone serves either God or Satan (although one does not need to be a Satan worshipper to serve Satan).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:14pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">Recall the challenge of Joshua who turned to the people and challenged them to make a decision as read in the following: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff14\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff\u201cNow therefore,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">fear the Lord, serve Him in sincerity and in truth<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">Serve the Lord<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">!<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff15\ufeff And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeffchoose for yourselves this day whom you will<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">serve<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">, whether<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff\ufeffthe gods which your fathers served that<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">were on the other side of<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeffthe River, or<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff\ufeffthe gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff But<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">as for me and my house, we will<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">serve the Lord<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\"> (Joshua 24:14-15).\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> Joshua was willing to challenge people in his influence to make a decision as to who they would serve. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:14pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">Once one decides to serve the Lord, one must serve Him in a manner that pleases Him, as I have shared earlier in these series.

Even the wicked are given talents by God, but only those that invest themselves in the Kingdom of God will be rewarded by God. One day at the Judgment (Bema) Seat of Christ each believer will be judged on various things including how one used their talents to serve God.

Paul writes (Eph 5:3-7), \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">But fornication and all<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufefff\ufeffuncleanness or<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeffg\ufeffcovetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff4\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeffneither filthiness, nor<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeffI\ufefffoolish talking, nor coarse jesting,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeffj\ufeffwhich are not fitting, but rather<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeffk\ufeffgiving of thanks.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff5\ufeff For<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff\ufeffthis you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeffl\ufeffinheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff6\ufeff Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff7\ufeff Therefore do not be<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\ufeffpartakers with them<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">.\u201d The metaphor of the Christian life as warfare (against the evil world system, the believer\u2019s sinful human nature, and Satan) is a familiar one in the NT (cf. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">2 Cor. 10:3\u20135; Eph. 6:10\u201320; 1 Thess. 4:8; 1 Tim. 1:18; 4:7; 6:12<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">). Here Paul is dealing with the conflict against the hostile world and the persecution which believers were facing (cf. v. 9; 1:8; 3:11,12; 4:7). If you desire to serve God as your commander, then you as a good solider you will heed His leadership, His word, as He strengthens you in Christ Jesus. Yet he calls you not to take part in the affairs of this life (the evil things previously mentioned). For example, when one is gossiping at the office do you engage or disengage in the gossip, or perhaps share that you would rather not be a part of the conversion? When you are invited to a movie that blasphemes God\u2019s name, is filled with smut and vulgarity do you accept the invitation or reject it? John MacArthur shares, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;\">A military soldier doesn\u2019t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;\">entangle himself,<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;\">because his call to duty is completely severed from the normal affairs of civilian life, so also must the good soldier of Jesus Christ refuse to allow the things of the world to distract him (cf.

But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD. &#8220;Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?&#8221; And David would not drink it.

He didn\u2019t give a command, he didn\u2019t make his request part of his men\u2019s job description, and he didn\u2019t have an expectation that these three men should take up the task of his \u201ccraving\u201d for water from Bethlehem. King David was in the line of Jesus Christ as reads in Matt 1:1 \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham<\/span>:\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">Three mighty men<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> out of loyalty to David went well beyond \u201cthe call of duty.\u201d They were brave and courageous with only three of them breaking through the host of the Philistine army after their twelve mile journey to get there. These men had to break through enemy lines, the Philistine garrison (outpost) in Bethlehem, retrieved the water, and bring it back to David. These men were not commissioned to do this task. They sacrificed their very lives not to gain clout or merit, not to be in the Israeli hall of fame, and not even to advance the victory for their army. No these men had one thing on their minds, to bring some water for their king! Why, because this is what would please the King. With loyalty and honor they risked their lives, \u201ccounting their lives worth nothing,\u201d just to please the King to which they longed to do, even putting themselves in \u201cdeath\u2019s way,\u201d. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">Haggai 1:8<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> reads, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,&#8221;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">says the LORD\u201d.

They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. 5 Finally these men said, \u201cWe will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">unless it has something to do with the law of his God<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">.<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">\u201d Daniel\u2019s enemies began to plot against him, manipulating the king to sign a decree stating <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">\u201cthat whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">\u201d.&nbsp; This jealous plot was not unlike the effort against Daniel\u2019s 3 friends in 3:8. However Daniel was past 80 years of age at this time, yet he was still on his knees thanking God and asking for His guidance and help. A servant of Jesus seeks the Lord, communes with Him, learns from Him, and obeys Him. How can one do the will of the Lord, without seeking Him? Daniel would not allow the death sentence (being thrown in a lion\u2019s den) deter his prayer life. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">Daniel 6:10<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> reads, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">Now when Daniel<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">knew that the writing was signed<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:14pt;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-size:11pt;\">he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime<\/span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">. Notice the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">First, he knew the writing was signed, showing he was unashamed (Rom 1:16, and steadfast (1 Cor. 15:58). Second, he opened the windows, he was bold and humble as he cried out to the Lord (2 Chron. 2:14). Thirdly, he knelt three times a day, he was persistent in his prayer life (Luke 18), he gave thanks among the heathen (Psalm 18:49) knowing the consequence could surly be death by a lion\u2019s den. Fourthly, he prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did AFORETIME (this was a regular practice for Daniel). Do any of these characteristics describe you? I\u2019m sure if you are living in a free nation, and your life is not on the line (not having the fear of receiving the death sentence as the persecuted church around the world faces). If death is not a deterrent from you having a prayer life then what is your reason for staying away from the prayer closet? Is it sleep, friendships, work, household responsibilities, laziness, etc\u2026? Now ask yourself, does even one of these compare to facing death? Do you serve Jesus on your terms or his, by examining your prayer life? Are you consistent in prayer, are you bold in your witness, do you thank the Lord?

These four Hebrew boys would have to find a way to serve God in a culture, among a people that did not normally serve Him. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Daniel chapter one informs us that these four were \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king\u2019s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.\u201d<\/span> Daniel\u2019s heart was set on serving God. It is interesting that Daniel equated himself as a servant of the king as long as it did not clash with His servant hood of God. \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king\u2019s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself (1:8).<\/span> Daniel chose to serve His God even when it was not comfortable him, because it was not about the servant, but about the One in whom Daniel served. Serving God led Daniel to the lion\u2019s den, and led Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah to the fiery furnace. Many seem to feel that when one serves God, life will be smooth because God is pleased. In the case of these men.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Among Daniel and his friends, the king would soon recognize the resolve of God\u2019s servants as they serve Him faithfully, despite the consequences, even in the face of death. When a decree was made by the king, and Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah refused to worship the statue of the king, they \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">answered and said to the king, \u201cO Nebuchadnezzar, \ufeff\ufeffwe have no need to answer you in this matter. \ufeff17\ufeff If that is the case<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> our \ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">God whom we serve is able to \ufeffdeliver us from the burning fiery furnace<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, and He will deliver<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\"> us<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> from your hand, O king. \ufeff18\ufeff But<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, nor will we \ufeff\ufeffworship the gold image which you have set up.\u201d<\/span> Wow, what a resolve! They are ultimately thrown into the furnace and, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> ye servants of the most high God<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire<\/span>.\u201d When serving the Lord we learn from their lives the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">First God is able to bring deliverance in our most seemingly horrific of circumstances. Secondly, we must believe God, for it is in Him that we must put our trust. We may have no idea how God could deliver us from what looks like doom from our perspective, but we must not forget we serve an all-powerful God! Thirdly, we must speak to the ungodly about the deliverance of God, and our resolve in Him. We are to proclaim that no matter what, we will not bow down to cultural expectations that violate the Word of God, even when our stance will be seen by the majority as an unpopular decision. We don\u2019t serve God to be popular with man, but to be obedient to our Lord! Fourthly, we must stay together through the trials; we really do need one another. The Hebrew boys faced the trial together, and through it together. What a great story they lived, that we now read about. Who knows our stories, read our stories, and watch our stories? Fifthly, will the ungodly recognize that we are servants of the Lord by the stands that we take in various circumstances? Will we truly refuse ungodly rules that violate God\u2019s Word, despite the consequence! It\u2019s easy to serve God until you are challenged by law, pressure, etc\u2026, to violate your professed service to God. Your faith must stand trial, and when it does, whose servant will you look like, as there are only two choices. Meditate on these things, and examine if you are a servant of the Most High God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt;margin:0;\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Phil (Evangelist) <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; We live in a world that tells us to serve the society that we live in.

Many people have jobs, families, hobbies, school, homes, and a plethora of responsibilities, so since God knows our heart, He should understand right? <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Jesus came to visit the sisters of Lazarus in their home one day and in the midst of his visit this whole issue of busyness, and serving Jesus rose to the forefront of His visitation. Jesus enters the home of the sisters and upon doing so each one responded to Jesus in a particular manner. Martha began to become cumbered (distracted) with much serving, and proceeded to question Jesus saying, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?<\/span>\u201d It seemed that the conversation centered on the value of sitting which is how Mary chose to respond to Jesus\u2019 visit as opposed to serving, which is how Martha reacts to Christ\u2019s arrival. Martha, seemingly feeling that she chose the better and perhaps more reverend option attempts to force Jesus\u2019 hand by requesting that He tell Mary to join her and serve Jesus alongside her. Perhaps if Mary would serve the foods, sweep the floor, or perform any helpful task, this would lighten Martha\u2019s work load and therefore, help the work move along more quickly. <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Tahoma;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">There is in fact always enough time to accomplish our God given tasks, and also to spend time with God Himself, if one seeks first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness (Matt 6:33).

Jesus said that \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mary chose the better decision sitting at his feet rather than Martha who served at His side (Luke 10:41-42).<\/span>\u201d In the area of servant hood, a true servant does the will of the one that is being served.

Galatians 2:20 is a great example, another one is Philippians 4:11-13. And the reason is simple, he mentions himself as the one who lives but then he shows us the One by the reason he lives. In other words, Paul always wanted to bring to light whose he was ultimately all glory and honor may be of Christ alone. He says in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1Corinthians 4:7, \u201cwe have this treasure in the earthen vessels that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us\u201d,<\/span> that fact that we have the treasure in us is the reason we can stand, it\u2019s the driving factor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">We now come to the verse above when he says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. : 12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, \u2026<\/span>\u201d. Even though it\u2019s the Lord who keeps us from falling and present us faultless in His presence with exceeding joy (Jude 1:24), this does not mean that we have no part to play. Paul says the Philippians obeyed and should continue even in Paul\u2019s absence Paul knowing that only through Christ they could obey.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">But then he adds this element which is mind boggling, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">work out your own salvation with fear and trembling<\/span>\u201d. Of course this does not mean to work to be saved which is justification but rather be open to God\u2019s work in us for sanctification, day by day being made Christ like. This is not human achievable, it\u2019s only through the power of the Holy Ghost can a man live a sanctified life, daily going deeper and deeper in the things of God. This is about employing yourselves in things which accompany salvation, bearing fruit, more fruit, and much fruit because you are abiding in the true vine, (John 15). Jesus told the woman at the well in John 4 that those who worship God must worship in spirit and in truth. The spirit here is not the Holy Spirit but rather, the human spirit, the desire, the passion, the zeal but the outcome of truth is of God. All our working depends upon His working in us. While Christ is our Savior, and the author of our salvation, we must accept Him and work together with Him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. \u201c13 for it is God who works in you both to will \u2026.\u201d<\/span> works in the converted person by His word and Spirit.

Can you imagine if you just poured your heart out to someone, and there was no response?&nbsp; How would you know if your wife liked or disliked something you shared?&nbsp; If you were sharing something precious to you with another person, such as the birth of your new child in the world, can you imagine if they were indifferent to what you just shared, how discouraging that would be?&nbsp; Now think of the average prayer meeting.&nbsp; Many seem to become gossip sessions instead of prayer meetings when people say things like, \u201cOh Lord, help John Smith with his gambling issues, and to stop beating his wife,\u201d when no one in the congregation knew that.&nbsp; Perhaps these things have only happened to me, but I doubt it.&nbsp; When we pray together, God should be the main focus, but you and I can certainly be \u201ccheerleaders\u201d and encouragers for someone that is pouring their heart out to the same Lord you pour yours out to.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\"><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Where is the \u201camen\u201d when we pray together<\/span>?

The murmur of quiet &#8220;Amens&#8221; and &#8220;Yes&#8221; and &#8220;Umhm&#8221; is like background music that supports the one who&#8217;s praying and joins him in the prayer.

The exhortation is to take careful note of each other\u2019s spiritual welfare. The purpose of this attentive, continuous care is to provoke each other to the exercise of love and good works.

Alford suggests two reasons for the addition of epi (\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9). It was used by the writer to take away the Judaistic sound of sunagoge (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5).

They are, on the other hand to exhort each other to continued attendance, and in view of the fact of the approach of the time when the Lord would come.&nbsp; One can translate it this way, \u201cNot letting down on the assembling of ourselves together, even as the custom of certain is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as ye see the day drawing near.<a href=\"http:\/\/mail.google.com\/mail\/h\/fmkdy35jhbh7\/#131f707c8f1f10e9__ftn2\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">[2]<\/span><\/a>\u201d&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">We need to assemble together, like each piece of yarn to make the whole picture of the tapestry.&nbsp; How helpful are the pieces with being interwoven together?&nbsp; Imagine if a group of archeologists were on a dig, and one discovered an ancient city during their excavation.&nbsp; Would the others not gather around, and become excited, and want to get in on the good news.&nbsp; Then when a man of God is excavating the wonderful treasures found in God\u2019s Word should we not also gather around the Word of God, and let him know that we are in agreement, and excited about the treasure he is sharing with us?&nbsp;&nbsp; We are to \u201cstir\u201d one another up which is the Greek word <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">paroxusmos<\/span> (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03be\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, 3948), \u201ca sharpening of the feeling, or action\u201d it causes the effect of irritation.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/mail.google.com\/mail\/h\/fmkdy35jhbh7\/#131f707c8f1f10e9__ftn3\">[3]<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">We must stir one another by the Word of God\u2026\u201cAMEN!\u201d<\/span>&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:10pt;margin:0;\">Let us stir one another to gather <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">ESPECIALLY<\/span> as the Day is approaching (when the Lord Jesus will return).&nbsp; His children with all creation will say \u201cAMEN\u201d at His return, and His enemies will be in peril, and curse His descending to the earth!&nbsp; \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">God knows this about worship and preaching.

Christ affirms them and even secures them by his blood. The fact that you don&#8217;t deserve God&#8217;s promise to pursue you with goodness and mercy all your days, is now no obstacle. Christ has taken your ill-desert on him, and put his righteousness on you. He is God&#8217;s yes to all the promises in your life. For his sake you will get them if you trust him<\/span>.\u201d&nbsp; You see God judged Christ as if He lived your life, so He can judge you as if you lived Christ\u2019s life.&nbsp; How can you not say \u2018Amen\u201d out of sheer gratitude to a gracious Father!&nbsp;&nbsp; Piper continues \u201cThen he says, in verse 20b, &#8220;. . . <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">therefore, also through Him is our &#8216;Amen&#8217; to the glory of God.&#8221; In other words, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">the reason we say &#8220;Amen&#8221;<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> through Christ when we hear the promises of God preached or hear a prayer of longing for the promises of God to be fulfilled, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">is that Christ has said &#8220;Amen&#8221; to us.

There is participation in corporate worship on the biblical Christ that is why it is in fact corporate.&nbsp; America is very much about individualism and independence but Christianity is not about that.&nbsp; Christianity is about interdependence, whereby we are dependent upon our shepherd in the midst of our fellow sheep that Christ works through to strengthen one another.&nbsp; There are a host of terms such as \u201cone another\u201d in the Scriptures, therefore we can see that Christ works the Church, therefore we do not gather to be individualistic, and hence there would be no need then to <\/span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;\">gather.&nbsp; \u201c<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/the.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">The<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;etymological notion underlying <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/to.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">to<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">gether &nbsp;is &nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/of.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">of<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\"> &nbsp;\u2018gathering\u2019&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/thing.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">things<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;into&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/one.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">one<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/group.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">.&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/it.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">It<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;was formed&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/from.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">from<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/the.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">the<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;prepos<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/it.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">it<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">ion&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/to.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">to<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/and.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">and<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;the element *gad- denoting \u2018association, company\u2019, &nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/which.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">which<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp; <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/also.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">also<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp; <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/lie.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">lies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/behind.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">behind<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/definition\/gather.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">gather<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\"> (<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-origins.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">http:\/\/www.word-origins.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;\">).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Piper further explains, \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">I think Paul would say, God is calling us not to be isolated, silent, encapsulated individuals in worship. Privately coming, privately hearing, privately going, with no one able to tell what we love and cherish and long for, because we haven&#8217;t expressed resonance &#8211; an echo, an empathy &#8211; with anything. I think he would say that God is calling us out of our cocoons of emotional isolation and invisible, inaudible, unshared responsiveness. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">I think he would say, it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will that we echo the excellence of God in preaching and prayer &#8211; that we express our affirmation of the truth of God in the Word, and that we resonate verbally with Godward longings and yearnings in prayer<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">. Let me mention two more reasons for making more of this than we do, and provide some practical suggestions. Consider 2 Corinthians 1:20. This is the passage that gives &#8220;Amen&#8221; its clearest and deepest meaning. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">&#8220;For as many as are the promises of God, in Him [that is, in Christ] they are yes [which is a translation of &#8220;amen&#8221;]; therefore, also through Him is our &#8216;Amen&#8217; to the glory of God through us.&#8221; <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Now what Paul is doing here is precisely what I am trying to do this morning. He is taking the familiar word &#8220;Amen,&#8221; and trying to fill it back up with the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">theological freight<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> that words so quickly lose, so that it has meaning and weight and power to it when we use it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">Words lose their meaning at times over time, or the meaning changes.&nbsp; This all depends upon the person using the term and what they mean when they use a particular term.&nbsp; In the public school I work in, I fortunately and unfortunately get to hear all of the latest New York City slang, and hear firsthand concerning words.&nbsp; \u201cOMG\u201d means \u201cOh my God\u201d and it is using the name of the Lord in a blasphemous manner, which I hear daily.&nbsp; \u201coh my God\u201d used to always be used in reverence toward the Lord, however, many have simply degraded it, and take the name of the Lord in vain, thus breaking the third commandment.&nbsp; Let us make a BIG deal about the very words used in Scripture, such as \u201camen.\u201d&nbsp; Let us \u201camen\u201d that which the Lord would \u201camen\u201d agree with.&nbsp; If the Lord himself would not agree then why are so many professing Christians say \u201camen\u201d?&nbsp; I would venture to say that many don\u2019t know the Lord, and many are biblically illiterate.&nbsp; I often see in churches that people don\u2019t worship God in spirit and in truth (John 4:24), but rather in the flesh and in lies!&nbsp; Can you really sing songs such as \u201cI surrender all\u201d, really have you done so?&nbsp; Can you sing, \u201cI am desperate for you\u201d, yet you are more desperate for other things rather than Him?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why Paul says, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">&nbsp; <\/span>Your mind must not become disengaged and take a back seat and allow your emotions to takes center stage.&nbsp; No, your mind and emotions must be side by side in the driver\u2019s seat.&nbsp; When you sing this week, be <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">mindful <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">and<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> emotional<\/span> and worship in spirit and truth, and spirit and mind.&nbsp; To be continued\u2026.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;text-align:right;margin:0;\">Blessings, until the nets are filled\u2026Phil, the Evangelist <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:tahoma;font-size:11pt;margin:0;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; \u201cTherefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. 14&nbsp;For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. 15&nbsp;What am I to do?

His message on \u201camen\u201d, really inspired, and I gleaned much from it, as I both read and listened to the message, I would encourage you to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>John Piper shares \u201cPaul would bring the word \u201cAmen\u201d to the Greek culture.  This is a most interesting journey.  Bringing the word &#8220;Amen&#8221; to Greece is a little microcosm of what happens spiritually and intellectually and culturally wherever Christianity comes to a new culture. It brings a vision of God and the world that keeps some things in the culture, rejects other things in the culture, and touches everything in the culture. There are no pure cultures, especially ours. Every culture needs more words and more concepts and more ways of viewing the world and deeper combinations of emotions and different patterns of behaving than is native to itself.  This word \u201camen\u201d has seeped into cultures all over the world, which displays that no culture, no language, no worship is complete in itself.  Our vocabularies are limited and cannot fully express all the feelings, emotions, thought patterns which people attempt to convey.  But let&#8217;s be more specific. What did the word &#8220;amen&#8221; come to Corinth to do? What did this Hebrew word mean as it grafted itself onto the Greek vocabulary of Corinthian Christians?\u201d   We know that over time words change, new words are created, and this is why there is different translations of the Bible.  How could most understand the Bible if it were still in Latin only, or Greek, Hebrew, or Aramaic?  Most of us would be reliant on the preacher (which is what happened in Roman Catholicism, where the people were reliant on the priests, because most common people could not read Latin).  Amen has become a word common to many languages, and it is Christianity with such servants like Paul, that is responsible for that blessed reality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Amen&#8221; in the New Testament<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Piper continues, \u201cNow here comes Paul into Greek-speaking Corinth, and he teaches them about this word &#8220;Amen,&#8221; &#8211; just as if he were to come to us today with a new Hebrew word we didn&#8217;t know. What did he teach them? Well, we can see behind 1 Corinthians 14. Paul is concerned that the gift of tongues is being abused in public so that people are speaking what nobody can understand. He is not rejecting the gift of tongues. But he is putting something way above it in the Christian assembly. He is saying that edification comes not by amazement at miracles, but edification comes by the understanding of God. That&#8217;s why verse 19 says that five intelligible words that help you understand God are better than a thousand unintelligible words that make you tremble with amazement.<\/p>\n<p>Paul is extremely zealous that public speaking (whether prayer or preaching) be an event of group understanding and group agreement &#8211; not one person doing his own thing and others boggled. Not even one person doing his own thing and others understanding and silent. What then? His answer is just beneath the surface in verses 15-16:<\/p>\n<p>What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also. Otherwise if you bless in the spirit only, how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted say the &#8220;Amen&#8221; at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?<\/p>\n<p>Paul assumes something here. He assumes that when a public prayer is made, other <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">people besides the one praying say, &#8220;Amen.&#8221;<\/span> Let&#8217;s not miss this. It seems to matter to Paul. He could have just said: don&#8217;t pray in tongues because nobody can understand you and so nobody is built up in their faith, because faith comes by an understood word of Christ. Or he could have said always have an interpretation. But he said more. He said (verse 16): If you pray so people can&#8217;t understand you, how will they say &#8220;Amen&#8221;?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Piper makes some powerful assessments about this passage.  When we pray, we do so unto God, but in a corporate setting we also affect the body of Christ that we are gathered with at that time.  It was this affect that Evans had on me when I first met my best friend as we prayed in the mornings at our church.  Many silently or quietly prayed, until I heard a prayer of thunder, fervency, and zealousness.  My prayer life has never been the same since beginning to pray with my best friend Evans.  His prayer caused my heart to shout, Amen!  I began to get more excited about prayer, and the \u201camen\u201d continued to be expressed when we would pray together.  This is not inspiration such as a painter that is inspired to paint a scenic horizon off in the distance.  Rather this is inspiration as the Holy Spirit was working through a life changed by the Gospel!  There are few that I can pray with that cause the \u201camen\u201d to rise up in me.  When someone mature and zealous for God is praying alongside you, do you agree in prayer, \u201camen\u201d with that person?  This tends to happen with those that are like-hearted toward the things of God.  Hence the things that God loves we should love, and when two or more are praying it would seem a harmony is being played before the throne of grace.  Yet when we pray we should be able to understand what is being petitioned concerning, God exalted, souls interceded for, etc\u2026.  <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">To be continued\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Phil, the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. 15 What am I to do?

Many people long to leave a legacy behind for themselves, making a name for themselves based on the \u201cgood things\u201d they hope to be remembered for.  Solomon was known for his wisdom, his influence, his wealth, his temple, etc\u2026 Yet, in his psalm did he focus on himself?  Nope!  Did he perhaps focus on any of his greatness, of the greatness of his father David?  Solomon wanted God\u2019s name to be remembered more, than he desired his own name to be remembered.  Not only did he want God\u2019s name to be blessed, but he also desired that the whole earth would be filled with the glory of God.  He wanted the whole earth to be filled the very glory of God.  What does Solomon see the earth is filled with if not the glory of God?  There is war, disease, death, burdens, destruction, etc\u2026, but Solomon desires that \u201cGod\u2019s glory,  is to be a holy site of worship, where God makes his presence known (cf. Ex. 40:34\u201335; 1 Kings 8:10\u201311), and this prayer is that the whole earth be such a sanctuary (cf. note on Isa. 6:3).[1]\u201d  Then he says Amen and Amen!  This is to say, he agrees with this blessing and yes let him say again he agrees.  I imagine he desires if you will, for the whole of creation to say amen and amen that it is filled by the very glory of God, as it was at one time, apart from any residue or presence of sin. <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">72:19<\/span> The filling of the earth with God\u2019s glory will be fulfilled in the consummation <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(Rev. 21:22\u201327).[2]  \u201c22 And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. 23 And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. 24 By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, 25 and its gates will never be shut by day\u2014and there will be no night there. 26 They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. 27 But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb\u2019s book of life.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is the picture that Solomon longs for.  Amen!  Is this what you long for?  Do you long to say Amen, not for Solomon\u2019s temple, but the temple of the Lord?  Do you long to say Amen, to abide in a city that has NO need of the sun, for the light of the Lord and His glory will be all the light that will ever be needed or desired?  Do you say Amen that all the nations will walk by his glorious light that in the Lamb of God that draws the very nations unto Himself?  Do you say Amen, that all the kings and rulers of the earth will bring their glory before the Lord and that their glory will be shrouded only by the greatest glory, the Glory of the Lord Himself!  All sin will be eradicated, for no sin can dwell in His presence. Even now does your heart cry out for this reality with a hearty, AMEN!  Only those that are born again will be there?.  There will not be one detestable, false convert, false preacher, heretic, or false teacher present.  Many think that their name is written in that book, and many are mistaken.  Matthew 7:21-23 reminds us of this grave reality.  Are you truly born again, and is your name written in heaven?  Are you saying Amen or ouch!  Let us reach the lost so they too may know the glorious Lamb of God, and join the Church of Jesus in saying Amen and Amen!  The Lord knows those who are his,\u201d and, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity (2 Tim 2:14),<\/span>\u201d therefore those who have their name chiseled in the Lamb\u2019s book of Life will be the only ones present.

Then all the people answered, \u201cAmen, Amen!\u201d while lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground (Neh. 8:5-6).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Many say the word, but few know what it actually means!  Have you ever said \u201cAmen\u201d in church, at a conference, or at a ministry training either quietly or out loud?  What does the word \u201cAmen\u201d mean, why do you say it, and what does it mean when you say it? <\/p>\n<p>John Piper writes, \u201cIn most languages of the world where Christianity has taken root the word &#8220;Amen&#8221; has been taken over untranslated.  Listen to a person pray in Chinese or Japanese or Swahili or Maninka or German or French or Russian or Arabic, and very likely there is at least one word you will understand: &#8220;Amen&#8221; &#8211; pronounced differently perhaps, but discernible. One of the reasons for this is that the Greek New Testament took it over from the Hebrew Old Testament untranslated (even though the Greek Old Testament [the Septuagint, LXX] rarely did, using &#8220;let it be&#8221; [\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf] instead of &#8220;amen&#8221; [\u0391\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd]).<\/p>\n<p>So what we have, all over the world today is a word, &#8220;Amen&#8221; that is a direct transliteration &#8211; not translation &#8211; of the Hebrew &#8220;Amen&#8221;. Now we see from our text that the word was taken to Corinth, a Greek city speaking the Greek language which did not have a word &#8220;amen.&#8221; And, within a matter of weeks or months, Paul and the other missionaries had already begun to transform the Corinthian culture by grafting a brand new word onto their great Greek language. It wasn&#8217;t the only one. Paul also taught them the Aramaic words &#8220;marana tha&#8221; (1 Corinthians 16:22, Marana qa) &#8211; &#8220;Lord, come.&#8221; And, of course, he taught them a vision of reality that exploded many of their preconceptions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the Old Testament the word &#8220;amen&#8221; was mainly a congregational response to give a strong affirmation or agreement &#8211; to a curse or a word of praise to God.  In, Deuteronomy 27:16 the Levites say, &#8220;&#8216;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother.&#8217; And all the people shall say, &#8216;Amen.&#8217;<\/span>&#8221; That is, we agree with that curse, so let it be.  Therefore, they affirmed curses as well as blessings.  This is not something that generally goes through one\u2019s mind in the modern church service when one says \u201cAmen.\u201d  Yet, we should say \u201cAmen\u201d to everything that aligns with the word of God, whether we read it, or hear it preached, and whether it speaks about a blessing or a curse, a blessing or a judgment. <\/p>\n<p> Look at what took place during the time of Ezra when he was open \u2013 air preaching in Nehemiah 8:1 \u2013 11 (please read the whole thing).<\/p>\n<p>First, there was a gathering and a standing, to hear the Law of God.  This expressed the great reverence the people had for it.  Secondly, there was preaching of the Law and the blessing of the God of the Law.  Thirdly, there was an understanding of the Law because of the exposition or explanation of God\u2019s Law.  Fourthly, because of the explanation of God\u2019s Law, there was the understanding of God\u2019s Law.  This is paramount, because many understand what the text of the Bible says, but not what it means.  We help people understand what it means by using hermeneutics, which is discovering the author\u2019s intent through the historical context of the text at hand.  Fifthly, there was an answering that took place, showing the people agreed with God\u2019s Law and this is where the \u201cAmen\u201d was shouted and a lifting of the hands!  The agreement with the mouth and outward accompanying praise of the body (lifting the hands) took place among the people.  And finally, there was worshipping, which is the proper response to God\u2019s holy Law.  This whole scene was a glorious account which you too should say a hearty \u201cAmen\u201d.  Oh how we should long to see this type of reverence for God\u2019s Word, and preaching that pierces the heart which causes people to say \u201cAmen!\u201d  John Piper again shares, \u201cThe &#8220;amen&#8221; meant, &#8220;Yes, we agree with your blessing! We join in your blessing! All that you have said of God&#8217;s greatness we let it echo in our Amen. We say, &#8220;True, and firm and reliable is what you have said.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>However, people say \u201cAmen\u201d for much lesser things, and usually when it is all about them.  Perhaps I should not use the term lesser, but many do in fact \u201cAmen\u201d when it is about them and are not consistent, when it is purely about God.  For example, a man gets a promotion at work, and says, \u201cAmen,\u201d but the preacher says, God is holy and there is no \u201cAmen.\u201d  Yet it was the holy God that blessed me with the job, and because the job was a blessing, the man focused on the blessing and not on the One who gave the blessing, namely God!  Furthermore, people say \u201cAmen\u201d to things that are totally unbiblical as well.  When someone such as the famous Joel Osteen does his motivation speaking, many say \u201cAmen,\u201d even when he only tells stories and uses the Bible out of context.  It is up to God\u2019s people to study God\u2019s Word, and to say \u201cAmen\u201d when the preacher not the motivation speaker, preaches what is in line with God\u2019s Word.  Would the people of Ezra\u2019s day say \u201cAmen\u201d if he were merely motivational preaching.  Yes there are many that gather to hear many of the preachers on the television, but are the things that are being preached worth an \u201cAmen?\u201d Be mindful of what you are saying \u201cAmen\u201d to.  When you say \u201cAmen\u201d you are saying you agree with what you have read, or heard preached. <\/p>\n<p>Would you say \u201cAmen\u201d to the first part of this message?  Well that depends if it is biblical, and if you agree with the truth, or if it is unbiblical and if you are more concerned about pleasing God than hurting my feelings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. 6 And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God.

The word \u201cfeet\u201d is not there just to fill in, it has a significant meaning. Feet help you relocate, it makes you move, it makes you go. When Jesus said, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Go ye into the world and preach the gospel<\/span>&#8220;. The beginning word \u201cGO\u201d requires \u201cFEET\u201d that would mean on your prayers, put feet to it and go. I do not see anywhere in the scripture where it says \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">how lovely are the feet of those who sit<\/span>&#8220;. You would imagine that those who sit have lovely feet because they are clean but the bible talks about those who go as the ones with lovely feet. Their feet may be full of dust, dragging, weary from going, but they are still going because it&#8217;s the message that they have that makes their feet lovely. As I go out witnessing, I always have enough excuses as to why I should not go. When I go and it\u2019s done, I come back rejoicing. Going up the mountain is tough and so is going after sinners but coming from the mountain is easy and relaxing and so is after witnessing, you come back rejoicing and relaxed.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way, at a police station, they have a party and all people have been invited including law breakers, they have a DJ, good food, gifts etc, tell me, how many would still show up at the party? very few. So is with the church, we are hoping that sinners will find their way to the church, we promise good music, spiritual food, a place of peace but still very few come. Why? because a guilty person will find it hard and intimidating showing up at a police station, we have to go out and apprehend them. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 10:14&amp;15, &#8220;How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe on Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? vs. 15, &#8220;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">And shall they preach unless they are sent?<\/span><\/span>. Vs. 15 has been fulfilled when Jesus said, &#8220;go ye&#8221;, we are the preachers who will preach to them repentance and faith, the only two keys to salvation.<\/p>\n<p>Here is what makes the feet of him that goes lovely, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 119:105, &#8220;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path<\/span>&#8220;. Jesus Christ is the divine light, His words we preach is the lamp to our feet that causes us to have lovely feet and He lights our path towards sinners. \u201cThe lamp unto the feet\u201d is for those who are moving. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;\">Could it be the reason Jesus washed the feet of the disciples so as to prepare them for the gospel?<\/span> Then He said we ought to wash other people&#8217;s feet (sinners).

There is no place more clear to deal with the issue of justice and fairness than looking to the cross of Calvary. If God were merely fair, was it fair to allow His sinless Son to die for sinful, undeserving people? If ever a man could say, \u201cit\u2019s not fair,\u201d it would have been Jesus Christ. It wasn\u2019t fair for Him to go to the cross for you, or for me. Yet, \u201cWhile we were yet sinners Christ died for us.\u201d It is to our benefit that He is not fair, because we would all end up in Hell, because there is no one good, no not even one Jesus said as He spoke to the rich young ruler. \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Why do you call me good?\u201d Jesus answered. \u201cNo one is good\u2014except God alone<\/span> (Mark 10:18).\u201d This man called Jesus good, apart from calling Him God, and only God is good. In civil law, a good judge must punish crime. If he turns a blind eye to injustice, then he is corrupt and he himself should be punished. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; mercy and truth go before your face<\/span>&#8221; (Psalm 89:14).

I used to think it was John!!. I think the name Jesus is the most HATED name in America if not in the world. Think about it, which name is frequently used as a curse word or used to express disgust?, Jesus and times His title Christ added to it. Which name would people most likely eliminate from anything? Once again it\u2019s Jesus. Campus Crusade for Christ recently changed their name to eliminate crusade and Christ because they are offensive. There are many who are offended by this name;  then there are those people who accommodate it; then there are people who pretend to love this name; and then there are us, Christians who love the name Jesus. We don&#8217;t love the name because it sounds good, we love it because of who He is and the power in His name. It&#8217;s more than just a name as we will see in the scriptures.<\/p>\n<p>A while back I came across &#8220;American Idol give back&#8221; whatever they named it. On this episode, they were raising money to support poor children in Africa and other parts of the world. The contestants stood up to sing a well-known song from Hillsong &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Shout to the Lord<\/span>&#8221; and I was like, wow, they are going to sing about Jesus on national TV with over 30million people watching. Then the beginning of the song &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My JESUS, My SAVIOR, LORD there is NONE like You<\/span>&#8221; was ELIMINATED COMPLETELY and they began from &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">my shepherd, my comfort<\/span>&#8220;. The name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; is in the song, in fact, the song is about Him and for Him. He is the whole reason for the song yet they left His name out it. How many of the events have pastors been told to pray in the name of God (not sure which one) but not in the name of  Jesus our God?<\/p>\n<p>Oh I love His name, it sounds sweet on my lips, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 18:10, &#8220;the name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and they are safe&#8221;, 2 Samuel 22:4, &#8220;I will call upon the (name of the) LORD, who is worthy to be praised; So shall I be saved from my enemies\u201d. Acts 4:12, &#8220;Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\u201d<\/span>. I remember about 10 years ago, on a snowy night, coming from school and down the hill my car lost control getting off the road and headed towards the trees by the road side. The name I could think of was none other than the name of Jesus who could save me. I shouted out His highly exalted name, the name above every name, the name JESUS. The car missed two trees head on and landed in between them with no scratch or injuries. Calling on that name saved me that day. And how many times have I called on that name and I believe you too have done the same. Oh I don&#8217;t take that name casually or use it loosely, I pray in that name. People get saved through that name. We get healed through that name. Demons tremble at the mention of that name. If you are used to using \u201cOMG\u201d in excitement, in shock or whatever the case, I urge you to quit it. His name is not to be used lightly, \u201cThe name of the Lord shall not be used in vain\u201d. If you are around people who misuse His name and you say nothing, I would be curious to know if you would be quiet if someone was using your wife\u2019s or husband or child\u2019s name as a punch line for a joke or as a curse word. There is something about that name.<\/p>\n<p>God the Father gave His faithful Son who was obedient even unto the death of the cross by first exalting Him which means He highly elevated His rank and then gave Him &#8220;THE&#8221; not &#8220;A&#8221; name above EVERY name, vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">10 \u201cthat at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father&#8221;<\/span>. God the Father did not take the name of His Son Jesus lightly neither can I. God the Father has promised His Son that every knee will bow to Him, either in repentance and faith or on judgment day.

For example you would go outside, but it&#8217;s raining. Five men found themselves in such a situation. Jesus was in town and was preaching, and multitudes no doubt flocked to him because they wanted to see him perform more miracles (like the healing of the leper). However, Jesus was preaching not working miracles inside the house. These men wanted to get their paralytic friend to Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>The Expositors Bible Commentary states, &#8220;This typical Palestinian peasant&#8217;s house was a small, one-room structure with a flat roof. Access to the roof was by means of an outside stairway. The roof itself was usually made of wooden beams with thatch and compacted earth in order to shed the rain. Sometimes tiles were laid between the beams and the thatch and earth placed over them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The phrase that grabbed my heart was &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">When Jesus saw their faith&#8230;<\/span>&#8221; How can one see faith anymore than one can see the wind? these four men teach us how Jesus can see our faith.<\/p>\n<p>1.

When the four men dug up the compacted thatch and earth (no doubt dirt showered down on those inside the house below) the dirt probably fell upon Jesus. Jesus looked up and saw the digging (action) to substantiate their faith (trying to get their friend to Jesus).<\/p>\n<p>See the opportunities through the eyes of faith.

I got into a discussion with another church-goer, but this time it was over fast food. Here is something to think about.<\/p>\n<p>My position: fast food is supposed to be a substitute for real food. It is not exactly on the same par with a restaurant. Fast food generally is expensive. Think about it. For the amount you pay for one burger meal that would fill you up- you could take the same &#8220;seemingly pennies&#8221; to the grocery store and buy the same (or more) amount of beef and take it home and feed for a couple of meals, right? And, eating food prepared at home on the stove or in the oven probably would be more healthier, too. Reputable dieticians warn that fast food should be used at a minimum as an absolute necessity. If you can honestly hold off until you get home- you should. I think that in some cases, it would probably be wise to forego the fast food meal altogether. That temporary fast would not damage your health or weight like the greasy fast food would. Think about it. So, why do we patronize fast food when its generally unhealthy and expensive in the long run? Because it&#8217;s convenient, easy, and it tastes good. GET THIS. We pay dearly for failing to plan or refusal to pack a lunch or being unwilling to do the work (that is, wait until we get home or stop by the grocery store to pick up the healthy food to cook at home). And, for some, fast food is a regular routine- not just an occasional alternative. Think about the parents who raise their kids on it&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The point? Well, Christians often eat fast food too. They go to the meetings and conventions instead of feeding on what&#8217;s been cooked on the pastor&#8217;s stove or baked in the pastor&#8217;s oven (that is, feeding on his formal teachings based on proper exegetical studies and prayer, or feeding on what good has taught him thru the heat of personal experience). This food would be cheaper, and more healthy generally, and would probably sustain you longer. As stated above, why don\u2019t we eat at home where it is cheaper and more healthy; why do we pay exceedingly more for our poor planning, refusal to pack a meal, or determination not to wait? Convenient\/easy: it&#8217;s easier to have a TV. preacher or convention preacher to spout the &#8220;truth&#8221; with requiring our active obedience in discipleship. Tastes good: irrespective of health benefits- fast food taste good. what the TV.\/convention preacher is going to say to you probably is not going to challenge you significantly to live right and to help others.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, it is well understood that you cannot live on fast food because it will clog your pipes and rob you of life due to heart problems- not to mention obesity. The same is true for your spiritual diet. Ministries that help you to exposit the texts of scripture and give you meaningful opportunities to grow and practice your faith are not &#8220;fast food&#8221; but rather are diet or food supplements. Those popular ministries that solicit your involvement without requiring from you a measurable and practical duty to God and to others should not be used on the regular! Everybody I know prefers a home meal. Eat at home- it\u2019s cheaper and more healthy and will sustain you longer. It requires work (you got to be at the meetings- do the studies- pray- be accountable- etc.).

It reminds us of how amazing God is and how He can turn things around and use the least likely, the despised, and the rejected for His glory. The walls of Jericho came tumbling down without a bulldozer or physical battle in place because God reversed things. God gave Gideon victory with only 300 men in Judges 7 after sending over 30 thousand men back home. Samson in Judges 15 found a fresh jawbone of a donkey and slew 1,000 men. How clear it is when the bible says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1Corinthians 1:26-28, \u201c26 For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called. 27 But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; 28 and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, 29 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that no flesh should glory in His presence<\/span>\u201d<\/span>. God is not a respecter of man, He is concerned about His name and how to make His name great among us.<\/p>\n<p>How often do we look at things and conclude there is nothing good or constructive  expected of them. We think of sophisticated as better; e.g.  an electronic device, it\u2019s easy to think the expensive one is better than the cheaper one . We can even conclude that the expensive one will last and yes there is some truth to it but not always. The despised can be great to use and even last longer. We see this with the four lepers whom the Lord choses to remind us that \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">not by might or power, but by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts\u201d, Zechariah 4:6<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now these four lepers were weak, sick, hungry and few in numbers. If we were to get a little understanding of the Syrians, they were feared by the Israelites. The Syrians knew that the only way Israel could be a threat to them was if  <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c\u2026 they hired against the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians\u201d<\/span>. There had to be two kings hired before they could be a threat to them but God knows how best to fight His battles. These four men chose to go to the Syrian camp to surrender hoping in that act, they would be spared, made slaves and given food but as they began to walk there in difficulty, vs. 6.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201c\u2026the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses\u2014the noise of a great army; so they said to one another\u201d.<\/span> without changing them, God caused the Syrians to hear a sound of an army and also believe a lie. God caused them to be terrified of their own imaginations, striking terror upon the spirits of the besiegers. There was not a sword drawn against them . God chose to use four weak men to bring terror to a mighty army. They had their ways of wanting to do things, God chose His way.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c\u2026Therefore they arose and fled at twilight, and left the camp intact\u2014their tents, their horses, and their donkeys\u2014and they fled for their lives\u201d<\/span>, God can when he pleases, dispirit the boldest, and make the stoutest heart to tremble. They that will not fear God, he can make them fear at the shaking of a leaf. Thus God needs no great preparation to destroy the wicked. Though they are many he can scatter them with a small noise, or shaking of a leaf.<\/p>\n<p>Are you feeling inadequate, weak, fearful etc? then you have the qualifications of what God can use to do great work for His name sake. All you need is to avail yourself and let the Lord chose how to fight His battles for you and through you while you yield to His plans. If God could use these four sick, hungry, weak men, God can use you. Are you available?

However when he was a young boy he didn\u2019t know how to use his hands in this regards, he had to learn it.  One moves from not knowing to knowing through learning, and he learned to use his hands from his dad.<\/p>\n<p>David wrote, He [God] teaches my hands to war\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>1. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Warrior Engage in War<\/span><\/p>\n<p>David was a warrior from his youth.  As a young boy he said <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cthere came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:  35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear\u2026\u201d<\/span> Of course David defeated the famous Goliath as well.  The Lord seemed to teach David\u2019s hands to war.  David would become a military leader in Saul\u2019s Army.  As Christians we are in the Kings army and there is certainly a war at hand, one that is not of flesh and blood, but one against rulers, principalities and powers of darkness. <\/p>\n<p>2. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Warriors have hands of war<\/span> <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">\u201cHe teaches my hands to war.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough to dress for battle and admire ones armor in front of a mirror.  Ephesians 6 also tells us after one has put on the full armor of God to take a stand against the Devil\u2019s schemes, the warrior must battle in prayer (Ephesians 6:18 \u2013 19). Open your mouth boldly, Make known the mystery of the Gospel, Pray always with all prayer in the Spirit, Pray with supplication in the Spirit, Watch with perseverance \u2013 Jesus said in the Garden of Gethsemane, \u201cwatch and pray\u2026\u201d Make supplication for the saints (fellow believers, not dead people), Pray for laborers (Matt. 9:36 \u2013 37)<\/p>\n<p>3. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Warriors make breakthroughs<\/span> <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201c\u2026a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Not everyone in the military is considered a warrior.   One prerequisite one needs to be considered a warrior is the fact that warriors have won some significant battles that could have been lost.  We think of warriors winning many more times than losing.   David wrote that he broke a bow of steel in my hands.  Acts 12:5 states, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">\u201cSo Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.\u201d<\/span>  Then something happened, Peter actually was broken free from jail by an angel of the Lord (Acts 12: 6\u2013 16).  Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, thy will be done,\u201d then He went to the cross and put \u201clegs\u201d to his prayers.  Don\u2019t just pray for the saints, \u201cencourage them as well,\u201d don\u2019t just pray for the unsaved, go out and reach the lost by preaching the gospel the way Jesus did.  If we are warriors for Christ, breakthroughs MUST take place.  Learn how to engage in war through prayer, and as one prays in the will of God, one should experience breakthroughs as the church did in Acts.  Are you a warrior?  If you feel you have been engaged in the spiritual war at hand are you experiencing breakthroughs? <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Engage, fight, pray, do, and breakthrough by the power and will of God!<\/span> Blessings, Phil the Evangelist<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201cHe teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms\u201d.

Paul here speaks of a people who are laden with sinful practice, yet falsely profess to be in Christ. Last week, Brother Evans shared on the toxic gospel, I see this to be one of the results of that gospel, and something that largely plagues what calls itself the church today. Let he who has an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.<\/p>\n<p>The form of godliness spoken of here refers to a merely ornamental religion, a dressed up outward religion that does not touch the heart. One of pomp and ceremony, tradition and idol worship, not one of love birthed in the heart. This religion gives no remedy for sin, only a covering of such things. The example here is the growing amount in the church, proclaiming Christ, while they drink and revel with the world. True religion is birthed in the heart, it springs forth in flames of holy love unto the Lord. This person willingly renounces the world, willingly forsakes sin and self, and pursues God with all the desire of the heart.<\/p>\n<p>Next Paul speaks of denial, a word here better translated as repudiate or renounce, which both speak of a willing turning away, one who hears the truth, but chooses to continue to follow their sinful practices. They hear of the necessity of a holy life, but they ignore this cry, choosing rather to hide behind a false theology or some empty dogma. The church today revels in this, worldly pastors preaching to worldly churches, no longer do the Pentecostal fires burn within these sacred walls. We have denied the power of the blood, shed by Jesus to cleanse us of our sin, not to cover it over. Jesus Christ came to destroy the works of the devil, all glory to His name!<\/p>\n<p>Lastly Paul speaks of power. The power here is the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, birthed within the heart by faith. Holiness is the proof and result of this work, not a mere outward holiness, but a purity of heart and life, characterized by a love for God above all else, and without this, I scarcely believe one can say they have Christ. There must be a change, we must be new creations, we must be born again. Not baptized, not on our church registry, born from above, born of the Spirit, now living lives wholly given to the Lord, obeying Him, loving Him incessantly. Let us consider our ways, let us turn again to the Lord, for He will abundantly pardon, He is willing that none would perish, but that all would come to everlasting life, remaining in that place by faith.<\/p>\n<p>In the Savior\u2019s love, blessings Brother Benjamen<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Timothy 3:5- \u201chaving a form of godliness, but denying its power.

As we get to verse 3,  Peter is observed as describing that the underlying motive of a false  teacher\/prophet is not love for the truth, but love for money. He says  to us that by greed &#8220;&#8230;<strong>they will exploit you with deceptive words&#8230;&#8221;<\/strong> because people are desperate. Desperate people do desperate things even if its lies that leads to destruction. Their words are deceptive,  appealing, and very spiritual. They concur with words as Peter reminds  us. They&#8217;re not interested in virtue, holiness, righteousness,  obedience, and godliness. One prominent word faith preacher in an  interview had the boldness to say that Jesus is the PRODUCT. The product used to exploit people.<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">The first three verses Peter gives us an overview,&nbsp;&nbsp; then takes time in the remainder of the chapter to paint a picture of who a false  teacher\/prophet looks like and their judgment. I will highlight a few  verses and leave their end result, God will deal with them; but for us,  we need to identify them and distance ourselves. Peter writing to us by  the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is calling true believers to wake up. Paul records in <strong>Romans 13:12, &#8220;The night is far spent, the day  is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us  put on the armor of light<\/strong>&#8220;.

Some have had moral (sexually, financially) but quickly  restored themselves to the pulpits, some have been divorced but moved on as though nothing ever happened and even found ways to blame the devil  for attacks.

God\u2019s great name is dragged on the mud, blasphemed all day long. God has a concern for His great name. Should not prophesies if any be in line with His word and not contradict it?&nbsp; Are we so fascinated with extra biblical manifestation that we violate God\u2019s written word and don\u2019t challenge those who contradict? If anything, prophets of today should be PROCLAIMING God\u2019s word and not FORTH TELLING. We are to be the Ezekiel\u2019s in Ezekiel 37 in the valley proclaiming the word of God to the dry bones until life is restored in the valley. If the Gospel we preach cannot be preached at all times in every place, it\u2019s no gospel at all and has no power.<\/p>\n<p><span>The tragedy of a false teacher\/preacher is that they are not clear on the gospel or how they teach it. They may say \u201cJesus is the only way\u201d but the rest of the message sounds like \u201cinclusive gospel\u201d, a gospel that is non-offensive so as to avoid losing followers or being controversial. Jesus never got excited about the crowds, He knew exactly the kind of gospel they wanted but He would not give it to them, He refused to change the message. He is unchanging God, His message is unchanging in a changing world. True gospel preaching starts with the nature of God and then reveals the nature of man and the commitment to Christ. Jesus said, <b>Matthew 16:24 \u201c\u2026, \u201cIf anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me\u201d, Matthew<\/b> <b>10:<sup> 37<\/sup> He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me.

It\u2019s many times half gospel which is not gospel at all. Therefore they preach another gospel that gives many people assurance of hope when they don\u2019t have the truth that saves, Christ. <b>2 Corinthians 4:2\u201d &nbsp;<sup>1<\/sup> <u>Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart<\/u>. <sup>2<\/sup> But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness <u>nor handling the word of God deceitfully<\/u>, <u>but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man\u2019s conscience in the sight of God<\/u>. <sup>3<\/sup> But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, <sup>4<\/sup> whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them. <u><sup>5<\/sup> For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus\u2019 sake<\/u>. <u><sup>6<\/sup> For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<\/u><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is why it\u2019s important we know those who pour into our hearts, do they preach the same gospel Paul, Peter, Christ preached or they preaching another gospel.

And here comes the sad part, many follow their destructives ways. Now these may not necessarily be non-believers, but believers too. Mark that Peter does not say few follow, he says many. This was a big concern for Paul too when he wrote to the Galatians, <b>Galatians 1 \u201c6 I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, <sup>7<\/sup> which is not another; <u>but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ<\/u>. <u><sup>8<\/sup> But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.<\/u> <sup>9<\/sup> As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed (banned)\u201d.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">It is not easy to spot false teachers\/prophets as they prey on their listeners primarily by what their listeners crave for the most, health and prosperity. While there is nothing wrong with these two in their right context, they are only by products not the prime product of Christianity and they are not guarantee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Why do many follow their destructive ways? 1. <b>Biblical and theological illiteracy.<\/b> If we don\u2019t know the bible, if we don\u2019t know the doctrine, if we don\u2019t know theology, it\u2019s virtually difficult to identify false teachers\/prophets and that is one reason we become uncomfortable when one identifies a false teacher\/prophets. We lack spiritual maturity, the writer of Hebrew having done his diagnosis, gives us the results, \u201c<b>12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food. 13 <u>For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe<\/u>. 14 But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, <u>those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.<\/u>\u201d Hebrews 5:12-14.<\/b> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Majority of people who get saved are unable to articulate what&nbsp; salvation is, why they are saved, and how they are saved. Therefore, few plumb line messages through the eyes of the gospel. It starts with the kingdom of God and what it entails; everything else is tested in the light of His kingdom. The kingdom of God is about righteousness, <b>Psalm 89:14, \u201cRighteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; Mercy and truth go before Your face\u201d<\/b>. Paul tells us in <b>Romans 14:7, \u201cfor the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men\u201d. <\/b>Christ did not die on the cross to make us happy, Christ died on the cross to make us righteous. This is the reason Isaiah 53:5 is not talking about physically healing primarily, it\u2019s talking about spiritual healing. <b>2Corinthians 5:\u201c21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him<\/b>\u201d. <b>Proverbs 11:4, \u201cRiches do not profit in the day of wrath, <u>But righteousness delivers from death<\/u>\u201d<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">If we don\u2019t know biblical gospel, we will follow their destructive ways. One way the false teachers \/prophets are doomed is because of the way of righteousness. Peter in vs. 4-11, stresses this point of righteousness. <b>Vs. 4\u201d\u2026 but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly<\/b>\u201d, and <b>vs. 7 and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked 8 (for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds). <\/b>In these two examples, we see Noah a preacher of righteousness, his life spoke righteousness as he called people to repent and avoid flood judgment. We then see righteous Lot, who had spiritual weakness but his heart was right with God.

They kept sending warnings and even gave marks of such people. Peter here deals with the false prophets and teaches us how to identify them so that we flee. These were not personal issues but doctrinal the same reason I address them. How sincere they are and many are is also not the issue, TRUTH is the issue.

The Lord is like a gene they rub on to get whatever they want.

They are more concerned about now than eternity.&nbsp; . The false teacher\u2019s basic error is that they will not submit their lives to the rule of Christ. <b>Titus 1: 16\u201cThey profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work\u201d<\/b><\/span><\/small><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:tahoma;\"><small><b><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Vs. 1, \u201c\u2026 who bought them\u201d, <\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">A master bought slaves, and the slaves owed the master allegiance as their sovereign.

The more I read, the more I became burdened as I from time to time address the subject of biblical discernment. Then this week I was handed an account to work on, only to find that it\u2019s for two ministers I would call false teachers. About 12 years ago I was hooked in their teachings among others and I later came to beware of them as false preachers primarily by their doctrine and their living as I carefully began to study the word and listen to solid teachings. That is why this subject is dear to my heart; I want to see believers especially those we minister to beware and distance themselves from these people.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases when I chat with believers, in our conversations they talk of those who influence their live, they will even say how they can\u2019t stand false teachers only to find in their list of their favorite preachers some are false teachers, again based on their doctrines and their life style. I am very concerned for our brothers in India and Africa because many have become victims of bad teaching and bad living and it\u2019s spreading there like wild fire.<\/p>\n<p>As Peter\u2019s life is close to pass into eternity, he dedicates this chapter to address a subject that must be addressed if the sheep is to stand. The letter is a warning about false teachers and their teaching. He wants us to know what they look like, how they act, how they talk, how they function and operate, and he describes them in a very, very graphic detail.<\/p>\n<p>At the expense of truth, there are some who\u2019ve said, \u201cDoctrine divides, can\u2019t we just put doctrine aside and get a long?\u201d It\u2019s always hard to draw the line and call someone a heretic, false teacher or false prophet when they are doing some nice things, when they have some truth in their teachings. If anything that\u2019s what makes them toxic. They are hard to spot and the only way is to plumb line what they teach with the word of God.  As Pastor Voddie Baucham puts it, \u201cmany of us are allergic to truth exposing false teachers\u201d, if anyone brings it up, we feel uncomfortable addressing such a subject and sweep it under the carpet as fast as we can. And while we let things slide, we continue to enable those who practice such things that blaspheme the name of the Lord. Another thing that is prevalent in our time when you talk about false teachers, people say, \u201cyou are being judgmental\u201d, that is true, how will you identify without judging. Right and wrong things are identified by judging so it\u2019s needed.<\/p>\n<p>John McArthur, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cI&#8217;m afraid the church today is a bit witless on these matters. It has become very tolerant of error, and it literally absorbs the very deception that Paul warns about and Peter warns about. The cry today is for everyone to agree with everyone, to tolerate everyone who names the name of Christ no matter what he teaches. This sort of endless tolerance has produced indifference to truth. Mark that. Tolerance has produced indifference to truth. The church is witless, careless, foolish, blind\u201d<\/span><br style=\"font-style:italic;\" \/><br \/>D.A.

The battles ultimately rested on the shoulders of the Lord, and not on the shoulders of Joab and Abishai. I imagine they fought as if the battle depended upon them, but knowing that <span style=\"font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">the outcome was not really in their ultimate control<\/span>.  Joab urged the army to \u201cbe strong\u201d and recognized that the outcome of the battle depended ultimately upon the Lord (cf. 15:26) (John MacArthur)[1].  If we believe it, we will proclaim it, and it would seem that the opposite is true as well (Romans 10:9,10)!  Joab, I imagine was a leader who exemplified faith, and I further imagine that his faith inspired others to have faith (not in him, but in the One who he placed his faith in! As men are we ok with that or must we control every situation?  Can we rest assure as has often been said by Charles Stanley, \u201cObey God and leave ALL the consequences to Him!\u201d  Can you surrender to God\u2019s sovereign hand?<\/p>\n<p>Recall Ezekiel when the Lord asked him, \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">And he said to me, \u201cSon of man, can these bones live?\u201d And I answered, \u201cO Lord God, you know.\u201d[2]<\/span>  God asks the question, and Ezekiel states, that God knows the answer to the question. He trusted in the Lord\u2019s answer, because God ultimately knew the answer.<\/p>\n<p>Remember Job, who stood in the midst of pain and opposition and yet spoke the words to his \u201cfriends\u201d when he said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">\u201cThough He slay me, yet will I trust Him (13:14)\u201d<\/span>  \u201cJob assured his accusers that his convictions were not self-serving, because he was ready to die trusting God. But still he would defend his innocence before God, and was confident that he was truly saved and not a hypocrite (v. 16).[3]  Despite all that he lost, despite all that he experienced personally, and the fact that he so \u2013 called friends pounded their advice on him, he rejected their advice, and being in the midst of his situation, made such a resounded trust statement that spewed from the depths of a desperate heart that trusted the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>By life&#8217;s end, a 19th century pastor named George Mueller had built five large orphan houses and cared for 10,024 orphans. The entire time, he <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">depended on God&#8217;s response to his prayer of faith to supply the needs of the orphans in his care<\/span>.

Men simply must fix their eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. [4]Look at Eph 6 which speaks of the armor of God.  Remember Paul wrote that letter from prison and described the armor as he looked upon a Roman soldier and the way they were dressed for battle, in times of peace or war.  However, unlike a Roman soldier, many of us will never see live physical military combat, but if you are a man of God you will fight many battles on your knees in prayer.  You will fight many battles in your mind when tempted by pride, lust, greed, rebellion against God, anger, rage, etc, as you become conformed more and more into the image and character of Jesus Christ (Phil 2:5; 4:8, Rom 8;29). <\/p>\n<p>How much does Scripture implore us to trust the Lord?  I am glad that you asked.  I trust in God (Ps. 25:2; Ps. 31:6; Ps. 31:14; Ps. 55:23; Acts 27:25); in God I put my trust (Ps. 56:4; Ps. 56:11); my God, in whom I trust (Ps. 91:2); my eyes are toward you (Ps. 141:8); I have trusted in the Lord (Ps. 26:1); you are my trust from my youth (Ps. 71:5); I trust in the loving-kindness of God for ever (Ps. 52:8); I trust in you (Ps. 143:8); I trust in your loving-kindness (Ps. 13:5); my heart trusts in him (Ps. 28:7); we trust in the Lord (2 Kgs. 18:22); we trust in his holy name (Ps. 33:21); we are relying on the Lord (Isa. 36:7); we rely on you (2 Chr. 14:11); so that we might trust in God (2 Cor. 1:9); to you I lift up my soul (Ps. 25:1); save your servant who trusts in you (Ps. 86:2); I will trust and not be afraid (Isa. 12:2); I know whom I have believed (2 Tim. 1:12); God, our eyes are on you (2 Chr. 20:12); I will put my trust in him (Heb. 2:13); we know and believe the love God has for us (1 John 4:16); though he slay me I will trust him (Job 13:15); though war arise, yet will I be confident (Ps. 27:3); I believed, even when afflicted (Ps. 116:10); when I am afraid I will put my trust in you (Ps. 56:3).[5]  Look to Scripture, and trust in God\u2019s Word doing what it says to increase your faith in Him by His Word.<\/p>\n<p>Where is the Joab of today?

John Piper shares, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cAs it developed, the Ammonites were arrayed at the walled city to protect it, the Syrians were gathered in the open field, and Joab, with the Israelites, were sandwiched in the middle.  So Joab took charge of one group of men and set himself against the Syrians, and the rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai, his brother, and set them against the Ammonites. In verses 11 and 12 Joab gives this great word of challenge and faith to Abishai\u2026<\/span><br style=\"font-style:italic;\" \/><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.

The answer to that question should have been answered by Cain himself, and the answer should have been a resounding yes.  However the question was asked as a harsh challenge and I imagine in a sarcastic tone.  Men cannot live as islands unto themselves.   The writer of Proverbs wrote,<\/span> <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">\u201cas iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another man (27:17).\u201d<\/span>  <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">As the proper tool shapes and sharpens iron for its desired use, so a man benefit intellectually and theological through being sharpened by a keener mind and encourages improvement of good character which the face will reveal [1] by their personal friendship.[2]  Men need to live the Christian life, and need the kind of conversion mentioned.  Furthermore, men need other men in battle; they do need to be one another\u2019s keeper.  Joab was there to help his brother in battle.  Israel was in the middle between two armies that desired to destroy them.<\/span>  Abishai was sent against the Ammonites; Joab went against the Syrians. Piper shares again saying <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cIt is wise battle strategy, when the enemy is widespread and diverse, that we not engage all the troops in one place. It is also wise to have everyone doing most of the time what they are best at.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Men you have perspective, gifts, and talents, etc\u2026, that you add to the battle against the enemy.  You need to humbly ask another brother at times to battle alongside you.  The enemy has sent attacks on men, and men must band together to fight.  It takes humility to ask for another\u2019s help.  Many will perhaps pray and ask God for help, but often His body (the church) is the help that He supplies by His good hand.  Men fight together, and are to hold one another accountable by and to the Word of God.  Men seem to be ferocious in sports (which is temporal), and timid about the things of God (which is eternal).  Men can scream at a sports event and this is seen as commendable, but when men get serious about the Lord, then they are deemed a fanatic.  Why oh man do you allow the world to set the rules to govern your life?  We are far too influenced by our culture and it\u2019s dictates.  Yet John write, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">\u201c5 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-style:italic;\">the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">\u2014is not of the Father but is of the world. 17 And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.[3]<\/span>  The three temptations listed are the same three that the first man (Adam, Gen 3) disobeyed God concerning, and these same three were the three that the second Adam (Christ, Matt 4, Luke 4) would not fall victim to concerning (see attached chart).  The temptations never changed, neither did the Word of God, but only one of them held to the Word of God and defeated the enemy.       <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Let US play the men<\/span>.  The ESV states \u201clet us be courageous for our people.  I love the term us.  There are many that try to be what Tony Miano calls Nomad Christians.  These men try to live the Christian life alone; they try to be lone ranger pastors, or nomad evangelists.  However, even the Lone Ranger had a sidekick.  No Christian is an island, even Christ (not that He had a need) traveled with His disciples.  There are so many verses that deal with such terms as \u201cus\u201d, \u201cone another\u201d, etc\u2026 how can one possibly be a man of God alone?  One cannot obey the Bible apart from the one another verses.  The writer of Hebrews commands, Hebrews 10 <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c24 And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.[4]<\/span>  Many Christians assemble (similar to all the pieces in a puzzle box) but they never assemble (putting each piece in its strategically designed location.  Men are to play the man at home by taking the lead role as the Bible commands, and loving their wives as Christ loved the church (Eph 5).  Men must train, nurture and discipline their children (Proverbs 22:6).  As shared previously, as men of God we need to biblically man up!<\/p>\n<p>Examine yourself; ask others to examine you, especially those close to you like your wife.

Then the guys in the movies are hard, indestructible, and then one that gets a different girl with every sequel of the movie.  Hollywood is definitely confused about men and is certainly influential over our society.  Ray Comfort shares in <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What Hollywood Believes<\/span>, \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">It is a sad irony that when legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMiller (director of the epc movie the Ten Commandments) first came to California in the early 1900s, he settled in a small town that was giving away free land to anyone willing to build a place of worship.  The town, said to be a \u2018Christian\u2019 settlement, had a picturesque name \u2013 Hollywood.  Yet through the years the famous town has come to bear little resemblance to middle America.<\/span>\u201d  Just as Hollywood has come far from their Christian heritage, men today that profess to be Christian seem so far from what a biblical man should be.  Right off the bat, let me state, that I am not saying one needs to be Christ (the perfect man) that is impossible, nor is the expectation to be Paul, John, Luke, etc\u2026you and I are not them, but our identity should be in Christ.   <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Men of trustworthiness<\/span> \u2013 Although this point deals with a previous verse from the text at hand, it is necessary to bring this into this message because it set the tenor for why Joab was sent to battle.   The writer of Proverbs states, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble Is like a bad tooth  and a foot out of joint<\/span> (Prov. 25:19).\u201d  I get frustrated by the lack of faithful men that profess to be Christians.  I have found that so many are unreliable when you need them, many don\u2019t stick to their word when they give it.  Men that are simply to show up for prayer, evangelism, church service, discipleship, work, etc\u2026 when push comes to shove they are not faithful.  At one time in American history there was a saying that a man\u2019s word was his bond, how much more should our \u201cyes be yes\u201d and our \u201cno be no?\u201d  Men, keep your word, with your family, with your church, with your friends, do what you said you were going to do.  When you say you are going to show up, then show up, be there when you say.  Look how many women have stepped up in leadership because the men have not been faithful they have allowed this growing trend.  David was able to look to Joab and \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men (v2 Sam 10:7)<\/span>.  Can your pastor look to you and trust you will step up to serve?  Can another mature believer look to you to follow through, to use your area of influence, to use your gifts\/abilities to serve when called upon, or perhaps you would even go so far as to volunteer? <\/p>\n<p>I have heard it said there are five stages in manhood which are:  male-hood, boyhood, manhood, fatherhood, and husband-hood.  The Apostle John focused on this reality of spiritual maturity when he writes 1 John 2:12-15.  He is not actually writing to children, young men, and fathers in the physical sense, but in the spiritual maturity sense. He writes the following: <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">12I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name\u2019s sake. 13I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father. 14       I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Many men are still boys (little children) spiritually.  Jesus called us to have faith like a child, but not the maturity of a child.  Paul gave the Corinthian church a tongue lashing for still being spiritual babies.  He wrote, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">\u201cBut I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. 2 I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, 3 for you are still of the flesh<\/span> (1 Co 3:1\u20133).\u201d  There comes a time to GROW UP!  Now I recognize in all fairness that people grow at different rates spiritually, similar to physical growth.  Some have growth spurts, others have slow steady growth, but all Christians, if they are Christians WILL GROW, and this is inevitable.  If a Christian never grows, you can bet that they are not abiding in the vine (John 15:7).   In moving from boyhood to manhood, I heard it said that taking responsibility is what separates the men from the boys.  In our secular culture the man is the one that \u201cgets the most girls,\u201d but God is looking for men that are faithful to Him, their wives, their families, and their churches.  Job is described in the following manner, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">\u201cThere was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil<\/span> (1:1).\u201d  Do you think he was faithful, you bet, just read the book and how he was faithful even when his wife told him to curse God and die.  I will touch specifically on job at a later time, as he was truly a man God used.<\/p>\n<p>You have to begin to be faithful in the little things, so you can be entrusted with more.  Glorify God in the little things, and He will allow you to glorify Him with more.  The man given one talent was UNFAITHFUL and even what he had was stripped from him and given to another, another that had been faithful with their talents.  God has commanded you to daily pray, but do you; He has commanded you to daily read the Word, but do you; to share the Gospel, but are you; to serve, but are you a servant?  There are those that want to preach, but has He called you to lead in that capacity?  A young Bible college student wanted to preach to crowds on the spectrum of a Billy Graham.  I invited him to come to NYC and evangelize on the streets with me and said, let\u2019s see how you do sharing the Gospel with one person first.  The guy never even showed up.  Whenever I disciple people, I see if they are faithful with the little, and if not it saves me a lot of time knowing that I will not invest greatly in lives that are not willing to at least be faithful in the little things.  If someone shares that they want to learn the Bible, I give a verse to memorize.  If they are faithful we move on, if they are unfaithful it displays that their heart doesn\u2019t have the desire that the mouth professes and it is simply lip service.  We have too many professing men that are just lip service men.  Recall what Jesus said in <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Matthew 15:7,8, \u201cYou hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: 8\u201c \u2018This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; 9 in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.\u2019 \u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Why did these give lip service, because that is truly what they believed!  What you truly believe will come out when the heat is on.  Recall the 3 Hebrew boys in Dan 3, that refused to bow, and not knowing the outcome of their commitment.  They obeyed God and left all the consequences to him.  I preached to a man that threatened to cut me while holding a blade in his hand.  Yet I shoved the sword of the spirit into his heart and he walked away convicted having put his blade away.  He was cut to the heart by the Word of God.  <\/p>\n<p>Look into God\u2019s Word and read about faithful men, and then examine if you are faithful.  Ask those closest to you (wife, children, boss, co-worker), to be Judgment honest with you, and ask if they believe you to be faithful.  Ask a faithful, mature Christian to examine your faithfulness.  Do you show up at work on time, and then leave when the day is over?  Do you cut corners, or do what expected of you, dare I see above and beyond what is expected of you?  Do you raise your kids, or are they raising you?

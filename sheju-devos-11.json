REPLACE is to put back into former position or place, it&#8217;s also to provide a substitute. RESTORE is to bring back into existence or use, also to bring back to an original condition.<u><\/u><\/span><u><b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">REVIVE which is my key word is to bring back to life or conscious<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">.<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">It&#8217;s also to return to validity, effectiveness or operative condition<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">. The three words have functions that sound a like as they talk about bringing back which is a sign to us that something was once there but for some unknown reasons it went dormant, dead, in effective, corrupted, broken. The word revival kind of outweighs the two because it talks more about bringing back to life. You can restore something but still not be able to make a difference, you can replace something and still not do much but when you revive something, you bring it back to life, to its validity, effectiveness and operational condition.<\/span><\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"color:#000080;\">9 times in Psalm 119 the word revive has been recorded. This an indication that at times we go through dormant stages in our Christian walk that leaves us ineffective, dead and without being valid. The cure for this dilemma is not replace or restore but revive, bring back to life.<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">Psalm 119:25, &#8220;&#8230;Revive me according to your word, Psalm 80:18, &#8220;&#8230;revive us and we will call upon Your name&#8221;, Psalm 119:40, &#8220;&#8230;Revive me in Your righteousness&#8221;, Psalm 119:88, &#8220;Revive me according to Your loving kindness&#8221;, Psalm 119:149, &#8220;&#8230;revive me according to your justice&#8221;, Psalm 119:156, &#8220;&#8230;revive me according to Your judgments, Psalm 143:11, &#8220;Revive me, O Lord, for Your name&#8217;s sake, Isaiah 57:15, &#8220;&#8230;revive the heart of the contrite ones&#8221; Habakkuk 3:2, &#8220;revive Your work in the midst of the years<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">&#8220;<\/span><\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"color:#000080;\">What causes us to need a revival in the first place?<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">Isaiah 40:27, &#8220;&#8230; The Creator of the ends of the earth, neither faints nor is weary&#8221;<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">Of course God does not change and what affects humans has no effect on Him but for us, we will go through different cycles, times of being up, and times of being down, times of encouragements and times of discouragement why?<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">Isaiah 40:30, &#8220;Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">It&#8217;s clear that each of us will have those seasons for the bible says so but listen to how we get revived,<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">Isaiah 40:31, &#8220;But those that WAIT on the Lord shall renew (revive) their strength&#8221;. &#8220;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">Wait&#8221; as I have always mentioned does not mean sit and do nothing,<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">wait is a word used in restaurants to mean serve<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">. Wait on God means serve the Lord, find something that you can do for the Lord because this is how revival begins to come. Look at how the bible puts it<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">&#8220;Shall renew their strength&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;their strength will be renewed&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">. What this shows me is that in the process of waking up and beginning to do something in your life to bring a revival, that process will renew (revive) your strength. Here are the results of revival<\/span><b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">, Isaiah 40:31, &#8220;&#8230;They shall mount up with wings like eagles (not doves)&#8221;<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"color:#000080;\">Doves would fly away very fast while eagles sow above everything. If you are dealing with struggles, learn by God&#8217;s grace to sow above it without trying to run away from it. &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">They shall run and no be weary<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">&#8221; this is not trying to run a way but running towards the mark set before us, this is not a weary race but a race of hope. &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">They shall walk and not faint<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:#000080;\">&#8220;, this is where I would plug in faith, have faith in God without fainting cause faith keeps hope alive. Some people may think revival is all about hearing a fiery preaching, getting slain, basking in the presence of God and all that is good but I am more revived being in the Father&#8217;s business. Inquiring of what&#8217;s in the heart of the Father and stepping out by faith with His help to serve Him. Where are you today in your spiritual life? what are you doing about it? Get into a revival mode.

There is something about His presence that makes one to see and deal with Him and things differently. In Genesis, Jacob had a vision, upon waking up, he said,<b> &#8220;The presence of the Lord was here and I knew it not&#8221;.<\/b> Moses said&#8221;, &#8220;<b>If Your presence is not going with us, do not let us move from here (paraphrased)&#8221;.<\/b> The children of Israel had the ARK of the Covenant which represented the presence of God. The bible calls Him<b> Jehovah Shammah<\/b> which means<b> Jehovah Present<\/b> and not absent. He is not coming or going, He is here, now, available, ready.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">What is the ARK in the bible?<u><\/u><u><b> An Ark is something that affords protection and safety<\/b><\/u><b><\/b>, therefore the ARK of God (Covenant) is<u><\/u><u><b> a throne where Yahweh Himself was present in the midst of His people<\/b><\/u><b><\/b>. The children of Israel cherished the ARK as it was a sign of God present with them. No enemy could subdue them in the presence of the ARK.<u><\/u><u><b> Understanding the ARK of the Covenant eliminates one from trying to treat Him as a lucky charm or a holy object that you can rub and get whatever you want<\/b><\/u><b><\/b>. He is present and He has His dwelling in our midst and though people who do not know Him think that we are using Him as a lucky charm, they have a wrong understanding. We don&#8217;t worship God because of what He does for us, we worship Him because of who He is. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><b>In 1Samuel 4:10, 11, &#8220;So the Philistine fought, and Israel was defeated&#8230; Also the Ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, died&#8221;.<\/b> The Philistines came out to capture this thing that was always been with Israelites. They don&#8217;t understand what they were messing with. All they cared about was capturing the ARK and having it positioned in their camp as a lucky charm because if it worked for the Israelites, why shouldn&#8217;t it work for them. The problem was, they were treating the ARK as an &#8220;IT&#8221; while the Israelites treated the ARK as Him, a sign of reverence and respect. What finally destroyed Eli is the fact that the Ark of the Covenant was captured. He heard that his two sons had died but that did not nearly affect like when he heard that the ARK was captured which meant that the presence of God had departed. His daughter in law was pregnant at that time, when she heard Israel was defeated, her husband and her brother in law killed and the ARK captured, she immediately gave birth to a child and died. She named the child<b> Ichabod, saying, &#8220;the glory of has departed from Israel<\/b>&#8220;. I wonder why the glory, God&#8217;s presence departed from Israel. Why has the presence of the Lord left you when you had Him, could feel Him, could talk to Him, you could hear Him. If the presence of the Lord has departed from us, that void has been replaced with Ichabod.  Do you have the ARK or Ichabod? I will get into depth about the glory next time, but let&#8217;s find out why the glory departed.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><i><b>1Chronicles 13:4, &#8220;And let us bring again the ARK of our God to us:<\/b><b><u> for we inquired not<\/u> at it in the days of Saul&#8221;.<\/b> David desired the<b> presence<\/b> of God while Saul desired<b> position<\/b>.

Then we will be prepared for whatever the day brings. I&#8217;m talking about rest this morning, a struggle to many including myself. There is no one who understands rest like God and we see this being recorded in the book of<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\"> Genesis 2:1-3, &#8220;Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished.

Forget about what happened today and what you could have done better, take a break from what you dealt with today and shut everything out and get yourself in a position of rest. Applying emergency brakes to a fast moving car will bring the wheels to a rest but the car body will still be in motion and that could make the car flip. I would say that applying the brakes gradually will not only bring the wheels at a rest but the body will also be brought to a rest at the same time. Worrying about what hasn&#8217;t happened or what will happen will rob you of peace and rest. The mind needs rest, so is the body and the heart too. Troubled water never settles because of troubling winds but we thank God, He is the quiet still water soothing our souls to sleep. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Jesus comes in later and reminds people of what rest is all about, rest from the burdens of sins.. We know that there can be no true rest outside Christ and the reason is simple, if you are going to rest, you going to have to give up on what is stopping you from resting. In this case, Jesus has offered to take off our hands what we are holding on to that in turn we might have the true rest in Him. He says, &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Come to Me<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8221; which is an action word meaning move from where you are to where He is,<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\"> &#8220;All you who labor (weary) and are heavy laden (burdened)&#8221;<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">this is the reason why you and I need to move,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;And I will give you rest&#8221;<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">then end result if we do what He ask of us. The main reason for this rest is rest from the burden of sin but has also benefits to the rest in our bodies. If you&#8217;ve received rest from your burden of sin, ask for rest for your weary body.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">I do believe that you could rest even when working for you are not dealing with things by yourself.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Mathew 11:29, &#8220;Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me&#8221;,<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Though the text has a unique meaning, I could take a principle and apply it in this was, &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">take my advise, allow me to help you, let me give you directions and strategies and learn all these things I am teaching you<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;.

The Lord is saying, I will take the yoke you are used to and I will give you mine which is easy, I will guide you, I will be on your side and the burden I have for you is very light cause I am carrying yours which is heavy. Who can resist such an offer?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Perhaps the words of the carpenter, promising rest, is so compelling because of our endless desire and quest to rest. Do you want rest? do you know where to find rest? The Father rested and sanctified it, the Son called and offered it, will you choose to receive it? If you want to bring under control a fast paced life style, you must eliminate the unnecessary and concentrate on the necessary by wanting to be where God wants you to be. My soul is at rest, my mind is renewed, there is no greater joy than Him being present.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:85%;\">Thanks<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:85%;\">Evans<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 2:1-3, &#8221; \u2026 Then God blessed the seventh day and satisfied if, because in it He rested&#8230;&#8221; In this fast-paced world in which we live, the very thing we need to do is what we often don&#8217;t do: We need to simply sit still and open our heart to the counsel of [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1003","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-gb","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1003","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1003"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1003\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1003"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1003"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1003"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1002,"date":"2008-06-19T06:59:00","date_gmt":"2008-06-19T13:59:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/06\/19\/freed-indeed\/"},"modified":"2008-06-19T06:59:00","modified_gmt":"2008-06-19T13:59:00","slug":"freed-indeed","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/06\/19\/freed-indeed\/","title":{"rendered":"Freed Indeed"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span class=\"gmail_quote\"><\/span><\/p>\n<div align=\"justify\">\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Good morning,<\/span><\/i> <\/p>\n<p><i><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">John 8:36, &#8220;Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed&#8221;<\/span><\/b><\/i> <\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">I ask myself this question, can born again Christians be demon possessed?

What is the difference between the two?, to be possessed is to be owned by someone or to be controlled, dominated, in other words, be a master&#8217;s slave. Born again Christians are not owned or mastered by demons, they do not belong to the devil,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">1John 4:4, &#8220;Ye are of God little children and have overcome them: because greater is He that is in you than he (demons) that is in the world<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;.

Oppressed is to keep down by severe and unjust use of force or authority. It is to weigh heavily, to overwhelm with an aim to crush. The work of the devil and his demons on Christians is to keep them down, accuse them, use force and authority to make sure he is down. He goes about putting heavy things on the back of Christians to overwhelm them. He is constantly looking for loop holes to come in and oppress but thanks be to God for a strategy to overcome,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">1Peter 5:8, &#8220;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion, walks about seeking souls he may devour&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Being sober is being aware of the tactics of the enemy and when he strikes. Being vigilant is always being alert cause as we have seen, he is always walking about trying to find those who are not sober and vigilant. He is roaring as (like) a lion, that means that he is not the lion but he is doing it like one. This can be looked at in two ways, when he roars like a lion, if you are not careful, you might think that he is the lion and blame Christ for all that you are going through. The bible says,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;My sheep knows my voice<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">therefore we have to distinguish between who roars like the lion and who is the Lion<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Jesus Christ is the LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH!!!<\/span><\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Why is this so important? because we were not called into bondage but into freedom and freedom only comes from and through Jesus Christ. Every one at times get oppressed through failures, sickness, confusion, frustrations, bitterness etc. You want to be free but can&#8217;t seem to find that freedom. Here is how the freedom comes about,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Isaiah 10:27, &#8220;It shall come to pass in that day that his burden will be taken away from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck and the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;. We have a burden of heaviness laid on us by the enemy to oppress us, the bible says that it has to be taken off the shoulder. The yoke is the next in line cause when you are oppressed, the enemy tries very hard to lead you to his ways and you are fighting to walk in God&#8217;s ways. So the yoke has to be taken off. Here is the key, &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;, if you take off the yoke and put it aside, it&#8217;s easy for it to be slipped back. If you break the yoke, there is a possibility that it can put back together but if you destroy it, case closed!!! Look at even documents, if the evidence is destroyed, nothing can be done to bring them back but if you just tear them into pieces, it&#8217;s easy to try and put it back together and make some sense out of it.

He answered him with a question, &#8220;<b>Why do you call me good?&#8221;<\/b> I believe Jesus wanted to challenge this man to see far beyond the natural Man, to a supernatural God. He was no ordinary Man and could not be in the same level with this man to be called good. If he called him good, was he refereeing to Jesus as God?

He says,<b> vs. 17, &#8220;\u2026but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments&#8221;.<\/b> It&#8217;s my humble opinion that Jesus was trying to strip this man of his self righteousness ultimately that he will see his need for a Savior. The first thing He told him, keep the commandments to have eternal life. Upon hearing this, this man would have said, I&#8217;m unable to keep the commandments that are summed up in loving the Lord with all your heart and soul, and loving your neighbors as much as you love yourself. But as I mentioned before, he came with his bag of good things if asked, he was ready to produce. Jesus told him to keep the commandments and he asked, which ones. Brilliant Jesus first gave him 5 horizontal commandments, commandments in relation to man, loving his neighbor as much as himself, shall not murder, commit adultery, steal, lie, honor etc. Out of his bag of good things, he said in<b> vs. 20, &#8220;\u2026all these things I have kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?&#8221;.<\/b> If this is what it took to have eternal life, he had just passed the test but to keep the commandments, you had to keep all of them.

The bible says in<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">John 3:19, &#8220;and this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness, rather than light, because their deeds were evil<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:#000000;\">&#8220;. This is one of the reasons people are not seeking to be saved, they love darkness and they don&#8217;t want the light to expose it so they will not ask.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">I will share another reason why people don&#8217;t ask shortly. Mathew 19, Mark 10 and Luke 18 tells about a young rich ruler who out of nowhere came to Jesus and asked,<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">&#8220;\u2026Good<\/span> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?&#8221;<sup><\/sup><\/span><\/b><sup><\/sup><sup> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"color:#000000;\">. There is a lot to chew out of this first line. If someone came and asked me how they can receive eternal life, I would really rejoice for I have never had anyone do that. Anyway, we would ask ourselves many questions as to the intentions of this young rich ruler. Mark the things that describe him, he was young, and rich and a ruler. He had everything going for him. What would make a man with his status seek to know what he was to do to have eternal life? Perhaps he wanted to make sure he got it right, or he wanted to see if Jesus really knew what it took to have eternal life or maybe he was really seeking the truth.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Look at his how he addresses Jesus,<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">&#8220;Good Teacher\u2026&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:#000000;\">, his introduction of Jesus already raises a red flag. First, Jesus was more than a good teacher, He was (is) the Messiah, the Savior of the world. He was God in the flesh and no one who has a wrong understanding of who He is can be saved. Today in talking to people, they are ok saying Jesus was a good teacher, a good prophet, a good man and even Son of God. See their faces change when you declare that Jesus Christ was (is) God. Then the rich man asked<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">&#8220;&#8230;what<u> good thing<\/u> shall do that I may have eternal life?<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:#000000;\">&#8221; This is the second red flag, this man thought you had to do good things to have eternal life, he just was wasn&#8217;t sure of what &#8220;good&#8221; thing he had to do.<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">Romans 3:20<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:#000000;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> corrects our understanding by saying, &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Therefore<\/span> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"color:#000000;\">by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight&#8230;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:#000000;\">&#8220;. He had a bag of what he called good, he was ready to go into his bag of what he called good things the moment Jesus would tell him of what they were. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;color:#000000;\">You may be reading this devo and you are not saved or soundly saved and like the rich young ruler, you have a wrong understanding of who Jesus is, or you may be thinking that you have good things to be saved, that it&#8217;s just a matter of time before He tells you what these good things are so that you can pull them out of your bag. We&#8217;ll find out how Jesus dealt with his potential convert.

Then he tells him, &#8220;<b>lay hold on eternal life&#8221;,<\/b> to remind him to cling on to the gift of eternal life he had received to which he made the declaration in the presence of many witnesses. Paul is advising Timothy all these that in the long run, he may look back at the many battles he endured and rejoice over them.

He fought a good fight by enduring life obstacles, he finished his race without giving up and fainting on the way. I can&#8217;t tell what speed he was doing but the speed did not matter, the fact that he finished the race shows how faithful he was. And most definitely, he kept the faith (salvation). <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><i><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">It&#8217;s worth fighting the good fight of faith even when everything around you is falling apart. Everything can be taken away but your faith unless you give it away in other words let go, will remain. It&#8217;s not how you start that matters, it&#8217;s how you fight, endure and finish. Any one can start a marathon but the question is, who will endure to the finish line? Can you say in the long run,<b> &#8220;I fought a good fight, I finished the race, I kept the faith<\/b>?

And Joshua went to<u> Him<\/u> and said to<u> Him<\/u>, &#8220;Are<u> You<\/u> for us or for our adversaries?<\/b>&#8220;. It&#8217;s is very important to know who is on your side and who is not. The reason is simple, he who is on your side believes in you and the ability you have and knows who you are to be able to help you do the right thing. In my text, Joshua was about to go to battle, he sees a Man ready for battle. Just looking at the scripture and how the words have been placed, I am utterly convinced he saw the Lord. Read the verse yourself and you will see these first words in caps<b> Man, You, His, Him.<\/b> Almighty God is referred to us here. What a comfort to know that the person whom you thought was against you is for you. It&#8217;s like I have come because You need me.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Two things to bring to our attention &#8220;<u><\/u><u><b>GOD BE FOR US&#8221;<\/b><\/u><b><\/b> AND &#8220;<u><\/u><u><b>GOD BEFORE US&#8221;<\/b><\/u><b><\/b>.<b> Romans 8:31, &#8220;What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?<\/b>. I know of many who feel God is against them. It&#8217;s disturbing to me because I understand that whoever is against you has an aim to destroy you by all means. I believe that the reason why some people think this way is because they called on God for something but He never came through for them or God allowed something to happen in their lives and to them that was a sign of God being against them. Suppose we asked our earthly father to do something and he did not, does that mean he is against us or does not love us? he is for us, meaning he is on our side looking for our well being. The bible says, &#8220;<b>If God be for us<\/b>&#8221; which is interesting because it does not say &#8220;<b>When God is for us<\/b>&#8220;. Using &#8220;<b>WHEN<\/b>&#8221; would imply that God is not ready yet to be for us for He is in the process of being ready. For sure we know God is always ready. The word &#8220;<b>IF<\/b>&#8221; drops the ball in our court because we are the ones who allow God to be for us. Joshua understood this concept because there was a Man (God) who showed up ready but through the question he asked Him showed that the Man was ready to be on someone&#8217;s side and that was Joshua&#8217;s. So it&#8217;s Joshua who needed to allow Him to be for them.

Look at how our thoughts (mindset) lead to our destinies:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<p align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">&#8220;Whoever sows a thought, reaps an action; Whoever sows an action; reaps a habit;<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Whoever sows a habit; reaps a lifestyle; Whoever sows a lifestyle; reaps a destiny.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">If not the prophet was not 100% accurate he would be stoned to death as a false prophet.  We cannot cease spending time with God and expect to have a true godly &amp; spiritual reputation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><b>The second component to having eyesight like Elisha is to not to have fear and unbelief, but trust and faith in the Lord (see v. 14-16)<\/b> The Armean king sent an army to capture Elisha by a surprise NIGHT ATTACK!  However, Elisha received revelation from God, about the attack.  You see the eyesight of the ungodly is warped, because they can never see as God sees and shows to His servants.  Elisha&#8217;s servant is nervous as he sees the city surrounded army of horses and chariots, and therefore asks, &#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;  The situation did not look promising and the young discipleship I can imagine had &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna die&#8221; in his head.

His prayer was short, specific, and in faith.  Elisha saw the angelic host of horses and chariots of fire that his disciple didn&#8217;t see, yet it was certainly there! Through prayer, the young disciple gained Elisha&#8217;s perspective on things and turn, God&#8217;s perspective.  The Lord opened his eyes, and he saw the angelic army surrounding them.

These men and women are trained to look for things that others would not even consider for a moment. It is amazing that two people can look at the exact same thing and see different things. What do you read in the following example: &#8220;<b>GODISNOWHERE<\/b>&#8220;? Did you see God is no where? Many people initially see this. However, can you see that it also reads God is now here? Perhaps you just said yourself, &#8220;WOW,&#8221; I didn&#8217;t see both statements. In the same light there can be two people that look into God&#8217;s Law, into God&#8217;s Word, and not see the same thing. The Psalmist prefaces his statement open my eyes\u2026, with &#8220;Deal generously with Your servant, so that I might live; then I will keep Your word.&#8221; He desired that God deal liberally, open-handed, with great kindness, so that he might live, because if God is not dealing kindly with him how can he live? As God is dealing kindly and generously with him he will keep God&#8217;s Word. He calls himself God&#8217;s servant, and a servant does what the Master says. Three times, The Lord called out to Samuel and initially Samuel didn&#8217;t realize the voice of the Lord, but when it was told to him by Eli that the voice was God&#8217;s voice, he was to respond accordingly to God. Therefore the very next time this took place the Bible says, &#8220;<sup>\ufeff<\/sup>Now the Lord came and stood and called as at other times, &#8220;Samuel! Samuel!&#8221; And Samuel answered, &#8220;<u><i><b>Speak, for Your servant hears<\/b><\/i><\/u> (1 Sam. 3).&#8221; The Psalmist in this same humble attitude desired his eyes to be open, so that he might see the wonderful things in God&#8217;s law! Everything in God&#8217;s law in God&#8217;s Word is wonderful. Just think of the word &#8220;<u><b>wonderful<\/b><\/u><u>&#8220;<\/u><u><b> which means &#8220;full-of-wonder<\/b><\/u>.&#8221; Proverbs 30:18\u201319 tells us, &#8220;There are<u> <\/u><u>three<\/u><u><i> <\/i><\/u><u><i>things which<\/i><\/u><u> are too<\/u><u><b> <\/b><\/u><u><b>wonderful for me<\/b><\/u>, Yes, four<i> <\/i><i>which<\/i> I do not understand:<sup> 19<\/sup>The way of an eagle in the air, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the midst of the sea, And the way of a man with a virgin. Do you comprehend these things, I think not. One cannot put the love for his or her spouse under a microscope and understand in fullness that complexities of that relationship. God&#8217;s Word is certainly full of wonder, but when one is a servant of the Master, then the Master can point out and illuminate His Word to His servant. Why is this? Because the servant (insert your name) can say, &#8220;Speak Lord, for your servant is listening\u2026open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in Your law.&#8221; The spiritual senses are engaged when receiving what God desires you to hear, to see, to know, to learn, and to do in accordance and obedience to His Word. It is one thing to hear a preacher, to read a Christian book, hear a sermon, read a devotional or article based on God&#8217;s Word, but it is an entirely more intimate experience when God shows YOU in His Word apart from someone else&#8217;s echoing of God&#8217;s Word. I have learned so much through mature Christian brothers and sisters in the Lord as well as through seasoned Christian leaders that chose to stay biblical no matter which was the &#8220;theological wind&#8221; was blowing at the time. However, I have learned most through spending time with Jesus in prayer, in Bible reading, in journaling thoughts, in memorizing His Word, in meditating on His Word, and in sharing His Word with others. God&#8217;s Word is like an archeological dig, there is so much to &#8220;unearth&#8221; or should I say &#8220;unheaven&#8221; beneath the pages of God&#8217;s Word, or rather within the pages of His Word. Reading through the beginning of Psalm 119, the longest chapter in the Bible, which is predominantly about God&#8217;s law, God&#8217;s Word, is when God showed me these great nuggets that you are reading today. It all started with this one verse that God seemed to illuminate off the page to me, and before I knew it, this message began to brew in my spirit, and then onto the computer screen. Is God&#8217;s Word being illuminated to you? If He is your Master and you are His servant then call out to him in the same attitude of Samuel and the Psalmist, &#8220;Speak Lord, for your servant is listening\u2026open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in Your law.&#8221;<\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;text-align:justify;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Seek the Lord today as a servant, when you do, I&#8217;m sure you will begin to look into God&#8217;s Word and he will illuminate things to you, that were always there, but that you have never seen before. The more I grow in God&#8217;s Word, the more this takes place. If I may, I would love to suggest this wonderful resource which will help you on this journey?

I have come to realize that many don&#8217;t progress because of what they saw in their families. For example, a man may believe that if his father cheated on his mother, most likely he might repeat the same in their own life.

How can you pick out and be in a good relationship if you never saw one acted out?. Maybe while growing up, your father left and so there was no male figure in the house to really teach you through his life style what a good husband would be. Some fathers were so dysfunctional that they left their children with no clue on how to pick the best or what a good relationship is like. Novels and movies have tried to paint a good picture full of fantasies and only showed one side of the coin. Who then do we look to teach us all we need to know? Thank God He has given us a book full of answers.<\/span><\/i><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;\" align=\"justify\"><i><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">According to a survey done on Christian women, these are the qualities a Christian woman desired of a man. 1. Committed to putting Christ first in his life, grounded in the Word, a spiritual leader, church attendance and service would be vital part of his life. 2. Able to lead, making good decisions and responsible. 3. Affectionate and loving in that he will both talk of and show his love. 4. In control of himself in the area of temper, physical violence, sexual, financial. 5. Masculine, a man who God has created him to be. 6. Attractive 7. Tender and considerate. Sensitive to the feeling of others and being unafraid to reach out and be open up in the area of communication. This one happened to be some of the most important things women expressed as their desires. Are not all these qualities addressed in the bible?<\/span><\/i><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;\" align=\"justify\"><i><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">As for the men, they desired 1. A woman committed to putting Christ first in her life. Her personal relationship with God would be strong and close. She would be actively involved in the church. 2. Submissive which is voluntary cooperation with the man&#8217;s leadership. 3. Responsive, loving and affectionate. Women to respond to their husband&#8217;s love as wives. 4. Supportive in making decisions, when succeeding or when failing miserably. Criticizing, nagging, complaining, and belittling were given as easy ways to destroy a relationship. 5. Feminine, a woman who God created her to be, Proverbs 31 woman. 6. Gentle in spirit, not physically violent, harboring hatred, bitterness, resentments or jealousy&#8217;s. Guys talked about women who are in control of their emotional lives and honest enough about negative emotions to confront their partners lovingly. 7. Attractive.<\/span><\/i><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><i>Have you read the word to know what is acceptable and prayed God&#8217;s will along those lines? If you look at the list for both men and women, there are certain qualities that differ but the one that remains the same, GOD FIRST (the foundation), His word, fellowship, church, prayers. As I mentioned earlier, God has given each of us a desire, a dream and choices.<\/i><i><b> <\/b><\/i><i><b>Proverbs 16:1, tells us &#8220;The preparation of heart belong to man, But the answer of the tongue is from God&#8221;<\/b><\/i><i>. The people who participated in the survey had their preparation they brought out but the final word has to be from the Lord. Why is it that people can desire these qualities and settle for something else? You have to do your part by praying and then let God to His part of approving. When you know what you desire and you have prayed,<\/i><i><b> <\/b><\/i><i><b>Psalm 37:7, &#8220;Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret&#8230;&#8221;<\/b><\/i><i> <\/i><i>Resting in the Lord mean calmed down knowing that the Maker does not slumber and does not make any mistakes. Waiting patiently is knowing that as He is working on your companion while working on you too. After it has been said and done, you will still need rest and patience to maintain a relationship. We have to communicate the truth to people otherwise we will be stuck with the version of the Hollywood mushroom relationships that have no foundation built on God and God given character.

When you\u2019ve prayed for companion, asked according to God&#8217;s will in line with His word, it&#8217;s hard to wait to see Him intervene. As time goes by, you feel like your patience is running out because God has not moved within the time you expected. Then you become attracted to unsaved person, pursue a relationship with them hoping God will save them and bless your relationship. I hear more of the saved dating or are in relationship with the unsaved and that amazes me for I am utterly convinced by the word of God that it&#8217;s not right. Introduction and foundation in anything is vital for a good thing to take place or even survive. <\/span><\/i><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><i><b>Any guidelines the Lord gives us is not to stop us from enjoying ourselves but to stop us from making the wrong choices and decisions that will haunt us in a long time<\/b><\/i><i>.

What I am saying, it&#8217;s not good to try and pursue a relationship with them. Why say so, what is right before God may not be right in the eyes of the unbelievers. Some unbelievers do not see anything wrong with lust, fornication, lying, putting God first, covet, in other words, breaking God&#8217;s laws is very normal to them but for the believers who know the truth, seek to please God. To be in relationship with someone who is in God&#8217;s will is the best way to go.<\/i><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><i><b>2Corinthians 6:14, &#8220;Do not be unequally yoked together with the unbelievers.

Gideon is resting at night, and God interrupts his rest with urgent orders to respond to divinely urgent news. Gideon is commanded to get up because God is going to give him the victory if he would attack immediately. Knowing Gideon\u2019s heart, God sees Gideon\u2019s fear, and responds to it with encouragement. Although faith is the opposite of fear at times we need to be navigated from one point to the other on the vehicle of encouragement. God told Gideon if you are too afraid to attack right now then spy on your enemies and eavesdrop on their conversation, you will be encouraged by what you hear.

A divided team can\u2019t stand, and a team that has no heart because it is gripped by fear has crippled themselves before engaging in the battle. At this point both armies were fearful of one another, but God was about to rip the fear from Gideon\u2019s heart and encourage him, thus replacing fear with faith. Gideon and Purah (most likely his armor-bearer) eavesdrop on the enemies camp and, \u201c<i><b>Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. \u201cI had a dream,\u201d he was saying. \u201cA round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp.

Gideon was the leader of Israel\u2019s army, and God would decrease the size of Gideon\u2019s army with a battle just on the horizon.  The Lord\u2019s instructions probably came as a complete shock to Gideon.  I can imagine the he was confused upon hearing, \u201c<b><i>You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands<\/i><\/b><i><\/i>.\u201d  That doesn\u2019t sound very sensible to me; decrease your army size, because there are too many men for battle.  Gideon\u2019s army was already outnumbered four to one.  When I was trying out for sports teams growing up, if one didn\u2019t qualify for the team they were cut from the team, so that only the best players were left to produce a winning team.  There were usually two cuts that took place.  This is what God did when he sifted Gideon\u2019s army.  God cut the first wave of people from the team by having Gideon announce, \u201c<b><\/b><b><i>Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead<\/i><\/b><i><\/i>.\u201d  The result was that \u201c<b><\/b><b><i>twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained<\/i><\/b><i><\/i>.\u201d  The first cut allowed the cowards to disqualify themselves and go back home to mommy.  Now God would have second cuts, and reduce Gideon\u2019s army even further.  A special examination or screening was set up based on the manner of water drinking among the 10,000 remaining soldiers.<b><\/b><b><i> There the LORD told him, \u201cSeparate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink.\u201d (7:4) Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.<\/i>\u201d<\/b>  Those that kneeled down to drink were cut, and those that apparently crouched down to scoop up water by using their hands as a dog uses its tongue remained. <b><\/b><b><i> The LORD said to Gideon, \u201cWith the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands<\/i><\/b><i><\/i>.\u201d  The size of the army went from 32,000 to 10,000 to a mere 300 men to fight.

Anytime someone is bleeding, they try as much as possible to stop the open wound from bleeding why? Because blood is precious, without it in the body, a person can die. What is the work of the blood that makes it precious? Blood carries gases, nutrients and waste products throughout our bodies. Blood also fights infections, heals wounds and performs many other vital functions.<u> <\/u><u>There is no substitute for blood. It cannot be made or manufactured.<\/u><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">In the old testament time, there was something about the blood sacrifice. People who sinned gave blood sacrifice of bullocks, sheep and goats to make atonement for their souls. All this pacified God but did not satisfy Him. The blood in the old testament only covered sin until the Lamb of God, who was, who is and is to come came down on the face of the earth wrapped in flesh and blood and offered Himself as a sacrifice by shading His blood precious blood on the cross for the sins of the world. He was the offerer and the offering and He came to take care of what other bloods only covered. While hanging on the cross, a Roman soldier pierced Him on the side and out of His side came water and blood for the sins of world. His blood was so powerful that it screened our sins and washed away our sins. \u201c<b>What can wash away my sin?, nothing but the blood of Jesus; what can make me whole again?, nothing but the blood of Jesus; Oh precious is that flow, that makes me white as snow; no other fount I know, nothing but the blood of Jesus\u201d<\/b> Not only did the blood take care of what we did, it also took care of what we could have done, what we thought about doing. If it were not for the blood, think about it for a moment, do you know who you would be today? I don&#8217;t know who and where I would be today had it not been for the blood. For sure I would be bleeding to death in my sins. The bible makes is clear, \u201c<b>The life of the flesh is in the blood<\/b>\u201d and the life of the gospel is in the blood.<b> <\/b><b>Hebrews 9:22, \u201c\u2026without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d (NIV). I can now understand why Jesus came as flesh and blood, It was necessary for Him to shed His blood for our sin, the reason He is called the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world.<\/b><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">The life of the flesh is in the blood, if the body stops functioning like Abel\u2019s, the blood will still speak out of the body because the blood can speak. And God hears the blood when it speaks. The devil knows the blood is against him and he knows that he has no power over those with the blood of the Lamb marked on the doorpost of their hearts. I remember a another song we sang,<b> <\/b><b>\u201cI\u2019m gonna hide right under the blood where the devil can do me no harm\u201d. \u201cThere is power, wonder working power in the blood\u201d<\/b> The blood of Jesus is what ties the blacks and the whites together, the rich and the poor, the young and the old.

Meaning that the angel of death, destruction, confusion shall have no power over you when you are under the blood. The devil is extremely afraid of the blood cause the blood is against Him. So hide right under the blood where the devil can do you no harm. I also believe that when God sees the blood on us, He will bless us, minister to us and encourage us.

Watch this closely, the first two look severe and would mean men would also be involved in the sense that if there was famine, they could look to other men to get food, second, if left in the hands of the enemy, that would mean destruction for him.

Times when you don\u2019t feel like praying like you should or reading the word and even witnessing like you should. Life goes through different seasons and each season has a way to prep you for the next season. Seasons change from time to time and as human beings, we have learn to adapt in different seasons using the necessary tools suitable for that season so that in the long run you can move to the next season. We don&#8217;t quit functioning because we are in the middle of winter, we continue to function without using the same strategy we used to function during summer time. As believers we also have seasons and every season presents it&#8217;s case in a different way and we got to learn through the word of God on how to adapt and function in these seasons without retreating or surrendering for they will always be there. Our seasons may be different but we all have seasons. Seasons of dry periods, seasons of spiritual prosperities, seasons of blessings, seasons of change to name a few. Every believer should know the season in which they are in, maintain their composure, learn everything that God would want you to learn in that season and trust God for the next season. How you deal with one season will definitely affect how you will deal with the next season. Someone said,<b> <\/b><\/i><b><i>&#8220;if you are in a tough season, don&#8217;t pray God get me out of it but rather pray, Lord what do you want me to learn from it&#8221;.<\/i><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Section1\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><i>In my text, Cain killed his brother Abel in Genesis 4 and God told him of what would become of him,<b> <\/b><\/i><b><i>Gen 4:16&amp;17 says, &#8220;The Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod&#8221;<\/i><\/b><i>.

They had been in a season of mourning for the lost of Abel their youngest son and that season was gone and God gives them a substitute to replace what they lost. As you read the genealogy of Adam, to Seth, you will see that many generations passed before we are told about a man by the name of Enoch. Something interesting in<b> <\/b><\/i><b><i>Genesis 4:26, &#8220;And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he named him Enosh<\/i><\/b><i>.<b><u> <\/u><\/b><\/i><b><i><u>the men began to call on the name of the Lord<\/u><\/i><\/b><i>&#8220;, I believe that from Seth&#8217;s descendants, man began to come back to the Lord. We are not told much about Enoch all we know of is that<b> <\/b><\/i><b><i>he walked with God for 300 years (Gen 5:22).<\/i><\/b><i> If there was anything that was recorded about Enoch is the fact that he walked with God in other words he had pleased the Lord in his life.

Many people in the bible had something about them, and God to favored them. Abraham was known as the Father of faith and a friend of the Lord, David known as a man after God&#8217;s own heart, Noah was known as the man who worked with God and many more and even though they also had their own failures and weakness, they maintained what we still talk about today about them.  They had their different seasons but they did not give up.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Section1\" align=\"justify\"><i><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">I want us to understand that their walks were not easy but they were determined to be the best they could by God\u2019s help. Growing and walking with the Lord is not easy and for a man to walk with the Lord 300 years faithfully is something that I wouldn&#8217;t take lightly. Enoch had only one important thing he left behind and that is the testimony that he had walked, pleased, served, worshiped the Lord. In as much as we have our own seasons and got to deal with them, we can a build a testimony that through it all,  we walked with the Lord. A testimony that even the unbelievers can see, a testimony that stands through the trials and fire. Job had this kind of testimony that though he went through trying seasons, he still maintained his integrity. How I pray that we will walk with the Lord every single day regardless of the season or the cycles. We got to be willing to maintain that walk for it&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got, let&#8217;s build testimonies that speaks even in our absence.

I have seen the miracles of healing, financial provisions, restoration but none of them speak volumes like the miracle of seeing a lost soul turning to Jesus right before your eyes as the Lord works the miracle through as you share the gospel with them. I encounter such miracles every time I step out on the streets to share the gospel. Last week, my friend AJ and I were on the streets sharing the gospel, we stopped at haircut shop that had just been opened, met the owner (Bruno) a big Italian dude, very sarcastic in his talk, cared nothing about where he will spend eternity. As I gently began to share with him the law, righteousness, judgment, hell, heaven, the cross etc, all of a sudden, the Holy Spirit captured this man&#8217;s heart, humbled him, convicted him while  he stood to listen to the whole gospel. Even when one of his customers came in, he asked him to give him a few minutes to hear this important message. Is that a miracle or what? I could tell you of a young man Miguel who I shared with yesterday. He was about to play basketball with his friends but then stopped to listen to the whole gospel. Even when his friends told him he would not play anymore if he did not come immediately, he said, &#8220;this is too important to play&#8221;  and he did not play. I have so many stories of miracles after miracles where I spoke to people on the streets who are hard cores, loud mouthed, blasphemous, God hater&#8217;s and then see their hearts softens and they become humble, got convicted, stop justifying themselves and received the good news. And their response, &#8220;I got to make things right with God&#8221; and later be thanked for being out there to share the gospel. We may wait forever for such people to come to church to hear the gospel, we have to go out there and harvest them for Jesus. He has prepared them as ripe harvest just waiting to be harvested.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000000;\">Brothers and sisters, only God can perform such a miracle but only when we are available to be used of Him. I am always scared going out there but after it&#8217;s been said and done I always come back rejoicing. Heaven rejoices over the miracle of a lost soul being saved and you and I can be part of that miracle.

Absolute truths are fought to be relative. \u201cYou stick to your opinions and I will stick to mine&#8221; is what we hear.

I want us to look at his preparation that ultimately I may link it with the top theme verse. vs.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">1Sam 17:34, &#8220;But David said to Saul, &#8220;Your servant used to keep his father&#8217;s sheep and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, I went after it and struck it, and delivered the lamb from it&#8217;s mouth&#8230;&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Here is David doing preparation by recalling how God had given him victory over the lion and the bear while he was just but a boy. He had believed God for greater things even in his youth and standing before a king and reciting his past victories were not foolish to him.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\"> 2Tim 1:12, &#8220;For the which course I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not a shamed: for I know whom I have believed and<u> I am persuaded that He is able<\/u> to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">He knew that he had to suffer rejection and at times fear but he concluded that he will not be a shamed to share what God had done in his life why, because he was<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">persuaded<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">. Persuade means to convince or win over. Doubt and fear may have tried to rise up in his life, but then what God had done in life had persuaded him to trust Him even more and he was ready to commit this next challenge to Him.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\"> Romans 10:10, &#8220;For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">One can only believe in his\/her own heart in other words having faith unto righteousness that can be interpreted as virtue, morality, decency, uprightness etc and where does all this come from?, from the Lord. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><i><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">1Samuel 17:45&amp;46 &#8220;Then David said unto the Philistine, &#8220;You come to me with a sword, with a pear, and with javelin.<\/span><\/b><b><u> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">But I come to you in the name of the Lord of host<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.

One&#8217;s confession is a total agreement with what has been said and supports it 100%. I believe in healing, I will confess healing; I believe in salvation, I will confess salvation; I believe that the Lord protects me everyday, I will confess that the Lord protects me every day. The devil will try and plant doubt inside to overtake the trust, your confession will begin to pump boldness and courage to fight back.  I believe that as David was speaking these words, his boldness, courage and trust increased for there is power when we speak the truth. The woman with the issue of blood kept on pumping faith, boldness and courage through her confession,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;If I may but touch the hem of His garment, I know I will be made whole&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">She did not say it ones, she kept on repeating it to herself over and over.

A barren woman in the old days and in some societies was considered cursed and rejected by their tribesmen. A woman with the ability to have children especially boys was considered a blessed woman and respected because of the fruits in her womb. And we see about 5 women with the same problem,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Genesis 11:30, &#8220;But Sarah was barren; she had no child, Genesis 29:31&#8243;&#8230;but Rachel was barren&#8221;, 1Samuel 1:5, &#8220;But to Hannah he would give a double portion, &#8230; although the Lord had closed her womb (barren)&#8221;,<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\"><\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Judges 13:2, &#8220;&#8230;whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had no children&#8221;, Luke 1:7, &#8220;But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">What a state to be in, everyone is nurturing their babies, these few women had no babies to call their own. A lot of &#8220;I wish&#8221; must have ran through their minds, questions as to why would a loving God leave them in conditions such as this. Some had rivals provoking them over and over again. They had everything according to man&#8217;s standards but not satisfied. They must have wondered, where is every good gift and every perfect gift that the Father sends from above?. Have you ever wondered and asked God how come everyone gets their gift but you? You ask, what is wrong with me that I don&#8217;t have it? Everyone seem to be benefiting from their gifts but me, I have people provoking me in different ways but are You are quiet not saying anything. I have called on You to do something about my situation but not a word.

These women had needs and when they least expected to be visited, that is the time God visited them. God visited them at a time when what He wanted to do was really needed. Through promise, God gave them gifts by opening their wombs to give birth and each of them reacted differently.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">God&#8217;s promises are ye and amen<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">and when you list expect it and when you feel you are not qualified to have it, that is when He comes to do it, why?, because He has the ability to do it when no man can do it.<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Ordinary women receiving extraordinary gifts<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">. Their one gift made them to be known and greater things did their children do. Look at some of the women who had their wombs opened, they had so many children but they were not used in a mighty way like the children of the mothers who were once barren. Rachel had Joseph, Hannah had Samuel, Elizabeth had John the Baptist, Sarah had Isaac and the list continues. What they received were not of man but of God. The grounds which could not bring forth, by God&#8217;s grace, they brought forth. I look at many years ago I was also barren in many areas, I wanted to be used of God but because I did not have the gift of Anointing in me through the help of the Holy Ghost, I watched people and even guys of my age do exploits for the Kingdom. Later when God visited me, in my unworthiness, He entrusted me with the spiritual gifts of praying, teaching, preaching and leading. An ordinary man receiving extraordinary gifts. God&#8217;s gifts are for a reason and not for a season!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">I wondered what would cause God to use these ordinary women and this is what I came up with and also looking at my life. First, they were<\/span><u> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">humble women<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">1Peter 5:6, &#8220;Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that<\/span><\/b><b><u> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">He may exalt you in due season&#8221;<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">, their humility caused them to be exalted. Second, they<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">were willing<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">to receive the gift even after being given tough conditions to abide by. Third, they<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">were available<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">to be used to bring forth servants of God. Fourth, they<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">were faithful<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">to carry these babies in their wombs and brought them forth and natured the babies till God was ready to use them. They were disciplined to protect the seeds in their wombs without aborting them. I know people who have aborted the gifts that were deposited in their wombs.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Having a gift in you requires work to keep it alive and in shape<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">. Pregnant women don&#8217;t just sit and wait to deliver, they take good care of themselves, they watch what they eat, where they go, who they hang out with for what they are carrying is precious. I also know people who want something to be deposited in their barren wombs but they do not want to be humble, willing, available and faithful. I wouldn&#8217;t pray for a gift I&#8217;m not willing to sacrifice for. Any gift comes with a responsibility therefore my prayer everyday is that Lord I want to be disciplined to protect every gift you have invested in me for I do not want to loose any gift. I will humble myself, be willing, available and faithful, deposit more gifts. I will do whatever it takes to protect them how about you?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:85%;\">Thanks<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:85%;\">Evans<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, James 1:17, &#8220;Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of light, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning&#8220; We looked father and son with gifts but when they were in foreign land, they could not protect and defend their gifts because of [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-928","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-eY","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/928","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=928"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/928\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=928"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=928"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=928"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":927,"date":"2008-04-29T20:19:00","date_gmt":"2008-04-30T04:19:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/04\/29\/disciplined-to-protect-part-1\/"},"modified":"2008-04-29T20:19:00","modified_gmt":"2008-04-30T04:19:00","slug":"disciplined-to-protect-part-1","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/04\/29\/disciplined-to-protect-part-1\/","title":{"rendered":"Disciplined To Protect, Part&nbsp;1"},"content":{"rendered":"<div dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Good morning,<\/span><\/i> <\/div>\n<p><i><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">James 1:17, &#8220;Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of light, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">We love receiving gifts.

How many times do we struggle to run a round to find that good gift that we hope it will make happy whoever we give it to? The moment you sense a sign of dissatisfaction, you feel disappointed. We get gifts mostly on certain occasions. If you gave someone a gift, the first question that might run through their mind is, &#8220;What is the occasion?&#8221;. God does not give us gifts based on occasions, it\u2019s based on His love for us.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">, what are some of these gifts, eternal life, Holy Ghost, hope, peace, joy, strength, courage, wisdom, life, marriage, job, ministry, calling, kids, home, health, confidence you name it are gifts from above. All these gifts have two things in common, they are good and they are from above.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Psalm 124:8, &#8220;Our help (gift) is in the name of the Lord, Psalm 121:1, &#8220;I will lift up my eyes unto the hills, from whence come my help (gift).<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Already we have established that gifts are things bestowed and not earned and if you look at your life closely. For a minute forget about what you\u2019ve not received and concentrate on the gifts you\u2019ve received. See if you ever qualified for any of those gifts? Every gift needs to be protected by all means.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Let me introduce two men, very much related, father and son who received gifts from God but something happened that I will touch on. In Genesis 12:10- Abram (Abraham), he was 75 years old married to Sarai (Sarah). Abram had received a gift from heaven by the name of Sarai and even in her old age, she still looked young and beautiful, here is what the bible says about her.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Genesis 12:11, &#8220;And it came to pass when he was close to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, &#8220;<\/span><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Indeed I know that you are a woman of beautiful countenance<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">I believe the gift God gives, He will preserve, nature and care for. So Abram thought the Egyptians might kill him for his wife. He then convinced Sarai to pretend to be his sister. Here is a man who was suppose to protect his wife from anyone but because he cared more about his self image, he neglects the task to protect the gift bestowed upon him. He cares more about what people will think than what he knows is right. He is selfish for he is not taking into consideration that the men will try to lay their hands on Sarai. It&#8217;s like saying that as long as we are in the church I will let everyone know that you are a gift to me but the moment we are out there, I will change the way we relate. Sounds like something very familiar, as long as I am in the church, let every one see Jesus in me but the moment I&#8217;m out there, I may not want to be identified with Him cause what will people think?. Abram almost lost his wife because Pharaoh fell for her but God protected Abram&#8217;s gift from the vultures by bringing calamities in the family of Pharaoh until he released her without touching her. Thought Abram would learn his lesson but not quite,<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\"> Genesis 20:1, &#8220;And Abraham journey from there to the south, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur&#8230;.vs. 2, &#8220;Now Abraham said of Sarah his wife,<\/span><\/b><b><u> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;she is my sister&#8221;<\/span><\/u><\/b><u><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">.<\/span><\/u><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">And Abimelech King of Gerah sent and took Sarah<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">&#8220;. For the second time he introduces Sarah after their names changed as his sister. I&#8217;m wondering, what could have been going through Sarah&#8217;s mind? \u201cmy husband who is suppose to be my protector and defender is not doing his job, instead he keeps on presenting me as someone I&#8217;m not\u201d. Once again God protects Sarah from the hand of king Abimelech by sending a dream to stop him from sinning. Abraham almost had two kings sin because of his stand but God stopped the kings from sinning and protected Sarah once again. Then here comes his son after many years in king Abimelech&#8217;s kingdom. Isaac was married to Rebekah who the bible says was beautiful to behold.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Genesis 26:6, &#8220;So Isaac dwelt in Gerar, vs. 7 And the men of the place asked for his wife. And he said,<\/span><\/b><b><u> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">She is my sister<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">, &#8220;for he was afraid to say, &#8220;she is my wife&#8221;, because he thought, &#8220;lest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Even in the case of Isaac, God protected Rebekah from being touched by other men.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">What I&#8217;m I saying? Good gifts ought to be protected at all cost and by all means regardless of time or place. Man of integrity will talk highly about their wives wherever they go, they will defend them, they will protect regardless of the cost. They will not be a shamed of who they are. I believe that when you have received a gift regardless of what it is, you will take good care for it for you do not want to disappoint the Giver. Could it be possible that many don&#8217;t get more gifts because they are careless with what they received? The more disciplined we become to protect that which is bestowed upon us, the more we can be trusted with more. Be disciplined to protect every gift bestowed upon you.<\/span> <\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:85%;\">Thanks<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:85%;\">Evans<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, James 1:17, &#8220;Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of light, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning&#8220; We love receiving gifts.

I fear conflicts by all means, adversities is another one, I do fear rejection, I fear not being able to make it and I fear failing. Anyone with me in this? I don&#8217;t like being in positions of not knowing what to do even when there is something that can be done. Not seeing something that I should have seen that someone comes to point it out. If it happens frequently, you will feel frustrated. I have come to discover that if I did something the wrong way, it might take me several attempts to make it right but that would mean more mistakes before it becomes right.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Let me cover adversities today as I believe adversities are good for us. Here are some words related to adversities, hardships, difficulty, danger, harsh conditions, hard times, misfortune. I&#8217;m not saying that adversities are nice, they are like medication good for our health if we let them be. One preacher said, &#8220;<u><\/u><\/span><u><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Many have never allowed problems to work for them&#8221;<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">and this is true,<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">instead of it working for them, it&#8217;s working them, destroying them<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">. Romans 8:28 always come into perspective for it works whether on good times or bad times. If there was a way to avoid adversities, I would be the first one to avoid them for it&#8217;s not fun yet it works for our good. Job tells us in<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Job 13:15, &#8220;Though He slay me yet I will trust Him, I will maintain mine own ways before Him&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Job did not request for adversities but he faced them and it made Him stronger, it taught him how to trust more, taught how to react, and taught him that God is the Boss and he is nothing without God. Adversities taught him to trust and maintain his ways before God. He also says in<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Job 23:10, &#8220;He knows the way that I take, after He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">What a bold statement in times of adversities, some would have complained and cursed God. Job understood that God knew the way His servant takes and that is the path of purity, faith, trust, humility, confidence in Him and what he is saying is if God can give him grace and strength to go through this test, ge will come forth as gold. They say that for the gold to be purified and all the other elements to be taken off, it has to be taken through the fire, why? because the gold can survive the fire when the other elements will be consumed in it. The other elements don\u2019t turn into gold, they get out of the way for gold to be seen.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">There are four ways to respond to adversities, you can<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Maximize<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\"> it<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Minimize it,<\/span><\/b><b><u> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Advertise<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\"> it or<\/span><u> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Analyze<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\"> it.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">Maximizing it is exaggerating and putting more into it than what is already there. Being destroyed by something that hasn&#8217;t even happened yet or something that has just started. For example, someone could have a headache to them that could be too big, the way they talk about it could make it extremely big and impossible to deal with. This is because they are putting more into it than what is already there. Maximizing it is trying to understand it with a lot of why did this happen to me? what did I do wrong? why me?. Minimizing is the attitude of not trying to make a big deal out of it. It looks terrible but it&#8217;s not that bad as I thought or suppose. The problem with minimizing it is trying to cover it up when you got to deal with it. Advertise it is very lethal for you want the whole world to know you are dealing with problems. The way you appear, the way you talk, the way you act is advertising to everyone that are dealing with stuff hoping someone will join you in your pity party. Analyzing it is the best way to go about it. This is extracting useful information from it and knowing that things don&#8217;t just happen. There are things we got ourselves into that brought adversities and now we got to learn from our mistakes so that we don&#8217;t have to repeat them again. There are things that happen that we have no control over and yet there are things that we could learn from. Job did not do anything wrong but the accuser of the brethren approached God and said Job&#8217;s reason for serving God was because of what he had. Just to say something,<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">God does not try anyone<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">,<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">He may allow but He is not the author of it<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">. In this case, God allowed Satan to try Job but to a limit. The limit was to take everything that he had but not His life. God will allow but He will control the thermostat. He will not give us more than we can handle. Job took the time to analyze why he had to go through adversities and he got useful information that sustained him. Some of the things he learnt, never put trust in man, you can loose what you have but not God, you can truly know who your friends are, you can maximize the faith inside of you, you can be trusted with something that would kill someone else, you can learn to serve others better cause you know what people go through and many more, you can have a greater testimony. Instead of you and I crying out,<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\"> &#8220;Lord get me out of this&#8221;, our cry should be, &#8220;Lord, what can I learn from this?&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">When you and I know that adversities are good for us, you can be like David in<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">1Samuel 30:6, &#8220;&#8230;But David strengthened (encouraged) himself in the Lord his God&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;color:#000080;\">David had face so many adversities in 1Samuel 30 and his soldiers were about to stone him yet he took the liberty to encourage and strengthen himself and the soldiers who wanted to stone him. When we all face them at any time, cry if you must but let it not wear you down, encourage yourself in the Lord.

The verse begins with \u201c<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\">gathered\u201d<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\"> then \u201c<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\">in His name\u201d<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\">meaning that we have one God, when we gather in His name, we become assembled. There is no way we are going to share one God without bumping into each other and learning to walk, work and worship together. Many have gathered but have not assembled and so everything has become a routine. About five years ago I bought an entertainment center for my living room, the whole thing was in the box even though I saw the picture of what to expect, that is not how it came. They were pieces gathered in a big box. Every piece in that box was significant starting from the sideboards to the small nuts. The interesting thing about the whole thing is that all the pieces were gathered in the box but not assembled for it to be a unit. We came in as different pieces ultimately that God would make us a unit.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\">Where God brings unity in diversity.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\"> Each piece is significant and has to be fitted in it\u2019s designed place to complete the unit, no one will ever know what the Master had in mind when He brought each piece together. Fitting the pieces together calls for work.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><i><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\">1 Cor 12:12, &#8220;For the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many are one body: so is Christ&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\"> We all have different gifts. My gifts may not be your gifts and the gifts that you have may not be my gifts but these gifts are used to edify one another for the glory of God. The body has different parts, the hands, legs, mouth, ears and the rest. They all have different functions but they cannot operate effectively without each of them. One may be very small and the big one will need it and so the bible puts it clearly &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\">Behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\">The verse shows us that it&#8217;s good for brethren and not just anyone to stand work together. If it had just stopped at dwelling together, then we all could be one room and still be the same as we were by ourselves, when completed with the word &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\">In Unity&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\">, it opened our eyes to see that there is more to gathering and that it to be assembled.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:85%;\">Have you discovered the gifts that God has placed in you? these are gifts given to us to minister to one another that we may no longer just gather but assemble.<br \/>The moment you begin to use your gifts to reach out to someone, if they were in pieces, your presence and what you have to do will help assemble them or put them back together. I know I have the gift of prayer, encouraging and preaching, I want to use all these to reach out to other people because the more I use them, the more I&#8217;m put together myself and the more I get united with the people I reach out to. I don&#8217;t have the gift of singing though I love to sing, God will send someone else to minister to me in that area. When was the last time you used your gifts to reach out to someone else? when was the last time you desired not just to gather but help assemble?

Often times we rejoice over the definition. Rejoicing over who we will be until we hit the process. David was anointed (defined) next king but he was not told the process. If he knew Saul would be after his life and so are many enemies for the next 17 years before making it to the throne, maybe he would have re thought the king thing. I love definition, it\u2019s the process that either breaks you or make you and that scares me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Definition is followed by the process and the process is the tough part. Peter has a definition, the process is to bring that definition to pass. We can still see his failures yet Christ does not give up on him. The process was to sift him, identify his weakness and strengths, let him in the inner circle, develop him etc and the final hours before Jesus&#8217; crucifixion, Peter fails once again when he denies the Master three times. In as much as I believe Peter may have been impacted by the life of Christ, I believe what really impacted Peter was when Jesus, the Messiah whom they believed would come and restore the kingdom went to the cross and died for the sins of the world. Jesus said that He would destroy the temple and build it in three days referring to Himself.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">This I believe is one of the greatest episodes that transformed and revolutionized Peter, Romans 5:8, \u201c<\/span><\/b>But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.<b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\u201d. Sold out for the call<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Jesus resurrected and at some point three times asked Peter if he loved Him to me prove that Peter was ready for service. Peter had finally come through something tough, he had been in the fire of his own weakness and his own fears. He had held fast the scorching vision of Jesus&#8217; death and understood it. Jesus dying for those who did not deserve His death for He was committed. In this, Peter had been restored to love and service by the mystery of Jesus resurrection. He could now understand that the vision they heard of who the Messiah was different from what they saw and experienced. Process progressed to transformation, ready for the Master&#8217;s use. Before Jesus left the earth he told them of the comforter and in,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Acts 1:8,<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">they were reminded of it<\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> &#8220;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">;&#8221; Peter confession of his love for Christ and Christ instructions to him to feed His sheep brought him to a place where he sold himself out for the Lord. Peter was never the same again, receiving the power through the Holy Ghost marked the beginning of the fulfillment of<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Matthew 16:18. He became not only one of the most prominent of Jesus disciples but also later the leader and principle spokesman fledging Christian church. Afflictions awaited him but he would not retreat nor surrender for he was sold out to the point of death.<\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">From the beginning it sounded like a position but now he understood it\u2019s about humility and service. The bibles says in<\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> Philippians 2:7&amp;8, But He (Christ) made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, coming in the likeness of man. &#8230;He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross&#8221;,<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Peter did the same, what he experienced could not be compared to what he would go through. I so pray that our weakness and failures would not dictate what we can be when He defines us and that we would be all be sold out to the Lord leaving no room for anything else but Christ Himself and to His service.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Thanks<br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Evans<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Matthew 16:18, &#8220;And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&#8221; As I mentioned yesterday, you can be defined and not be there yet.

He is the one who tries things that no one else tries, he says things that make you wonder where that came from. One minute he is strong, the next minute he is weak. He is quick to say things he cannot defend. He shows me of his spiritual side and his human side, his strength and weakness. He is one of Jesus disciples but also a friend let on the inner circle with all his faults. He rebuked Jesus when He spoke his death, he said he would not deny Jesus and he did. He did not want Jesus to wash his feet, he walked on the water and then doubted, he spoke of making tents for Jesus, Moses and Elijah when he had nothing else to say. I would get frustrated with such a person but he is a picture of what God cannot give up on. God knows how to take junk, make it and use it. If God was to give up on us the way we give up on people, we all would be in trouble. I&#8217;m amazed that He keeps on hanging to broken vessels that are not sold out ultimately that one day they will be whole.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">This is a man who is not complete yet the Master is patient with him. The first thing that makes me believe He will be used mightily one day is when the Holy Sprit used him to define Jesus.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Mathew 16:15, &#8220;He said to them, &#8220;But who do you say that I am?&#8221; 16, &#8220;Simon Peter answered and said, &#8220;<u>You are the Christ, the Son of the living God<\/u>.&#8221; 17,&#8221;Jesus answered and said to him, &#8220;Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah,<u> for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven<\/u>&#8220;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">. In his faults and failures not even sold out, God uses him. <\/span><b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">God is not a respecter of any man but a respecter of principles<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">. The first introduction to Peter,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Matthew 16:18, &#8220;And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&#8221;. 19, &#8220;And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">&#8220;. Jesus knew who He was, the definition Peter gave of Him by the help of the Holy Spirit was not to Jesus benefit but to the disciples who needed to truly know Him. Then Jesus defines Peter who wasn&#8217;t yet what he was defined but what Jesus had envisioned for his life. How can you be defined when you are not even there yet? He is told the gates of hell shall not prevail and the next minute, the gates of hell show up right after the words of the Lord cause Peter takes Jesus aside and rebukes Him when he talked about dying and what does Jesus do, &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">23, But He turned and said to Peter, &#8220;Get behind Me, Satan!&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">. How can this be? did Jesus make a mistake defining Peter and then he fails the next minute?.<\/span><u><\/u><u><b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">You can have a definition but not sold out yet!!!<\/span><\/b><\/u><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;color:#000000;\">Sold out is having all accommodations sold especially a head of time. Someone who is sold out for Jesus has no more room for anything that is not of Him. Many times we have faults like Peter and we call it a quit, the Master has not given up on us but we have given up on Him and ourselves.

We seek first His Kingdom as we go an extra mile, lingering longer. He has found us but not we have to find Him though His presence is always with us.

This is the story about a Shunammite woman. A woman who was so humble and kind that she went out of her way to take care Elisha anytime he was in town. The bible says,<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">something I saw in this woman\u2019s life.<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">One cannot bow and serve unless they are humbled<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">and because of her humility and kindness, she received a prophesy that revealed a promise.<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">2Kings 4:16, &#8220;About this time next year, &#8220;Elisha said, &#8220;you will hold a son in your arms&#8221;.<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">See how the verse above played part in this woman\u2019s life<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">, \u201cthat He may exalt you in due season\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">. It&#8217;s in her humility and kindness that opened doors for her to be exalted in due season. . The bible says that<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">God does things in His own way and He makes all things beautiful in His time<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">and when we all learn that everything He is doing them in His time, we have no room to try and rush or dictate Him for after it has been said and done, His timing will prevail. In as much as we want and desire things according to His will, they will not come in our timing, the marriages and relationships will not come in our timing, jobs and promotions will not also come in our timing and so is even ministry. We all got to reach to that place where we can humble ourselves even with the little knowing that He will exalt us in due season. Just because according to you, time is running out does not make God&#8217;s time run out. According to men standards, it was already too late for her to be blessed but we know that God always does the impossible that men may know He has the power to do so.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">In the process of time, the Shunammite woman conceived the promised son and what a blessing it was for her and her husband. As the precious little boy was growing up and with the parents having visions and dreams for him, it happens that one day in vs. 18-, that the child complained of pain and later died on his mother\u2019s laps. A fulfilled promised is snatched by death, hopes and dreams for the boy are shattered. Exalted in due season only for it to turn into a tragedy. What can she and her husband do? Some time ago I shared on &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Don&#8217;t bury the dead yet<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">&#8220;, this woman could have been quick to bury her son and so are we, we throw in the towel to quick, casting it a side because it&#8217;s not coming out like expected. You have cried and wept over it, it has taken your strength and confidence and all you are left with is regrets to have received the blessing in the first place. Your reaction  when situations happens matters a lot,<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">vs. 21, &#8220;She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out, vs. 22,&#8221;She called her husband and said, &#8220;Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return&#8221;.<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">We have looked at<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\u201chumble yourself under the mighty hand of God<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\u201d, we have also looked at &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">That He may exalt you in due season<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\u201d, let\u2019s now look at &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">casting all your cares upon Him<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">&#8220;. She is casting all her cares upon the Lord by placing her dead child on the man of God&#8217;s bed and setting herself on a journey to find him. Yes I know that her trade mark in this passage is the fact that she can say,<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">&#8220;It&#8217;s is well&#8221;<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">but I see that she could not say these words unless she had cast her cares. She could have still held onto the dead child but that is not what she did, she gave it back to the Lord to certify that nothing else could be done and now she has the confidence to say<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">it is well<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">. You and I will find it hard to use these words as long as we are holding on to our cares. Holding onto your cares will steer you to worry, depression, confusion but the moment we give it to the Lord, you and I don&#8217;t need to worry about it anymore for our cares are in safe hands. Let God be the one to worry about it. I came across a joke a couple of years ago, a husband and wife are a sleep in bed, one day in the middle of the night, the husband wakes up and cant sleep tossing back and forth. The wife wakes up to find her worried husband smoking. So she asked him what the matter was and he explained to her that he was worried about how he was going to pay their next month&#8217;s rent. The wife gave him this advise,<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you call the landlord and let him be the one to worry about it instead of you&#8221;.<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">We worry when we can do nothing about it, why not cast it upon the Lord for He cares for us.<\/span> <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;color:#000000;\">Thanks<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-size:85%;color:#000000;\">Evans<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Peter 5:6&amp;7, &#8220;Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due season, casting all your cares upon Him, for He cares for you&#8221; Psalm 119:89 tell us that, &#8220;Forever Oh Lord, thy word is settled in heaven&#8220;, everything can change and will change but the word [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-921","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-eR","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/921","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=921"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/921\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=921"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=921"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=921"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920,"date":"2008-04-16T18:38:00","date_gmt":"2008-04-17T02:38:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/04\/16\/tolerance-part-2-by-charles-t-crabtree-submitted-by-phil-the-evangelist\/"},"modified":"2008-04-16T18:38:00","modified_gmt":"2008-04-17T02:38:00","slug":"tolerance-part-2-by-charles-t-crabtree-submitted-by-phil-the-evangelist","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/04\/16\/tolerance-part-2-by-charles-t-crabtree-submitted-by-phil-the-evangelist\/","title":{"rendered":"Tolerance, Part 2, By Charles T.

He was so tolerant of earthly things he could say, &#8220;<b>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound&#8221; (Philippians 4:12)<\/b>.<\/span> <\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Paul&#8217;s intolerance at any attempt to undermine the authority of Scripture and doctrine is well known. The first General Council in Jerusalem was to settle the role of circumcision and salvation. Paul&#8217;s intolerance of legalism kept Christ&#8217;s atonement and our salvation in the realm of faith<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:85%;\">\u2013<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">not works. This is the same apostle who wrote, &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law&#8221; (Romans 2:12<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">).<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">It does not take a great deal of spiritual acumen to ascertain the proper use of tolerance. Like loving mothers and fathers, we are tolerant and patient with our children in their normal growth and development. At the same time we are absolutely intolerant of anything or anyone who would harm them.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">My prayer is that all will realize they have not been ordained by men to preach the gospel and declare the whole counsel of God. God has ordained and placed the mantle of divine authority upon His messengers. They are to be the purveyors of truth, not the secular press or unconverted, educated geniuses, or some Eastern guru.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">It is my plea that every minister will fight the good fight of faith through a new emphasis on the apostles&#8217; doctrine and Bible theology. Our task is to build people through the systematic teaching of the Word of God, not through a convoluted philosophy and false self-image. Our task is to make certain people know God, not just feel good.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;The fear of man bringeth a snare&#8221; (Proverbs 29:25).<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Nowhere is this truth more applicable than in this day when the world is demanding we be tolerant of all kinds of perversion and false doctrine.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind&#8221; (2 Timothy 1:7).<\/span> <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">What steps should be taken to withstand the strategy of Satan to destroy our faith and still the voice of truth?<\/span> <\/p>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Know your faith. &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God&#8221; (Romans 10:17).<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Every believer, and especially every minister, needs to concentrate primarily on the Word of God and not on the words of men, even good men. Our faith grows as we eat food for faith. The renewal or addition to our faith is a daily discipline, not a weekly obligation.<\/span> <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Defend your faith. If you do not, who will? You are commanded by Scripture to<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints&#8221; (Jude 3).<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The world may call you narrow-minded or bigoted or defensive, but that is not your problem; it is theirs. It is difficult not to appear defensive when you are defending. Do not be contentious in spirit or defensive in attitude, but be strong in your defense of the gosp<\/span> <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Declare your faith. The enemy would like nothing better than to still the testimony and witness of Pentecostal people. The apostle Paul would be a bit mystified by those who call themselves Christians but are afraid to share their faith. He said,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth&#8221; (Romans 1:16).<\/span> <\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Let us not allow the words of men to cancel the Word of God. Let us not let the spirit of the age overcome the indwelling Spirit of God. Let us not let the fear of men dissuade us from obedience to God. &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord&#8221; (2 Corinthians 4:5). &#8220;But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed&#8221; (Galatians 1:8)<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">.

Crabtree, submitted by Phil the&nbsp;Evangelist"},"content":{"rendered":"<div dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Good morning<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">In the last few years, there has been great emphasis on spiritual warfare. A vast majority of Christian leaders would probably agree the focus on this subject is warranted. The New Testament uses militant language to describe our continuing battle with the enemy. Spiritual warfare is a biblical reality.<\/span> <\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">When a legitimate concern such as spiritual warfare is raised, there is an inherent danger<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:85%;\">\u2013<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">expending an inordinate amount of energy and focus on one front while neglecting an even greater threat on another.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">A powerful enemy is a skillful enemy. He not only uses firepower, but also intellectual power. A master military strategist must be a master of deceit. Without question, Satan is a powerful enemy because he is a master in the use of illusion and deception.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">One of the advantages the believer has against the devil is special insight beyond the obvious. Paul voiced this advantage in<b> 2 Corinthians 2:11: &#8220;We are not ignorant of his devices.<\/b>&#8221; The purpose of this article is to expose one of the devil&#8217;s most insidious strategies in the present spiritual conflict. It is the device called tolerance.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">One of the most effective and destructive devices of Satan is the erroneous understanding and application of tolerance in our present culture. No church is unaffected by its corrosive influence. Satan is using tolerance to intimidate the preacher, undermine scriptural authority, and render the church of Jesus Christ helpless through negative propaganda. It is essential for all Christians to be forewarned and forearmed.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The devil is presently in the greatest disarmament program in history. His goal is to disarm the Church through brainwashing believers into thinking it is not Christian to defend their faith, be salt and light, and evangelize the world.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The satanic motivation behind the modern thrust of tolerance is rebellion against God&#8217;s authority. If the devil can diminish and destroy the authoritative Word of God in the minds of people, he will have accomplished his ultimate aim<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;font-size:85%;\">\u2013<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">to exalt himself above the throne of God.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">In the Garden of Eden, Satan was planting the seeds of a demonically hybrid tolerance:<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;Hath God said\u2026for God doth know\u2026ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil&#8221; (Genesis 3:1,5)<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">. In other words, there is no longer an absolute. Man is the source of his own truth. If it is evil to you, no problem; if it is good to you, no problem. Just do not interfere with what I think. We will not have any absolute authority over us telling us what is evil or what is good.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The enemy has made progress in his deceitful use of tolerance even within the Church. More and more I hear, &#8220;We are beyond doctrine,&#8221; or &#8220;I know we don&#8217;t believe the same things, but that shouldn&#8217;t keep us from having fellowship.&#8221; The lack of concern about what things we believe or do not believe is troublesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">When someone says, &#8220;Doctrine divides,&#8221; I answer, &#8220;Of course, that is the nature of doctrine.&#8221; Doctrine is the formulation of the principles on which the Church bases its actions and policies. It is the basis of teaching and instruction. It is another term for revealed truth and, in the case of the Church, systematic theology.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The strategy of the enemy is to get the church of Jesus Christ involved in internal battles over nonessentials while meekly accepting poisoned K rations from the enemy. Some think spiritual warfare is contending for the traditions of the 1950s and 1960s while allowing eternal truth to die as the source of their spiritual lives and existence.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Jesus showed the proper use of tolerance throughout His earthly ministry: &#8220;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you&#8221;<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">(Matthew 5:44). &#8220;Judge not, that ye be not judged&#8221; (Matthew 7:1). &#8220;He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone&#8221; (John 8:7).<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\"> The list goes on and on.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The tolerance of Christ was supernatural in the realm of the physical and temporal, but His intolerance was supernatural in the realm of the spiritual and eternal.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me&#8221; (John 14:6)<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;I came not to send peace, but a sword&#8221; (Matthew 10:34)<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">.

Peter saw Jesus walking on water and desired the same. Maybe by that time Jesus had already spoken these words in<\/i><i><b> John 14:12, \u201c&#8221;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I go to the Father\u201d.<\/b><\/i><i> It&#8217;s Peter who desired to operate by faith while the rest of the disciples sat in the boat frightened. Now remember Peter was weak in many areas if you read his story but that did not stop him from believing Jesus in attempting the impossible.<\/i><i><b> With his desire and faith mixed with Jesus word, he was able to do the impossible, Mark 9:23&#8243;&#8230;all things are possible to him that believeth<\/b><\/i><i>&#8220;.

All of a sudden, they look around and get overwhelmed by the winds of life. The ship is behind them which represents where they came from, the Lord is before them who said come and because of the overwhelming situations, their focus on the Lord changes and they begin to focus on the circumstance. See walking with and towards the Lord is not easy for you got to want to. As long as Peter&#8217;s eyes were fixed on Jesus, regardless of what was around him none of that could have an effect on him but the moment he withdrew his eyes from the one who commanded him to come, doubt came in, fear, anxiety, hopelessness and that is what caused him to begin to sink. He did not just sink at once but he began to. The moment you stop reading His word in search of the truth, and you stop praying, you even stop mixing with the other believers, being in a church where you can be fed, believe me, you will begin to sink. I ask myself many questions everyday about the Lord and let me not give you an impression that I have it all together, I am struggling myself with issues but I am trying my best with God&#8217;s grace to keep my eyes focused on Him. If I give up on the Lord, where can I go?, whom can I turn to?, where will my help come from?, I can&#8217;t even hide from His presence?. In short without God in my life, I am handicapped, paralyzed, blind and dead. He is everything to me and so my prayer everyday is Lord help me keep my eyes focused on You for I do not want to sink in what other people are sinking in. This is my desire, this is my passion and I want it and I am going for it. <\/i><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"color:#333333;\"><i><b>Matthew 14:30&#8243;.. and beginning to sink he cried out saying, &#8220;Lord, save me!&#8221;.<\/b><\/i><i> Peter was a fisherman and as a fisherman, he must have known how to swim, a man of skills. On this particular day, everything he knew about could no help him, the friends whom he left in the boat could not help him the only one who could help and save him is the same one he stopped looking to. We can have all the expertise in dealing with life, but there will come a time when all you know and have will not save you, only Jesus.<\/i><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"color:#333333;\"><i><b>Mathew 14:31, &#8220;And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him&#8221;,<\/b><\/i><i> Jesus is amazing for when Peter cried out, immediately Jesus came to his rescue but wait a minute, Jesus could have stopped the wind, He could have also commanded the water not allow him to sink, he could have also called a boat or ship into existence and He could have frozen the water but He did not. Are you waiting for the Lord to change the surrounding for you to fit in as you maintain your salvation? Jesus had to change Peter for him to fit in a surrounding that was wild. And the first thing He did was stretch His hand and catch him. I bet Peter had his hands raised out for Jesus to pick him up. As long as Peter was holding on to the hand of the Master, he could not drown and if he would have thought of letting go of His hand that could have marked his end. At the time of rescue, Jesus did not change the situation but His hand was enough to keep Peter from sinking. I am glad to know that even if He did not change the situation and surrounding, He is holding my hand. I would have sank without His hand.<\/i><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#333333;\"><i>Friends if you are sinking, take a look closely and you will see the hand of the Master is stretched out to save you from sinking but you have to want it and that would mean doing your part, crying out to Him, stretching forth your hand and setting your eyes back on Him. And for those who have their hand on Jesus hand, His word for you and I is, &#8220;DON&#8217;T LET GO OFF MY HAND&#8221;.

All of a sudden, they look around and get overwhelmed by the winds of life. The ship is behind them which represents where they came from, the Lord is before them who said come and because of the overwhelming situations, their focus on the Lord changes and they begin to focus on the circumstance. See walking with and towards the Lord is not easy for you got to want to. As long as Peter&#8217;s eyes were fixed on Jesus, regardless of what was around him none of that could have an effect on him but the moment he withdrew his eyes from the one who commanded him to come, doubt came in, fear, anxiety, hopelessness and that is what caused him to begin to sink. He did not just sink at once but he began to. The moment you stop reading His word in search of the truth, and you stop praying, you even stop mixing with the other believers, being in a church where you can be fed, believe me, you will begin to sink. I ask myself many questions everyday about the Lord and let me not give you an impression that I have it all together, I am struggling myself with issues but I am trying my best with God&#8217;s grace to keep my eyes focused on Him. If I give up on the Lord, where can I go?, whom can I turn to?, where will my help come from?, I can&#8217;t even hide from His presence?. In short without God in my life, I am handicapped, paralyzed, blind and dead. He is everything to me and so my prayer everyday is Lord help me keep my eyes focused on You for I do not want to sink in what other people are sinking in.

One prophet in the bible tried to understand who God is and all He concluded was that His Wisdom cannot be fathomed, His ways are great and marvelous.

style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">In the Old Testament time, people were given laws to live by. Your living depended on whether you followed them or not. If one broke a law whose penalty was death, not only was he killed, his entire household was wiped out.  Why would God kill an entire family if only one person sinned? simple, if one sinned, the sin would linger in the family unto the generations to come and so what one member of the family did, it was bound to happen again through another generation within the family. David had lust problem, we see the same with Solomon and Abhner. These were the David&#8217;s sons, you might say that\u2019s a coincident, wait a minute, Abraham lied about his wife being his sister, not too long after, Isaac (Abraham\u2019s son) comes a long and does the same about his wife being his sister then we see Jacob (Isaac\u2019s son) lying to his father and receives a blessing meant for his brother Esau. You can see pattern the reason why God would wipe out an entire family to start a new seed. If God was to deal with us the way He dealt with the people in those times, we would all be dead. We thank God for Jesus.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">We are called to purity, something I always fear to talk about when I struggle with it myself. If you look in the bible there is not a word repeated three times in the same line like the word<b> Holy<\/b>. You see<b> holy, holy, holy<\/b> is the Lord repeated in the bible. This to me reminds me that there is much to know about who God is especially in the area of holiness. We don&#8217;t hear love, love, love or mercy, mercy, mercy. We serve a holy God to which the 24 elders in the book of Revelation bowed and<b> cried holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was who is and is to come..<\/b><\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">If we walk in the spirit, we allow ourselves not to be in the flesh for the flesh craves for the things of the world while the Spirit craves for the things of the Father. To be holy is not about perfection for us but direction (growing in holiness), we still live in a fallen world. Many walk in the flesh, do things in the flesh and try to please God in the flesh but I would pray this morning that we will put aside the sins of the flesh that easily besets and begin to walk in the Spirit. The Spirit like the fire alarm will convict you of the things. The choice is whether to listen or yank the battery off the fire alarm.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">The bible says<b> &#8220;Be ye holy for I am holy&#8221;,<\/b> it&#8217;s tough to stay holy and be overcomers when we are struggling,<b> James 4:7, &#8220;submit yourselves therefore unto God, resist the devil and he will flee&#8221;.<\/b> If you want to stay holy and pure, submission to the Lord is the requirement before resisting the devil of the flesh.<b> Romans 13:14, &#8220;But put ye on the Lord Jesus and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill it&#8217;s lust thereof&#8221;.<\/b> The times I put on the Lord Jesus, I find myself safe from the things I\u2019m vulnerable to. I am vulnerable to sin and so are you and always putting on the Lord Jesus gives us the opportunity to be guided in the right paths so as not to fall in sin. It&#8217;s a sin to be in compromising situations, live a fornicative lifestyle, watch things you know are not right, allowing our mouths to curse and swear. We cannot use the same mouth we curse with to bless also for the two cannot work together.  Growing in holiness as I have said is not about perfection though that is the ultimate goal, it\u2019s about direction. Where we can look back and say, surely there has been change, a progress. See the bible says, \u201cwalk in the Sprit\u201d not \u201carrive in the Spirit\u201d , Lord help us to grow in holiness as we strive to walk in the Spirit.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"> <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning Galatians 5:16, &#8220;This I say then, walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh&#8221; In the Old Testament time, people were given laws to live by.

I don&#8217;t know much about the deer&#8217;s but I believe that when they are thirsty for water, they run to find a place to drink water and they stick there until they are filled. Anyone who is not thirsty will not run around looking for water and anyone who is not hungry will also not run around looking for food. Praise be to God that we are in a place where our souls can pant after God because we haven&#8217;t had enough of Him. The Samaritan woman kept on going to the well to get the water that could only quench her thirst for a season but when Jesus appeared and talked to her about the eternal water, she began to pant for it,<\/span><\/i><b><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <span style=\"color:black;\">John 4:15, &#8220;The woman said unto Him, &#8220;Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not&#8221;.

When the Samaritan woman was thirsty, she tried to satisfy her thirst with men in her life, tried different things. In our age, people try to satisfy their thirst with drugs, sex, drowning themselves in work, getting more of materials.  Funny thing, they do temporarily. The Samaritan woman was offered the best water to fill her thirst and we too have been offered the same. I know that at times I drag to find the Lord and at times I&#8217;m not thirsty enough to really pant more to find Him. My desire and prayers is that my soul shall thirst for the living God, always desiring an opportunity to appear before Him.

A place of remembrance often tips you on whether you are progressing or not, it will also tip you on whether you are drifting back or not. In his remembrance, he realized he lost the hunger and thirst he had and wanted it back. And like us, we are also brought to a place of remembrance where we see that we are not hungry for the word like we used to, not thirsty for prayer like we used to, not thirsty for the Holy Ghost conviction like we used. We become warm when we are suppose to be hot. We become satisfied with the little we have when He so has much more to give.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:black;\">Psalm 42:5, &#8220;Why are you cast down, O my soul?

God can only fill us if we are ready for to be filled. The psalmist looked at his situation and saw where he gave up and how his soul went into despair but he refused to stay in that condition. If you and I are going to thirst, it&#8217;s time to awaken the soul and speak hope into it by yet praising Him for the help of his countenance (Appearance of His face).<\/span><\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:black;\">Hunger and thirst will cause you to change the way you think, your actions and the direction you take.

What a divine appointment, it started as a disappointment but as time went by, all things began to work together for good and they looked at it as an opportunity. The bible is very clear about dealing with the people we call our enemies who are not in the actual sense. It says,<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:black;\">&#8220;When your enemy is hungry, feed him&#8221;, &#8220;overcome evil with good&#8221;, &#8220;Pray for those to despitefully use you&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"color:black;\">The reason the bible stresses the point of doing good is because,<\/span><b><u> <span style=\"color:black;\">doing good has a greater ability of changing the heart<\/span><\/u><\/b> <span style=\"color:black;\">cause who doesn&#8217;t want someone to good to them?. It&#8217;s as a reminder that someone cares for their well being. Doing good shuts the mouth of an evil person and soften their hearts. No wonder they say,<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:black;\">you cannot fight fire with fire, you have to be the fire extinguisher<\/span><\/b><span style=\"color:black;\">. The prison keeper&#8217;s mouth was shut by the good deeds Paul and Silas did and immediately realized that these had to be of God and he desired the same for himself and his family. They received eternal life. I can imagine Paul limping while trying to baptize but the joy inside to reach out to someone overwhelmed the pain. <\/span><\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:black;\">Acts 16:34, &#8220;Now when he had brought them into his house (prison keeper), he set food before them; and he rejoiced, having believed in God with all his household&#8221;.<\/span><\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <span style=\"color:black;\">Think about this for a moment, what would happen if all the people who were really against you came to you to bless them, pray for them because they understand that you have something they don&#8217;t have? Many hearts have been changed and friendships have been built through those who were considered enemies at one point. I can therefore say confidently, doing good is contagious why? because just as one man was against Paul and Silas at one point, that meant that even his family was against them too, but now one man comes with good news, brings the same men everyone wanted in jail with the message of truth and hope, they all get saved, get baptized and rejoiced. A friendship is built, the prison keeper sets food before them, helps clean their wounds, nursed them.<\/span><b> <span style=\"color:black;\">A mind made up will take the opportunity in his disappointments and make appointments out of them by doing good.<\/span><\/b><\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:black;\">To close, in the morning the magistrate sent a word for them to be released, but Paul said that they should come and release them.

What they forgot was that these men were not operating on happiness but on joy, they did not understand that these men&#8217;s minds were made up to do good anytime of day or night regardless of the situation.

Paul and Silas were in pain, no doubt, instead on nursing their wounds, their minds were made up to sing hymns to the Lord anyway. The prisoners heard them do something unusual. A prison is not a place for happiness and these men were not happy to be in jail,<b> they had joy, unspeakable joy full of the glory of God<\/b> that caused them to do the un heard of. Dealing with your prison life can cause someone to look at life differently, you should be weeping, cursing and even depressed but you keep it cool because of the One inside of you.

Do you know that every time you sing a song and pray to God you are weakening foundations, chains and walls around you? It may not happen immediately but something is happening. These men were not singing and praying to be released, they realized that no matter what happens, God is still in control. They approved that which was good put it into practice. The bible says that everyone&#8217;s chain was loosed, what does this tell us, even in their afflictions their goodness still shined and someone who may have not experienced something good in their lives for long did that day.<b> Mathew 5:16, Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven<\/b>&#8220;. Every time you pray for someone you know, or you don&#8217;t know, your enemies and the people who use you, something in the spirit is loosening those foundations, chains and walls.<b> Acts 16:27, &#8220;And the keeper of the prison, awaking from his sleep, seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoner&#8217;s had fled, drew his sword about to kill himself, vs. 28<u> But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, &#8220;Do thyself no harm, for we are all here<\/u>&#8220;&#8230;vs. 30 and he (keeper of prisons) brought them out and said, &#8220;Sirs, what must I do to be saved&#8221;.<\/b> It&#8217;s easier to think of revenge when you have an opportunity to get even with someone who has hurt you in the past through lies, hatred, beaten you with words but you have a chance to show them mercy and grace. When God loosed every men and opened the door, though they did not escape, God&#8217;s power was demonstrated. The jailer in turn is ready to kill himself and someone would have let him do it but remember our brothers made up their minds to serve and do good to everyone.

All things work together for good to them that love God and to them that are called according to His purpose, Romans 8:28<\/b> applies in this case.

Immediately she was freed and the masters were not too happy about it. See her masters did not care about what she needed as a person, they saw her as a means to get what they wanted. I&#8217;m not surprised about people who do not want to see you to be free, excel and move forward. They will do everything in their powers to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen to you, they will lie on you, the will back bite, they will send frustrations in your life but the good thing is that when God chooses to free you, come rain or sunshine, He will free you like He did to this girl.<\/span><\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Thought that Paul and Silas would be commended for the good works, nope, the masters to the young girl arrested them, brought them before the magistrates and lied on them saying they were causing trouble in the city. No one is talking about a girl who had been freed from possession and oppression by the enemy.<b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Acts 16:22, &#8220;Then the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> Can we say that justice was served? of course not, when they accused Jesus, justice was not served either. If you look at Jesus&#8217; situation and Paul&#8217;s, they were found guilty not by the evidence but by the majority who raised their voices. And just like they tore Jesus&#8217; garments, they tore Paul and Silas&#8217; clothes and commanded that they be beaten with rods, they were put in prison and a jailer was put to keep them securely. What would you do when you have done good and instead of being appreciated and commended for the good work, you get beaten with words, they strip you of your dignity and they put you in a prison (block your way of progressing) where it&#8217;s very? I have been there at times I felt that it was no use to do good when no one appreciates it.<\/span><\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><i><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italicfont-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Acts 16:25, &#8220;But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them&#8221;.<\/span><\/span><\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> Prison robs you of freedom, access to a lot of information and it&#8217;s degrading to make it worse, you can be in with wounds. A lot of things can be running through your mind wondering, is it worth doing good when you don&#8217;t see a return? Jesus felt it but still did it, I believe that these two men began to ponder in their hearts and thought about what compelled them to do good in the first place. And looking at the life of Jesus doing good and was still lied on, beaten crucified, these men had made up their mind to serve. Why? because their reward to come was much greater than what they were dealing with. Jesus told the disciples in<b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> John 16:33, &#8220;These things have I spoken unto you, that in me you will have peace.<u> In the world you will have tribulation<\/u>: but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world<\/span><\/b>&#8220;. Jesus said that we will deal with offences, trials, tribulations. He even said that people will do evil things to His people thinking they are doing God a service. With this understanding my mind is made up, I will do good whatever the cost, I will give the best service even if I don&#8217;t receive the same for my hope is built on NOTHING LESS than Jesus, it\u2019s all about Him.

If someone tells you, to be His disciple is to pick up your cross and follow Him, check out what happened to Him when He picked up His cross and you will understand what will happen to you when you pick up yours. His challenge to us is that if He did it, we too can do it, He said greater works than this shall ye do. This does not only go by what is to be done, but what we have to go through because He lives inside of us. This is going to be hard to swallow but bare with me,<b><u><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> DON&#8217;T EXPECT TO BE TREATED ANYWAY BETTER THAN THE WAY JESUS WAS TREATED IN THIS WORLD<\/span><\/u><\/b>.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">What amazes me and you will agree with me is the fact that you do not get the kind of service you give. You can go out of your way to help a customer outside or within, you do everything to make sure they are helped. You do things that are not even related to you so that someone else may benefit but when you need the same kind of service, you don&#8217;t get it or you are treated worse. Ever wondered whether in such cases you should continue being doing good or what? The bible says in<b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Luke 6:38, &#8220;Give and it shall be given unto you, good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall men give unto your bosom, for with the same measure you mete withal it shall be measured unto you again<\/span><\/b>&#8221; and you wonder, &#8220;how come I don&#8217;t get the same measure of what I give, where does this scripture apply?. This scripture is not given to people expecting, it\u2019s for the people who have chosen to give anyway.<b><u><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> My primary reason for giving is not to expect<\/span><\/u><\/b> (receive). Giving is required of me and it&#8217;s a good thing to do.<b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Acts 10:38, &#8220;How God anointed Jesus Christ of Nazareth who went about doing good unto the children of men&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> Jesus wasn&#8217;t doing good things to men because He wanted to gain something from them, He came to SERVE. You would think that someone who has come to serve will always be accepted, commended and liked but that was not the case with Jesus, yet He still served anyway. He went out of His way to help, I don&#8217;t think Jesus had programs and schedules as to who to serve and reach, anyone who appeared who needed help, He gave the best service they needed. He gave them even more than what they desired. He even washed the feet of the disciples when He knew that one would betray Him and many would leave Him alone yet He was still willing to serve. What an example of service to us. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">In the book of Acts, Paul and Silas are in Macedonia, already the Holy Ghost prevented them from going to different places to do good unto the children of men. Paul received a vision not to go there. The Holy Ghost stopping them is not an indication that the Holy Spirit changed His mind, it\u2019s an indication that they fulfilling the calling of going into all the world to preach the gospel and if not stopped going to a certain place, the Holy Spirit approved their move and would also empower them. These men<b><u><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> were initiative knowing that God had such a calling in their lives<\/span><\/u><\/b>. You will always be commended for being initiative by doing something right. For Paul and Silas, they knew that they were called to go into all the world and preach the gospel, they did not wait again for God to tell them to go, they just picked up their stuff and went. Because of they were initiative, the Holy Ghost led them by allowing them to preach in some places but also preventing  them from preaching in certain places. Their doing the work was not to receive praises from men but to do good just as Jesus did.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Two things to present to us this morning, don&#8217;t expect to receive the same measure of what you give but don&#8217;t stop giving.

The thinking is that after giving the best years to work; now, one can sit back and enjoy the fruit of those labors.  However, when does one &#8220;retire&#8221; from serving the Lord?  Is there an age that one should say, &#8220;Well Lord I have put my time in these many years, and now I will rest from ministry?&#8221;  When Moses sent out the spies to spy out the Land, Caleb was a much younger man at the time, with much strength and vigor.   At Kadesh Barnea Caleb was 40 years old and the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for thirty \u2013 eight years, then the conquering of the Land took seven years (ca. 1405\u20131398 b.c.).   In the above Scripture Caleb is now eighty-five years old, and says, &#8220;Now<b> therefore, give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day\u2026&#8221; <\/b> Did Caleb retire from moving forward, did he hang up his ministry belt, did he sit back and decide to rest at this point, NO!  He was determined, at eighty \u2013 five years old to move forward in all that God had for him.  However, sadly in this day and age I see many older folks in churches sit back reflecting on the former years, yet failing to create new memories and continuing to minister unto the Lord, and serve people now.

Perhaps one of my most favorite testimonies about an older man serving the Lord is called &#8220;I got off at George Street.&#8221;  Click here and listen soberly to the eight minute testimony- <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><a title=\"http:\/\/video.google.com\/videoplay?docid=\" href=\"http:\/\/video.google.com\/videoplay?docid=-8079222068794156871\"><i><span title=\"http:\/\/video.google.com\/videoplay?docid=\">http:\/\/video.google.com\/videoplay?docid=-8079222068794156871<\/span><\/i><\/a><i>.  WOW, wasn&#8217;t that an incredible testimony?<b>  This man was willing to do in his condition, what many are not willing to do in their &#8220;healthy&#8221; condition.  Perhaps that is why Samuel said that &#8220;&#8230;The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart (1 Samuel 16:6),&#8221; speaking of young David.  <\/b><\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> David wrote the famous Psalm Twenty \u2013 Three in his golden years, not as a shepherd boy in the field.  After he slayed Goliath, was on the run from Saul, committed adultery made a leader over all the downtrodden and destitute in Israel, took a census, and was betrayed by Absolom, etc\u2026then and only then did he penned the famous Psalm.  Caleb was ready still to take land, &#8220;So Moses swore on that day, saying, <\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">&#8216;Surely the land <\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">where your foot has trodden shall<b><u> be your inheritance and your children&#8217;s forever, because you have wholly followed the Lord my God<\/u><\/b>.  Wow, this blesses my heart abundantly to hear this great news that Caleb was such a great example to follow as he WHOLLY followed his God, and would leave inheritance to his children as God&#8217;s blessing upon him.  His servanthood into his older age was blessed by the Lord.  The older ones must<b><u> wholly follow the Lord<\/u><\/b>, and not just in the younger years of their lives, and must disciple the younger ones or else how will they grow, as<b><u> the Great Commission has no expiration date on it<\/u><\/b>.

At first it looked and sounded like the Lord was just telling him what to do and knowing that what God says will happen, it was still an encouragement to him but the moment the Lord said that not only are you going to do the things I have commanded you, I am going with you to be with you. Praise God, for we can go anywhere, face any situation because we have Him with us.

The Lord would speak to us this morning about being strong and of good courage why, because He is going with us. It&#8217;s like being told to be strong and of good courage for you have national security to back you up, you have the bouncer to go with you, how about trained army to accompany you but the one who is going with us is more than the these people for He is the Lord of Host. Joshua is also told not only to be strong and courageous but to follow the commandments that were given to Moses,<b> vs. 7, &#8220;Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not  turn from it to the right hand or to the left,<u> that you may prosper wherever you go<\/u>&#8220;.<\/b> We have a promise to go with the words that proceeds from the mouth of God.<b> &#8220;The Lord says as long as you do what I have commanded you to do, you will prosper wherever you go&#8221;,<\/b> prosper health wise, spiritually, materially, wisdom wise, socially because God is the Lord of abundance.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">vs. 8, &#8220;This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to according to all that is written in it.<u> For then you will make your way prosperous, and that you will have a good success<\/u>&#8220;. What a commandment that comes with the promise<\/span><\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">, we have a choice here whether to get blessings or curses and the only way will be by how we choose our destiny. Joshua is told clearly how to obtain the blessings, favor, guidance, protection from the Lord, it all comes back to not letting the Book of the Law (bible) depart from his mouth in other words, don&#8217;t stop reading it, speaking it in your mouth and following what the Book says, meditate on it day and night which I would also say, think about the word and let the word be life to you. When we have done all this then we will make our ways prosperous and the good success will come our way, a proverb we all like<b> Prov 3:5, &#8220;trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not on thy own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path&#8221;<\/b> also<b> Psalm 119:105, &#8220;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path&#8221;, Psalm 119:11, &#8220;Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee&#8221;.<\/b> There is something about the Book of the Law that cannot be taken lightly.

And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. (John 19:19)<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">When one thinks about the concept of good, things such as a good meal, a good day, a good deal may come to mind.  However, when the concept of good is used in Scripture it correlates to, perfect and holy.  Christians around the world remember the culminating days of Christ&#8217;s passion with today being named, as Good Friday.  What is so good about this day?  Jesus is tried before the Sanhedrin, sentenced by Pilate, crucified and buried all before the Sabbath.  What is so good about all of this?   Put yourself back during the days of the disciples.  We look through hindsight, but those that followed Jesus didn&#8217;t have that luxury at the time.  I imagine that they looked with eyes of various emotions such as:  doubt, loss, discouragement, distress, bewilderment, sorrow, emptiness, duress, abandonment, depression, and defeat.  They heard Jesus say what was going to happen pertaining to His Resurrection, but they were two days away from seeing the fulfillment of His words.  There are some incredible things that happened here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">First Jesus stands in submission to Pilate.  Jesus surely had greater power and authority to Pilate.  However, because of Jesus&#8217; commitment to His Father&#8217;s will, Christ submits Himself to the Father in the Garden of Gethsemane, and thus to Pilate.  Pilate thought the he was running the show, he thought he was in control.  Christ exemplified that we too need a Garden of Gethsemane experience whereby we pray,<b><i> &#8220;\u2026not my will be Your be done<\/i><\/b>,&#8221; and follow through with the prayer by our actions.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Secondly, Simon carried the cross of Christ.  Christ was too weak to carry His own cross, so another, Simon, carried it for Him.  There is nothing comfortable about a cross.  Jesus said earlier to His disciples, &#8220;<sup>Mt 16:24<\/sup> \u2026&#8221;If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.&#8221;  As Christians we are each given a cross to bear, and by carrying it, we become more like Christ.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Thirdly, Christ these men took the name of the Lord in vain, thus breaking the Third Commandment.  The soldiers stripped Him of His clothing, scourged Him, placed a crown of thorns upon His head and hailed Him saying, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221;  The worship of Jesus became a mockery compared to times past, when many various persons Christ encountered came to Christ in sincere worship.  The soldiers made not only a mockery of Christ through blasphemy, but also of all those that followed Him.  These soldiers didn&#8217;t realize that the One they mocked, would be worshipped by the world one day, and the toll would be reversed as Jesus the Judge would one day judge their lives by His standard of righteousness.  One soldier came to his senses on Good Friday and upon Christ&#8217;s last breath, the solider cried out, &#8220;Truly this was the Son of God!&#8221;  Do you worship Christ in spirit and truth or flesh and lies (John 4:24)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Fourthly, Jesus while he was being crucified prayed for the salvation of His murderers.  Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father forgive them for they know not what they do.&#8221;  Non-Christians do not know what they are doing when they mock your faith in Christ.  Do you forgive them for their ignorance, and mockery?  Christ exemplified how to love your enemies and commanded us to do the same (Matt 5).  Stephen the first Christian martyr had the Lord&#8217;s heartbeat of forgiveness (Acts 7).  Do you show love to your enemies?  Is there someone you need to forgive? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Fifthly, Christ was paying the fine for the Law (The Ten Commandments) that you and I broke, in his life&#8217;s blood.  &#8220;<b><i>For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring <\/i><\/b><\/span><b><i>\ufeff<\/i><\/b><b><i><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit<\/span><\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> (1 Peter 3:18).&#8221;  He was the not only the King of the Jews, but John also wrote in Revelation that He is And <\/span>\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">He has on<i> His<\/i> robe and on His thigh a name written: <\/span>\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.  Is he your King, are you in His Kingdom, and do you do His will?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Good Friday, there is so much that Christ can teach us even before Sunday (Resurrection Day!)  Don&#8217;t miss out on these and the many more lessons found in reading the Scripture centering around Christ&#8217;s Passion.  No doubt many will pay there Sunday visit to Church on Resurrection Sunday, many out of tradition and not because they truly love the Lord.  Many will gather together and eat after Church with family and friends.  However, how Christians many will tell their family, friends, and even strangers about the true story of what many term Easter, and tell their neighbor why Christ died for them, and how He rose on Resurrection Sunday?  The Good God made a way of escape from Hell by the blood of His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, and all those that repent and put their trust in the Savior will surly pass from death to life (John 5:24).  <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Until the nets are filled\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<br \/>Phil The Evangelist&lt;&gt;&lt; <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><br \/>Ps check out this message: <a title=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yX_7j32zgNw\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yX_7j32zgNw<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">**** Happy Easter everyone!!<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><br \/><b>Sarah Susan&#8217;s began series will continue on tomorrow or Wednesday<\/b> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;Now Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross.

But the above verse says that He had given skill to<b> ALL<\/b> the craftsmen to make everything He had commanded\u2026If we try to do some tasks which are assigned or allotted to someone else, then definitely we find something lacking\u2026But God has called us for something different. He has a specific plan for each of us\u2026He has called some to be apostles, some teachers, some evangelists and so on .Our God is just and is not partial and does not show favoritism \u2026His love and justice is exhibited by the very fact that the sun is the same for everyone and gives equal light to all, irrespective of whether he admires God or not and whether He understands Him or not\u2026Though there are people who worship the creation instead of the Creator (Worshippers of Sun or Worshippers of Trees ,whom I met) ,God still demonstrates His patience by sending rain on all the people equally\u2026It is never like a good rain for a believers field and complete drought for a wicked person\u2026The very Creation speaks of His accommodative nature\u2026So He has given ALL the people talents .. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">We read of Noah, a blameless and a righteous person among the people of his time who were so wicked and they grieved\/pained God\u2019s heart \u2026But in view of the planned terrible destruction through floodwaters on the earth, God commanded him to \u201c<b>Make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out, This is how you are to build it :The Ark  450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high<\/b>\u201d  \u2026It had to made with three decks<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">There was never rain till then, on the entire earth.

The bible says in vs. 4<b> Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes,<\/b> that was (is) the good news of the gospel. In reading a few verses later within the same chapter, the bible says, Israel rejected the gospel and so were the Athenians. The people who were religious and zealous for God rejected gospel when Paul taught the true righteousness of God. Preacher Paul Washer said (paraphrased),<b> &#8220;Many people like the idea of God but will not submit if they taught His nature&#8221;(Paraphrased). This scares me because many are led to the Lord without being first instructed of the righteousness of God to let go of their self righteousness and submit to the righteousness of God.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">To be truly saved, one cannot be ignorant of the righteousness of God revealed through the law. The righteousness of God should either make a sinner very angry like many of the Israelites and Athenians who rejected the gospel though dubbed zealous and religious or humbled by the righteousness of God like Isaiah who was said &#8220;<b>Woe is me for I&#8217;m done<\/b>&#8221; and cried for mercy. One thief on the cross who was ignorant in the beginning acknowledged his deep sin because he transgressed the law and understood he deserved to be crucified yet there was a Man in the middle who did not deserve to be there, He was innocent. This thief was ignorant because in the beginning he like the other thief was mocking Jesus. But then looking at Jesus on the cross, innocent Man on the cross, his ignorance disappeared. He acknowledged his sin and flung to Jesus to save him.

What a different child to be proud of, Different from Hophni and Pheneas because he was prayed in and prayed through. In serving together in the temple, Eli and Samuel had a relationship more of a father son relationship. A relationship I imagine Eli would have loved to have with his sons and a desire to serve the Lord together with his sons in the temple. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">The Lord passed judgment over the house of Eli and Eli somehow accepted what was to come. Just in my wild thinking, what would have happened if he interceded for his sons even in the midst of their rebellion and God&#8217;s judgment upon them? Who knows whether the Lord would have softened and changed the hearts of Eli&#8217;s sons? Eli may have given up on his sons, something parents should never do. In the midst of all rebellion, the prodigal son&#8217;s father lost his son to the world but never once did he give up on waiting for his son to come back home, constantly watching and waiting patiently. You never know what God can do with fervent, earnest, desperate prayers for Him to change the hearts of your children. God is faithful to bring back and I am a living witness to this. If only Eli interceded for his sons, who knows how that would have changed their fate after all Hannah&#8217;s prayers were answered through Eli&#8217;s prophesy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">I also believe that we as children to our parents today will also influence to some degree how our children will be to us as parents. Parents want to pass the baton to their children and their children to pass it their children&#8217;s children. I want to be all I can be to my parents today as this is also a seed planted for my children to come. And may this flow down from one generation to another. In the bible you hear, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, what a legacy. What my parents started, I want to continue and pass it down to my children. The bible says in<b> Proverbs 17:6, &#8220;Children&#8217;s children are the crown of old men, And the glory of children is their father&#8221;.<\/b> In Eli&#8217;s case, his sons were not in a position to preserve their father&#8217;s legacy of serving the Lord for over 40 years for God was going to destroy them and no one was there to intercede.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">Don&#8217;t write off your children yet, God has not written them off yet. You still have something within reach you can use to change the course of their destiny, prayers. My parents prayed me through when I did not know the Lord and did not look like I was going to. They patiently waited for their prodigal son to come home. I thank God they did not write me off like Eli who wrote off his sons and would not intercede for them. They did the best to raise me in the fear and the knowledge of God and left the rest for God. God&#8217;s hands were on Samuel all his life, thank God He has His hands on us as children and His hands on our children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">Blessings<br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">Evans<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1 Samuel 2, 17\ufeffTherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for men abhorred \ufeff\ufeffthe offering of the Lord. \ufeff18\ufeffBUT Samuel ministered before the Lord, even as a child, \u2026&#8221; It&#8217;s interesting to note that the scripture takes time to address the behavior of Eli&#8217;s sons in bits [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-900","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-ew","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/900","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=900"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/900\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=900"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=900"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=900"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":899,"date":"2008-03-13T05:52:00","date_gmt":"2008-03-13T13:52:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/03\/13\/take-the-land-now-2-by-phil-the-evangelist\/"},"modified":"2008-03-13T05:52:00","modified_gmt":"2008-03-13T13:52:00","slug":"take-the-land-now-2-by-phil-the-evangelist","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/03\/13\/take-the-land-now-2-by-phil-the-evangelist\/","title":{"rendered":"Take the Land Now 2, By Phil The&nbsp;Evangelist"},"content":{"rendered":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Good morning, <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">God is surely a God of provision.

And God&#8217;s ultimate provision is when Christ paid for our transgression in His life&#8217;s blood.

If one does not believe God&#8217;s Word, one is calling Him a liar, and we know God cannot lie.  Israel was commanded to obey the commandments of God.  There are professing believers that like to treat the Bible like Thomas Jefferson, which ripped out every account written of a miracle in the Bible.  As believers, we must not pick and choose what commands we will follow, and which we will neglect.  One area many neglect is evangelism.  Why is that?  Perhaps one reason can be found in the following verse.  <sup> <\/sup><\/span><sup><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">2<\/span><\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> &#8220;<b>And you shall remember that the Lord your God <\/b><\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you and <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">test you, <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">   Many believers seem to forget what the Lord did to pull them out of their sin when they were converted to Christ.  The Lord wants His children to be humble before Him, and this is made manifest in times of testing.  How one responds in various situations (tests) reveals what is in one&#8217;s heart, and if someone is obedient to the Lord or not.  How do you measure up when tested?  I have found that there were times in my life that when I was tested, pride rose up in my heart instead of humility.  It is always better from one to humble oneself, or God will step in and make sure that He humbles you.  The Pharaoh with each plague sent hardened his heart, instead of humbly letting Israel GO!  It wasn&#8217;t until his son was killed that he released the Israelites, and even then would chase after them to kill them.  After God killed the Egyptian army, and the Israelites were in the desert they began to complain about their situation in the desert, especially in terms of what they ate in Egypt (even though they were being physically abused in the process), comparing their current food, manna, to the leeks and onions of Egypt. <sup> <\/sup><\/span><sup><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">3<\/span><\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> So<u> He humbled you<\/u>, <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">allowed you to hunger, and <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that<u> man shall <\/u><\/span><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">not live by bread alone; but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord<\/span><\/u><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">. <\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> Jesus quoted this very verse when tempted of Satan in the desert.  Do you hunger for the Word of God, like Job who said &#8220;I esteemed the Words of His mouth more than my necessary food (23:12)?&#8221;  Paul writes of the armor of God in Eph 6, and the Word of God is the offensive sword used to attack.  The breastplate of righteousness was worn to protect the vital organs (heart and lungs).   Do you love the Lord with all your heart; is he the focal point of all your affections?  Moses mentioned wrote of the Israelites, &#8220;<sup>4<\/sup><\/span><sup><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Your garments did not wear out on you,<u> nor did your foot swell<\/u> these forty years<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">.  We are to rest in the righteousness of Christ, as His righteousness does not and cannot wear out.  Paul writes for believers to have feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.  We are to stand in the authority of Jesus Christ, and to carry this great gospel to areas and people that are going to Hell.  These shoes are unlike any others, because with them we can go into the enemy&#8217;s territory and preach the gospel that others may walk out of the enemy&#8217;s camp in freedom, no longer a prisoner of sin and Satan.  The Israelites FEET DID NOT SWELL for forty years, yet many Christian&#8217;s feet is swollen with pride, laziness, and disregard for the lost, and prejudice.  They are like Jonah whose feet took him in the complete opposite direction to the direction that God commended him to go in.  His feet were swollen with the things previously mentioned, and God just didn&#8217;t let him off the hook (no pun intended).  Moses wrote of the Israelites,<sup> 5<\/sup><\/span><sup><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">You should <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">know in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so<u> the Lord your God chastens you<\/u><\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">.  Perhaps if you&#8217;re feet are swollen for failing to share your faith, then God is chastening you unto obedience today.  Don&#8217;t rely on &#8220;professional ministers&#8221; to do the work, be obedient to the work.  &#8220;For four hundred years the Christian church had no great preacher by rhetorical standards. The first great preacher was Chrysostom. Yet during those centuries, Christianity conquered the Mediterranean world by the faithful witness of the common believer.&#8221;  (Warren Wiersbe and Lloyd Perry)  While there<u> were no professional missionaries<\/u> devoting their whole life to this specific work, every congregation was a missionary society, and every Christian believer a missionary, inflamed by the love of Christ to convert his fellow men.\u2026 Every Christian told his neighbor, the laborer to his fellow laborer, the slave to his fellow slave, the servant to his master and mistress, the story of his conversion as a mariner tells the story of the rescue from shipwreck (Philip Schaff, about the early days of the post-apostolic church)  There is no plan B that Jesus has in place!  Consider the following:  According to a legend, when Jesus returned to heaven following his death on the cross and resurrection from the tomb, the angels gathered in amazement. They gazed at the wounds in his hands and feet, and shuddered to recall his suffering.  Finally Gabriel spoke: &#8220;Master, you suffered terribly down there. Do they know and appreciate the extent of your sacrifice.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said Jesus. &#8220;Not yet. Right now only a handful of people in Palestine know.&#8221; &#8220;Then what have you done to let everyone else know?&#8221; asked Gabriel.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve asked Peter, James, and John, and a few others to spread the news. They will tell others who will tell others until the message spreads to the ends of the earth.&#8221;But Gabriel, knowing the nature of human beings, asked, &#8220;What is Plan B?&#8221;  &#8220;I have no Plan B,&#8221; replied Christ. &#8220;There is no alternative strategy. I&#8217;m counting on them.&#8221; Twenty centuries later, he still has no other plan. He&#8217;s counting on you and me.  Rom 10 reads, &#8220;<sup>14<\/sup> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?<sup> 15<\/sup> And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!  You are called to take the land now!  Are your feet beautiful or swollen before the sight of a holy God to who you have to give an account of what you did with the glorious Gospel of Christ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Phil the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt; <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, God is surely a God of provision.

Although of little strategic value, US command ordered assaults to clear the area around AP Bia, which led to pitched battles on the heavily fort<\/span>ified Hill 937. As the battle was primarily carried out by infantry using small arms fire, the fighting was akin to WWI trench warfare with the US Airborne troops moving up the highly sloped hill against experienced and well equipped entrenched troops. Attacks were repeatedly repelled by weather, friendly fire, accidents, and especially the highly effective PAVN defenses. Nevertheless the Airborne troops took the hill through direct assault, causing extensive casualties to the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PAVN\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">PAVN<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span> forces, and taking such in their own units. The backlash due to the high casualties over a strategically unimportant point led to dramatic changes in the conduct of the war, and Hamburger Hill would be the last major US g<\/span>round assault of the war.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Section1\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span>It is amazing that men gave their very lives to take over a hill in the midst of a war.  This tells me that the hill was of great value to them, this tells me that someone commanded the men to do so; this tells me that these men<\/span><span> <\/span>placed their very lives on the line to obey the command.  I would imagine that taking the land would be an important victory in the battle against the enemy, and that it would please the one that called for the Hill to be taken.  The enemy was not going to just give up the hill, the soldiers had to take it from the enemy by being proactive, moving forward, risking their lives, being resolute and mission minded, not could deter them from the mission, defeat was not an option.   <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Section1\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Moses wrote in Numbers 13,1-2, 17-20 &#8220;And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, \ufeff\ufeff&#8221;Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, everyone a leader among them.&#8221;<sup> <\/sup><sup>\ufeff<\/sup><sup>17<\/sup><sup>\ufeff<\/sup> Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, &#8220;Go up this<i> way<\/i> into the South, and go up to \ufeffthe mountains,<sup> <\/sup><sup>\ufeff<\/sup><sup>18<\/sup><sup>\ufeff<\/sup> and see what the land is like: whether the people who dwell in it<i> are<\/i> strong or weak, few or many;<sup> <\/sup><sup>\ufeff<\/sup><sup>19<\/sup><sup>\ufeff<\/sup> whether the land they dwell in<i> is<\/i> good or bad; whether the cities they inhabit<i> are<\/i> like camps or strongholds;<sup> <\/sup><sup>\ufeff<\/sup><sup>20<\/sup><sup>\ufeff<\/sup> whether the land<i> is<\/i> \ufeffrich or poor; and whether there are forests there or not. \ufeff\ufeffBe of good courage.

However, he still called Moses to send forth spies to spy out the land and to see the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Section1\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">        <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Section1\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">What was the condition of the land, were the people strong or weak, was the land good or bad to dwell in, were the cities like camps or strongholds.  As the spies took inventory of the land and the people, they were to finally bring back some of the fruit of the land to show Moses.  There were two different reports that returned, one team of ten brought back a fearful report, and the team of two brought back a faithful report.  Verse 32 states of the ten fearful spies &#8220;And<b><u> they brought and evil report\u2026to the children of Israel.<\/u>&#8221; <\/b>  The ten (the majority) reported that the land was good; however the people were allegedly giants to be feared, and the cities were a stronghold.  The two faithful spies returned (Joshua and Caleb) and Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, and reported &#8220;We should go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it.&#8221;  Do not fear and faith oppose each other?  Which report would you have believed?  It is interesting to note, most Christian can name the two spies from memory, Joshua and Caleb, but cannot name the ten spies from memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Section1\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Did you know that God too has called us to look out over the land, and believe that although the enemy, Satan is the god of the world (land) we can go and posses the land by winning the lost to Jesus Christ?  However, just as most of the spies, ten, did not see the need to reality of taking the Land, but only two did, so too are 98% of professing Christians not seeing the necessity of sharing their faith, but 2% only obey Christ&#8217;s command to take the land by seeking and saving the lost by His hand.  The two saw what the ten did not and perhaps would not see victory.  Paul wrote, &#8220;What then shall we say to these things? \ufeff<b><u>If God<i> is<\/i> for us, who<i> can be<\/i> against us<\/u><\/b> (Rom 8)?  Can the &#8220;giants&#8221; really have any effect on us when God is on our side?  It seems that the giants of fear, lack of zeal, feeling unequipped, lack to compassion, media, political correctness, etc\u2026, have really scared off so many professing Christian from taking the land to reach the lost.  Jesus spoke to His disciples in John 4, and said, &#8220;Say not ye, There are yet four months, and<i> then<\/i> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you,<b><u> Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest<\/u><\/b>.  The land has people is ready to be harvested, so what is the problem?  Jesus said in Luke 10, &#8220;The harvest truly<i> is<\/i> great, but the labourers<i> are<\/i> few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.<sup> 3<\/sup> Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.&#8221;  Jesus has called the few laborers (Joshua and Caleb were among the minority) to go face the land, despite the possible &#8220;giants&#8221; in the land.  Jesus calls us to be proactive, &#8220;And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.  The force that we are to take the land by is &#8220;Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts (Zech 4:6).&#8221;  If soldiers can give their lives to take a hill, should we not give our lives to serve the Lord?  <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Section1\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Are you obeying Jesus, by faith, and are resolved to go in and TAKE THE LAND NOW!<br \/>Blessings, until the nets are filled\u2026.Phil the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt; <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, The Battle of Hamburger Hill was a battle of the Vietnam War which was fought between the United States and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from May 10 &#8211; May 20, 1969.

The moment a child is born, the Christian parents raise the child (children) the best they know how according to God&#8217;s word but still, they do not know what the child (children) would turn out to be as he or she grows older. I think parenting is exciting but the same time very scary. In as much as parents hope and pray that their children turn out right, there is a wonder and fear inside, &#8220;how will my child (children) turn out to be?&#8221;. I&#8217;m not a parent yet but I am beginning to think and wonder, how will my child (children) turn out to be when God blesses me with them. No one encounters with the end results, they only encounter with the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Eli served God as a judge for 40years. He had a successful ministry but a broken home. He had two sons Hophni and Pheneas. Both sons were to be priests but they were worthless, corrupt men who promoted prostitution, abhorred the offering of the Lord and refused to heed to their father&#8217;s teachings, rebuke and advise. What a disappointed father Eli was that in spite of being successful in ministry, he had failed as a father and God held him accountable for it. He lacked the firmness to control his sons. Two sons gone bad and a father who has no son to be proud of. The bible says<b>, &#8220;17<\/b><b>\ufeff Therefore the sin of the young men was very great \ufeff<\/b><b>before the Lord&#8221;.<\/b> I don&#8217;t think Eli ever imagined his sons turning out like this but they did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">\ufeff<b>18\ufeff BUT Samuel ministered before the Lord, even as a child,<\/b> \u2026&#8221;. In spite of Eli&#8217;s gone wrong sons, there was but a young child Samuel who ministered before the Lord. In the midst of looking around and seeing children going against God and are being disobedient to their parents and to authority, I am reminded of &#8220;BUT&#8221; word. It tells you how God is still raising children in the midst of bad things happening around. Children like Samuel who will grow in the fear and the knowledge of God because they were prayed in and prayed through. God&#8217;s hand is upon their lives because their parents prayed for them and commended them to God&#8217;s hands. They did the best and left the rest for God to handle. Parents can&#8217;t change the hearts of their children, God can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Let&#8217;s make a few steps back and understand how Samuel came into the picture. Samuel was born in an answer to a tearful prayer of his mother Hannah. Let this be a reminder to you that it&#8217;s not too late or to early to pray for your child (children), this is encouraging because I am a firm believer of it. I do not have children but I&#8217;ve began praying my child (children) in and praying them through. Praying that one day God will give and begin to use them at their young age like Samuel. Eli prophesied the birth of Samuel and when he was young he came to minister with Eli to the Lord in the temple. Samuel&#8217;s mother prayed him in and prayed him through. Her desire was for the Lord to bless and use the blessing. That God&#8217;s hand would be upon her God given gift. She was offering back what came from God, a prayer all Christian parents should offer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">God told <span style=\"color:navy;\">Jeremiah, &#8220;<\/span><\/span><a href=\"\/\/passage\/?book_id=30&amp;chapter=1&amp;verse=5&amp;version=50&amp;context=verse\"><b><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;color:navy;\">Jeremiah 1:5<\/span><\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><b><span style=\"color:navy;\">,<\/span><\/b> &#8220;<b> <\/b><b>Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations.&#8221;<\/b> There are four &#8220;I&#8221; in direct link to God to show how God&#8217;s hand was in the process from the time He thought of Jeremiah, to forming him, to sanctifying him, to calling him.

You were fine then all of a sudden you became sick. You had a job then out of nowhere you got laid off. You know of those things that catch you unprepared. Dealing with sudden things are more tougher than dealing with something you were prepared for. Un expected leaves you in great shock, disoriented and helpless. This is the time people find it hard to think straight, panic jumps in, worry becomes a side effect because like I said you were not prepared for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">Knowing where to run to first in such moments is key. Astronauts on a mission keep close contact with control center. They always want to make sure everything is in place and the moment something goes wrong, their first action is to alert the mission control center, &#8220;<u>Houston, we have a problem<\/u>&#8220;. Believers have a mission control center. We are here on earth on a mission and as our mission progresses, we constantly keep close contact with the mission control center (heaven) and when something happens, our first response is to send a message to our control center. Often times we find it hard to call control system immediately we run into a problem. Instead of going to the control center, we panic first, start running around, looking for who we can call on, doctors, lawyers, banks, friends and whoever you would call on. With this I would say that God becomes second or last resort when plan \u201cA\u201d is failing or when plan \u201cA\u201d need to be strengthened. Our desire is to call on Heaven when we have our problems first, send a telegram, email, send fax to heaven.<b><u> Heaven has a direct line called prayers<\/u><\/b> and when you think you are going to get a busy signal or think that there will be a voicemail or go through an operator, remember Jesus dying on the cross cleared the lines. With the lines cleared, whenever you call, call on the name (Jesus). We have no access without that name. What an awesome opportunity to call on heaven when I have a situation and the password for the believers is &#8220;<b><u>IN JESUS NAME<\/u><\/b>&#8220;. Ever wondered why we pray in Jesus name, a preacher preached on this sometimes and it blessed my heart the way he put it. When Jesus was on the face of the earth, though He was a 100% God and a 100% man, Jesus went through what we human beings go through. Now God the Father has never gone through any of these stuff we go through everyday but Jesus has, He knows what it means. So when we pray in Jesus name, Jesus goes to the Father and says, &#8220;<b>Father, I know what it feels like to be in that kind of situation, I have been there&#8221;. Romans 8:34, &#8220;Who is he that condemeth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God,<u> who also maketh intercession for us<\/u><\/b>&#8220;. As we pray in His name, He stands in the gap for us before the Father. Our Lord knows what it means to go without, to be sick, to loose something or someone. When you think He doesn&#8217;t understand, check again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">It&#8217;s very clear that heaven desires to help us when we are in need.<b> Psalm 46:1, &#8220;God is our<u> refuge<\/u> and<u> strength,<\/u> a very<u> present help<\/u> in trouble&#8221;,<\/b> Just looking at this verse, I see four things that make it good to trust in Him, I see that He is our refuge, He is also our Strength, and don&#8217;t forget that He is also present and not just present but He is our help in time of trouble. I see a continuity and a progress on the verse. The first thing we all need when we are in trouble is God and when God is in the picture instead of Him dealing with the problem first, He gives us a place of refuge and then strengthens us to cope with the problem as He is a dealing with it. When we don&#8217;t know what to do, God already knows what to do and He will do it when we give Him a chance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">Psalm 18:3, &#8220;I will call upon the name of the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies&#8221;.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\"> David tells us the importance of calling upon the name of the Lord when we are in trouble. I recall the times David was faced by many challenges and his first call was to the mission control center. KJV uses the word, &#8220;Inquire&#8221;. And every time he inquired of the Lord, the Lord helped Him to overcome his enemies. Most of the time what makes you uncomfortable is some type of enemy and what a joy to know that God has already devised a plan to help you overcome it. The Lord may use other means, the doctors, lawyers, bankers and even friends to accomplish what you are dealing with, but He is our first priority when we have an issue. Watch this as I close, why God first and not people and other means, well as you wait for people to try and fix something, you will not be at peace until it&#8217;s done, at times you will not even be sure whether they will do it. And being that you are waiting, you will not have peace as<b><u> peace leads to patience<\/u><\/b>. God gives first the peace and comfort even in the midst of your situation while He is dealing with it. You will be at peace to trust that the same God who gave you peace is the same God who will fix the problem.

Even after 3 years of exposure to His miracles and messages, they still had doubts.

Some additional expressions are being a &#8220;party pooper,&#8221; &#8220;a kill joy,&#8221; &#8220;a wet blanket,&#8221; etc\u2026  These types of people seem to have a &#8220;gift&#8221; of discouraging people.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">This is precisely what I imagine the seventy disciples experienced when Jesus dialoged with them as they came in from the field of ministry.  They returned after a powerful time of team ministry, and their highlight was seeing that they were used to deliver demonized people by the name of Jesus.  As Jesus hears the words of the disciples he shares what I imagine initially took them by surprise when He states, &#8220;I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.<sup> 19<\/sup> Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.&#8221;   Jesus&#8217; focus here was most likely not the fall of Satan from Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28, but he rather spoke hyperbolically here, pointing out that the ministry of the disciples was a direct assault on Satan&#8217;s authority and influence upon those that were just delivered.  Satan has been a problem for humanity since the Garden of Eden, with all his influential lies and deceptive tactics, which is why he is called the Father of Lies (John 8:44), who masquerades himself as an angel of light (2 Cor. 11:14) roaming around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8 ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">Jesus continues sharing what he sees having happened by saying:  &#8220;Look I have given you the authority in My name to trample on snakes and scorpions and over all power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.&#8221;  Jesus was saying that the authority to do these miraculous exploits did not originate in the disciples, but originated in Jesus and His authority.  Jesus promised protection to His disciples that are in His keeping power which is greater than Satan&#8217;s influence (Psalm 91:13).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">A flee would have a better chance of defeating a heard of stampeding elephants, then Satan would have of defeating Christ and the Church by his evil influence.  Jesus said, &#8220;While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled (John 17).&#8221;  The son of perdition is a reference to Judas, which was a false convert, and I believe is a representative of false converts, which are those that sit among God&#8217;s people but are really not Christian, but are goats, or wolves in sheep clothing.  He was under the influence of Satan as one recalls Jesus&#8217; words to His disciples, &#8220;\u2026one of you is a devil.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">Jesus says, &#8220;\u2026nothing will ever harm you.&#8221;  How encouraging are those words toward the genuine follower of Christ?  Nothing will EVER harm you, hence wickedness from the kingdom of Satan will NEVER overtake you.  Paul writes in Romans 8, &#8220;What shall we then say to these things? If God<i> be<\/i> for us, who<i> can be<\/i> against us?<sup> 35<\/sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<i> shall<\/i> tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?<sup> 36 37<\/sup> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.<sup> 38<\/sup> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,<sup> 39<\/sup> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221;  The real reason to rejoice is not that the demonic spirits are submitting to you, but rather because your name in engraved in heaven!  Rejoice because the name demons submit to, is the same name that purchased your salvation!  Luke writes, Acts 4, &#8220;Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.&#8221;  How wonderful it is that God&#8217;s children have their names written in His Book of Life (Rev. 20:15).  It is not that God&#8217;s children will not experience the effects of Satan&#8217;s storms, but that they will never overtake the Christian.  Remember Job when Satan attacked him.  God allowed him to be attacked, but He would not let Satan kill Job (Job 1:12).  After going through all that Job went through he cried out, &#8220;<b><u>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him<\/u><\/b>: but I will maintain<\/span>\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\"> mine own ways before him (13:15) \u2026For I know<i> that<\/i> my redeemer liveth, and<i> that<\/i> he shall stand at the latter<i> day<\/i> upon the earth:<sup> 26<\/sup> And<i> though<\/i> after<\/span>\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\"> <\/span>\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\"> my skin<i> worms<\/i> destroy this<i> body<\/i>, yet<b><u> in my flesh shall I see God<\/u><\/b> (19:25).&#8221;When one considers all of life&#8217;s experiences ultimately what could match seeing God!  The disciples saw the demons submitting to them, but Jesus said their names are engraved in heaven; they would see God the Father, as they have seen the Jesus the Son.  I look forward to seeing the Lord one day, even though He has done ministry exploits through my life, nothing will match seeing Him as He is.  Oh, when we see the source of Gospel Himself what a day, glorious day that will be, and to see our names engraved in the book of life.  I close with the words from the famous hymn, What a Day That Will Be:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">What a day that will be<br \/>When my Je-sus I shall see,<br \/>And I look up-on His face,<br \/>The one who saved me by His grace.<\/p>\n<p>When He takes me by the hand,<br \/>And leads me through the Prom-ised Land,<br \/>What a day, glo-ri-ous day that will be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">May you appreciate God&#8217;s gift of everlasting life, and may you seek and save the lost so others will know this same salvation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Phillip the Evangelist (Acts 21:8) &lt;&gt;&lt; <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">*<b>FYI- due to some issues, we were unable to deliver devotions on Friday.

Not only in the life of a Christian but even in business, in the home, in church. No one wants to run a business that is not growing and healthy. A parent would get worried if their child was not showing signs of growth physically, mentally and the like. No one wants to be associated with something that is a stagnant, yet in the realm of our Christian walk, it\u2019s easy at times to be stagnant and lukewarm. Some are stagnant by choice and others don\u2019t allow things and people to challenge their walk that would cause them to grow<b>.<u> I believe growth takes place in an environment where there is a challenge. <\/u><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Isaiah had an experience that challenged his walk with the Lord and he had to re evaluate his stand. His experience with the Lord knocked him out of the normal, where he felt safe, where there was no more to his life than being just a man who feared God. In the year king Uzziah died, Isaiah saw the Lord sitting on the throne (I believe by vision) and everything he thought he knew about God and what he would have thought as a sign of his arrival at the top was challenged by the holiness of God. This brought him back to ground zero, incomplete. I remember days I would bring my paperwork to the teacher because I thought it was complete and then the teacher would write on top of the paper, \u201cincomplete\u201d. How often do we stay normal, everything is normal, our Christian walk is normal. We don\u2019t want the Lord to disrupt our lives because if He did we may hear \u201cincomplete\u201d. What is incomplete requires challenge, change and hard work and who wants change when everything seems ok.<b><u> Why fix what is not broken?<\/u><\/b> As long as you are a Christian, you are saved, you are going to heaven, you read the bible occasionally, you go to church, you are involved in some ministry, what more would the Lord require of you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">The bible says, in <a title=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?book_id=\" href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?book_id=54&amp;chapter=13&amp;verse=5&amp;version=50&amp;context=verse\"><b>2Corinthians 13:5<\/b><\/a>, \u201c<b>Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith.<u> Test yourselves<\/u>. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?\u2014unless indeed you are disqualified\u201d.<\/b> Evaluate your Christian life and see if you are truly growing in your walk or if you are stagnant. The same verse says<b> \u201cTest yourselves<\/b>\u201d, in school teaches test students to see if what they are learning is sinking in. Without the testing, how will you know whether you are growing or not.<b><u> You must have a measuring bar that serves as the striving factor for your life<\/u><\/b>. We are to be imitators of Christ, now Christ was (is) Holy, we have not prayed like Christ did, we have not served like He did, we have not reached people like He did. Until we look at Him as our measuring bar we will be stagnant in our growth in Christ. Isaiah\u2019s experience showed him that he was not even close and he said,<b> Isaiah 6:5, \u201cWoe<i> is<\/i> me, for I am undone! \u2026\u201d,<u> an interrupted life for a bigger purpose.<\/u><\/b> In my early Christian life, the fact that I was saved and going to heaven was enough until God interrupted my life and I saw myself undone. The experience I had developed a thirst to be more like Jesus which served as a challenge to strive to be like Him.

Sounded like a real candidate for salvation only that Jesus already knew his heart that he was not ready to give up one master and serve the other. What did Jesus say after the rich young ruler went away sad?, &#8220;<b>how hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God<\/b>&#8220;,<b> Luke 18:24<\/b>. The following chapter he meets another rich tax collector with a different spirit and like what Jesus said, &#8220;<b>nothing is impossible with God<\/b>&#8221; is demonstrated when He meets Zacchaeus.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Vs. 5, &#8220;And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I MUST stay at house&#8221;.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> Jesus, who was on a journey looked up, saw him and called him by his name to come down. The Lord knew exactly who He was, knew about his occupation, and even knew the humble heart he had at that very given moment. God sees beyond the physical, He sees the heart, for that reason He could tell the young rich ruler was not ready while Zacchaeus who was also rich was ready. And God shows mercy to those of broken heart and of contrite spirit, He saves search. The rich young ruler sounded more of a salvation candidate but again, God sees the heart. <b> Psalms 9:10, &#8220;And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou oh Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee&#8221;. <\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">&#8220;<b>Today I MUST stay in your house<\/b>&#8221; John MacArthur says, &#8220;This was worded as a mandate, not a request. It is the only place in all the gospels where Jesus invited Himself to be someone&#8217;s guest&#8221;. An ordinary man of short stature in  His humility made Jesus stop on his journey and it may appear like Zacchaeus was not part of the appointment but if we can take a closer look, we will see that it was a divine appointment. How many times have we reached some people with the gospel and you could just tell it was a divine appointment. You did not plan it, you did not know who you were going to meet and when you did, for sure you knew God had marked them for salvation.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Vs6&amp;7, &#8220;So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully, but when they saw it, they all complained saying, &#8220;He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner&#8221;.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> For the first time someone accepted Zacchaeus for who he was without judging him. He was condemned already the reason for his humble heart. Jesus knew everyone&#8217;s heart who was present right there and Zacchaeus heart was different. Right there and then the condition of the heart of many was revealed because they complained that Jesus, the Son of God, Perfect and sinless was willing to stoop low and dine with a sinner. Interestingly, Zacchaeus did not  again let people&#8217;s complains discourage him from letting Jesus into his house. Of course we can&#8217;t tell what condition his house was in but that did not matter, he was ready, opened and real. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Vs<sup> <\/sup><\/span><sup><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><\/b><b><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">8<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, &#8220;Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">d<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">e<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">false accusation, <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">f<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">I restore fourfold.&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> A change of heart through conviction and restoration, his priorities changed.

His journey required Him to pass through Jericho. You don\u2019t hear much of scheduled appointments with Jesus while He was here on earth, He was under a different appointment. I read in<b> Acts 10:38, &#8220;How God anointed Jesus Christ of Nazareth who went about doing good unto the children of men&#8221;.<u> He was under divine appointment<\/u><\/b> partially because the bible says Everywhere He went, all He did was good. On a mission to reach someone and anyone who stopped Him and we see that He attended to their needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Zacchaeus was a chief tax collector, he was rich but of short stature (short man). At that time, the tax collectors were known to rip people off. I read that Zacchaeus was a Jew collecting taxes for the Romans. Being of short stature and cunning, the Jews must have disliked him. Maybe he sought to be rich so as to be liked, fit in and be happy. I don\u2019t riches bringing him happiness. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he went into depression for that reason. Fear and insecurity must have gripped this man who had what the world would call success. One day he heard that Jesus was passing by his town, vs. 3 ,<b> &#8220;And he<u> sought<\/u> to see who Jesus was&#8221;,<\/b> He sought which in other words mean trying to find, asking questions, looking around by all means that he would see who Jesus was. Jesus was a king without a kingdom here on earth as Pastor Phil puts it but there was something about Jesus that drew so many people to Him and may be Zacchaeus wanted to see what it took. The crowd was blocking him from seeing Him but he was determined to see Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Situations and people can discourage you from seeking God. People blocked his view, and no one cared enough to give him space to see Jesus. Everyone minded their own business and may I say that though many saw Jesus, most of them were not as hungry as Zacchaeus.<b> Desperate people take desperate measures<\/b>,<b> they pray desperate prayers<\/b> for they are certain that only God is their source of hope and if He does not come through for them, they will not make it. God has made a way for us to seek Him that we may find Him, to call on Him that He may answer, to knock that He may open. There will be obstacles like in Zacchaeus case but we got to keep doing what we know to do. Zacchaeus did not allow his limitations to terminate the desire of his heart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Vs. 4, &#8220;So he ran a head and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way&#8221;.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> Here was a man seizing this opportunity before it passed him. Casting down his pride and doing the silliest thing, climbing on top of a tree like a little boy so as to see Jesus. You have to be humble to do something like this, something that the Lord requires of His children. This reminds me of the times I go to pray and immediately sense hindrances from the flesh trying to stop me from praying but I still fight hard for breakthrough so I climb a tree of praise. You begin to praise God in your hindrances; you will climb a spiritual tree bringing you closer and closer to Him.<b> God inhabits the praises of His people<\/b>. If you struggle to lock in and concentrate in prayers, include worship and praises in your prayers this enables you to go above the hindrances, setting you up for an appointment like the one Zacchaeus had. He wasn\u2019t looking for attention, all he desired was to see Jesus of Nazareth and that opened doors for something bigger than what he expected. to continue<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 19:1-10, &#8220;&#8230;Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at house&#8221; One day, Jesus was on a journey to Jerusalem.

Could be a ministry or promotion or a different job and you don\u2019t see  all the requirements needed in your life and you think to yourself, \u201chow can I?\u201d. May I remind you of something,<b> the world crowns success while God crowns faithfulness,<\/b> you may not be successful but you can be faithful and that could be a great strength an employer could be looking for. In God&#8217;s eyes we are not dealt with by who we are and what we have accomplished but by what we will be as He continues to work in us. It&#8217;s good to have the qualifications but it&#8217;s a greater blessing when the Lord fights for you when you don\u2019t have all that it takes. I\u2019m speaking this principle from experience. Somewhere in<b> Romans 8 it says, \u201cthem that He called, He justified and them that He justified, He also glorified\u201d<\/b>. This is what faith is all about, hoping for those things which are not seen and yet believing that they can happen.<b> 2Cor 12:10, &#8220;Therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities, in reproaches and necessities, in distresses for Christ&#8217;s sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong&#8221;.<\/b> May I use this verse in a different way<b>, \u201cwhen you are not that&#8217;s when you are for Christ\u2019s\u2019 sake<\/b>. The bible tells me that the moment they made a move, the Lord multiplied the sound of their feet and they sounded like a mighty army. Take a closer look at what God did,<b> God did not change their condition for the sake of the enemy, He changed the way the enemy perceived of them<\/b>. God may not change your situation or circumstance, He may allow someone else see you as an asset and not a wimp<b>.

This is what faith is all about, hoping for those things which are not seen and yet believing that they can happen.<b> 2Cor 12:10, &#8220;Therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities, in reproaches and necessities, in distresses for Christ&#8217;s sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong&#8221;.<\/b> May I use this verse in a different way<b>, \u201cwhen you are not that&#8217;s when you are for Christ\u2019s\u2019 sake<\/b>. The bible tells me that the moment they made a move, the Lord multiplied the sound of their feet and they sounded like a mighty army. Take a closer look at what God did,<b> God did not change their condition for the sake of the enemy, He changed the way the enemy perceived of them<\/b>. God may not change your situation or circumstance, He may allow someone else see you as an asset and not a wimp<b>. God may allow someone else to see more potential in you than you could see by yourself and that is because He has reserved a tank for His glory for such a time as this.<\/b> They were weak almost dying, they didn&#8217;t have war gear and to make it worse, they were just four heading to the enemy\u2019s camp to surrender and that is when the Lord made their feet sound like a mighty army. Of course their walk was no different and they did not even know what happened; only God knew. I don&#8217;t know how God does it but it works. I may never understand how He operates but I love to be part of his operations.<b> <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">The enemy did not care to check if these were true warriors coming after them , they fled leaving their tents, their horses and everything for the sake of their lives. \u201c<b>Greater is He that lives in side of us than He that is in the world\u201d 1John 4:4 tells us<\/b>,. Read the rest of the story and you will see how they ate and drunk and had a good time, God favored them. They came mentioned it to the king of Israel of what happened. The king of Israel thought the Syrians were playing a trick on them and the Syrians thought Israel came to attack them while we know God was in control of the destiny of these four men. All my life I never got what I deserved or qualified, all I have known is how best God can be glorified in my life through what He does therefore when I moved, God stepped in and made the sound of my feet sound like a mighty army and instead of being judged by what I had, I was judged by what God could do through me. So the things I have not yet accomplished will not cause my dreams and desire to die. Though it looks like nothing is happening and the conditions are getting tougher, part of me maybe affected and may not function effectively. Even in the midst of it, I will not let them hinder me from rising up and moving, I may be feeble and I may not walk well but that is a good sign that I&#8217;m not dead yet,<b> Psalm 118:17, &#8220;I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord&#8221;. God has a reserved tank for a time like this.<\/b> My life in Christ is a book yet to be written, a song yet to be sung, a testimony yet to be testified, a desire yet to be fulfilled to the glory of God, can&#8217;t go under just because I have leprosy in my life. I encourage you too not to go down, though something in you is draining life out of you and at times you feel like this is it and can\u2019t do it anymore, well<b> until God says it&#8217;s over, it&#8217;s not over yet,<\/b> so ask the Lord to show you the other tanks He put on reserve , rise up and use what is in that tank and give God all the glory as a sign you are not dead yet. Dead things have no voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Kings 7:1-20, &#8220;And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?&#8221; Vs 5 &amp; 6.&#8221;And when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.

Anyone who had leprosy in the olden times was out cast of the city and lived in caves, mountains or right out of the city.

The bible says that even the dung of a dove was considered precious and rare commodity and had to be bought at a high price. This alone gives me a picture that there was such a great famine in this land. Knowing the situation in Samaria, lets look at four men in vs. 3 who we are not even given their names. These were men we would consider less fortunate in the society for no. 1 they were lepers. Anyone who had leprosy in the olden times was out cast of the city and lived in caves, mountains or right out of the city. The lepers were always required to chant &#8220;I&#8217;m unclean, I&#8217;m unclean&#8221;. Situation number one looked severe then topped with situation number 2. Which is as lethal as number one and that is famine. Sick and no food, How much can a man take?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">They were aware of their situation as outcasts and they knew sooner or later one of these situations would kill them first sickness or starvation or both. I love how they reasoned with themselves,<b> vs. 3&amp;4&#8243;&#8230;and they said one to another, why sit here until we die? if we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also&#8221;<\/b>. I thank God that in some tough times He still allows us to think and reason. Though we may feel handicapped in some areas, we are reminded that there are things in us that are alive and functioning. I don&#8217;t want to throw everything out of the window simply because there is a part me that is not functioning like it should. I maybe struggling in some areas and that could be my leprosy and I might be going without the spiritual food for some unknown reason but I know that I am not dead yet so devil don&#8217;t bring me no casket God is showing me the part of me that has life and He is giving me grace to activate them. The other part of me will bring life to the rest of my being. I see many beat themselves because what was working for them at one point stopped. I believe there are TANKS in you God reserved for a time like this. You might have not known that you had a filled tank and just when you thought you had exhausted everything and left hopeless then here He comes to open this tank He left in reserve.

Recall the famous story of the Good Samaritan, whereby Jesus is speaking with a lawyer who questions Jesus initially by asking, \u201cWhat must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d  Jesus was a master of communication, and he seemed used an apologetical response at times in responding to the question.  Presuppositional Apologetics seeks to defend the faith by dismantling people\u2019s presuppositions so one does not continue to filter truth through one\u2019s presuppositions.  Jesus answers a question with a question.  He says what is written in the Law (hence what does it say)?  Then he continues by saying how do you read it (hence what does it mean)?  This is a hermeneutic, looking to the original intent of the author and using their meaning and not smashing one\u2019s own personal meaning into the author\u2019s intent.  The lawyer responds by saying, \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and [love] thy neighbor as thyself.<sup> 28<\/sup> And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?\u201d  What does the following story of the Good Samaritan have to do with the man trying to justify himself?  Perhaps Jesus\u2019 answer will answer that question.

Many that sing praises to God on Sunday morning walk by and let the sinner die their sins, because they have no compassion for the unsaved.  Notice again that the Samaritan was moved with compassion.  If the professing Christian has no compassion for the unsaved, is those professing Christian saved themselves?  The Samaritan was willing to invest his own time, talent, and treasures to see that the mugged man would not die, but live!  <\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:black;\">What about you, do you walk by with an uncompassionate heart, or does compassion swallow your fears causing you to be moved to action as Jesus was (Mark 1) as the Samaritan was?  If Jesus is within the life of the Christian, shouldn\u2019t His attribute of compassion be within the professing believer?  The one that walks by is no different than the man mentioned at the beginning that watches a child drown, while he or she reads a magazine just feet away while the child drowns to death.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">O Christian, where is your compassion, do you truly believe that God will overlook if you have a lack of concern for the lost?  Charles Spurgeon said, \u201c<\/span><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Have you no wish for others to be saved?<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">  Then you are not saved yourself.

Recall the famous story of the Good Samaritan, whereby Jesus is speaking with a lawyer who questions Jesus initially by asking, \u201cWhat must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d  Jesus was a master of communication, and he seemed used an apologetical response at times in responding to the question.  Presuppositional Apologetics seeks to defend the faith by dismantling people\u2019s presuppositions so one does not continue to filter truth through one\u2019s presuppositions.  Jesus answers a question with a question.  He says what is written in the Law (hence what does it say)?  Then he continues by saying how do you read it (hence what does it mean)?  This is a hermeneutic, looking to the original intent of the author and using their meaning and not smashing one\u2019s own personal meaning into the author\u2019s intent.  The lawyer responds by saying, \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and [love] thy neighbor as thyself.<sup> 28<\/sup> And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?\u201d  What does the following story of the Good Samaritan have to do with the man trying to justify himself?  Perhaps Jesus\u2019 answer will answer that question.

Notice again that the Samaritan was moved with compassion.  If the professing Christian has no compassion for the unsaved, is those professing Christian saved themselves?

It&#8217;s God&#8217;s favor that causes a person to fit in where he would have not fit in had it not been for God. Jesus entered  into Jerusalem riding on a donkey, the crowd were spreading their  garments, leaves, robes and cloaks on the ground that the donkey (favored donkey) would walk on, now let&#8217;s not get over heel thinking that when we see them do the same before us that they are doing it for us, they are actually doing it for the Man who sits on the donkey and to us the Man who lives inside.<b> 1John 4:4, &#8220;Ye are of God, ye little children for you have overcome them, for greater is He that lives inside of you than He that lives in the world&#8221;<\/b>.

He may have believed, the greater the number, the greater the chance for victory. God knows what He is doing and can use anything to accomplish what He has started. Don&#8217;t start loosing heart because what you thought the Lord was going to use in your life is actually contrary to what He had in mind. There are some who had dreams and visions for their lives and the Spirit of the Lord was upon them but when the Lord chose to approach it in a different way and they got offended and quit.

For the first time someone has told him something about himself he never knew about, he has been promised God&#8217;s presence and victory, he is so blessed by what he hears that he cannot afford to loose the opportunity to loose being in the presence of the Lord. When you encounter with truth that negates facts, like Gideon you won\u2019t want to miss the opportunity of always being in the presence of the One who knows you best. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Gideon time of receiving ended and his time to give started.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> He goes to the house to bring the best sacrifice to offer before the Lord.

He was like a little boy hiding himself from harms way not imagining himself as a mighty man o valor.<b><u> Your past history is not a mystery to God<\/u><\/b>, He is not even moved an inch by who you used to be after all He knows your history. If He was concerned about your past, He would have killed you after He got you saved but he did not.

If He cared for us when we did not know Him and now that He has revealed Himself to us like He did to Gideon, how much more will He care for those who know Him and are His?. If God needed someone else, He could have gone for them, but down in your need, in pain, in a state of confusion He reveals Himself.<b> God is not a respecter of any man but a respecter of principles<\/b> and that&#8217;s why in<b> 1Corinthians 1:27-29, &#8220;But God has chosen the foolish things of this world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of this world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and<u> the things which are not<\/u>,<u> to bring to nothing the things that are<\/u>, that no flesh should glory in His presence&#8221;.<\/b> I was never chosen because I was eloquent, strong and educated, I was chosen in midst fears and weakness and so were you.<b> Romans 8:30, Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these also He justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified&#8221;<\/b>.

Any time when we feel like we are alone and no one cares, there is always a way God reaches out to us in ways no one else can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">In the story if you begin from the previous chapters, we find how Israel had disobeyed God and how God brought Midianites, Amalekites and the people of the East to come against them. The reason why this came to them was because of the idols they worshiped this led to some of them taken captive and while others were hiding in caves, on mountains and under some sacred tree where Gideon was found. Gideon was hiding so as not to deal with the present situation, he felt like there was nothing more to live for. He had lost hope and confidence, he came from one of the poorest and youngest families. He was hiding in shame, despair, weak, broken, rejected, abused, feeling like a failure, confused wondering where is God when he needs Him the most. Have you ever been in a situation where all you felt was a victim of circumstance and you wondered what is wrong with me that I have to deal with all these?, where is God when I need Him?, He seams to be blessing everyone else but me?, My neighbors are happy, my friends seam to get it all together, their families are not broken like mine. Ever felt like some people were getting promotions but you?, you seam to be trying very hard but they keep raising someone instead of you?, have you ever been somewhere where everything wasn&#8217;t working right?, you try to say the right thing but it comes out the wrong way?, you try to succeed but you keep failing? I know some have felt this way and that is what our friend Gideon also felt. This led him to do nothing thresh wheat under winepress. He had stopped trying, he didn\u2019t see any future out of it and so what is left to do is sit there and call it a quit. In his dilemma, the Angel of the Lord appears, sits down under the tree and watches what Gideon is doing in his lost thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">6:12-13, &#8220;And the Angel of the Lord appeared to Him, and said to him, The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor. Gideon said to Him, &#8220;O my Lord, &#8220;if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about,&#8230;.now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">. Here is a man who had suffered for a while, the Angel of the Lord appears and tells him, &#8220;<b>the Lord is with you<\/b>&#8220;. Lord if you are with me, how come I am suffering?, if you are with me, how come I had to go through this and that?. You know what, we don&#8217;t have to feel the Lord to know He is present, the bible calls Him<b> Jehovah Shammah<\/b> which means that He is present. When you think He wasn&#8217;t there He was actually there. You may have not felt like He was doing anything but be assured He was there and in the case of Gideon, He was always there and yet Gideon did not know why I&#8217;m I saying so? If God wasn&#8217;t with him, he could have been captured, he could have been killed, greater terrible things would have happened but because God was with him, none of these happened to him. You might have been wondering where the Lord was when you broke up with your girlfriend or boyfriend, where was He when you lost your job, when you were sick, when they lied on you, when they prevented you from receiving what you know was meant for you, where was He when your parents went through a divorce, where was He???????. You did not feel Him when you needed Him and now He appears and calls you what,<b> &#8220;mighty man (woman) of Valor&#8221;?<\/b>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">I got to stop but I have to say that whenever God is going to lift someone up, the rooted issues have to be dealt with for where you are going doubts, fear, un answered question cannot come with you for they will be an hindrance to what He wants to do. Gideon is launching His complain but all he needed to understand that regardless of what he went through and had to deal with and though the presence of God was always there, he needed to appreciate the fact that He manifested himself in other words revealed Himself marking a beginning of something greater and tell you what, whenever the Lord reveals Himself, know that there is something in store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Judges 6:11-40&amp;7:1-25, &#8220;&#8230;The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor&#8221; In the book of Judges 6:11 begins by saying, &#8220;Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-883","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-ef","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/883","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=883"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/883\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=883"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=883"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=883"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":882,"date":"2008-02-08T07:21:00","date_gmt":"2008-02-08T15:21:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/02\/08\/point-of-reference\/"},"modified":"2008-02-08T07:21:00","modified_gmt":"2008-02-08T15:21:00","slug":"point-of-reference","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/02\/08\/point-of-reference\/","title":{"rendered":"Point Of Reference"},"content":{"rendered":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Good morning, <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">1Sam 17:1-58, &#8220;36<u> Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God<\/u>.\u201d 37 Moreover David said, \u201c<u>The LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine&#8221;<\/u><\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Every Christians has to have something that they can look back to. It&#8217;s very easy at times to forget where we come from and so when we face new challenges we don&#8217;t see how in the world we will get out of them. I believe that everything in every Christian life happens for a reason and that God maybe glorified even in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Today we are looking at a young shepherd boy who happened to be at the wrong place at the right time. From the time he left, he had been asked to faithfully deliver food to his brothers who surprisingly were in the battlefield facing their enemies the Philistine. David  was a shepherd boy attending to sheep, temporarily he become a delivery boy. Here comes this the poor, young man smelling like sheep bringing food to his brothers who are not even fighting. It&#8217;s good to be humble and be obedient when some people in the authority assign you certain tasks that might not even be our job description why? you may never know what you are setting yourself for. I know it works!!!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">David makes his way to the battlefield and all he can see is people standing far from each other with no battle taking place. To his surprise, he can hear some deep voice talking about the children of Israel. A different man is introduced in the story and his name is Goliath of Gath. He is a giant well trained and equipped to be soldier. He has so much confidence on who he is, what he has been made and what he has and that causes him to blaspheme the name of the Lord and make fun of the Israelites.  If he only knew<b> Psalm 118:8<\/b> which says, &#8220;<b>It&#8217;s is better to rust in the Lord, than to put our confidence in man<\/b>&#8220;. Then out of nowhere, Goliath sends a challenge to any man who can fight and kill him with a promise that whoever wins will make the other party their slaves. Since the Israelites don&#8217;t want to loose and they have no one to fight this man, they are left stranded. Is it amazing how we can have all the things we need for the battle, be well trained and equipped and still find something that is so much bigger than us? When we come to a halt, that&#8217;s then when God steps in and it might not be how we expected Him to show up. David listens carefully to the giant\u2019s demands then makes an inquiry what would happen to the man who kills the giant. Read it for yourself and you will see the promise made. This lad makes a move to face goliath with God greater in Him than the giant he is about to face. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">We know well that you don&#8217;t fight a lion with a toothpick, you don&#8217;t sneeze into the wind to put off a fire, you don&#8217;t go bear hunting with a cork gun and certainly you don&#8217;t send a shepherd boy to the battle field. What I&#8217;m I talking about this morning, I&#8217;m talking about having a<b> point of reference<\/b> in your life that will cause you to make<b> a profound move in a situation that looks impossible<\/b>. He is ready to challenge a man who is well trained while he is not. He is very young, this man is big. This man is well equipped with an armor, shield and sword but David is not. How will he fight and what is his weapon.<b> Heb 4:12,<\/b> &#8220;<b>The word of the Lord is living and powerful, sharper than any double edged sword<\/b>&#8220;. When we all understand where our strength is coming from and we have a point of reference, something to look back to and see where we have come from, the battles we had to face in the past, situations that were impossible but God came through for us, well we can have the faith and the courage to take face our giants. Let&#8217;s look at David&#8217;s point of<b> 34 But David said to Saul, \u201cYour servant used to keep his father\u2019s sheep, and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, 35 I went out after it and struck it, and delivered<i> the lamb<\/i> from its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught<i> it<\/i> by its beard, and struck and killed it. 36<u> Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God<\/u>.\u201d 37 Moreover David said, \u201cThe LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\u201d And Saul said to David, \u201cGo, and the LORD be with you!\u201d.<\/b> Your faith and mine are boosted by our point of reference knowing that if the Lord did it then, He can do it again for His own glory. If He delivered me then, He can do it again. He will continue to do it again and again because He is the same yesterday, today and forever more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">We know the end of the story how David took five small stones used one bring the giant down. Even though many believe that it&#8217;s the stone that brought him down,  I believe that the point of reference David had melted Goliath&#8217;s heart that he had no more strength left in him. The children of Israel had points of reference from the time they were brought out of Egypt but they did not bring them to remembrance. One last thing, before David could face him, Saul tried to give him his fighting attire but David would not use them as he had not tried them. I desire to use what works for me not what the world passives to be a good fighting combat gear. If it did not work for them certainly it will not work for me. You come to me with Sword, spear, and shield, I come to you in the name that is above every name, the Lord whom you have defied and it&#8217;s because I have a point of reference meaning proof that He is able and He will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Sam 17:1-58, &#8220;36 Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.\u201d 37 Moreover David said, \u201cThe LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-882","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-ee","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/882","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=882"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/882\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=882"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=882"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=882"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":881,"date":"2008-02-07T06:54:00","date_gmt":"2008-02-07T14:54:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/02\/07\/who-is-on-your-team-by-bro-boaz-olang\/"},"modified":"2008-02-07T06:54:00","modified_gmt":"2008-02-07T14:54:00","slug":"who-is-on-your-team-by-bro-boaz-olang","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2008\/02\/07\/who-is-on-your-team-by-bro-boaz-olang\/","title":{"rendered":"Who Is On Your Team? by Bro. Boaz&nbsp;Olang"},"content":{"rendered":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Good morning, <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Life is a game with many players, teams and coaches. The aim of every team is to win. Each individual is a team and also a unit in some bigger teams. The size of the team doesn\u2019t matter. The goal of the team does; and the goal of any serious team is winning-success. Winning the game of life requires your participation but also your team\u2019s support. It is very hard to win alone. It is a lot easier to win when you have team members who support you and a coach who motivates you to win. Without much elaboration, let me underscore a fact of life here:<b><u> team members are necessary if you want to win anything in the game of life<\/u><\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Now, I have a question for you: who is in your team? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Before you try to answer that question, you may want to reflect on some of the things you have been trying to succeed at or are thinking of winning. These may include: advancement in career or education, getting married or keeping a loving and lasting marriage, raising up children, saving money for something special, developing or maintaining a prosperous ministry, initiating a project and succeeding at it, improving your performance at work, learning new skills, dealing with everyday life\u2019s challenges that require tough decision making in uncertain environment, forecasting the future when you don\u2019t have all the facts, or just making simple decisions about some things etc. The list could go on and on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Do you have a team that supports you and helps you to win whatever you set your eyes on or are trying to succeed at? If you do, do you believe you have the right team members? And, are you seeking their support and advice? What about your coaches? Do you recognize them? Do you listen to their instructions? Do you involve them in your game of life so they can help you minimize your chances of loosing and maximize you chances of winning? Do you assume that you have the strength and that you can make it with nobody\u2019s help? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">I don\u2019t know what your answers are and what your position is, as far as seeking help from your teams and coaches is concerned. But, I do know that we all need somebody to help us. That is why we have parents, spouses, children, friends, uncles and aunts, supervisors, neighbors, pastors, counselors, lawyers, professors and teachers, etc. help us accomplish our dreams and goals in life so we can enjoy a happy and prosperous life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">God recognized our need for help and that is why he made available everybody that we may need to help us. He is a team player. He operates in three persons: God the father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost. Before His ascension, Jesus said that He would not live us alone, but that He would send to us the Holy Ghost to help us. He is a team member. Is He in your team? How about God and the Lord Jesus Christ? Do you include them in your plans and decision making?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">How about others? Do you carefully identify your team for advice and support? Here are examples of people who succeeded because of support from their team:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Moses had his father-in law on his team. That saved him from potential failure as a leader and from family collapse. Jesus had twelve disciples. He also had three inner circle disciples that He confided in whenever times were tough. Together, they succeeded at founding the eternal Church of Jesus Christ. Isaac had his father Abraham to arrange for his marriage. Timothy had Paul to help him become a successful pastor and leader. Ruth had Naomi as friend and advisor on relationship and marriage plans which led to her being married to King Boaz. Samuel had his mother Hannah and Eli, the priest as his mentors and he became the first and most powerful of God\u2019s prophets, Peter, James and John were a team in fishing business and they succeeded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">What about you? Who are the key players in your team? As for me, in order of importance, my team players are: God, my wife, my children, my parents, my brothers and sisters, Christian brethren and leaders, friends, relatives and others. I have never succeeded a lone. I have tried, but it doesn\u2019t work May advice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">\u201cDon\u2019t try to succeed on your own even if it\u2019s possible and you have the opportunity to so<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">. Involve others to help you succeed and be willing to share with them the credit and rewards of your success.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Listen to what the Bible says:<b> \u201cTwo are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor\u2026woe to him that is alone\u2026and a threefold cord is not easily broken\u201d Ecc. 4:9-12, \u201cWithout counsel, plans go wrong, but with many advisers they succeed.\u201d Prov. 15:22<\/b>, Paul wrote to the Romans \u201c<b>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established<\/b>.\u201d<b> Romans 1:11<\/b>, Jesus confirmed that we need Him, if we are to be anything. \u201c<b>I am the vine and you are the branches: He that abides in me and, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me, you can do nothing.\u201d John 15:5<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">These scripture point to one thing; nobody can succeed at anything without being a team player and belonging to a team and having a good coach. Ask God to help you find wise, able and experienced team members and mentors to help you. Most importantly, use the natural supports that are already in place. Sometimes the grass is not greener on the other side as we are sometimes made to believe. Give help and seek help, too. You will be amazed at how much you will have \u201cgood success\u201d in your Christian walk and life. That is God\u2019s way and will for all His Children (Joshua 1:8).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">\u201c<b><u>Our best thoughts come from others<\/u><\/b>.\u201d Ralph Waldo Emerson, <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Blessings<br \/>Bro.

Abraham asked the Lord again if He would destroy it if He found 45 righteous, then if He found 40, then asked if there were 30 and he asked the Lord the question until the number dropped to 10 and the Lord answered in all that He will spare the city if He found 10 righteous people living in the city. I believe with all my heart that God can do great and mighty things because there are righteous people standing for the Lord. Even in the midst of bad things people are doing, a few righteous people have the capability of making a change. We can make a change by pleading with God. Many of unbelievers will one day say<b> Isaiah 1:9, &#8220;Unless the Lord Almighty had left us<u> some survivors<\/u>, we would have become like Sodom &#8230; Gomorrah&#8221;,<\/b> unless the Lord had used some righteous people to shine in the middle of darkness, many would have not known the love of Christ and His forgiveness of sins. Christ in us is the answer to this world, Christ in us is the answer to our families and friends, Christ in us is the answer to our community, city, state, nation. You could be the only righteous person in your family and through your pleading, the Lord could spare your family without allowing them to die without Him.<b> Isaiah 1:18, &#8220;come now let us reason together&#8221;, says the Lord, &#8220;though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow, though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool&#8221;<\/b>. Abraham reasoned with Lord, so did Moses for the sake of children of Israel and we can do the same on behalf of our family members, friends, colleagues who are not saved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Through you, many can be reached and through you, many lives can be spared from going to hell.  Everyday God gives us opportunities to affect our surrounding so let&#8217;s make use of it. I was talking to a good friend of mine sometime back and he was telling me that while they were flying one day, the plane developed some engine problems and needed to make an emergency landing, it did not look good as the engines were failing then a thought came to me, suppose they all survived because there was a righteous person on board and God was giving each of them a second chance not only to live but turn to Him.

It may not even suit the situation correctly \u2026 If we rely on God to fight for us, we can see the results \u2026Since Laban was warned he did not dare to do any harm to Jacob , though he was very angry .Laban mentions to Jacob in<b> Gen 31:29 \u201cI have the power to harm you<\/b>\u201d. Yes, though he had power and was heading to harm him, God fought the battle and finally safeguarded Jacob and everything he had\u2026.<\/p>\n<p><b>SETTLEMENT<\/b>&#8211; We see Mary ,who was only a virgin and betrothed to Joseph, to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Joseph was shocked to hear about this, since they had not yet come together. Since he was a righteous man, he did not want to expose her to public disgrace. So he had in mind to divorce her quietly . ..But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said<b>\u201dJoseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

It contained all kinds of four footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.

The Holy Spirit had been poured out on all of them.<\/p>\n<p>A dream may look simple but God can use it to convey his message. Even when the king himself forgot the dream he had, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Yes, the God had used a dream as a means to warn Laban while heading to harm Jacob and to reconcile them, to show Joseph the factual situation and build the home, which was going to be shattered, to inform Pilate that Jesus was Lord and totally innocent\/blameless\/pure, to correct Peter so that he should go to the Gentiles to preach the goodness, to exalt Daniel before the king and his entire kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>So we need worry for any situation because He can warn our enemies in face of danger and safeguard us, he can fabricate \/put together broken homes, he can prove a person innocent, when the entire world is against the same and he can also correct us so that we may be used in His work ,and he can use the same dream for honoring us and for any other higher purposes.

It is interesting that many that began to use their gifts in the church, at some point used it as a stepping stone to use their gifts toward the world.  For example, I believe that Pop singer Britney Spears was raised in the Southern Baptist Convention, and began using her voice to sing in church.  However, when one looks at her life now, the talent that God gave her has not been one that it used for the Kingdom of God, but rather for the Kingdom of Darkness.  There are a number of people that have done the same thing.  Why is that?  Perhaps it is because there is certainly more fame and fortune outside the church, then inside.  However, I would submit in light of this, it depends who one looking to serve.  Everyone serves either God or Satan (although one does not need to be a Satan worshipper to serve Satan).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Recall the challenge of Joshua who turned to the people and challenged them to make a decision as read in the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><sup><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">14<\/span><\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">&#8220;Now therefore,<b><u> fear the Lord,<i> serve<\/i> Him in sincerity and in truth<\/u><\/b>, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt.<b><i><u> Serve<\/u><\/i><u> the Lord<\/u><\/b>!<sup> <\/sup><\/span><sup><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">15<\/span><\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord,<b><u> <\/u><\/b><\/span><b><u><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">choose for yourselves this day whom you will<i> serve<\/i><\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">, whether <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">the gods which your fathers served that<i> were<\/i> on the other side of <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">the River, or <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> But<b><u> as for me and my house, we will<i> serve<\/i> the Lord<\/u><\/b> (Joshua 24:14-15).&#8221;  Joshua was willing to challenge people in his influence to make a decision, as to they would serve.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Once one decides to serve the Lord, one must serve Him in a manner that pleases Him, as I have shared earlier in this series.

Then he decided that the talents were to be distributed each ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ABILITY!  Each one had different abilities, and the amount of talents was given in light of the responsibility that the master placed on the servant according to their own ability.  Upon the return of the master, he would pronounce his approval or disapproval of each servant.     <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">The first and second servants, who received five talents and ten talents, pleased the master and doubled their talents.

Now this does not mean that one can work one&#8217;s way into heaven, because one is saved by grace, and this not of oneself (Eph 2:8,9), but one will show one&#8217;s faith by how one lives, and also what one does with the talents that Jesus has given them.  Event the wicked are given talents by God, but only those that invest themselves in the Kingdom of God will be rewarded by God.  One day at the Judgment (Bema) Seat of Christ each believer will be judged on various things including how one used their talents to serve God.  Servants of Jesus desire to bring Him joy, because in the presence of the Lord is fullness of Joy, and the joy of the Lord is one&#8217;s strength.

Admit that you have a problem but confess that there is a way out of it. I believe where there is an entrance, there will be an outlet, all we have to do is find that outlet.<b><u> Admitting is recognizing where you are but desiring a change<\/u><\/b>. Now Jesus did not come to have a funeral service, He came to turn people&#8217;s mourning into joy.<b> Mark 5:39, &#8220;When He came in, He said to them, Why make this commotion and weep? the child is not dead, but sleeping&#8221;.<\/b> Is Jesus blind to really see that this child is dead? can&#8217;t he differentiate between a live person and a dead one? well if Jesus is life, this is no match to Him, He compares it to sleeping. The mourners are looking at the natural but they are not seeing that the One who conquered death has power over death. If they could only see things the way He did.  They saw the child dead, He saw it as an opportunity to perform a miracle. How I desire that the Lord would give me His eyes to see things as He sees them. When Lazarus was sick,<b> John 11:4,<\/b> says \u201c<b>He said, This sickness is not to end in death; but [on the contrary] it is to honor God and to promote His glory, that the Son of God may be glorified through (by) it. (Amplified).<\/b> Jesus being all knowing knew in the natural, Lazarus would die, in the spiritual realm, he would sleep and He let it happen on purpose and what He would do later was to promote God\u2019s glory and that Him as the Son of God would be glorified by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">The problem today is that we hang out with people who don&#8217;t believe then they inject us with words of discouragements saying, &#8220;there is no way it can happen&#8221; and sooner or later we believe the lie. Jesus had the same people surround Him and He knew about that, He closed out everyone who made fun of the miracle to be done and only brought to the inner circle those who had faith.<b> Mark 5:40, &#8220;And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with Him, and entered where the child was lying&#8221;.<\/b> Allow people in your life who will boost your faith over the situation you are dealing with, share with them what you are dealing with, let them help you pray over it by faith for the bible says,<b> &#8220;Whatsoever two or three shall agree on as touching one matter, it shall be done unto them by My heavenly Father<\/b>&#8220;, &#8220;<b>how will two walk unless they agree<\/b>&#8220;, if we both have faith, we are in agreement. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Mark 5:41, &#8220;Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, &#8220;Talitha cumi,&#8221; which is translated, &#8220;Little girl, I say to you, arise&#8221;.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> Two wonderful things I have picked from this line, Jesus not only wants to do something in our lives, He wants to touch us too.  Touch brings warmth and assurance and I\u2019m not talking about warm fussy feelings. Go to the hospitals, you will find that most patients just need someone to either hold their hands or just hold them. The second thing from this line, He did not speak about the girl, but He spoke to the girl. I don&#8217;t know who can speak to a non living thing and it hears him only Jesus. However dead the situation is, if He speaks, the dead thing will hear His voice. We speak to people and animals that can hear us and they do what we say sometimes, Jesus speaks to that which does not exist or if it exists, however dead or a live, they will hear His voice. Even that which has no ears still hears His voice. I&#8217;m not even going to get to the results of what happened but just know that there is nothing impossible with Him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">What I&#8217;m I say as I conclude, It&#8217;s not over until God says so, He is a God who keeps time, see things the way He sees them, and know that there is nothing impossible with Him.

Why trouble the Teacher any further?\u201d.<\/b> This is not the news the father expected and whose to blame for the death of the little girl? If I asked each of you the same question, I will hear different answers. Some would blame the woman with the issue of blood because had she not stopped Jesus, Jesus would have reached and healed her on time. Some would blame Jesus for they would argue that He should have set His priorities right.<b> Isaiah 55:8, &#8220;for My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, \u201csays the Lord&#8221;.<u> To you He may have delayed, to Him, He was on time<\/u>.<\/b> How we perceive and look at things is not the same way God looks at them, instead of praying, &#8220;Lord see it the way I see it&#8221;, we ought to pray, &#8220;Lord let me see it Your way&#8221;.<b> YAHWEH (YA WAY) meaning His Way and not HIGHWAY<\/b>, meaning you stick with the Master without taking highways because He did not do it your way. This man had hopes when the situation was still bearable until he learnt that his child was no more, then people discouraged him from bothering the Teacher because it was too late according to man\u2019s ways.<b> What we call over and finished may not be what God calls it<\/b>. Here are people who had changed God&#8217;s word and put a period, an indication that it was over, but He had placed a comma to show there was more. You may have thoughts that He has limited abilities based on what you\u2019ve heard; you might think this is beyond His league. Could it be possible that Jesus decided to delay for He wanted to perform a greater miracle beyond just healing?<b> The bigger the miracle, the greater faith is boosted. The<\/b> bible says,<b> &#8220;Whatever is impossible with man is possible with God<\/b>&#8220;. Can we say He forgot? A person who is all knowing can never forget. Can we get to that level where we see God as He is and not as we perceive of Him. Jairus might have only seen Jesus as a healer and so were the people who came from his house but the bible says in<b> John 14:6, &#8220;Jesus said to him, &#8220;I am the way, the truth, and<u> the life<\/u><\/b>.

God has allowed man to do wonderful things<b><u> BUT<\/u><\/b> creating life and restoring life from the dead is His job. If Jesus has power to give life, shouldn&#8217;t that be an indication to us all that, there is nothing impossible with Him? Someone is frustrated because they called on God when their situation was still bearable but nothing happened, please understand that God is still able, more than able for His ways and His thoughts are not our thoughts. Do you Have dreams, desires, visions, plans, hopes, love, marriage, relationships, conditions, situations that died even after you brought them to Jesus?, guess what,<b><u> it&#8217;s not over until He says so<\/u><\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">To someone it may be over, to God it&#8217;s just the beginning for greater things, so Jesus tells him,<b> Mark 5:36, &#8220;&#8230;Do not be afraid; only believe<\/b>&#8220;. Jesus is taking Jairus back to the faith he had when he first approached Jesus. It&#8217;s faith that activates the power to do the impossible. God will do His part but you and I have to do our part by having faith. No need to be frustrated with someone else because they got their blessings before you and yet you asked of Jesus first. No need to be frustrated with Jesus because He did not come when you called on Him, the bible says, &#8220;<b>He has made all things beautiful in<u> His time<\/u><\/b>&#8220;.

A sentence can have the same wordings but how you punctuate can change its meaning. I have been misunderstood through emails by the way I punctuated my sentences to an extent that what I meant was not how it was received. With this in mind, God had given us His word, how we punctuate His word will cause it to sound how we want it to or how the Author intended for it to be punctuated. Don&#8217;t put a question mark where God puts a period and don&#8217;t put a period where God puts a comma. If there is a period, it&#8217;s a done deal we can move on to the next thing, if He puts a comma, there is a short pause for there is more to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Jesus as usual was going about doing good. He came to seek and to save the lost coming to and on the other hand, He was teaching and providing for His followers not forgetting  healing them. On one particular day, He had just healed a man who was demon possessed and before long a man came to Him, a ruler of a synagogue by the name of Jairus. He was a Jew and if you have read different passages, Jesus being a Jew was rejected by the Jews for the bible says, &#8220;<b>He came to His own but His own received Him not&#8221;<\/b>. Again there is another passage that says,<b> &#8220;A prophet is not honored and welcomed in His own town&#8221;,<\/b> referring to His people the Jews. What really prompted this man, a ruler to come to Jesus against the odds?<b> Mark 5:22-23, &#8220;&#8230; And when He saw Him, he fell at His feet and begged Him earnestly, saying, &#8220;My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay hands on her, that she may be healed<\/b>&#8220;. We see he had a serious emergency, a life at stake that if nothing was done, it would be lost. Why not ran the girl first to seek treatment elsewhere? Did he not forget that his people always had a problem with Jesus? what would people say if he went to Him? I have come to realize that when you are in need, no matter what people think or how you have always been perceived by other people, you will lay a side your pride and ego and look for help. When you know your help can be through a church, who will  stop you from getting help there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">When the Master received the message, He started a journey to meet this girl. A man who had faith in Jesus to heal his daughter. Now Jesus had a great multitude after Him even with that, He left to rescue this young girl.<b> Mark 5:24, &#8220;So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him&#8221;.<\/b> It&#8217;s like Jairus had called 911 and help was on the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">The first 4 verses talks about Jesus encountering with Jairus, everything seem to be going as planned, Jairus must have been excited because the Lord was willing to come but then in vs. 25, the story takes a different turn and begins to focus on someone else referred to as the woman with the issue of blood. She had heard about Jesus, she knew her condition; she was not worthy to be around for she was considered unclean. She had had her condition for 12 years, much had been spent in worthless physicians and now she had a chance to get healed. She reaches out and touches the hem of His garments, gets healed and Jesus stops. What do you think must have gone through Jairus mind? what do you think his reaction was towards the woman who had stopped Jesus from reaching to his daughter who is in bed dying? What would your reaction be if you called 911 and as the paramedics are coming to your rescue, they stop by somewhere else to help another person?<b><u> This is an interruption that causes delay that opens doors to frustrations that test you as you learn patience and trust<\/u>.<\/b> Hope this sentence makes sense to you as it does to me.

And with that, man has tried by all means to be able to make themselves wanted. Many have altered who they were originally made to be into something they thought they wanted to be so as to belong, some have also gone as far as doing things to the extreme so as to be wanted or fit in. Identical crisis still affects many even today. We see it with the youths, young adults, young men and women and even the old. Today people tend to be defined not so much about who they are but rather what they have. As long as you have it, your name will excel but the moment you start loosing it, your name also fades away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">Who does not want to be needed, valued or accepted? there is a sense in each of us to want to be in a place where our opinions are valued, what we do is accounted for and not taken for granted, where we people can feel and recognize our presence. I have been to some places where I wasn&#8217;t sure whether anyone knew I was there or if they did, I did not feel my presence mattered or counted. So everyone was busy talking to their friends or acquaintances while I was there wondering whether I should have brought someone else to talk with. We all have a desire to belong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">A part from belonging, people also desire a touch. As much as this works well with the females, males too crave for it though most don&#8217;t admit it. At times people do not need things done, they just need a touch.<b> Touch is to cause or permit a part of the body, especially the hand or fingers, to come in contact with so as to feel. It&#8217;s also to reach out to or to be in contact with<\/b>. Different things touch people but nothing touches like the presence of someone you want to be there. They say that a touch is a form of healing as touching soothes, helps relieves tension, brings warmth to the body, brings security and also gives a sense of belonging. In the verse given above, three disciples were up the mountain with Jesus. In the process of time, Jesus was transfigured and a voice came from heaven to say, &#8220;<b>this is My well beloved in whom I Am well pleased, hear Him<\/b>&#8220;. God is addressing the three disciples Peter, John and James and all of a sudden they fell down to their faces and were afraid of what they had seen and heard. There will be times we will encounter with things that will bring fear in our lives at times what you and I will desire will not be a miracle but a hand that reaches out to touch us, letting us know that everything will be okay. Someone to stand by your side when all hell is breaking loose. This is the time that even if the Lord does not do anything about my situation, just His presence and touch alone is enough to pull you through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">Jesus reached out and touched them, told them to rise and not be afraid. The Lord knows what is best for us and a miracle might not be what we need, you might have prayed that God would do something different but He allows His presence to be there as comfort. If you are in a boat and the boat is rocking and feels like it&#8217;s going to sink, if the Lord is with you in the boat, you will have the confidence to face the wind cause even if He does not calm the wind, the boat cannot sink for how can God drown? His presence and touch kept me from going back, giving up, stop looking to Him. There are things I have prayed to Him to do for years. He has not done them yet, but His touch has kept me from loosing my faith. Remember the touch is not a quick thing but it takes time because as He is touching, He is restoring, fixing, massaging and getting you ready for another step. He is the Potter working on the clay periodically reaching out to touch the clay with an aim to make it into a vessel. He could speak my existence but I would rather have Him take time to touch me. He touched me and made me whole, so do you desire a touch or do you want a miracle? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">FYI &#8211; I have a prayer project and need prayer warriors who would seriously pray for admissions trip to India coming up in mid February.

I have had to train for sports, competitions, tournaments in order to prepare myself to compete against my opponents.  How would our spiritual life change if we took our approach to practicing a sport or musical instrument and applied it to being trained in our faith?  Heb 5:14 reads, &#8220;<b><u>But solid food is for the mature<\/u><\/b>\u2014for those whose senses have been trained to distinguish between good and evil.  The writer mentions for those whose senses have been<b><u> trained<\/u><\/b> to do something, and that something is to distinguish between good and evil.  Each of us have come out of the world into faith in Christ Jesus if we are Christians, and we knew evil well, we loved it, we drank iniquity like water, we were dead in our sins and transgressions.  After we were changed we began to see a great difference between good and evil, but yet there are still things that perhaps we still hold to things that the Scriptures consider evil.  Do you gossip (1 Tim 5:13), are you a glutton (Proverbs 28:7)?

Here Paul is dealing with the conflict against the hostile world and the persecution which believer&#8217;s were facing (cf. v. 9; 1:8; 3:11,12; 4:7).  If you desire to serve God as your commander, then you as a good solider you will heed his leadership, his word, as He strengthens you in Christ Jesus.  Yet he calls you not to take part in the affairs of this life (the evil things previously mentioned).  For example, when one is gossiping at the office to you engage or disengage in the gossip, or perhaps share that you would rather not be a part of the conversion?  When you are invited to a movie that blasphemes God&#8217;s name, is filled with smut and vulgarity do you accept the invitation or reject it?  John MacArthur shares, &#8220;A military soldier doesn&#8217;t<b> entangle himself,<\/b> because his call to duty is completely severed from the normal affairs of civilian life, so also must the good soldier of Jesus Christ refuse to allow the things of the world to distract him (cf. James 4:4; 1 John 2:15\u201317) (<i>The MacArthur Study Bible)<\/i>.  We pull away from the things that we used to do, a replace those things by godly living, for this purpose, &#8220;[that] he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.&#8221; Recall the account of King David&#8217;s men.  &#8220;<i>David longed for water and said, &#8220;Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!&#8221; So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD.   &#8220;Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?&#8221; And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men<\/i>. (2 Sam 23:15-17)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">David was the King that had a desire, water.  He didn&#8217;t give a command, he didn&#8217;t make his request part of his men&#8217;s job description, and he didn&#8217;t have an expectation that these three men should take up the task of his &#8220;craving&#8221; for water from Bethlehem.  King David was in the line of Jesus Christ as reads in Matt 1:1 &#8220;<i>A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham<\/i>:&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Three mighty men<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Out of loyal to David these men went well beyond &#8220;the call of duty.&#8221;  They were brave and courageous with only three of them breaking through the host of the Philistine army after their twelve mile journey to get there.  These men had to break through enemy lines, the Philistine garrison (outpost) in Bethlehem, retrieved the water, and bring it back to David.  These men were not commissioned to do this task.  They sacrificed their very lives not to gain clout or merit, not to be in the Israeli hall of fame, and not even to advance the victory for their army.  No these men had on thing on their minds, to bring some water for their king!  Why, because this is what would please the King.  With loyalty and honor they risked their lives, &#8220;counting their lives worth nothing,&#8221; just to please the King to which they longed to do, even putting themselves in &#8220;death&#8217;s way,&#8221;.   Haggai 1:8 reads, &#8220;<b><i>Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored<\/i>,&#8221;<i> says the LORD<\/i>&#8220;.

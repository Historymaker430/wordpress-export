When ready to sleep, we blow it up until its firm then go to sleep. I have realized many times that by mid morning or sometime when I wake up, the mattress is no longer firm, creating discomfort. Forget about sleeping on it is gone, very frustrating. The next day we look for holes to seal only to repeat the same cycle as we discover there are more holes in this thing leaking out air that should keep it firm.<\/p>\n<p>This is no different from marriages that start airtight, very firm only to find down the road that it is not firm, as it should be or how it was from the beginning. There are things leaking out leaving this thing called marriage wobbling in every direction. For the last few days, God has given me a burden to pray for marriages, as there are many under silent frustrations. The smile is there on the outside but on the inside, there are fed up individuals, under pressure, very insecure, and resenting folks. The Love that was to keep it airtight is silently leaking out because there are things that are poking holes in it.<\/p>\n<p>We see people who have been successful building corporations; great CEO\u2019s, manages successfully corporations with thousands of employees but failed in one thing, marriage that involves two people. How will we stand when what we hoped and dreamed of is not what it became when we got there? In addition, where do we go from here? My prayer as we do a series on marriages is that God will fireproof our marriages. That does not mean fire will not come, it just means when it comes it will find us prepared.<\/p>\n<p>First things first, I believe God created marriage primarily to conform us to the image of Christ. This is to show us that it\u2019s more than happiness. I know we are programmed to ask ourselves what is this in for me, what will I gain out of it, how will it benefit me but that\u2019s the wrong order of things. That it becomes easy to give when you have received and no one finds it easy to be the first one to give when they feel the other person does not deserve it. Then all that happens is we go through unending cycle of silent frustrations that lead to nowhere and some end up leading to divorce.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that for the next few days we can share with you some encouragements concerning your marriage as we also pray for you. Moreover, those who are under silent frustrations will take time to heal and be restored to the glory of God. Marriages are tough, we can\u2019t make them work on our own. Like Mary and Joseph who received instructions from heaven as to how to raise baby Jesus, we too need instructions from heaven on how to grow and maintain what God has joined. My dad always says, \u201cMarriages are made in heaven, they are perfected here on earth. We have to be in God\u2019s will, ready for change and ready to grow. I know not of any other place that I can grow more than in my God given marriage. Blessings Ev<\/p>\n<p><strong>BTW, on Friday I became an uncle to baby Devyn Matthew Awando.

(NIV)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the most frustrating things is dealing with failures. There is no joy in knowing you have fallen or failed. Competitions have winners and losers, that is how it is set up but how about when there is no competition? We cheer up for winners and we rejoice when we are winners but what do we do when we fall and or fail? You may be frustrated with yourself right now over failing to meet a dead line, or failing an exam, or failing to win what you hoped to have won. What about failing to please the Lord with your life, fell in sin or sinned so bad that you wondered whether there was any more mercy left for you. You have fallen many times and each time you asked for forgiveness and mercy and they were granted each time. This time you feel you have fallen too hard and too far that you do not believe no mercy is left on your God given personal account to be released to you. I have encountered some people who were so mad at themselves over how they failed that they would not forgive themselves over the past failures. It is not like God had not forgiven them, God had done it but they found it so hard to forgive themselves over what they did. God forgot about it, but they keep reminding God of what they did. That is what is pulling them down and hindering their progression with God. Failing is part of life, we don&#8217;t want to fail yes but at times it comes and we can either use it to advance ourselves by learning from it or use it to put ourselves down.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Proverbs 24:16,&#8221;for<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> though<\/span> a righteous man falls seven times, &#8220;.<\/strong> &#8220;<strong>Though<\/strong>&#8221; indicates that there is possibility, an indication that a righteous man may and will fall and not ones but several times. We can trace it\u2019s origin from Adam and all who came after him failed the test even before taking it.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Falling is not an option<\/span><\/strong> however, it does happen as you grow and as you walk to your destination, making choices that will lead you there. There are some things you have no control over that will either make you win or loose. The key thing is to realize that there are possibilities and what you do when you fall or fail matters a lot Jesus understood that though His disciples were strong while He was with them, there was going to come a time when they would be faced with challenges and even fail. He tells Peter in<strong> Luke 22:31 And the Lord said, &#8220;Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> But I have prayed for you<\/span>,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> that your faith should not fail<\/span>; and<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> when you have returned to Me<\/span>, strengthen your brethren.&#8221;<\/strong> Peter was not planning on failing but the devil was determined make him fail and Jesus knew about it yet He does not even stop the situation. All He does is let Peter know what awaits him and what He has done for him in the situation. Jesus says to him, &#8220;<strong>But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail<\/strong>&#8220;. In other words, everything can and may fail but when you have faith in God, that faith will cause you to pick yourself up again and keep moving.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> You have enough faith in God to work with when the flesh fails<\/span><\/strong>, when all you hoped and dreamed for fails. A righteous man falls seven times and he rises again because He has enough faith to work with. When one falls or fails, what happens?, They still have enough pieces of things they need to assemble them back together again. Jesus tells him, &#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">when you have returned to me<\/span><\/strong>&#8220;, this was an indication that his failure would move him further from the Lord but his faith in Christ will somehow bring him back to find the Lord and encounter with him again. God would use his experience to strength his other brothers who would face situations like that too.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Have you fallen or failed?, the bible says the &#8220;righteous&#8221; man not the &#8220;wicked&#8221; falls seven times but he keeps on rising because he has faith to pick him\/herself up again. You can&#8217;t keep crying over spilled milk, don&#8217;t you understand you have enough to work with to get you back on your feet again?. You have faith to believe God can forgive you and faith to believe God can help you rise again and give you new avenues for progression.<strong> 1 John 2, \u201c1 My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin.

And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, 43 and said to his servant, \u201cGo up now, look toward the sea.\u201d So he went up and looked, and said, \u201cThere is nothing.\u201d And seven times he said, \u201cGo again.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is hard to understand God\u2019s ways but He sure can be trusted. I do not think Elijah expected the blessing of the rain to delay, after all, he called on God and fire from heaven immediately came. Waiting for the rain appeared to be taking time. He could not doubt God\u2019s word to make it happen. He had enough trust in God to take God at His word.<strong> Numbers 23:19, \u201c\u201cGod is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good? Romans 3:4, \u201c\u2026let God be true but every man a liar\u201d.<\/strong> When you know God\u2019s ways rather than His works, you can choose to trust when it does not make sense, when it is not clear or even when it has delayed. God can be trusted.<\/p>\n<p>Like Elijah, I hear the sound of abundance of rain in this year the reason I am on my knees praying. I have no idea what kind of rain God will send my way or when but I will continue to trust Him even when I do not understand. We see Elijah sending his servant to check on the promised rain 6 times. Who knows if his servant wondered, \u201cwhat\u2019s the use of checking on something that is not there\u201d. On the seventh time, he gets a report of \u201c<strong>A cloud as small as a man\u2019s hands in the rising from the sea<\/strong>\u201d. Imagine for a second the man of God expecting abundance of rain to fall on the land, after several checking it yields a small cloud like man\u2019s hands. He was not discouraged; he knew God had answered his prayers. It was small yet significant. The little is the confirmation he needed.<\/p>\n<p>Great blessings often arise from small beginnings, and showers of plenty from a cloud of a span long. Let us therefore never despise the days of small things, but hope and wait for great things from it. Small beginnings are like seeds; they do not look much but have potential of producing much. It is with the little that we see and thank God for that we trust as it unfolds while we grow in it and through it.<\/p>\n<p>I am learning more and more that it is not when you have it all together that you move or when you see the big picture that you act. It is in the process of taking those small steps day by day that the Lord unfolds what He is doing and wants to do in your life.<strong> Ecclesiastes 11:4, \u201cHe who observes the wind will not sow, And he who regards the clouds will not reap<\/strong>\u201d. You make those small steps by faith having fireproofed your faith through prayer and the word<\/p>\n<p>While some are promising that it is going to be a great year (as they always do every year), I would say it could be a great year if we heed to God\u2019s call. Let us go back to basics, prayer and the word; may God repair those who need repairing; may we remember God wills then waits. Elijah told Ahab to run home for it was going to rain and it did.

Fire falls on Elijah\u2019s sacrifice upon seeking God. Note the order, before God showered them with blessings, Elijah offered an excellent sacrifice that pleased the Lord. We seek to please God first (Psalm 103:1, Matthew 6:33) while we trust God to shower us with blessings too. Let us give Him what He requires of us.<br \/>\nAbel and Cain offered sacrifices to God. God had respect for Abel\u2019s sacrifice rejecting Cain\u2019s sacrifice. God did not leave them to figure out what He desired of them, He told them what was pleasing to Him. Here is how we know<strong> Genesis 4:6 Then the LORD said to Cain, &#8220;Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? 7 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? (NIV<\/strong>), Abel offered his sacrifice by faith so did Elijah and God had respect for both sacrifices. We need to learn more and more what the Lord requires and offer it by faith.<strong> How to please the Lord is revealed and instructed in Word, it\u2019s then fueled and powered by faith in God. Romans 10:17, \u201cSo then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\nWe see that upon demonstrating to all the true God, Elijah ordered the false prophets be destroyed at his command. This prepared the way for what the Lord was about to do. Back in the day, false prophets were killed if their prophesies did not happen. As Matthew Henry says, \u201cIsrael being thus far reformed acknowledged the Lord to be God, and had consented to the execution of Baal\u2019s prophets, that they might not seduce them any more, though this was far short of a thorough reformation, yet it was so far accepted that God thereupon opened the windows of heaven, and poured out blessings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Elijah sent Ahab to eat and drink, for joy that God had now accepted his works, and that rain was coming. It was time to rejoice for the Lord was about to release His blessings. And Elijah, by faith, hears the sound of abundance of rain. He retires himself to pray while waiting for the rain by faith. He cast himself down on his knees upon the earth, in token of humility, reverence, and importunity, and put his face between his knees. He ordered his servant to bring him notice as soon as he discerned a cloud arising. Six times his servant goes to check and sees nothing, brings no good news to his master; yet Elijah continues praying. Though the answer of our fervent and believing supplications may not come quickly, yet we must continue instant in prayer and not faint nor desist; for at the end it shall speak and not lie.<\/p>\n<p>God will\u2019s then waits for His people to respond in prayers. God had promised Elijah drought would end but Elijah had a job to do, pray the blessing through. Those who desire the abundance of rain will have faith, seek God fervently in prayer, patiently wait until He has moved. Those who do this would have no room for discouragement, for they will understand they are in God\u2019s will,<strong> 1Thessalonians 5:16 Rejoice always, 17 pray without ceasing, 18 in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you<\/strong>.

Ahab and the people expected that Elijah would, in this solemn assembly, bless the land, and pray for rain; but he had something else to do first. The people must be brought to repent and reform, and then they may look for the removal of the judgment, but not until then.<br \/>\nI am always amazed at how many times we are asked to claim and receive blessings but rarely do we hear about restoring and reforming things lost and bent out of share or building what it will take to maintain blessings. No one can pour precious stuff in a leaking vessel, it will leak out. You have to restore the vessel, repair it first. We need our character and integrity built to sustain and retain the blessings brought about by God. How often do you pray to God to build your character, integrity, give wisdom, teach you patience, desiring preparation to be a good\u00a0 steward? It is easy to ask for blessings with nothing to sustain them. Listen to what Elijah did in preparation to what God was going to do,<strong> 1King 18:30, \u201cThen Elijah said to all the people, \u201cCome near to me.\u201d\u2026 And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down<\/strong>\u201d, what had been broken down and forgotten about called for repair. Instead of Elijah doing something new, he repaired the old that the Israelites had left to seek other things. You may have left the ways by which to be blessed and sought other ways, may be running from one conference to another; trying to work your way through things by yourself; waiting for someone to have a word from the Lord for you. We have to go back to the foundation, prayer and the Word which will repair you.<\/p>\n<p>While others are looking for the new sensation, new fad, new experiences, new feelings, extra biblical manifestations, I believe God is bringing His people back to the basics; where they lost their direction. Repairing the altar of the Lord broken down by other things. Paul encourages believers<strong> in Romans 12:1<\/strong> by saying, \u201c<strong>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service<\/strong>\u201d. The repaired altar is for a sacrifice that is pleasing to the Lord. You may have been damaged by sin, damaged by drought; fear, doubt, depression etc instead of seeking God for something new, why not seek the Lord to repair you again for His service. No one is beyond repair.<\/p>\n<p>My prayer, \u201cGod do not send your rain of blessings until you\u2019ve repaired me first\u201d, I do not want blessings poured in a leaking vessel, it will not retain it. I desire of the Lord that my life will be presented to Him as a living sacrifice for His service. A life consecrated for His work. More displaying His glory. Giving Him what is right and not what is left. I would desire for you and myself this year more of spiritual blessings, it begins with repair. What are you trusting God for this year? Are you being repaired in readiness for what He will do? It\u2019s time to show up in the Lord\u2019s workshop, Jeremiah 18. to continue.

All the work done, hours spent only to miss the whole point of what I was to write on. If you were to be asked to write a report or an essay about this year we are concluding today, would you miss the whole point about your life and why this year had to be what it has been? When I missed the point on my essays, the only way to escape it was to re do it and get it right. I can see the same with now, if you missed the whole point of 2009 in your life with everything that had happened, you may have to repeat the class in 2010.<\/p>\n<p>Elijah appears in 1Kings and proclaims a drought for three years. This began a series of miracles to demonstrate to the people who the true God was. There was Yahweh the almighty God and so was Baal, additional false god they were worshipping. Israelites had mixed worship of both, moving away from serving the only God to serving other gods along side the almighty God. They did not deny God; they just didn\u2019t serve Him whole-heartedly. In that drought period, Elijah challenged the prophet\u2019s of Baal in the presence of all the Israelites<strong> 1Kings 18:21, \u201cAnd Elijah came to all the people, and said, \u201cHow long will you falter between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him\u201d. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This has been a year of drought too and I believe it came about to remind people who God is and turn to Him. I believe most people still missed the whole point and you would tell by what they say. I don\u2019t recall many people drawing to God or even calling on God. This drought has also been a reminder that things that people hold onto firmly like finances can tank in hours, days, weeks or even months. Things that people have labored for years. It has been a reminder that though it has been a drought that has affected us mostly physically; it was also to be an avenue by which God would use to bring about a spiritual hunger for Him.<\/p>\n<p>If you were to write an essay about this year for yourself, what would you say? I would say it\u2019s been a very enriching year for me spiritually in regards to praying effectively, being in the word, teaching, seeing lost souls come to the Lord, seeing my youngest brother getting awakened spiritually and for the first time drawn to the things of God, seeing my wife grow more and more spiritually. Yes, it has been a very difficult year for us financially but I have not missed the dynamics brought about by the drought. It has been a pruning process and the pruning can be hard and painful but the results are amazing.<\/p>\n<p>It is in the drought that God demonstrated to the Israelites that He was the true only God to be worshipped and trusted. It is in the drought that God demonstrated to the people that one man of faith, standing firm righteously could make a change when their trust is the Lord. It is in the drought that God demonstrated that He could sustain; he sustained both Elijah and Zeraphath as recorded. It is in the drought that they saw God.

After he had fully described it to her, she asked, &#8220;Sir, do you sit while the work of refining is going on?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, yes ma&#8217;am,&#8221; replied the silversmith; &#8220;I must sit and watch the furnace constantly, for, if the time necessary for refining is exceeded in the slightest degree, the silver will be injured.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The lady at once saw the beauty and comfort of the expression, &#8220;<strong>He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.<\/strong>&#8221; God sees it necessary to put His children into the furnace; but His eye is steadily intent on the work of purifying, and His wisdom and love are both engaged in the best manner for us.

We gave them an opportunity to share what they believe and why they believe what they believe. Sharing from their very selected verses to support their belief. After they were done, having known some of their positions especially on who Jesus is, we took time to ask them tough questions in their world view and in that process also shared the gospel with them. We now pray that the Holy Spirit will awaken them, convict them and lead them to the true light.<\/p>\n<p>I often ask people these two questions,<strong> \u201cwhat do you believe\u201d<\/strong> and \u201c<strong>why do you believe what you believe<\/strong>\u201d. People often trip on these two questions, going round and round not making it clear (I was like that too a few years back).<strong> 1Peter 3:15, says \u201c15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> AND ALWAYS BE READY to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you<\/span>, with meekness and fear;\u201d <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The use of &#8220;defense&#8221; in 1 Peter 3:15 is general: Whether formally in an official setting or informally to anyone who might inquire, a believer is to be ready to provide an answer. That answer is about &#8220;<strong>the hope that is in you<\/strong>,&#8221; which is the Christian faith. Believers should be able to give a rational explanation of their salvation and Christian faith.\u00a0If you can\u2019t stand for something, it will be easy to fall for anything. We got to be the ones to influence because we have the truth or else we will be influenced which will draw us away from the truth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark 13:22 and Matthew 24:24, 22, \u201c For false christs and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> deceive, if possible, even the elect<\/span>. 23 But take heed; see, I have told you all things beforehand\u201d<\/strong>. What is interesting is that, we will run into people who are in cults who will seem to speak the same language as we do, use the same words and even feel like they are one of us. It\u2019s in the probing that you find that you mean different things. For example we could all say we know John but the moment we begin to describe the John we are talking about, we discover they are not the same. That is why you as a believer ought to be ready with God\u2019s word to know what you believe, why you believe what you believe and defend what you believe. Mark and Matthew tells us that \u201cfalse christs \u2026 will rise\u201d, we don\u2019t have to wait for them to arise, they are already here proclaimed by others, it\u2019s the christ not revealed in the Holy Scriptures. Paul fireproofed his son in the faith Timothy by admonishing him with this words,<strong> 2 Timothy 2:15, \u201cBe diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF TRUTH\u201d.<\/strong> Timothy was going to be faced by people who preached another gospel that appeared real. Paul even mentioned two of those people in this chapter. He told Timothy \u201c<strong>rightly divide the word of truth<\/strong>\u201d which is an indication of some who will come and wrongly bisect God\u2019s word making it appear real. Timothy was to be ready at all times to defend the faith.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1Corinthians 3:11, \u201cFor no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ\u201d<\/strong>. We must truly know this foundation and build our lives on it. We must also know those who pervert this foundation and not embrace all who name the name of Christ who may be talking of false christs.<strong> 2Timothy 2:19, \u201c\u2026the solid foundation of God stands\u201d,<\/strong> this is the true foundation that cannot be shaken, the foundation to bring other\u2019s too.<\/p>\n<p>If someone was to come to you and ask you about what you believe and why you believe what you believe, are you ready to fulfill 1Peter 3:15? Let us be ready, let God\u2019s word fireproof us for the coming days so as not be part of the deceived. In addition, let\u2019s not shy from those of other faith, they need to hear the truth.

A couple of days later he brought it back to the owner. To his neighbor&#8217;s surprise, not only was his pan brought back in good condition and clean, inside of it was another small pan. His neighbor reminded the man who had borrowed the pan that he had only given him one not two. The man explained the reason for the small pan. While it was at his house, the pan gave birth to a small one and therefore it belonged to his neighbor. A few weeks later, this man went and borrowed the same pan, his neighbor was glad to give it to him, after all, miracles seems to happen at his house, pans give birth. Upon waiting for his pan to be brought back for days, he went to inquire about his borrowed his pan that had not been returned. The man quickly jumped up to explain that the borrowed pan had died and he buried it. His neighbor standing there stunned said to him, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand how a pan can die&#8221; and the borrower said, &#8220;If you believed it gave birth in the first place, why can&#8217;t you believe it\u00a0 died&#8221;. Whatever has a beginning has an end.<\/p>\n<p>Often we find it easy to take good care of things that belong to us and not the things that belong to others. If you know that the company can to afford it, why take good care of it? If you live in a rented home or apartment, why take good care of it if you are paying rent to live there? If you rent a car, why keep it clean if it&#8217;s not yours? If you are checked in a hotel, why shouldn&#8217;t you throw things around the hotel room after all someone is paid to take care of it. Saw something out of place, why fix even if I am in a position to, simply because it&#8217;s not my responsibility? We are all called to be good stewards and what is a steward,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> one who manages another&#8217;s property, finances, or other affairs<\/span><\/strong>. Every good thing that God brings your way that may not be what He has placed in your hand as your own He requires you to be a good steward of it. He wants you to treat it as your own and I would say even better than your own. Christians ought to be different when it comes to handling other people&#8217;s stuff. How about what God has placed in your hands? You ought to be a good steward as to what you put in your body and on your body; after all it doesn&#8217;t belong to you but God. A good steward when it comes to your finances, living within your means and taking good care of what God blesses you with. I have seen people abuse blessings God brought their way.<\/p>\n<p>The above scripture reminds us of our requirement of stewardship, &#8220;be found faithful&#8221; in other words to be loyal, trusted, reliable, steadfast, devoted until the time of the Father. How faithful you are determines what can be entrusted in your hands. It&#8217;s not about who owns it, it&#8217;s a matter of taking good care of it. It&#8217;s a matter of being faithful even when you don&#8217;t feel like it. Joseph was a good steward in Potiphar&#8217;s house. Listen to Paul speaking<strong> 1 Corinthians 9:16, &#8220;For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel! 17 For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> I have been entrusted with a stewardship<\/span>. 18 What is my reward then? That when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel of Christ without charge,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel<\/span>.<\/strong> Are you a good steward? the story above showed a good steward for a season, be a good steward always.

to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.<sup> 19<\/sup> Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.\u00a0 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \u201cJoseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit (Mt 1:18-20)\u201d.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this day and age there are a lot of voices speaking, but none as important as the voice of the Lord.\u00a0 The Scriptures speaks of Joseph (Mary\u2019s husband to be) as a righteous man not wanting to make a public display of his love (Mary).\u00a0 His was willing to protect and provide for her needs at this confusing time.\u00a0 At first Joseph didn\u2019t understand it all, but his actions were dictated by his integrity and his love for his fianc\u00e9.\u00a0 Although Joseph did these noble things he still lacked in one area, he had not heard from the Lord yet.\u00a0 The angel Gabriel had spoken to Mary at this point, but not to Joseph (Lk. 1:26-38).\u00a0 Mary is spoken of often in the Christmas story, but Joseph seems to be given a lesser role, a backseat role in the birth of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>Yet God is looking for men of God to hear from the Lord.\u00a0 In Mt. 2:13, Joseph hears from God to take his family into Egypt because Herod would try and kill Christ.\u00a0 Thank God Joseph wasn\u2019t too busy to hear and obey God or we would all have been in trouble because our Savior would have died before His time.\u00a0 Of course God would not have let that happen, but yet God worked through fallible humans to accomplish His will.\u00a0 Again in Mt. 2:19-21, we find God speaking to Joseph about leading his family back to Israel, because God knows where He wants you.\u00a0 Sadly though many men believe God and church are for women only, and that they are to work and bring home the bacon.\u00a0 Yet from Scripture, before Joseph and Mary were married God spoke to both of them, and after they were married God spoke to Joseph, not Mary, concerning the leadership of their family. God desperately desires men that He can speak to, to lead their families in the way the Author of the family designed.<\/p>\n<p>God said,<strong> \u201cI looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found none (Eze. 22:30).<\/strong>\u201d Where are the Christian men building up, and standing in the gap for their families?\u00a0 Statistically if 100 children profess Christ, 3.5 families will be added to your church; if 100 women profess Christ, 17 families will be added, but if 100 men come to the Lord, 93 families will be added!\u00a0 God saves both men and women, desiring they both to hear and obey Him.\u00a0 But God is calling for men to spiritually lead their families, but without waiting on Him how can a man obey this?<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application<\/span>:\u00a0 Men are you more emotionally focused on your job, or your family?\u00a0 Yes you are to be the breadwinner, provider, but remember jobs come and go, you are replaceable at work, but your family only has one husband, one dad.\u00a0 If you die your job will\u00a0 fill your role, but your family won\u2019t.\u00a0 Listen to the voice of God, so you can spiritually lead your family, because this God will hold you accountable for.\u00a0 Women, give your spouse room to lead, pray diligently for him, because as a man and husband I know WE NEED your prayers.\u00a0 Women make sure that you too are hearing from the Lord.\u00a0 And may you together bring your children up in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\u00a0 Here is practical help for family devotional time.\u00a0 Blessings Pastor Phil<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201cThis is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. 19 Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1609","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-pX","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1609","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1609"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1609\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1610,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1609\/revisions\/1610"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1609"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1609"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1609"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1605,"date":"2009-12-22T20:16:04","date_gmt":"2009-12-22T14:46:04","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1605"},"modified":"2009-12-22T23:51:48","modified_gmt":"2009-12-22T18:21:48","slug":"he-takes-knowledge-of-me","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2009\/12\/22\/he-takes-knowledge-of-me\/","title":{"rendered":"He Takes Knowledge Of&nbsp;Me"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p><strong>Psalm 144:3, &#8220;LORD, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are very interesting beings when you think about it. We have issues, we go through changes, we loose sense of directions many times, we deal with fear, we complain and many more stuff. I often wonder why the Almighty Perfect God would keep up with us. Remember God promised to deliver the Israelites from Egypt and bring them to the promised land. As they were being led to the promised land, they complained and mumbled but God was very patient with them. I don&#8217;t know about you but I find it hard to keep up with people who cannot get their acts together. After sometime either you get it together or get lost because I could dedicate that precious time for something else. I\u2019m glad the Lord does not deal with us the same way.<\/p>\n<p>I tend to ask myself this question,<strong> Psalm 144:3, &#8220;LORD, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?\u201d<\/strong> It&#8217;s already been established that there is no one good but God. God does not reach out to us on that basis and the very best we can bring before the Lord has flaws<strong> Isaiah 64:6, &#8220;But we are all like an unclean thing,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> And all our righteousness are like filthy rags<\/span>; We all fade as a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, Have taken us away<\/strong>&#8220;. Remember it does not say &#8220;our SINS are as filthy rags&#8221;, it says &#8220;our righteousness are like filthy rags&#8221;. When God blesses you and not someone else, it&#8217;s not because you are a little better or deserve it, it&#8217;s because of His grace and mercy. Man has issues but He still lifts him up. He may even curse God but He still shows him mercy. It blows my mind more so when the Lord blesses me and I don&#8217;t deserve it at all. At times right in my mess ups, He still steps out to deposit a blessing into my account. It&#8217;s like Lord, don&#8217;t You have something better to do than deal with such a broken vessel?<strong> I&#8217;m amazed that His blessings are not based on who I am and what I can do but on who He is and what he can do. That His blessings are not about me but about Him<\/strong>. That He has chosen to pick me up when no one is around to pick me up. You will agree with me that if you are going through something, people can stand with you up to a certain point and if they see no change, they will call it quits. As for Him,<strong> He is a friend who sticks closer than a brother<\/strong>. All may be tired and leave but He sticks closer. Lord, what is man, that You take knowledge of Him?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m attached to a blessed Vine, what a blessing. Thank God for the Roman soldier who pierced Him on the side. He opened away for me to be grafted in to partake of His blessings through His covenant. I\u2019m blessed in the field; on the mountain; in my going out and in my coming in. I&#8217;m blessed at home and I\u2019m blessed at my job. I&#8217;m not blessed when I receive the blessing, I\u2019m blessed even on the verge of waiting for it for faithful is He that has promised. I have no reason to have this amount of blessing in my account all I know is that He decided to bless me.<strong> Proverbs 10:22, &#8220;The blessing of the LORD makes one rich, And He adds no sorrow with it&#8221;.<\/strong> No one who is blessed has sorrows because blessings are signs of abundance. This goes for spiritual and material blessings. I have joy blessings deposited in my account. I can encourage myself and others in the Lord because He has deposited encouragement blessings in my account. I count my blessings one by one. God was mindful of us, He gave us His Son, the greatest gift to satisfy the demands of the law we couldn\u2019t pay,<strong> 2 Corinthians 5:21, \u201cFor He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him\u201d<\/strong>.

We can\u2019t make it alone, we know that. Just because we don&#8217;t want to be alone does not mean we just need people to help us in one way or another, we may just need company. If you look at a child who is terrified, a parent&#8217;s presence is enough to calm him or her down. He or she may not look to the parent to take the fear away; the presence of a parent is enough to overcome their fear. They believe the parents are bigger than their imaginary monsters that appear real.<\/p>\n<p>What about us believers, at times we are not looking for answers, we are looking for someone to be there with us. Their presence is enough to make us face what we could be running away from. In Joshua&#8217;s case, he always had Moses with him. That made him feel strong and courageous fighting in battles. When Moses was gone, the Lord encouraged him of His presence; He may have seen that He needed His presence now more than ever. And the Lord said to him, &#8220;<strong>Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged&#8221;<\/strong>,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> God wasn\u2019t giving Joshua anything, He was assuring him of His presence and the peace he needed would come about because of God&#8217;s promised presence<\/span><\/strong>.

Three times in Joshua 1, God assures Joshua of His presence,<strong> Joshua 1:5,&#8221;\u2026 as I was with Moses, so I will be with you<\/strong>,<strong> 1:9, &#8220;for the LORD your God is with you&#8221;, 1:17, &#8220;\u2026only the Lord your God be with you&#8221;.<\/strong> God&#8217;s presence alone was enough to take away fear and give him courage to go forward. God was with Joseph in the absence of his father Jacob. Jacob did not even know what became of his son but God was with him in the pit, in portiphar&#8217;s house, in jail and even on the throne. God was with Daniel in the lion&#8217;s den; he was with Shadrach, Meshack and Abednego in the fire; he was with David when he was running away from Saul; he was with Jonah when he tried to flee from His presence; He said to Abraham, in<strong> Genesis 26:3, &#8220;dwell in this land, and<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> I will be with you<\/span> and bless you<\/strong>.

They look at the ASSETS and the LIABILITIES columns as part of their analysis for the business. Assets are properties or things or people of great value, in accounting, they are items on balance sheet that constitute the total value of an organization. Liability has a different description, for the sake of the point I would like to make, I will describe it as something that holds somebody back (organization, business) or causes trouble.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a classic example of a RICH young ruler coming to Jesus with what he considered assets to gain him everlasting life. He comes ready that upon being told what it took to have eternal life, he could pull it out of his bag of good things.<strong> Vs. 21 Jesus said to him, \u201cIf you want to be<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> PERFECT<\/span>, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.\u201d.<\/strong> He admitted to have kept some of the commandments and Jesus seeing that he was determined to have all these in his assets column, he tells him that if he wants his asset column to be perfect, he has to get rid of all that he had. In actuality, Jesus was showing him where his heart was, it was in his money and you cannot serve God and money.<\/p>\n<p>Then Jesus says how hard it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. Of course, we know of rich men who are saved and are being saved. I believe the deeper understanding of this would be someone having what he calls good (declaring himself rich) because he believes he has what it takes to gain eternal life. This is someone who has taken his attempts to be good enough before God and placed it in his asset column. Such would be hard to save; they are trusting in their own merit to gain eternal life. Paul tells us in<strong> Romans 7:9, \u201cI was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. 10<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> And the commandment, which was to bring life, I found to bring death<\/span>. 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me. \u2026 13 Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> what is good<\/span>, \u2026<\/strong> Everything that Paul once considered an asset, something to save him actually brought death, in other words became a liability to him. What was to give him value, trying to keep the law, made it more impossible to gain eternal life. When he thought he was rich with good works it only turned out to condemn him. That\u2019s what condemns people today who consider themselves rich with good works and would not declare themselves bankrupt and trust on Christ riches of righteousness to save them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Proverbs 11:4, \u201cRiches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness delivers from death\u201d<\/strong>, Men\u2019s assets won\u2019t save them in that day only Christ\u2019s rich mercy provides the righteousness he needs to stand before God. Under conviction, Paul filed chapter 11,\u00a0<strong> Philippians 3:7, \u201cBut what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, t<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">hat I may gain Christ 9 and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Are you trusting in your riches to have eternal life, trusting in your good works? If you are, Jesus has a message for you,<strong> Matthew 19: 24 And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.<\/strong>\u201d When you realize that everything you counted on to save you is a liability, tainted with sin, be done with yourself, file chapter 11, declare bankrupt, put all your today\u2019s assets in the liability column and receive Christ who is rich in mercy to grant you the righteousness you need today and everyday. He\u2019s righteousness is the asset you need in your column. When the disciples wondered who could be saved then, Jesus said<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> \u201cWith men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\u201d.<\/span><\/strong> Your salvation and mine are impossible without Him.

The spirit of Jezebel always brings fear, threats and is out to steal your faith and confidence in God. If Elijah called on God to answer by fire and He did, couldn&#8217;t he have believed God for fire to defend him from Jezebel? The bible says that God went before the children of Israel by day as a cloud of wind and by night as<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> a pillar of fire<\/span><\/strong>. Darkness is associated with evil therefore Elijah being threatened was the presence of evil and he needed God to go before him by night as a pillar of fire. Some of us need God to go before us today as a pillar of fire as we face our Jezebel.<\/p>\n<p>After running for his life into the wilderness, praying that his life would be taken away, then fed by God, It&#8217;s an encouragement to us that<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> God cares for his servants in the moments of triumphant and in the moments of defeat. The Lord does not abandon us when we are defeated and we shouldn&#8217;t abandon the Lord when we feel defeated<\/span><\/strong>. A true believer will run to the Lord when his life is under pressure and they feel like giving up, they will also know that their confidence is not in themselves but God. When Elijah ran into\u00a0 the wilderness looking for death only to find life, , God reached out to him. This is the Lord I fall in love with daily. Like Ravi Zacharias always says that, \u201cGod did not hide the scars of our hero\u2019s in the bible\u201d. That even the men of God used mightily had their moments of struggle with sin, fear, battles, challenges you name it and we can identify with them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vs 8, &#8220;So he arose, and ate and drank; and<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights<\/span> as far as Horeb, the mountain of God&#8221;,<\/strong> Given food and drink which kept him running 40 days and 40 nights, wow!!.

God gave Elijah what he needed for that period of time and it was enough to sustain him in the journey God had set for him. I believe the Lord was teaching him that what He had started, He would be faithful to complete it and because He wasn&#8217;t done with Elijah, He would provide all the necessary tools he needed to keep him strong. You will realize that after being fed, never again did he complain that he wanted to die. Remember this, when it gets tough, He is offering to ease your burdens,<strong> Matthew 11:28, &#8220;Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest<\/strong>&#8220;. It&#8217;s not giving up that you need, it&#8217;s the rest you need for the journey is still long. If He was done with you, He would have killed you Himself but the fact that you are alive and kicking is an indication that your journey is not over.<strong> You may be missing in action yet you are being prepared for a come back<\/strong>. God will give you rest, equip you, feed you, reveal Himself to you and will send you back to where you tried to run away from. The only difference is that you are going back as a changed, renewed person.

He challenged the prophets of Baal as one man to prove to them all who the real God was. In other words, 1 man against 450 prophets of Baal. They were all prophets only that one was a true prophet of God and someone had to challenge the theology of the rest. What an awesome opportunity to stand for the Lord. You might be the only believer yet you are not intimidated by the fact that the people surrounding you are not believers, you can stand strong and tall and challenge their stand through your lifestyle, your walk, your message. Elijah did, prevailed and killed all the 450 prophets of Baal. Upon receiving a word of what happened to her prophets, Jezebel threatened to kill Elijah and he ran for his life. How is it that we can have boldness to fight but at times some type of Jezebel threatens us and we run for our lives? Fear is lethal, it cripples. King Ahab was not a threat to Elijah but his wife Jezebel the queen was. That boldness he once had to stand for the Lord is threatened and challenged.\u00a0 Listen to his cry to the Lord<strong> 1Kings 19:4, &#8220;&#8230;And he prayed that he might die, and said, &#8220;It is enough! Now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!\u201d<\/strong> It&#8217;s over, I&#8217;m done, I&#8217;m finished, I can&#8217;t see anything beyond this, I don&#8217;t see any more victories lined up for me, take my life. I can&#8217;t fight any more, it&#8217;s just too much. I caved when the pressure was too much. I conquered many prophets of Baal by God&#8217;s grace but that Jezebel threatened to take my means of livelihood and I couldn&#8217;t help but find a place to hide. Elijah did not see the reason for living anymore and he was right because after all, he would die by Jezebel\u2019s sword but if the Lord did it, he would die peacefully. Couldn\u2019t this man who called fire from heaven stand on the thought of whose he was?<\/p>\n<p>Like I said, God knows what we need better than we do, God knew this man was under pressure. Dying was not what he needed; he needed encouragement, refreshment, rest, food and a time to refocus.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> The Lord responded to his need first before he dealt with his complaint.<\/span> Vs. 5&#8243;&#8230;suddenly an angel touched him, and said to him, &#8220;Arise and eat.\u201d<\/strong> He needed to be away from everything else to be one on one with God. He had a want yet God was only responding to his need. Twice the Lord fed him with bread and water which kept him strong for forty days. My first point for today, God knows your need better than you do.

I prefer the first one as it teaches you to see things through the eyes of faith. Faith negates the facts; it sees beyond the natural and presents a whole new picture of things which produces hope. People can see something the way it is, you are seeing what it can be. That is seeing what you believe. You can be in a situation that everyone has stopped hoping for good out of it like the case of the woman with the issue of blood but when you see far beyond the natural that you can be healed, you can encourage yourself into the victory, trusting in the one who is able. By what people had seen, she had been in her condition for 12 years, by what she was seeing, there was still hope.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> It&#8217;s our perception of things that channels us to see things from either men&#8217;s point of view or God&#8217;s<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.<\/span> If you wait for people to always see it the way you do to agree with you before you move, you will never move.

Is it possible for the Lord to take away temporarily what He has given you because that thing took away your complete faith in Him? Or He could take away something that He knows you can&#8217;t do without and then He becomes your eyes to prove to you that He is in control of every part of your being? Paul (Saul) was persecuting Christians but after encountering with the Lord on the road to Damascus,<strong> Acts 9:8, Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 9, And he was three days without sight<\/strong>&#8220;. His ability to see in the natural was taken away and had to be led for a season. His spiritual eyes were activated at that point and he was never the same again.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> At times what we see with our natural eyes can contaminate what we should see with our spiritual eyes<\/span><\/strong>. For Saul, he was beginning a great journey that needed assurance that it wasn&#8217;t by might nor by power but by the Spirit of the Lord says the Lord of host. He needed more of His spiritual eyes than His physical eyes. One man said when he had his two natural eyes and was living in sin, he was blind but when he came to Christ after loosing one of his physical eyes through an accident, he could clearly see things more than he did with his two eyes. Are not the eyes also the window to the soul? Are not eyes associated with visions?

Had a vision, shared it but the impression you received from people gave you an indication that they did not see it, catch it or maybe were not willing to see it? You sit and wonder why they can&#8217;t see it; you are frustrated as to why they cannot catch it. I&#8217;ve been there, been frustrated until I learnt something new.<\/p>\n<p>If you remember the story of Elisha and the Syrians, Elisha knew the plot they had against the Israelites and he sent a message to warn the king of Israel about it. The Syrians were not too happy with Elisha so they planned to capture him. They came in at night with such a great army and surrounded the city where Elisha was. In the morning his servant wakes up, goes out and sees that they are surrounded and panic strikes in. Before I go further, the scripture tells us that Elisha knew everything they were saying in the inner chambers, closed door meetings. It had to be through a God given vision. If the army came at night, I&#8217;m sure he already knew because he saw them and he still slept through the night peacefully. I want us to understand that there are certain things that are not of the ordinary. You can make a decision that goes past the normal ordinary circumstances and many may begin to freak out as they do not understand why you can make such a move when they do not see something in the natural that can help it to its destination. Many want to be sure before they can adapt or accept a change. You can even be talked into changing your mind. The servant is not at peace because all he can see in the natural is a tough situation. A situation like this had never presented itself. What will you do with people who are not seeing what you see? Elisha wasn&#8217;t even frustrated with his servant for freaking out, he knew his servant had not seen what he saw. I believe that when God gives you a vision, yes there may be panic all around but you with the vision will be at peace about it. You are not seeing in the natural, you are seeing in the spiritual realm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>vs. 15; &#8220;&#8230;Alas; my master! What shall we do?&#8221;\u00a0 16, &#8220;So he answered; &#8220;Do not fear; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them&#8221;.<\/strong> We can encourage people not to be afraid of the new move still few will embrace it. Elisha was seeing that there were more with them than those surrounding them. There is less in the natural (just them two) and there are more with them in the spiritual realm.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> The natural eyes perceive of now situation, the spiritual eyes perceives of something greater<\/span><\/strong>. Instead of Elisha rebuking, condemning, or being frustrated with his servant, here is what he did<strong> 2 Kings 6:17, &#8220;And Elisha<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> prayed,<\/span> and said, &#8220;LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.&#8221; Then the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw&#8221;.<\/strong> This is the best thing you can do for those who are not seeing the vision or for those you want to catch the vision you have. Not praying about them but praying for them for God to open their eyes to see what you see, to experience what you experience. Don&#8217;t condemn or discourage someone about what they are doing till you first find out and understand why they do things the way they do. I have been rebuked by some people about the way I present the gospel and I normally say, &#8220;before you rebuke me, find out why I share my faith the way I do&#8221; and many times they come back to agree with me about how I share my faith because they now see what I see.

What concerned them most was not when the promises were to be fulfilled but what they had to do in order to receive the promise. They were concerned also about the correct paths or ways they were to take to lead them to the promises in the now and then life. In their lifetime, they did not see the final promised blessing of the redeemed. Their primary hope was for was eternal life with God in a heavenly homeland (Where there is true homeland eternal security). They fixed their eyes on the new citizenship in the new heaven and new earth.

On the long life\u2019s journey to the destinations God has determined for us, one thing is critical, if we are to reach the destinations: and that is having correct map. A map is simply what shows the right way of getting to a destination from the point where one is. A map is about a territory. It is not the territory. It shows points and locations in the territory. Christians are citizens of two territories: the earth, where we live right now and the heavenly kingdom where we are headed. On earth, we are called pilgrims or strangers or sojourners. In other words, we don\u2019t belong here permanently. Our permanent citizenship is heaven. But while we are here, on a journey, we have dreams, goals, wishes, hopes and desires which we would like to achieve, acquire or reach. And, it is in God\u2019s best interest that we successfully reach the destinations. These things are in the territory of life. Do you know where they are? Do you know how to get there? Can you be able to tell when you arrive or whether you should still be on the road? These are important questions to ask on your way to your destiny.<strong> Faith is wonderful and you cannot do without it. But accurate roadmap is crucial. The Word of God is your accurate roadmap.

If the Son of God was tempted in the wilderness to reveal his strength, for sure we will be tempted to find where our strength lies. Jesus won because He was sober and vigilant on the other hand Samson slept and the enemy cut his hair (lost the presence of God). I would rather loose everything but not the presence of God. The enemy only wins when men are a sleep.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vs. 20, &#8220;And she said, &#8220;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&#8221; So he awoke from his sleep, and said, &#8220;I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free!&#8221; But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him<\/strong>&#8220;. You toy with sin, God may still let you retain the anointing for a season and if there is no room for repentance, don\u2019t be surprised if He lifts His anointing (presence) off you. David&#8217;s prayer in repentance after he sinned was<strong> Psalm 51:8, &#8220;Do not cast me away from Your presence, And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me<\/strong>&#8220;. Not even once did I hear Samson confess to have messed up, asking God for forgiveness and praying that His presence would not leave him. When the presence of God had departed, he was left vulnerable with no strength to fight back. All he ever did cost him his eyes and because God was not in control of his life at this moment, he became a slave to the Philistines with no eyes because they plucked them out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Judges 16:28, &#8220;Then Samson called to the LORD; saying; &#8220;O Lord GOD; remember me; I pray! Strengthen me; I pray; just this once; O God; that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes!&#8221;.<\/strong> Can we say he had a lot of chances to get things straight? Was God done with him? Did God schedule for him to die this soon and die in the hands of the enemy? He was born for a reason and even in the midst of his foolish moves, God still accomplished his plan. Can we say that God was more concerned about what to do to the enemy than He cared about Samson as a person?<strong> I believe God will do His part and let you do yours<\/strong>. So Samson had one last chance to get things right with God and instead, he is seeing an opportunity for revenge for his eyes (self) and he sincerely prays one last prayer. At times if we insist on having our way, be sure God may let you have your way. It may not be His will, but your will. The Israelites cried to God for a king. God took time to show them how an earthly king would treat them but they refused to listen. God wanted to be their king but because they persisted, he turned them loose and gave them what they wanted and you know the rest of the story. And God gave Samson his last request, the bible says that he destroyed more enemies in his death than he did in his life, Jesus also destroyed more enemies in His death than He did in His life. Started well, finished poorly, his weaknesses out of control brought him down. Don&#8217;t let what God is doing in your life cloud your vision, let His hands be upon everything He is doing, Let Him sit on those weakness that want to be out of control, ask Him not to cast you from his presence, let what He has invested in you not be about you but about His business that you may finish the race with joy. Just like Samson, you too are born for a reason, the question is, \u201cwill you start and finish strong?\u201d.

Revenge in simple words is action taken in return for an injury or offense. It&#8217;s also to inflict punishment in return. If a person does a good thing to you, can you do the same and call it revenge? No because revenge is a punishment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Judges 15:7, &#8220;Samson said to them, &#8220;Since you would do a thing like this, I will surely take revenge on you, and after that I will cease&#8221;<\/strong> Samson had left his wife in Philistine when he went back to his home. I don&#8217;t know why he did not take his wife with him, may be because she would not be welcomed in his home. He comes back to check on his wife and finds that his wife was given to his companion. He gets angry, seeks revenge by going to the field, and catches 300 foxes. He ties their tails two by two, set their tales on fire and let&#8217;s them run in the Philistines field burning it down. Was his anger justified? Did his anger need to be directed to other people who were not involved with this issue?. Watch this, instead of dealing with his in-laws, he directed his revenge to the Philistines and the philistines directed their revenge to his in laws and he revenges by slaughtering men.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Revenge does more harm than good<\/span><\/strong>. How many times did David have opportunities to revenge on Saul and yet he did not? I see a lot of &#8220;I and &#8220;ME&#8221; which is about self in Samson&#8217;s story. We are not anointed for self, in fact the anointing in our lives is not even about us or for us, what&#8217;s in your vessel is for those whom God wanted that anointing to reach. Jesus said<strong>, Luke 4:18, &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because God has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor&#8230;, &#8220;, Acts 10:38, &#8220;how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him<\/strong>&#8220;. Jesus had more enemies than anyone yet he did good unto them. Even those who crucified Him, He had the power to revenge by calling fire from heaven to consume them. His prayer was, &#8220;<strong>Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing<\/strong>&#8220;. Everything that He did was not about self, He was doing them to please the Father. Samson on the other hand, everything that he did, all came back to self. Your position is not about you but about Him (God). Joseph rose to power and he knew God had raised him for a reason, he used his position to serve others. So was Esther, Solomon, David, Stephen, Paul and the rest who took what God had placed in their lives to serve others and God blessed them. They had people on their cases but they let God fight for them. Stand firm, do all you can for the Lord with what He has given you, ask the Lord to deal with those you would want to take revenge on. I believe God would have dealt with the Philistines in his own way, I don\u2019t think how Samson went about it is the way He had planned though it still accomplished His purpose.

You\u2019ve heard people say &#8220;I was born this way&#8221;, in other words, I was born with this weakness or this problem and there is no way I can ever change. At times blaming the community or people around you for the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I don&#8217;t hear anything about a child born a thief, liar or a murderer; it\u2019s the choices one makes. Remember when I said that either we become servants of the Lord or slaves to our flesh, it plays major role in here. You can trace it&#8217;s origin from the heart and intent.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I also believe that what was meant to be a blessing can be a destroyer if the blesser is not in charge of the blessing<\/strong>. My prayer is, &#8220;If You are going to bless me God, let your hand be on me and the blessing. Jabez understood that the blessing could be a curse in his life if God&#8217;s hand was not on it. This was his prayer,<strong> 1 Chronicles 4:10, &#8220;&#8230; &#8220;Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain<\/span>!&#8221; So God granted him what he requested. Romans 14:9, &#8220;For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living<\/strong>.&#8221; If Jesus is not the Lord of my life, I would become wild, in other words the things that should be under His control would be on the loose, out of control running wild. Deep within my heart there are things if the Lord was not sitting on as Lord, ugly things would surface. I don&#8217;t even want to think about what I could have turned out to be without Him. In our text we see a man being used of God; also we are seeing some of his weaknesses on the loose running wild. These are the same things that eventually brought him down.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Judges 14:19, &#8220;&#8230;So his anger was aroused, and he went back up to his father&#8217;s house<\/strong>&#8220;. He retrieved honey from a lion he had killed. He did not mention it to his parents because he knew they would not approve of it. He uses the situation as a riddle, when the men with him could not tell what it was; they used his wife to get it out of him. He gets angry, goes to the field and kills thirty men, takes their stuff to pay the men who interpreted his riddle.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> When you don&#8217;t understand the purpose of having power or ability and leadership position, there is a possibility you will abuse the power<\/span><\/strong>. Getting angry and unleashing it on other people who did not anger you is unwise. People get angry somewhere else and bring it to their work place or bring it to their homes. Hot tempered people at times lash out what is inside without the thought of damage it will have on someone else. I believe this is selfishness in the sense, if you can find what will cool you down, it doesn&#8217;t matter who else is affected by it, you will unleash it. The Israelites caused Moses to get angry. Instead of Moses obeying God, he disobeyed Him by striking the rock instead of speaking to it as God had instructed. God knew it was the people who caused him to be angry yet God held him accountable for his actions. His anger was directed in the wrong direction. God knows that in anger it&#8217;s very easy to sin and so we are told<strong> Ephesians 4:26, &#8220;Be angry, and do not sin&#8221;. Anger is an acid that destroys the vessel in which it&#8217;s stored in. Anger is one letter short for D<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">ANGER<\/span>. Even God is slow to anger.<\/strong> Check out if you have hot temper and anger on the loose running wild, don&#8217;t let it affect what God is doing and wants to do in your life. Let Him sit on it, He is the Lord over the weakness that wants to run wild.

Strengthen me; I pray; just this once; O God; that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes!&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of all the people God ever used, I believe Samson had the greatest physical strength. Clearly looking at other individuals, I would say that God gave them spiritual strength, in other words they called things through the power that was given to them. In as much as men like David and Joshua were warriors, they had armies to back them up unlike Samson a one man army who battled many.<\/p>\n<p>He had dreadlocks if you would allow me to use that word; a national hero chosen by God, a man endowed by physical strength but had four weaknesses. . He had a weakness for women, was a tempered man,\u00a0 vengeful, and was full of himself. The bible says that where there is good, evil is also present (paraphrased) and what brings a man of God or woman to their destiny is what he or she has allowed to control them.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Either you become a servant of God or a slave to the flesh<\/span><\/strong>. In his weakness, he desired women from his enemies\u2019 side. Going against what his parents had taught him. He ignored the values they instilled in him through the guidance the angel of the Lord had given them before Samson was conceived. This was his problem, rebellion.<\/p>\n<p>You can be anointed and used mightily by God but when you begin to go against values and morals you were taught or even look at some and twist them to fit your desires, you will be walking on a very dangerous path and that\u2019s for sure. One who is being used of God still needs guidance and teachings. You play with fire and you will get burnt. Some say they were born with a weakness, I say they made provision for the flesh.<strong> Judges 16:1, &#8220;Then Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went into her. vs. 3, and Samson lay till midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts&#8221;.<\/strong> Just sinned but I still got the power (anointing). I tell you the truth, we too can be deceived to think that when we sin and still feel the anointing in our lives, we can conclude that it was okay or not that bad or acceptable before God.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> It\u2019s possible to be used and be disqualified<\/span><\/strong>. That scares me because I would rather not be used but know that I will enter the Kingdom of God than be used and be disqualified. Listen to Paul speaking, 1<strong> Corinthians 9:27, &#8220;But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified<\/strong>&#8220;. The difference between Samson and David is, David had the same weakness yet he learnt the art of seeking forgiveness. He learnt to cry out to God in his weakness (Psalm 51). He says in<strong> Psalm 51:11, &#8220;Don\u2019t take Your Holy Spirit from me<\/strong>&#8220;, in other words; don&#8217;t let your presence leave me. He would check to make sure that he was not being used while he wasn\u2019t in the right path<strong>. Psalm 139:23, &#8220;Search me, Oh God and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts. Vs 24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting<\/strong>&#8220;.

I know that God has something for us. My prayer is that we will take something out of this and apply it to our lives.<\/p>\n<p>The story of Samson is very familiar to us; normally it is referred to as the story of Samson and Delilah. Samson was no ordinary child when he was born. His mother was barren and the angel of the Lord visited her and promised her a child. Samson was a promised son so was Isaac, John the Baptist and Jesus. If you take a closer look at the promised sons, you will see that their mothers were given special instructions as to handle their pregnancies and the babies when they were born. They were promised sons for a reason. God had something in store for them that only they could fulfill. They were sons of destiny, they were born with a calling already not like other people in the bible who God called and made them prophets, kings, priests at a later time. Samson was a Nazirite to God from the womb; the Nazirites were to be consecrated in service to the Lord. They were not to drink wine or similar drinks, they were also not to eat unclean things, and they were to be set a part for God&#8217;s service. I am not a shamed to say that I am a Nazirite not by physical birth but spiritual birth. I am consecrated to God&#8217;s service. I am adopted into His son ship and I am not afraid to call Him Abba Father.<strong> Galatians 4:6, &#8220;And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &#8220;Abba, Father!\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>24, &#8220;So the woman bore a son and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him. 25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move upon him at Mahaneh Dan&#8221;.<\/strong> Whenever God is raising an individual to do is work, He first puts him in reserve in readiness for the calling He has for that individual. A lot of teachings, guidance through the wisdom He gives to the Spiritual fathers or natural fathers and then in due time He takes over to work with them in their calling. Samson grew and so was his hair which symbolized the presence of the Spirit of God in his life. Blood on the door post of the Israelites doors was to show the angel of death those that God had set apart so that they would not be touched. God had given instructions for the blood to be applied on the door. To me that was like a reminder of His promise to the Israelites, &#8220;When I see the blood, I will pass over you&#8221;. The same with Samson&#8217;s hair, it was a reminder that He was born for a reason and there was a calling in his life.<\/p>\n<p>If you are born a Nazirite (born again), whether you believe it or not, God has a calling for you. He has something in store for you that only you will be able to perform. There are many who still don&#8217;t know what their calling is, be still, God will show you.

Everything God does, He does that He may get glory out of men. You begin to take the glory; He will take the gift and place it on someone else who will give Him glory.<\/p>\n<p>Here is Hannah who had a loving and caring husband. She was married to Elkanah who had also another wife called Peninnah. We are not told who the first wife was, but we know that Elkanah loved Hannah more than Peninnah for we see how they get treated when it comes to getting gifts.<strong> Vs 4&amp;5, &#8220;And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife&#8230; vs. 4 But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah&#8221;<\/strong>.\u00a0 Now God had blessed Peninnah with children meanwhile Hannah was barren for the Lord had closed her womb. Being that she was loved and cared for, given more attention, more material things someone would think that would give her all the joy and the happiness not in Hannah\u2019s case. In life, we see people who have everything and other people think that should make them happy yet these are some of the most miserable folks why?<strong> Relationships are more fulfilling than possessions.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I believe she was okay with the whole situation until her rival Peninnah began to provoke her severely to make her miserable according to Vs 6. I\u2019m not surprised for I saw this between Jacob\u2019s wives, Leah and Rachel. Leah had children while Rachel did not, Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and therefore Leah provoked her daily and that made Rachel desire a child. Hannah was provoked so much that she desired a child of her own too. We can be provoked by people around us to desire bigger cars, bigger houses, bigger promotions, bigger ministries or anything that someone could provoke you to want to have but the question is, what is the motive?. Yes they are good things and can be desired but the motive for desiring them can be wrong. &#8220;I want to be big that I may fit in, or feel better than someone else, or not feel rejected, or that my pride may get the best of me&#8221;<strong> James 4:3, &#8220;Ye ask and receive not, because you ask a miss, that you may consume it<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> upon your lusts<\/span>&#8220;.<\/strong> At times we don&#8217;t ask but many times when we ask good things we find later they were for wrong reasons. Hannah desired a child, the question is, what was her motive? Did she want a child to get back at her rival,\u00a0 or a child so as not to feel left out or out of place, or not to be under attack any anymore? This could have been her motive and therefore year in year out she prayed but God would not answer her prayers. Don&#8217;t blame God now for not answering your prayers when you know for sure that if He answered them, you will not go to church anymore, you will not give Him glory due to Him, and your pride will take over. God will not give you what He knows will destroy you until you begin to get your act right. Some desire boyfriend or girlfriend, husband or wives, desire to be anointed and used of God etc, the question is what is your motive?<\/p>\n<p>Hannah knew that her prayers were selfish prayers and God would not answer until she changed the way she prayed.<strong> vs. 11, &#8220;Then She made avow and said, &#8220;O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maid servant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, no razor shall come upon his head&#8221;.<\/strong> This is what I call praying with a purpose, this is the type of prayer that supersedes our selfish desires and ambitions for we begin to see that anything God is going to bring our way is not for us but for His glory and to reach many. He may entrust it in our custody but it&#8217;s not for us. Her vow was to allow her son to be God&#8217;s servant all the days of his life and God must have said, &#8220;I\u2019ve been waiting for you to pray like this for now I know for sure that honor and glory will come back to Me&#8221;. After she prayed this prayer, her desire was granted.<\/p>\n<p>Now I understand why many people cannot be used of God for God knows that they will love the praises of men and He will not get any of it.<strong> 2Cor 4:7, &#8220;But we have this treasure in the earthen vessels that the excellence of the power maybe of God and not of us&#8221;.<\/strong> The bible says that our God<strong> is a jealous God<\/strong> and He will not share His glory with any one else. When I pray a promotion, a better place to live, to be used more is because I want to glorify Him in all things and others may be blessed too, it&#8217;s all about Him. My motive is to build a testimony that many may know that God is able Read Ezekiel 36:22-. John the Baptist was told that Jesus was doing the work that John should have been doing, here was his response,<strong> John 3:30, &#8220;He must increase, that I may decrease&#8221;.<\/strong> Because of Hannah&#8217;s change of prayer attitude, Samuel is born to become one of the greatest prophets for he served many. Yes the mother rejoiced to have received a male child, but God used His gift to the woman to reach out to many. Rachel bore Joseph who became mighty for he reached many. What is that thing you have desire and prayed about? what was your motive?

We all know this story. David comes to the field and his main and only job in the field is to check on his brothers and bring them food. Watch how the Lord opens a door to glorify His name through this young man. The Philistines threatened Israelites by a reason of the giant in their team. No one in Israel could face the giant; they had forgotten that God was their giant. David shows up to find Goliath threatening and defying the armies of God, he then said vs. 26,<strong> &#8220;&#8230;who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?&#8221;, vs. 37, &#8220;Moreover David said, &#8220;The LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.&#8221;<\/strong> David could only speak in this manner because he knew who God was (is). He knew what God was cable of doing, he delighted himself in the Lord and he knew the Lord would be pleased with the move. God had opened a door for him and all he needed to do was walk through it. He was in God&#8217;s will and you know what happened.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Hannah in 1 Samuel 1, God had something in store for her, instead of speaking it directly to her, He allowed Penninah, her husband&#8217;s other wife to provoke her. It built such a great desire in her heart for a son. I don&#8217;t know how much she knew the Lord because year after year she prayed that God would bless her and the Lord did not. I like her spirit, she knew that having a child was acceptable therefore she couldn&#8217;t quit. The more she spent time in the presence of God, the more she got to know Him, the more her selfish desires for a child melted a way and this was her prayer that opened doors for her blessing,<strong> 1 Samuel 1:11, &#8220;Then she made a vow and said, &#8220;O LORD of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, &#8230;&#8221;.<\/strong> God showed her something and that became the desire of her heart and we know that the male child Samuel\u00a0 God anointed to be a prophet. God was glorified in Samuel&#8217;s work.<\/p>\n<p>Then here comes Esther a slave girl. An opportunity arose and she was encouraged to step in to fill in the position for a new queen. God opened a door for her to make a difference without her even knowing. The Jews were being mistreated and something had to happen for this to stop. At one point it was about herself but listen to what her uncle tells her,<strong> Esther 4:14, &#8220;For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father&#8217;s house will perish.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this<\/span>?&#8221;<\/strong>. Esther had an opportunity to glorify God through delivering the Jews using her position. Isn&#8217;t it amazing that when you know God, you become sensitive to the things He is doing?. I heard of a song, &#8220;God has given me a window and I can finally see the light&#8221;. I now know when God is giving me a window, it becomes clear and clearer as you get to know Him more and more.<\/p>\n<p>How about Peter in Mathew 14, the man who walked on water besides Jesus. He saw Jesus walking on water, he had walked with Jesus to know what was acceptable. Jesus had said, greater works than these shall ye do so why not do what Jesus was doing, walk on water?. Peter saw an opportunity to strengthen his faith and the faith of those who were in the boat and he said<strong> vs. 28, &#8220;&#8230;, &#8220;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&#8221; 29 So He said, &#8220;Come.&#8221; And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus&#8221;. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Time fails me to talk about others in the bible who over and over again God commends them for their initiative acts for His glory. God said, &#8220;I<strong> will write my laws in their hearts and they will know what to do without me even telling them&#8221; (paraphrased<\/strong>). Yes there are some that you have to clearly hear the Lord but there are some that He shows you, opens the doors and you do your part. What did the people I just shared with have in common, they did it with all their heart not for them but unto God,<strong> Colossians 3:23, &#8220;And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men&#8221;.<\/strong> And because of their humility God exalted them in due season. Their aim was to please the Lord in all that they did. They had known what He would require and God reached out to bless them,<strong> James 4:10, &#8220;Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up&#8221;.<\/strong> I have applied these principles in my walk with God and God has been glorified in each step and He has lifted me up in due time.

Fruits have always been known as the result of what was done before. If you plant an orange tree, your aim is to get orange fruits in the right season and so is any other tree you plant expecting fruits. In the garden of Eden, God planted trees with fruits on them. Adam and Eve were told of the trees they could eat fruit off and the one they could not eat from. God did not just tell them not to eat from it but also gave them reasons why. There is something about the fruit, they are the outcome, the result of ones labor. I believe that the fruit is a result of what is happening behind the closed doors, behind the curtains, that which is not seen. If I plant a tree hoping to get fruit, I want to be sure that it&#8217;s planted on the right soil, the ground is prepared and that it will have it&#8217;s roots down deep in the soil. As I continue to work around the tree, it will begin to grow and spread it&#8217;s leaves. However beautiful or big the tree might look like, I will not be satisfied until I see fruit.<\/p>\n<p>Twice I\u2019ve heard different parents tell me their children are saved, they just don\u2019t know it. Of course, they are living in rebellion against God, away from church but they believe (head knowledge) and at one time in their lives, they made a decision. You look at their lifestyle; you see little or no Godly fruit. God is not impressed with fruit not leaves,<strong> Psalm 1:3, &#8220;He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper<\/strong>&#8220;. The river of the living water plants you, your roots will go deeper and deeper as the water provides the nutrients the tree needs that it might bring fruit. You bear the right fruit; God will prosper you in all you do. Jesus one time was walking by and saw a tree that should have been bearing fruit, it looked healthy and nice but it was lacking the reason for it&#8217;s existence. When Jesus did not find any fruit on it, He cursed it and the tree dried up.<strong> God is interested in us bearing fruit cause it shows where we are connected. John 15:2, &#8220;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes it away<\/strong>&#8220;. The wellspring of righteousness flows from Christ, the Living Water. A believer who has the root of righteousness will\u00a0<strong> &#8220;bear fruit worthy of repentance&#8221; Matthew 3:8<\/strong>, this fruit is an evidence of growth, it tells you more about the condition of the soil and the roots.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Proverbs 11:30, &#8220;The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, And he who wins souls is wise&#8221;.<\/strong> People ought to enjoy the fruit from your tree, I remember when God called me into ministry, and He showed me that first He would transplant me from a soil I was familiar with to one I was not. He showed me that my leaves would wither and dry and I would look like I will not make it. That would be the beginning of His work in me. He said that once He was done with me, I will be a big tree with a lot of leaves creating a space for those who will need shed of encouragement will come and sit under the tree when the scotch of the sun of discouragement was too hot. In addition, He also said that I will bear fruit and many will come to eat off this tree. This was 12 years ago and now it has come to pass why? The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; you give life when you give out your godly fruit. You have the fruit of salvation, are you sharing it with someone? The bible says, &#8220;<strong>He who wins souls is wise&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A believer who continues to bear fruit God will give them grace and strength to bear fruit even in the old age,<strong> Psalm 92:14, &#8220;They shall still bear fruit in old age; They shall be fresh and flourishing&#8221;.<\/strong> Lord help us lay before you the first fruit of our income, we want to bear the fruit of the Spirit, we want to grow more. We are thankful you brought us this far but we are not satisfied where we are. We want to have the evidence of our growth revealed by how we bear fruit, Your word says in<strong> Mathew 7:16, &#8220;You will know them by their fruit&#8221;.<\/strong> Let people see your fruit in us as we look to see it in other people&#8217;s lives.

This is foolishness. The question to be asked is not how badly we were wronged but what are we profited by our forgiveness<\/strong>?\u201d\u00a0 Excerpt from Esther Huish\u2019s Diary<\/p>\n<p>I would like for us to think about a simple, but vital concept that is central to the Christian faith and one, which if understood and applied daily in our walk with Christ will assure us victorious living and godly relationship with God and men, and that is: putting off and putting on. To be a Christian, you must, first put off something and then, put on something and maintain the practice and process as long as you live. The question is; \u201cWhat is it that we must put off and put on?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Colossians 3:5-10, the Bible is clear on what must be put off &#8211; sin. The reason is because sin brings the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience (vse.6) Before you became a believer, you walked in sin, lived in sin, enjoyed sin, boasted of sin, clutched to sin, adored sin. Sin was your life and your life was nothing but sinful. We all know what sins had ruled and ruined our lives. Nevertheless, when we came to Christ, acknowledged our sins, repented of them and asked for forgiveness by faith, we received salvation-freely. However, as we walk and live daily with Christ, we still encounter situations which tempt us to sin, again. That is why it is important to practice putting off sin from our lives daily and putting on righteousness on daily basis.<\/p>\n<p>Putting off is not easy. There are some sins we love to cling to and those that are difficult to put off. Whatever the case may be, we don\u2019t have options. We only have one, and that is: we must put off whatever sins we are aware in our life. When it comes to putting off sin and putting on the things of God, there are no electives. There are only requirements. Un-forgiveness, resentment, bitterness, hatred, for example, are sins we must put off from our lives. When people offend you, for whatever reason, the tendency usually is to resent, hate and not forgive them. When you are deeply hurt, it is very difficult to forgive and love the person who has hurt you. It is worse when the person or persons involved are people you love, care about and are every close to you. What should you do? Put off un-forgiveness, resentment, hatred and bitterness which you may be having. What you don\u2019t put off will stay inside you and will hurt you more. To free yourself, you must forgive as you also have been forgiven. If you don\u2019t forgive others, you can\u2019t be forgiven. Moreover, if you are not forgiven, then you are equally guilty like those you have a problem forgiving and both of you now are on same level and are subject to God\u2019s wrath. As a child of God, you need to put away the sin, and put on the new man and walk in love. \u201c<strong>But now you also put off all these; anger, bad temper\u2026\u201d Colossians 3:8<\/strong> and may I add, resentment and un-forgiveness. Instead put on love, peace, truth, joy, holiness, without which, no man shall see God. \u201c<strong>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long suffering; forbearing one another and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all things, put on Love, which is the bond of perfect-ness.\u201d Colossians 3\u201d12-14<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, let it be known to you there is no profit in un-forgiveness, but there is great gain in forgiveness. Do you have any resentment toward anybody? Have you been badly hurt by someone and for so long you have not been able to forgive? Today, with the help of God, you can forgive and rid yourself of the consequences of un-forgiveness. Don\u2019t clutch to resentment. There is no treasure or profit to be gained from holding on to any sin. Put sin off and then put on the garment of righteousness. Forgive someone today. If you can, let them know.

Whether it happens in your lifetime or not, doesn\u2019t really matter. The fact remains He is coming! Are you ready to meet Him? Not as your personal Savior but as The Judge of the whole world? All of us will have to meet Him as Judge to decide our eternal fate.<strong> Hebrews 9:27<\/strong> confirms that after this life, and we will all die, the judgment will follow<strong>: And it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before Jesus came on earth, He was not called the Judge. In Heaven He was called: God, the Living Word, the Prince of Peace, Almighty, the Divine One etc. When He stepped into the world, He acquired a new name: Emmanuel meaning God with us; He was also named Jesus-meaning the Savior. He was also called other names such as: the Lamb of God that takes away our sins, Lord, King of Kings, the Christ, Son of God etc. All these names portrayed Jesus as loving, caring, forgiving, friend of sinners, enemy of sin, death, sickness and disease etc. And He truly was all those and more.<\/p>\n<p>After His death and resurrection, He ascended into glory and sat at the Father\u2019s right hand. The Father exalted Him and gave Him a name above all names and commanded everything in Heaven, on Earth and under the Earth to bow before Him and confess that He is Lord (see Philippians 2:9-11 ). He also became the High Priest for all believers, to advocate for us before the Father and to help us overcome all our infirmities (see Hebrews 4:14-16).<\/p>\n<p>Now, in His second and final return to earth, He will come with a new name and a new role. This time not as Savior, to forgive sins and save mankind, but as Judge to judge mankind. He is coming as &#8220;Judge Jesus&#8221;. He will judge the world and decide the fate of every one. Your fate will be decided based on your deeds here on earth, now. If convicted, Hell will be the destiny (read Mathew 25:31-46); if acquitted, Heaven will be the celestial home for ever (see John 14:1-3, Mathew 25:34). Ready or not, everybody will meet &#8220;Jesus the Judge&#8221;. He will judge justly. There will be no favoritism, nor mercy. Grace will have exhausted its limits. The &#8220;records&#8221; will reveal it all and will be the only evidence permissible in His courtroom for consideration for acquittal or condemnation.<strong> Do you know what is in your record<\/strong>? What do you think your record could get you if you faced Judge Jesus today? Heaven or Hell?<\/p>\n<p>Now this is a serious matter. It is a matter of life and death. I mean everlasting life or everlasting death. The judgment will truly take place. John, in the book of Revelation, saw the Judgment Seat and the Judgment process. This is how he described what he saw: &#8220;<strong>And I saw a great white throne and Him (Jesus-the Judge) who sat upon it. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> And if anyone\u2019s name was not found in the book of life<\/span>, he was throne in the lake of fire. Rev. 21:11-15.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The time to put things right before meeting the judge is now whether you are a Christian or not. Examine your life. Right all wrongs. Repent of your sins today if need be, then\u00a0 trust the Savior to save you. Maintain a holy life and walk with God daily. Life is short and you don\u2019t know the time, your time. Don\u2019t struggle to ready any one before you are ready yourself first. Pray for God\u2019s strength and guidance. Amen!

By faith flavors we favor, I mean, for example, denominations, churches, doctrines, teachings, personalities, preachers etc. we favor preaching and practicing the opposite of the true Faith.<strong> Faith flavors we favor a constant confusion for sinners to be won for Christ and for saints to be edified by them (nourished) in the Church of Jesus Christ. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The faith flavors are so many and ubiquitous these days that it\u2019s no longer an easy task to decide what to believe and who to follow or which church or denomination to belong to or follow. Do we really need all the numerous and confusing faith flavors in order to know God? I mean the flavors, most of which are, made out of our own recipes? It seems like the original Christian message recipe has been changed to something more appealing to human appetite and sensation but certainly not godly. We have a lot of people and churches who, even though they confess Christ and are in ministry, have a form of godliness and they deny the power of God. Should true believers be part of such?<\/p>\n<p>Who changed the Gospel recipe anyway? Has it ever been necessary, advisable or permissible to change the original faith recipe which was formulated, established, practiced and proclaimed first, by Jesus Christ, the author and finisher of our faith and then by the Apostles and also by great men and women of the Faith who have stuck to the original Gospel message which is the only &#8220;faith flavor&#8221; found in the Bible? Isn\u2019t the Bible God\u2019s absolute, authentic, and infallible recipe for Salvation of all mankind from original sin and all sinfulness and evil in the world today? Why so much deviation?<\/p>\n<p>The today\u2019s &#8220;<strong>faith flavors we favor&#8221;<\/strong> seems desirable, delightful and delicious to many but, are they divine? What about purity: Are they pure? Are they safe? Are they humanly engineered or God ordained? Are the &#8220;<strong>faith flavors we favor&#8221;<\/strong> preachers and crusaders motivated by their own personal agenda or are they obeying the Lord\u2019s commission to preach the only one acceptable and holy flavor of faith: faith in Christ Jesus, God the Father and the Holy Spirit as the only way to be reconciled to God in order to escape eternal damnation in hell and live eternally with God in Heaven?<\/p>\n<p>Why is Christianity today so powerless, confusing and corrupt? Christianity cannot be powerful and pure if its message is impure. When the Gospel is corrupted by human theology, ideology, philosophy, mythology, belief, and worldliness etc., Christianity and the Church can no longer remain pure. Hence, Christianity ceases to be truly Christ\u2019s Christianity birthing Christ\u2019s Church, because God is holy and pure and cannot be associated with evil, corruption and unrighteousness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Christianity should not come in many flavors and be preferred like flavored Ice Cream; true Christianity comes in one flavor and teaches that taking up individual Cross and following the Christ of the Cross who is also the founder and defender of the Christian faith is the only option for experiencing true Christianity. Such experience follows salvation by faith. For by grace are ye saved through faith, and not by your own righteousness earned by good works or by obedience to the Law. \u201cJesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever (Hebrews 13:8) and Christianity which He founded is the same, too, yesterday, today and forever.\u00a0 Which flavor or whose flavor would you rather have? <\/strong> What flavor are you offering?

I don&#8217;t believe Christians can be<strong> demon possessed, but I believe they<\/strong> can be<strong> demon oppressed.<\/strong> The difference between the two words is this, possessed is to be owned while oppressed to be dominated which is the opposite of liberty. The bible says,<strong> &#8220;It shall come to pass in that day that his burden will be taken away from your shoulder&#8221;<\/strong> the burdens are the baggages; the heavy stuff the enemy puts on believers to oppress them. If you have heavy baggage on your shoulder or back the heaviness will weigh down on you such that you slump a little. You cannot walk faster and you cannot be happy simply because you are so much oppressed by baggages of fear, anxiety, confusion, frustration, stress you name it. The good news is that, there is hope. It will come to PASS in that day which is now that the burden will be taken off our shoulders. But that&#8217;s not enough, the next thing &#8220;<strong>And his yoke from your neck&#8221;.<\/strong> The yoke in the text is considered as a controlling device if you look at bulls with the yokes around their necks, they are usually limited in that the two bulls have to go in the same direction.. They are yoked to something else that controls their movement and some believers are in the same dilemma, being controlled by this kind of yoke.<\/p>\n<p>I thank God for the anointing that destroys the yoke of the enemy. I have been wondering why the bible does not use the word BREAK instead DESTROY. If it&#8217;s broken, it can be restored, put back together but if it&#8217;s destroyed, it&#8217;s done. Are you feeling like you are oppressed and need freedom, God is in control and He desires to set His children free from oppression. The bible says that<strong> whosoever the Son sets free is free indeed<\/strong>. I refuse to be the devils little toy he can control and manipulate\u00a0<strong> 2Cor 10:4&amp;5, &#8220;for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal (God&#8217;s word), but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds, casting down imaginations and anything that exalt itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity under the obedience of Christ&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I could stop here with the anointing breaking the yoke and being free but I can&#8217;t for there is still a little problem leaving it at this stage. Remember Jesus was tempted and He overcame in the wilderness and the devil left him for a season? So are you, if loosed from and not led to, the devil will only leave you for a season before he comes back. You have been loosed from the yoke of the enemy, now take the yoke of the Lord,<strong> Mathew 11:28-30, &#8220;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> my yoke<\/span> upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light<\/span>.<\/strong> The devil may not mind someone being loosed from\u00a0 he knows he&#8217;ll be back\u00a0 but when you decide to be led to another yoke, he can&#8217;t handle that.

Even Moses who was strong to lead the Israelites out of the land of Egypt needed someone to help him bear the burdens. At one point while Joshua was battling Amalekites, their victory depended on Moses keeping his hands raised up high. In that process, Moses\u2019 hand got tired, thank God for Aaron and Hur \u201c<strong>they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it.

It\u2019s shameful for us believers to let those who are battling, battle alone. If we are in a season of victory, we should trust God to direct us to help bear burdens of those living in defeat. I\u2019ve discovered with the Lord, sometimes is not when you have everything in place that he sends someone, at times is when you have little or nothing to give that\u2019s when he sends someone your way. In 1King 17, God sent Elijah to a widow in Zeraphath to take care of him. Upon getting there, he finds the widow has nothing but a little jar of oil and a handful of floor. She was gathering sticks to prepare last meal for her and her son and die. Here comes Elijah who has nothing and asks to be provided for first. Bear one another\u2019s burden.<\/p>\n<p>Paul tells us in<strong> Romans 15: 1 We then who are strong ought to bear with the scruples of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 2 Let each of us please his neighbor for his good,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> leading to edification<\/span>. 3 For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, \u201cThe reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me.\u201d<\/strong> When was the last time you encouraged someone or even emailed or told them you were praying for them? We who are strong ought to bear to the glory of God. Let\u2019s also be ready at any time because the Lord may require us right when we are weak to reach others. Your restoration could be positioned in lifting up others who are weak while you are weak yourself. I find many times I am more encouraged and strengthened while lifting up others either through prayers, encouragements, giving assistance financially, helping hand etc. We are blessed to be a blessing and sometimes our blessings are on verge of extending a helping hand.<\/p>\n<p>Divine Master invites his disciples, and encourages them by showing himself as meek and lowly in spirit. The same disposition ought to mark the conduct of his servants, especially of the strong towards the weak. The great end in all our actions must be that God may be glorified; nothing more forwards this, than the mutual love and kindness of those who profess Christ. Those that agree in Christ may well agree among themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Make a point this week to bless someone. A friend, a family member who is weak, struggling in their walk, in their finances, in their health, whatever the case might be, call them, and email them.

Amos 8:11-13<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Destruction was to come upon the city of Samaria which would be the cause of bitter mourning. Amos described the event in terms of a funeral for an only son.\u00a0 He continued the use of metaphorical language as he depicted a coming famine. It was no ordinary famine but one of the words of the Lord (v.11). He pictured men longing and searching for God\u2019s Word as starving people seek food or water (vv.12-13). But despite their search they received no word from the Lord. They had rejected the word, not realizing its great value, and had lost it forever (cf. Luke 17:22; John 7:34).<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate the Bible and all it Contains ponder on this, A young man once received a letter from a lawyer stating that his grandmother had left him an inheritance. To his astonishment, it was $50,000 plus &#8220;my Bible and all it contains&#8221;\u00a0 The youth was delighted to receive the money. However, he knew what the Bible contained, and because he wasn\u2019t into religion he didn\u2019t bother to open it. Instead, he put it on a high shelf. He gambled the $50,000, and over the next fifty years he lived as a pauper, scraping for every meal. Finally he became so destitute, he had to move in with his relatives. When he cleaned out his room, he reached up to get the dusty old Bible from the shelf. As he took it down, his trembling hands dropped it onto the floor, flinging it open to reveal a $100 bill between every page.\u00a0 The man had lived as a pauper, simply because of his prejudice. He thought he knew what the Bible &#8220;contained.&#8221;\u00a0 The Bible has treasures, and spiritual nourishment you need for your survival.<\/p>\n<p>Can you imagine having a famine of the Word of God?\u00a0 Imagine Bibles taken off the shelves of stores all around the world.\u00a0 It is illegal in some countries to own a Bible.\u00a0 What happens if and when that happens in this country?\u00a0 Which one book takes a definite stand against abortion, homosexuality, relativism, and a host of other controversial issues without compromise, but the Word of God?\u00a0 With the way the USA is going, I can see the continual moral decay, and the word of man taking more and more precedence over the Word of God.\u00a0 Do you have the Word of God so settled in your heart, especially through Scripture memory (not memorizing the whole things)? that should that day come you know how to live God\u2019s Word without the thin lined pages of your Bible so easily accessible?\u00a0 Imagine the worst famine the world has ever seen<strong>, &#8220;a famine of hearing the words of the LORD<\/strong>&#8220;. It certainly happened in the Scriptures, perhaps it will happen again.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting that the famine wasn\u2019t one of food or water.\u00a0 Yet Job said, &#8220;<strong>I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food (Job 23:12<\/strong>),&#8221; and Jesus said in<strong> John 4:32-34, &#8220;I have food to eat that you know nothing about.\u00a0 Then his disciples said to each other, &#8220;Could someone have brought him food?&#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;My food,&#8221; said Jesus, is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work<\/strong>.&#8221; Furthermore in speaking with the woman at the well &#8220;<strong>Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.

And if you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for me with all you heart\u2026\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have you found God? If you are saved and have been born again through faith in Christ and by the power of the Holy Spirit, I know for sure that God found you. I also know where He found you from. And I know the marvelous change He has brought into your life. I also know about the promises He has given you. I also know about His love and willingness to help you walk in His power and live a victorious Christian life. But, the question that I want ask and would like for you to think about and mediate on is this:<strong> Have you also found God as He has found you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Finding God? What does that mean? Is it necessary? Is it practical? Does God hide at times, and then give us hard times to find Him? If God found us and saved us, why then do we need to find Him? Why can\u2019t we just lay back, recline, take it easy and just enjoy the ride to heaven? Why put effort when Jesus did everything for us so we could be saved and go to heaven?<\/p>\n<p>You might have asked these questions and even more just like many of us have. You probably are still wondering whether it is necessary, logical, and practical to find God. For one, God is bigger than big. The whole world cannot contain Him. So, how could He be contained in you if you found Him and desired to retain Him in your heart? You may also be thinking that because He is Omniscience and Omnipotent, He is everywhere and all powerful and so it is not necessary and theologically correct to urge believers to search and find God. Whatever your thinking is or your belief is, you need to listen to what God is saying about the need for you and all believers to find Him. You need to understand that God, from time immemorial, has required His children to seek and find Him. There is something special about that requirement. It has a dual purpose. One, God delights in seeing His children taking time and reverently seeking Him with all their heart, and Secondly, the children of God benefits a great deal when they seek God and find Him.<strong> The union between the believer and God, following the believer\u2019s desperate and selfish search of Gods presence, is the most perfect and highest level of spirituality anybody can attain.<\/strong> You can\u2019t go higher than that. And you can\u2019t get better than that. Everything life is and all that we could ever desire or want, according to God\u2019s will, is within reach when we seek God and find Him.<strong> Righteousness and Holiness, without which no man shall see God<\/strong>, become attainable by we the mortal when we have searched God and found Him. Isn\u2019t that wonderful?<strong> The call to seek God is a call that must be heeded, because it is a call with a purpose and a promise.<\/strong> It does not matter where one may be; there is always a call from God to seek Him.<\/p>\n<p>For example: When the Israelites were exiled in Babylon, God through the Prophet Jeremiah urged them to seek Him with all their heart until they found Him. The prophets, priests, elders, men, women and children were urged by God Himself, to seek Him till they had found Him. Following is the \u2018call\u2019 and \u2018directive\u2019 God gave:<strong> \u201cThen you will call upon me and you will find Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And if you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for me with all you heart. And I will be found of you, \u2018declares the Lord, \u2018and I will restore your fortunes and will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, \u2018declares the Lord, \u2018and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile.\u201d Jeremiah<\/strong> 29:12-14<\/p>\n<p>You may not be in exile right now, but you need to seek the Lord. You need to pray. You need to put effort. You cannot give God leftovers and please Him. You cannot find Him when you are not searching and seeking Him with all your heart. It is not where you go to seek Him that matters; it is the condition of your heart and the ardent desire you have and the faith you have that matters and will lead you into His presence. You need to seriously set yourself to go on an expedition to find God. Once you have found Him, live in His presence daily through the power and prescience of the Holy Ghost.<strong> The Holy Ghost cannot be your occasional Holy Guest. He must be a permanent resident and the president of your heart and home.<\/strong> You must retain God in your heart, mind body and soul. God has to fill your entire being. When you wake up in the morning, you need to crave for God like an addict craves for drink, drugs or cigarettes. Be filled with His Spirit. Walk in the same power everyday wherever you are. You truly will be turned from exile-whatever the exile may be that you are in right now, when you seek God with all your heart. In exile or not, find God. Do whatever it takes to find God. Don\u2019t be satisfied and limited by your current level of the knowledge of God you have. You can\u2019t know God fully as He really is even if you searched throughout eternity. But, He will reveal Himself to you in response to your searching and according to the level of your faith. Then you will Grow in His knowledge and<strong> His righteousness will be revealed to you from \u201cfaith to faith\u201d<\/strong> glory to glory (Romans 1:17). Let the Holy Spirit help your infirmities, and pray on your behalf and lead you into your search for God. If you seek Him with all your heart, you will sure find Him. God bless you!

All things are possible for Thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt.&#8221;<\/strong> Mark 14:36<\/p>\n<p>Shortly before Jesus was betrayed and arrested, He was very distressed and troubled to the point of death. He took His three disciples and led them to a lonely place where He could reveal to them the sad condition of His heart and also pray. He said to them:<strong> &#8220;My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death; remain here and keep watch<\/strong>&#8221; And went a little further to pray and He prayed the prayer quoted above. The Bible says that He prayed the same prayer twice. He had expected His disciples too to pray and watch with Him, but they didn\u2019t. They were overcome with sleep. But He prayed and His expressed His desire, which was &#8220;<strong>to let this cup (the suffering and the crucifixion he faced) pass away&#8221;<\/strong>. In his human nature, He felt the pain like we do. He experienced conflict of choice like we often do. He naturally feared like you and I sometimes do. The enemy was heavily present to persuade all His senses to reject the suffering and evade the cross, which would have been a good thing for Him, but would have been disobedience to God, His Heavenly Father. Jesus was at cross roads. Faced with the challenge and difficulty of choosing between what pleased Him and what pleased His Heavenly Father, He chose to surrender His will to God\u2019s will. Now that was not easy, but it was necessary and was the right thing to do. He simply obeyed his Father\u2019s wish to die for the world\u2019s salvation. He remembered that &#8220;<strong>Obedience is better than sacrifice<\/strong>&#8221; according to 1 Samuel 15:22. And, in that moment, He gave up His will. Nothing mattered to Him anymore than what mattered to His Father. He trusted in His wisdom, guidance and power to do anything He willed. And God willed that He dies. And He did! A loss for Christ? No! That surrender brought such great joy to the Father and unprecedented recovery of all Jesus had lost when He came down to die for sinful mankind. The surrendering of His will to the Father\u2019s and His humility and costly obedience, earned Him a Name above all names and elevated Him to position of honor in heaven and on earth. His reward:<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Therefore also God has highly exalted Him, and has bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of JESUS, every knee shall bow, of those who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and that every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.&#8221; Philippians 2: 9-11 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Today, you might be at cross roads like Jesus. Your will to do your thing or escape pain may be stronger than you are willing to surrender or let go. Your thoughts, ways, plans, purposes, dreams and intentions may appear right, righteous and acceptable in your sight and in the sight of many, but the end thereof may be death and loss of opportunity of doing God\u2019s will for God\u2019s rewards. God\u2019s will is God\u2019s wish for your life. If you want to see God at work in your life, join Jesus in praying &#8220;<strong>Thy will be done<\/strong>&#8220;.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> That total surrender to God\u2019s Will is what moves God<\/span><\/strong>. It is what secures your future and mine. It is the guaranteed insurance and assurance that you are covered against any losses or future eventuality or disappointments. It is what will earn you peace and prosperity. Surrender your will today; let go and let God! God bless you, In His service, Br.

Spurgeon &#8211; Prayer Makes History<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>I understand that in Spurgeon&#8217;s church on Sunday mornings before service ~800 intercessors were in the basement praying&#8230; <\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The memory of Charles Haddon Spurgeon has been cherished among evangelical Christians for over the past 100 years. Many Christian leaders consider him to be the greatest preacher England ever produced. He is commonly hailed as the &#8220;Prince of Preachers&#8221;. Over 63 volumes of published sermons still bear witness to the richness and success of C. H. Spurgeon&#8217;s ministry. Though known as a great preacher, it was not preaching that made Spurgeon great. Mr. Spurgeon repeatedly acknowledged <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">his success as the direct result of his congregation&#8217;s faithful prayers<\/span>. &#8220;It has often been remarked that the whole church helped produce Spurgeon<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.&#8221; When visitors would come to Spurgeon&#8217;s church he would take them to the basement prayer-room where people were always on their knees interceding. Then Spurgeon would declare, &#8220;Here is the powerhouse of this church.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\nSpurgeon in his autobiography described his gratefulness for being blessed with such a praying church. &#8220;I always give all the glory to God, but I do not forget that He gave me the privilege of ministering from the first to a praying people. We had prayer meetings that moved our very souls, each one appeared determined to storm the Celestial  City by the might of intercession.&#8221; <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Spurgeon regarded the prayer-meeting as the spiritual thermometer of a church<\/span>. His church&#8217;s Monday night prayer meeting had a worldwide testimony for many years. Every Monday night a large portion of Spurgeon&#8217;s sanctuary was filled with earnest and fervent intercessors.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">&#8220;In Spurgeon&#8217;s eyes the prayer-meeting was the most important meeting of the week.&#8221;<\/span> It is here many of us find ourselves in conflict with dear Mr. Spurgeon. We love our meetings for preaching and praising and yet sadly neglect those set aside for praying. One of Spurgeon&#8217;s greatest concerns was that his people learn to truly pray. &#8220;He taught his people to pray, doing so far more by his example than by any preaching. People heard him pray with such reality that they became ashamed of their own mere repetition of words.&#8221; Throughout his entire ministry many hearers remarked that they were moved by his preaching, but yet still more affected by his praying. D. L. Moody after his first visit to England, being asked upon his return to America, &#8220;Did you hear Spurgeon preach?&#8221; He replied, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">&#8220;Yes, but better still I heard him pray.&#8221;<\/span> A close friend of Spurgeon&#8217;s, commented on his prayer life, &#8220;His public prayers were an inspiration, but his prayers with the family were to me more wonderful still. Mr. Spurgeon, when bowed before God in family prayer, appeared a grander man even than when holding thousands spellbound by his oratory.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Spurgeon fully recognized that the Church&#8217;s greatest need was not to have another, &#8220;Prince of Preachers&#8221;, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">but to have more princes of prayer<\/span>. One of his many published sermons expressed his feelings on this. He wrote, &#8220;Shall I give you yet another reason why you should pray? I have preached my very heart out. I could not say any more than I have said. Will not your prayers accomplish that which my preaching fails to do? Is it not likely that the Church has been putting forth its preaching hand but not its praying hand? Oh dear friends! Let us agonize in prayer . . . &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There has been much talk lately about pockets of revival springing up in our nation. Many are saying they desire such revivals in our own local churches, and cities. Yet, is it not the prayer-meeting which is still most neglected? If Christ Jesus were to visit us today with real revival power, how could such a blessing be sustained where there is no ground work laid in prayer? To merely exercise our words about revival and not our knees is hypocrisy! It is time to make the prayer-meeting as crowded as our favorite preaching and praise meetings. It is then and ONLY then, that a true revival will come with lasting power!\u00a0 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Like Mr. Spurgeon, let us regard the prayer-meeting as our most important meeting!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; One of our church prayer\u00a0warrior sent me this email\u00a0so moving, impacting and cutting to the core.\u00a0Those who have heard of Charles Spurgeon and his ministry over 100 years ago will appreciate to learn where his strength of excellence came from.

They are to be obeyed for us to see the victories. It amazes me how the kingdom principles are opposite man\u2019s principles. Men\u2019s principles are based on reason, God\u2019s principles require obedience.<\/p>\n<p>The world would teach that being alive makes you accomplish much, the bible teaches the opposite, we will see how. Samson in the book of judges had strength of many men. In his lifetime, God destroyed many philistines who were their enemies. You remember at one point he slew 800 men with a jawbone of a donkey. God used him mightily but we see such great victory over the enemy in his death. He made huge mistakes but right in his humility God mightily used him one more time at his request.<strong> Judges 16:30, Then Samson said, \u201cLet me die with the Philistines!\u201d And he pushed with all his might and the temple fell on the lords and all the people who were in it.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> So the dead that he killed at his death were more than he had killed in his life.<\/span><\/strong> He destroyed more enemies in his death than he did in his life. And so was Jesus dying on the cross doing the same. He did not come to live, He came to die and that\u2019s why this verse is important, it reveals the principle of destroying more enemies in death than in life<strong>, John 12, \u201c24 Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain<\/span>.<\/strong> Men like Stephen, Lazarus etc did more to the glory of God in their death than they did when they were alive.<\/p>\n<p>Samson and Jesus died as individuals, the call we too have in our lives is to die daily as individuals. You have to make that choice of dying to self. Jesus says in<strong> Matthew 10:39, \u201cHe who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it\u201d<\/strong>. We fight hard to find life; Jesus says those who are His are those who are ready to loose their lives for His sake. Why is this so important, because we too have more victories in our death than in our life. Being dead to sin and alive unto Christ destroys more enemies that come our way and produces much fruit. Jesus could gain fruit while alive, but He says, \u201c<strong>but if it dies (grain of wheat), it produces MUCH grain<\/strong>\u201d. In His death we have eternal life. In his death souls are still being won into the kingdom 2000 years later.<\/p>\n<p>A WILL is not in effect as long as the person is alive<strong> Hebrews 9:16-17, \u201c16 For where there is a testament, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. 17 For a testament is in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the testator lives<\/strong>\u201d, so are we the believers, God\u2019s will is not in effect as long as we are still alive. Oh how I desire to die daily that His will may be in effect. Daily walk is hard with the enemy of our soul on the loose, I take comfort knowing that there is more victory in my life, marriage, ministry, and my job as I die daily that His may take effect in my life. There are some victories we get when we live, but greater victories I believe are achieved when we die. Die to what, die to self. Our will wants to be alive, may the Lord slay it.

They journeyed to Mount Sinai, a place where they would worship the Lord and be ready to continue with their journey to the Promised Land.\u00a0<strong> Exodus 19:1 says \u201cIn the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai\u201d.<\/strong> Mark how long it took them to get there and how long it took them to stay there, 40 years,<strong> Deut 1:3 Now it came to pass in the<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> fortieth year<\/span>, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him as commandments to them\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From a land of bondage, a land of less than enough, a land of hard labor, the Israelites were by this mountain cared for, protected, and provided for. They got comfortable, way too comfortable. Of course they were to be there for a season, they had not arrived to their destination. They had come from a land where the Lord fought for them; the time had come where the Lord would fight with them and through them. This is where they got paralyzed. Where they were going was going to require total trust and confidence in God, they were not ready for that. So they sat by this mountain year after year and that\u2019s when \u201c<strong>The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: \u2018You have dwelt long enough at this mountain<\/strong>\u201d<strong>, Deut 1:6.<\/strong> Are we anyway different? There are people who have been in one place forever; the same prayers they prayed 5-10 years ago are the same today, gotten used to being out of Egypt but done progressing to God\u2019s promise land fearing battles ahead to make it there. If you were to evaluate your spiritual life, you discover you are stagnant, no challenges, no desire to move forward. Satisfied right where you are, complaisant,\u00a0 lukewarm, and not allowing the Lord to use you, only depending on Sunday morning church to keep your spiritual life alive. If you are experiencing any of this, you are like the Israelites who dwelt by the mountain long enough, stagnant.<\/p>\n<p>Sinai dwelling was supposed to be temporary; they made it a permanent dwelling. You and I got to have something big before us that serve as a challenge otherwise we too will stop moving with the Lord. I\u2019m glad to be out of Egypt but I\u2019m not bound to die by the mountain when God has revealed that there is more. We ought to turn to the One who is more than able, who has made us more than conquerors and we take Him at His word and vs<strong>. 7 Turn and take your\u00a0 (our) journey, and go to the mountains of (whatever your mountain is)<\/strong>. The following verse, tells us we are not there yet,<strong> 1Corinthians 2:9,\u201d But as it is written:\u00a0 \u201cEye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.\u201d<\/strong> Imagine the time they wasted and the time we too have wasted not obeying His voice due to fear of the battle a head of us.

I\u2019ve sat to listen to a few testimonies; the spotlight was on the person giving testimony rather than Christ.<\/p>\n<p>We should have a place for testimony but if our testimony overshadows His testimony, then we have a wrong order of the affection.

Here it is<\/p>\n<p>The prophet Zechariah was once given a vision of a golden lamp stand &#8211; a symbol of the church (Zech.4:2; see\u00a0 Rev.1:20). To keep the lamp burning continuously, the greatest need is a continuous supply of oil(v.3). And for this, there were two olive trees planted on either side of the lamp stand &#8211; symbolizing the FRUIT and the GIFTS of the Holy Spirit, through which the church is built. The angel then told Zechariah that God&#8217;s work would be done, not by human power, but by the power of the Holy Spirit, and that every mountain that stood in the way would be flattened (Zech.4:6,7).<\/p>\n<p>We will face hindrances and obstacles of many types. We may wonder why God allows us to face such mountains, when we are wholeheartedly seeking to do His will alone. But God&#8217;s purpose is to exercise our faith, so that we can experience His mighty power reducing all those mountains to a plain. We read of an occasion in the gospels, where Jesus urged His disciples to go across the lake of Galilee. They did not want to go, but he urged them to go (Mt.14:22). When they obeyed Him, they ran into a fierce storm. If they had disobeyed Him, and not crossed the lake, they would not have faced that storm at all. But they would not have experienced the power of the Lord stilling the storm either. It is only when we face the storms that we can also know the power of God.<\/p>\n<p>It is the disobedient and compromising Christian who has an easy way through life. But he never experiences the power of God either. The disciple of Jesus may go through &#8220;many afflictions&#8221;. But he also experiences the Lord &#8220;delivering him out of all of them&#8221; (Psa.34:19). God delights to see His people trust Him in the midst of gigantic problems that no man can solve. It is in such situations that we prove that we believe in an almighty God. Far too many of God&#8217;s people believe in a god of their own imagination who is unable to help them when they face man-made or demon-made storms or mountains. That is not the God of the Bible, but a god of their own making &#8211; an impotent idol of their imagination, no better than any heathen idol. Is there any problem too big for our God? No. Then why do we fear when men or demons raise up mountains in our way? When the Israelites heard of the size of the giants of Canaan, they began to think, &#8220;These giants are too big for OUR god to handle&#8221;. Who was their god? Not the God Who had delivered them from Egypt, but a powerless figment of their own imagination. No wonder God sentenced them to 38 years of wandering in the wilderness (Deut.2:14). They\u00a0 were unbelieving &#8211; and their unbelief insulted God and tied His hands, so that He could do nothing for them. There are Christian leaders today also who tie God&#8217;s hands through their unbelief.<\/p>\n<p>But God is looking for men like Joshua and Caleb, who will believe and proclaim that there is nothing impossible for God. God is always on our side against Satan. And nothing can prevent Him from working for us, except our unbelief. Even if all the 5500 million people in the world and all the millions of Satan&#8217;s demons opposed us, they would not be able to hinder God&#8217;s purposes for us &#8211; if we trust in God. So we never get discouraged or give up &#8211; no matter what happens. Even if we die, we will die trusting in our Almighty God, believing that His Name will be glorified through our death! When God allows us to face mountains &#8211; whether in the form of demons that wrestle with us, or hundreds of people who oppose us and accuse us &#8211; His purpose is that we might thereby become strong and wealthy. &#8220;If God be for us who can be against us&#8221; (Rom.8:31).<\/p>\n<p>It is only when we face mountains and the\u00a0 opposition of demons and men, that Zechariah 4:6,7 becomes more than just a wall-text hanging in our sitting- room. It gets written into our bloodstream! But we have to be wholehearted and say, &#8220;Lord I really want to stand for You here, whatever the cost. Give me grace to stand for You, even if all my fellow-believers become lukewarm, and even if my wife opposes me. I am totally Yours. All I have is Yours. I am willing to spend all my life&#8217;s earnings also for Your work&#8221; Then we will find God continually flattening mountains in front of us, everywhere we go.<br \/>\nLet there be any number of giants in the land. Our God can handle all of them. He will &#8220;be an enemy to our enemies&#8221;, and &#8220;fight against those who fight with us&#8221; (Exod.23:22; Isa.49:25). God has promised that &#8220;no weapon formed against us will prosper&#8221;, and that &#8220;He Himself will vindicate us&#8221; (Isa.54:17). So we never need to defend ourselves when falsely accused. We can remain silent, &#8220;entrusting our cause to Him Who judges righteously&#8221; (1 Pet.2:23). That is the dignity with which servants of the new covenant conduct themselves. We depend on God utterly, knowing that He will never let us down. What He did for Jesus, Our Forerunner, He will do for us too. Our own testimony, is that we have encountered many mountains during these past years &#8211; the opposition of men and demons, false accusations, malicious gossip, betrayal by &#8220;false brethren&#8221; (2 Cor.11:26), etc., We have never defended ourselves. We have always fallen down before God and said, &#8220;Lord, this is Your work, not ours. We are only Your servants. We believe that no man or demon can hinder what You are seeking to accomplish in our land. We command this mountain to be removed out of our way, in Jesus&#8217; Name.&#8221; We can testify that God has removed EVERY SINGLE mountain that has stood in our way. He has been an enemy to our enemies and He has vindicated and attested us Himself. All glory be to His Name. We know He will do the same in the future too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Thought this devo someone shared with me sometime back can be an encouragement to you.

That was Mary\u2019s situation. Here we see a woman who is engaged as we are told, was looking forward to getting married, planning her wedding, maybe planning on when to actually have kids down the road. The timing for her and her husband to be couldn&#8217;t be perfect as they painted a picture of their future then suddenly their lives are interrupted. I remember when I was 23, I had set my life, couldn\u2019t wait to be married, everything was running according to schedule when all of a sudden, my life was interrupted, halted and changed. It was hard to adjust to the new plan but the Lord interrupted the flow of things for a reason. When a life is interrupted, it calls for change and change can be hard when everything you planned comes to a halt.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Look at how it started with Mary, vs. &#8220;<strong>28 And having come in, the angel said to her, &#8220;Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!&#8221;<\/strong>. You and I would consider a favored life as a life blessed with our desires falling in place. Here we see Mary considered HIGHLY favored, the reason she was chosen. When you are in the will of God, if the Lord interrupts your life, it may not mean you are doing something wrong or being punished, it may mean He has something bigger planned for your life that will bring Him more glory.<strong> The interruption may be because He wants to impregnate you with His own destiny rather than yours<\/strong>. Your plans and mine are temporal, His are eternal. He may delay your plans and your response is to be obedient to His plans as Mary did. When the angel spoke to her about what was to come, instead of sharing her plans with the angel, she was willing to obey. She did not share how her fianc\u00e9e would take it, or how it will slow her plans or how her people and family would think,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> all she wanted was to honor God in her interrupted plans<\/span><\/strong>,<strong> 38 Then Mary said, &#8220;Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.<\/strong>&#8221; If it was of the Lord, the Lord would take care of the details and make things known clearly.<\/p>\n<p>You may feel like your hopes and dreams have been interrupted. You had imagined by now you would have been married, had your career on the move, done with school or had kids (whatever it might be), everyone seems to be moving\u00a0 ahead but you. Have you considered that your life may have been interrupted by the Lord for a reason?\u00a0 That your desires may have been DELAYED but not DENIED? And your prayer, \u201cLord what do you have me do?\u201d, Mary said, \u201c<strong>Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.<\/strong>&#8221; The Lord has interrupted my life many times and in that I\u2019ve learnt to take Him at His word as I trusted His wisdom in my plans. I found the more I yielded to His will, the more my will was refined under His will to align to His.

I know little about investments and with the little understanding; I will use the concept of investment to share the word of God. Companies invest in other companies and so do people also invest in companies. I am yet to meet someone who is investing without any expectation of a profit. Not only is the investment done on just any company, but you look at the ones which will give you a better return, for you cannot expect to invest the same amount and get the same in return. Whatever you invest is also used to do business and so is what you save. There are earnings, profits, interest that you expect in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever people invest, there are a lot of risks that go with it and therefore some people tend to spread their investments around so that incase one enterprise begins to loose, they still have other investments somewhere to balance or even out what was invested in this enterprise. Christians ought to be people who invest not only on stocks and bonds but investing in people, relationships, community, church, work. If you invest little, expect little in return; invest much, expect much in return. You invest in one person, he or she will invest in another and it goes on and on. Many don&#8217;t want to invest in other people because they feel that investing in them will rob them of what they have. There are some bosses who will not invest in their employees because in the long run their positions may be threatened by someone they invested in, and so are some pastors and preachers who are scared of investing in certain people who could take their positions. Paul invested in Timothy so was Elijah who invested in Elisha and if you look at these people who did invest, they got a greater return on the investments they made.<\/p>\n<p>Ecclesiastes AKA the book of the preacher 11:1 says, &#8220;<strong>Cast your bread upon the waters, For you will find in after many days<\/strong>&#8220;. This to indicate the principle of investing that which is precious to you upon the waters.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> I was wondering the significance of water here and I have come to realize that water takes any form in whichever place it is poured<\/span><\/strong>. You pour it in a cup, it will take the cylindrical shape, you have it the river, and it will take that form. Water does not have any color but it&#8217;s very essential to human survival and many things need water to become something. They say the world is covered with more water than land. Cast thy bread upon the waters, you do not know how far it will go, who will benefit from it, and when you will receive something in return but the bible is clear when it ways, &#8220;<strong>You will find it after many days<\/strong>&#8220;, this will require expectation, patience, watching till you have received it again but I would rather continue investing even more. It may not come back through the same means but it will come back.<strong> Eccl 11:3, &#8220;If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree falls&#8230; in the place where the tree falls, there is shall lie<\/strong>&#8220;. If we all wait to see the signs to do anything, we will not go anywhere, If we also wait to be sure of what we will receive back before we can move, certain opportunities will pass us by.<strong> Eccle, 11:4, &#8220;He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap<\/strong>&#8220;. I am not a risk taker, at times I want to be sure that if I do this and that, I should be fine or I want to wait for a sign or want to be sure that I am fully prepared and ready to move. I have come to learn that there are certain things that<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> you get ready as you are doing them<\/span><\/strong>. God will not first invest in me to be a leader to use me in leadership, it&#8217;s in the process of being a leader that He invests in me more to accomplish the work He has called me to do. Don&#8217;t waste time hoping that you will fully be ready before you can get into a ministry, or thinking that you have to be perfect before you step into a relationship, marriage, have children for those who are married, more will be invested in you as you are casting your bread upon the waters.<strong> INVESTMENTS ARE FOR THE RISK TAKERS NOT FOR THE SURE INDIVIDUALS.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Invest quality time with your spouse, invest love, invest complements in your friends, invest hope, invest confidence, invest teachings, and invest values and morals. Take different people and invest in them, take advantage of what is being offered to you and do as many investments as you can. Your return on investment could mean someone else also investing in you. People don&#8217;t wait till they have too much to invest, they take the little they have and they invest it anyway. Be wise and invest on your future home, invest in the children you haven&#8217;t seen yet, live like this was it and also live like there is tomorrow. There is a great return on the investments if you invest wisely, purposefully, spread it around for you will find it after many days.

He is After You, by Boaz (Mr. Olang&nbsp;Sr.)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good Morning,<\/p>\n<p>Living a depressed life is living a defeated life. Depression is a killer. It builds up from very tiny thoughts of hopelessness and helplessness. Satan will from time to time want you to be depressed. And when you are depressed, you loose energy, and enthusiasm for living. Life becomes very meaningless and sometimes you may feel worthless and see no purpose for living. That why some people who have severe depression, in some cases, become suicidal. They take a way their life. You may not consider doing that, but you equally could die from within suddenly or gradually. This may be evidenced by sudden disappearance of the joy of your salvation, and unwillingness to do anything or seek help. You may also be withdrawn from brethren and even stop going to church or stop reading and enjoying your fellowship with God in His word as you used to do. There may be a lot more changes in your behavior and lifestyle that depression will trigger.<\/p>\n<p>Do you remember David? I mean the famous David mentioned in the Bible? What do you remember about him? Well most of us remember him as a giant killer. He slew Goliath, the giant that haunted Israel for so long and he became one of the most celebrated young warriors in Israel. He was strong and courageous. Above all, he trusted in the Lord. He overcame Goliath by the name of the Lord. And he had great victory where a whole nation had failed. He made Israel fly in the air. The experience left him feeling elated and buoyant. Victory surrounded him. He was full of confidence and hope for greater things in the future. He didn&#8217;t think that there was anything that could put him down, especially after slaying a giant. Dwarfs were nothing. David, perhaps, thought he could conquer anything. And, sure, he could. But that turned not to be the case. At one point, after being conquered by his own uncontrolled lust, which led him to have sex with Uriah&#8217;s wife, he was knocked down so hard by the spirit of guilt and depression, he could not get up. He tried to hide the sin and weakness but without success, He also tried to deny that he was degenerating and dying from the inside with fear, guilt and shame, but only made his situation worse.<strong> You see cover up and self-denial cannot change facts. Denial is a kin to defeat. And cover up and pretense can only take you so far.<\/strong> When the time is mature, what ever was denied and covered up will resurrect with such force and power, capable of ruining your life forever and separating you from God eternally. David almost ruined himself forever, but he did what you and I need to do every time we feel like losing it. He cried out to God for help-for with God, nothing shall be impossible (Luke 1: 37). \u00a0Coming to God, in prayer, with a broken and contrite spirit, he cried and pleaded with God in<strong> Psalm 51: 10-13: Create in me a clean heart O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not a way from Your presence; and take not Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. And I will teach transgressors your ways; and sinners will be converted unto thee.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Conquering something great in life does no guarantee victory over everything in life: but conquering everything in life, with God&#8217;s help does.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Anybody can fail or fall into deep pits, where you may be tempted to believe you will never get out. Well, I have news for you, if you fall deep into the pit of depression, or hopelessness because of any circumstance, get up! God has made provision for rising up. He understands that sometimes, we will feel awful and hurt badly. That is why He says .&#8221;A RIGHTEOUS MAN FALLS SEVEN TIMES, AND RISES UP AGAIN&#8221;. You too can rise up today.

and ultimately leads a meaningless life (Eccl 1:2).<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 1 instructs us that a blessed man does not take counsel from the ungodly.\u00a0 There are many advice givers, but is that advice coming from a godly source?\u00a0 One that is blessed will take life counsel from spiritually mature Christians.\u00a0 A blessed man also will not stand in the way or will not flow in the thinking of sinners.\u00a0 Sinners are the ungodly, enemies of God, while saints are the godly, righteous, redeemed children of God, and again you are either one or the other.\u00a0 Yes saints sometimes struggle with sin, but if they are a saint, that is there identity given to them by Christ.\u00a0 A blessed person will not sit in the seat of the scornful, those that mock God.\u00a0 The &#8220;mockers&#8221; have no regard for God and his commandments. The mocker is<strong><em> a fool in the language of wisdom<\/em><\/strong> (Proverbs 9:8; 14:6).<strong><em> He does not respond to instruction<\/em><\/strong> (9:7; 15:12) but<strong><em> stirs up strife by his insults<\/em><\/strong> (22:10). He<strong><em> delights in mocking<\/em><\/strong> (1:22).\u00a0 The blessed life takes delight in, God and His Word.<\/p>\n<p>The blessed life is the one that responds to God\u2019s commands begrudgingly, by gritting their teeth and sheer will power, kicking and screaming.\u00a0 No way, the blessed life delights in God\u2019s Word so much so that he meditates on it day and night. (Josh 1:8).<\/p>\n<p>In his book<em> What in the World is God Doing,<\/em> Dr. Ted Engstrom, former president of World Vision, relates a story told by a Korean believer.\u00a0 The story concerns three Korean workmen who found jobs in China in the 1880s.\u00a0 While in China they heard the gospel and embraced Christ as Savior and Lord.\u00a0 They were now determined to find a way to bring the gospel to their own country of Korea, even though evangelizing was illegal.\u00a0 They decided to try and smuggle a copy of the Chinese Bible, because the Korean alphabet was so similar.\u00a0 The first man buried the Bible in his luggage and walked many days to the border.\u00a0 His bags were searched, the Bible was found and he was executed.\u00a0 Word got back to the two friends, and the second friend tore pages from his Bible, stuffed them throughout his luggage, made the long journey, only to be searched and beheaded.\u00a0 The third friend determined to do what his friends did not succeed in, ingeniously tore his Bible apart page by page.\u00a0 He them folded each page into tiny strips and wove the strips into a rope.\u00a0 He tied the homemade rope around his bag, made his journey, was searched, and succeeded in passing over the border.\u00a0 The man arrived home, untied the rope, and ironed each page.\u00a0 He reassembled the Bible and began to preach Christ wherever he went.\u00a0 Now that is delighting in God\u2019s Word. Charles Spurgeon said, \u201cSome of you have enough dust on your Bible that you can write the word \u2018<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">damnation\u2019<\/span> in the dust with your finger.\u201d Ouch, hopefully that\u2019s not you!<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application<\/span><\/strong><strong>:\u00a0 Are you living the blessed or cursed life?\u00a0 Who do you take counsel from?\u00a0 Do you stand in the flow of sinners and mockers?\u00a0 How much do you delight in his word?

What might have not bothered me before, now I realize it does. These things are like little tools presented to diagnose and reveal the areas in our lives that need work. I\u2019ve been surprised by my flesh when something out of the ordinary came and stirred an attitude, critical spirit I thought was not there.<\/p>\n<p>The prodigal son&#8217;s brother encountered with a situation that brought out the ugly side of him he may have never known to be present. Of course he was the quiet one, always doing what was right before his father, worked with him, stood beside him, never disappointed his father. Here comes his little brother who took his portion of inheritance even before his father was dead which may have suggested that he wished his father was long dead so as to get his inheritance.\u00a0 He then goes to a far off land and squanders it all. In as much as his older brother was a hard worker, you will later realize that he had the spirit of I don&#8217;t care. His father would always pray and watch for his son to come home, maybe the older brother was praying his brother would never come back. Finally the brother comes home and he is received well, given the best robe, a feast thrown for him. He does not even call him &#8220;my brother&#8221; but &#8220;this your son&#8221;. Received all the blessing yet he messed up. Remember that person who got saved and came to your church, he was received well, everyone loved on him, they offered to invite him to their homes. Before long, everyone wanted him to be involved in ministry, later met someone to marry before you, saw them excel and when you looked at your life it was like, this is not fair. &#8220;Lord I have walked with you all these years, worked for you faithfully, tried my best to live a life pleasing to you and someone else comes in who has not walked with you that long and has all these blessings?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A little attitude is enough to mess up the plans the Father has for you, all the older son needed to remember was that all the wealth his Father had was his also. You may be envying someone, even try to frustrate them, you feel neglected or left out when you feel that someone who does not deserve the kind of treatment they are receiving right now are receiving it. You ask yourself, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I be happy for them?\u201d To be in the big brother&#8217;s shoes, though it&#8217;s hard to deal with a situation like that, I would thank God for allowing a situation like this to bring out stinginess that I need to work on, uncaring spirit that was locked down in my heart, unforgiveness, resentment, pride, not desiring one that has messed up to progress and rejoice over their progression. If you look at the story again, you can see that even the Father had something inside of him revealed, his unconditional love for his son. You could be a father who is angry enough to want to chock your son but if you were walking down the street and saw people attacking your son, there will be that human instinct and love that overwhelms you not to continue walking away but run to his rescue. Who is that person God has sent your way to reveal something in you that God wants to deal with. It could be what is hindering you from getting to where He wants to take you. That your complete healing and restoration depends on the surgery He does to remove the growth.<strong> Right diagnosis preps you up for the right cure<\/strong>. The prodigal son in your life is not an enemy but a friend who God is using to bring out what is inside that the Lord may work on it.

Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him for the help of His countenance&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are days you and I feel like God is distant or He is present but not saying anything in our situations. To make it even more painful, you have a few folks who are constantly on your case trying to make your life a living hell. They lie on you, they try to make your life difficult and you sit and wonder, how can a loving God allow such terrible things to happen to the ones He calls His own?. You might have heard of a story about a man who dreamt that he was at a beach somewhere walking with the Lord; he noticed two sets of footprints. One was his and the other was the Lord&#8217;s. It felt good and pleasant to have the Lord walking besides him as he could see a sign of His presence through His footprints. When the last scene of his life flashed before him, he looked back at the footprints and noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life. This bothered him that he launched a complaint to God. &#8220;What&#8217;s up with you that when I need you the most that is when I don&#8217;t even feel or see you at all?\u201d Have you been there when God seemed silent in your situation and felt like you were left to walk and battle alone?<\/p>\n<p>The Lord said unto him, &#8220;My precious, precious child, I love you and would never leave you.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> During your times of trial and tribulation, when you saw only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you<\/span><\/strong>&#8220;. Do you see that when he thought the single footprints were his, actually they were the Lord&#8217;s. When you think about how far you have made it with all the trials and difficulties, when you thought you were making it by yourself, check again to see that the foot prints that you thought were yours were actually God&#8217;s carrying you through. This is why the Psalmist goes back to ask why his soul is down and challenges his soul to hope in God. He wanted to remind His soul that God was carrying him through. Three times in Psalm 42:5, 11, 43:5, he repeats the same line to revive his soul.<\/p>\n<p>Why the soul and not the heart or the kidneys or any other organ in the body?<strong> The soul is the animating and vital principle in humans,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> credited with the faculties of thought<\/span>, action, and emotion and often conceived as an immaterial entity<\/strong>.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> This is where I believe your response affects your destiny<\/span><\/strong>. The soul needs to be revived to hope in God for you to progress into your destiny. While hoping in God, the psalmist encourages his soul to praise Him for the help of His countenance,<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Psalm 103, &#8220;Bless the Lord oh MY SOUL and all that is within me bless His holy name?<\/span><\/strong>. To keep the soul revived, you have to warm it with praises, &#8220;<strong>My soul magnifies the Lord, and my Spirit rejoices in the Lord My Savior<\/strong>&#8220;. The more you concentrate on one set of foot prints you think are yours, your soul will stay down believing that you are handling it alone. When you realize that you are not alone, a bigger hand is carrying you through without even saying a word, you will revive your soul to praise Him anyway. Paul revived his soul by saying<strong> 2 Timothy 1:12, &#8220;For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day<\/span><\/strong>&#8220;.<strong> You can only speak like Paul when you know that you don&#8217;t have to see two sets of foot prints to know that He is present. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trade your heavy heart this morning for a heart of joy, celebrate what the Lord has done. Let His joy be your strength. May you be reminded that He is carrying you through and the footprints you see as yours are actually His, you are not making it by your own strength. Revive your soul to hope in God, our hope is built on nothing less than Jesus. When God seems silent, He is carrying you through.

There is a proverb that says<strong> obedience is better than sacrifice<\/strong> and we see this in the life of Ruth, she left her home where they worshiped pagan gods and followed Naomi who was her mother in law before she lost her son (husband to Ruth). Even though Ruth knew there was nothing to keep her close to Naomi, they remained friends. One thing about Ruth is that she is a faithful follower,\u00a0 has a teachable spirit and never complains.<strong> Ruth 2:11&amp;12, &#8220;And Boaz said unto her, &#8220;it has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother in law since the death of your husband&#8230; and you have come to a people you did not know before, The Lord repay your work, and a full reward be given you by the Lord God of Israel&#8221;<\/strong>. Because of her character, she is set up for something great that she herself does not know about, everything she is about to achieve is based on her obedience and if you read the entire book of Ruth, you will see how she looks up to Naomi as a mentor and does everything that Naomi instructs her to do.<strong> Ruth 3:5, &#8220;And she said to her (Naomi), &#8220;All that you say to me, I will do&#8221;.<\/strong> According to the proverbs, she can be trusted and Naomi knows that Ruth will do her good and not evil for the rest of her days. Her character was instrumental to Boaz choosing her as his wife.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of faith. Proverbs 31:21, &#8220;She is not afraid of snow for her household<\/strong>&#8220;. She is the type of woman who is not living in the natural but in the supernatural for she knows that her help is in the name of the Lord,<strong> Psalm 124:8, \u201cOur help is in the name of the Lord\u201d.<\/strong> Not only is the Shunammite a woman of kindness, she is also a woman of faith.<strong> 2Kings 4:26, &#8220;Run now, I pray thee to meet her, and say unto her, is it well with thee? is it will with thy husband? is it well with the child? and she answered<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> it is well<\/span>&#8220;.<\/strong> It&#8217;s easy to say it is well when everything is going the right way but when you read the story of this woman, it wasn&#8217;t okay at the time she said it, she had just lost a son. The son was in the field working with the father and he fell sick, the father then brings the son to the mother who lay him on her lap till he died.<strong> A woman of faith know something has to be done, she rises up to act by faith in the midst of fear and confusion for she is operating by faith. She will speak life in her situation regardless of the circumstance; she will strengthen herself and put her faith into action.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>A virtuous woman is a woman of prayer, Proverbs 31:17, &#8220;She girdeth her loins with strength and strengthens her arms&#8221;.<\/strong> There is something about a praying woman; she knows how to stand before her Master. If you go to churches now you will find that majority of prayer warriors are women. Hannah was a praying woman for the greatest she ever desired came through prayers.<strong> 1Samueel 1:10, &#8220;\u2026and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto then Lord, and wept sore&#8221;.<\/strong> Here is a woman battling in the Spirit doing intensive intercession for something she believes God is able to do. Her intercession is not for selfish reasons but desiring to be blessed that many may also be blessed through her prayers. She prayed for a son (Samuel), God gave her a prophet for her prayers were diligent, earnest, powerful, and effective.<strong> Samuel 1:15, &#8220;&#8230;but I have neither drank wine or strong drink, but have poured my soul before the Lord&#8221;,<\/strong> she is not afraid of pouring her heart to the Lord holding nothing back.

My learning enables me to treat and pray for them effectively. The intercessory prayer ministry my wife and I head, 95% are ladies. I have respect for ladies maybe one of the reasons is how my salvation came about. My special mom prayed me into the Kingdom, my dad always prayed for me but when mom stepped it to join forces with him, the Lord saved me. I was discipled by a lady. It&#8217;s not easy nowadays see men treat ladies the way they should be treated. I also don\u2019t understand how many women get attracted to men who mistreat them.<\/p>\n<p>Several times I have come across women who referred to themselves as Proverbs 31 women, this led me to read and study the chapter for myself. It says,<strong> Vs 10, &#8220;who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubbies&#8221;.<\/strong> Let&#8217;s start by defining the word<strong> &#8220;virtuous&#8221;, this is having or characterized by moral virtue (goodness) and righteousness<\/strong>. From the experience I have come to learn is that when a woman is of good character, however bad the husband might be,\u00a0 she has a way of neutralizing the bad side of her husband. But when a woman is bad she destroys the house. This makes me believe that depending on the character of the woman, she will either make or break the home.<\/p>\n<p>With that said let&#8217;s look at our first point,<strong> A virtuous woman is a woman of kindness, Proverbs 31:20, &#8220;She extends her hand to the poor, Yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy&#8221;,<\/strong> a great example is of the Shunammite woman we talked about the other day in<strong> 2Kings 4:8,<\/strong> which reads<strong> &#8220;Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a great woman (virtuous), and she persuaded him to eat some food&#8221;.<\/strong> Note the way the bible calls her \u201c<strong>a great woman\u201d<\/strong>, she is no ordinary woman for her kindness goes far and beyond. It happened that the man of God always passed by the town and I bet she did not know him\u00a0 but knew for sure that whenever he would pass by, he would need food to strengthen him and there she was doing what was right. Her kindness does not stop here but continues, she lovingly consults with her husband about doing more than what she had done before,<strong> 2Kings 4:10, &#8220;Please, let us make a small upper room on the wall..so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there&#8221;.<\/strong> Not just food but also a place to sleep is what she offers the man. Now wait a minute, there is something missing in this woman&#8217;s life and that is a son, but yet in that void, she goes far beyond to make sure that someone else is blessed.<strong> A virtuous woman will see a need and put other people&#8217;s needs ahead of hers<\/strong>.<strong> She does not do what is left, she does what is right.

Remember it&#8217;s not addition but multiplication (doubling forces). &#8220;<strong>And how will two walk unless they agree<\/strong>&#8221; Why do you think the enemy fights unity? If he can set couples to fight against each other, he will have no one fight him. Praying together as part of the solution will do wonders. God might show your spouse something for both of you that could have not happened had you not come in agreement. One might see something the other did not see. Also you are going to be either an encourager or a discourager the choice is yours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vs 23, &#8220;So he said, &#8220;Why are you going to him today? It is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;It is well.&#8221;<\/strong> This was said by the Shunammite&#8217;s husband. He is asking why his wife is going to find the man of God. Is he forgetting he has a dead son? Also why does she have to do it today? why not tomorrow, another day, at a specific time? Is faith based on season?. He probably did not know that he was discouraging his wife from doing something that could restore Their son. After all, it&#8217;s by her that they received a son and it&#8217;s by her faith that THEIR son could (will) be restored. She needs a little encouragement, a little support and because she will not receive it from the man she loves, she encourages herself with this three words &#8220;IT IS WELL&#8221;. Not doing it for herself (MY) but for her husband too (OUR). In the natural circumstances it is not well, Faith sees beyond the natural and negates the facts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>26, &#8220;Please run now to meet her, and say to her, &#8220;Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?&#8221;&#8216; And she answered, &#8220;It is well.&#8221;<\/strong> She takes a trip, her husband is not accompanying her. She has a destiny, the life of THEIR son depends on the moves she makes and finally when she is seen far off by the man of God, the man of God sends his servant to make sure everything is well and she says &#8220;it is well&#8221;. How would she say it is well with her husband when she hasn&#8217;t received any help from him? She had a chance to air his dirty laundry before the man of God, remember she did not get any help, instead she chose to defend her husband. She had a chance to do her husband evil but she did not. It\u2019s damaging to hear how some people negatively talk about their spouses. Being quick to air each other&#8217;s dirty laundry, this does a lot of damage. It is well with her son? he is not dead until the man of God comes and certify he is dead. Not that she doesn&#8217;t know the difference, she is acting by faith. Is it well with her? not really, she must be emotionally exhausted, physically drained, maybe frustrated by what is happening in her home yet she understands that it&#8217;s not over until God says it&#8217;s over. Practical living is when you have faith for something greater when someone else does not see it. Your approach to situations can help boost the faith of the other person when they see the calmness in you and how you deal with things in a dignified manner. Being calm in the midst of the storm. You don&#8217;t have things in place but you are not consumed by what is around you. Yes you may sit and cry for a while yet you reach to that point where you take action. You sail through the storm without the storm coming into you. Long story short,\u00a0 the boy came back to life after Elisha came and prayed to God. I believe the husband had more respect and admiration for his wife, his faith must have been boosted, he got his son back, he must have increased the trust of his wife&#8217;s judgment and must have loved his wife even more. She was no ordinary woman, something like this could have destroyed other marriages but she sought opportunities even in hardship to make it better knowing both their strengths and their weaknesses.

What would you do if what was suppose to be &#8220;OUR&#8221; responsibility turns out to be &#8220;MY&#8221; responsibility when it&#8217;s broken? The Shunammite woman and her husband enjoyed the presence of their son, a son of old age, a son to pass to pass inheritance to. Having a son was huge therefore this husband must have been respected for that reason but then things changed. The bible does not call this woman notable for nothing because even in the midst of tough situation, she can still calm herself when no one is around to calm her down. A responsible father would have taken a step to see what needs to be done, worked together as a couple to see how their son can be cured. The bible says the boy sat on her knees till noon and then died. Could it be possible that she was confused as to what to do next while the boy sat on her knees? maybe frustrated by the fact that she is left to deal with the tough situation alone. What do you do at times when those who should be there for you are not there for you? I know God has a way of cushioning you to encourage yourself. Don&#8217;t stay frustrated because someone who needed to help you is not there when you really needed them the most. God may use them many times and there are days God will use you to be your own encourager. God may show you that He reserved a tank of encouragement in you for a time like this. The timing has to be right. This is practical living knowing that your help is in the name of the Lord and that God will stick closer than a brother. God can trust you with a responsibility He would not allow your spouse or friend to have. I believe this works to your advantage therefore how you react to your spouse&#8217; weaknesses will be different. The husband had his own strengths, providing for the family, I also see a weakness in him,\u00a0 not knowing what to do in tough situation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>21And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out. 22Then she called to her husband, and said, &#8220;Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.&#8221;<\/strong> We have a husband who has quit too soon, he even discourages his wife from doing something about their situation as you read the passage. On the other hand we have a wife who is very unique. A dead child on her knees, what&#8217;s next? No one to comfort her at their time of loss, the miracle worker is not present, not even sure if He has the power to raise the dead. She can&#8217;t even cry over what she has lost in other words no pity party for her. What appears to be over for everybody is not over for her yet and that is why instead of burying her dead son, she puts him on the bed of the man of God and takes a journey by herself to find him. She has faith when no one else does, she knows she has to do something about the situation or it will never be done. God bless the wives, they have such spirit of perseverance, they stick with it till it&#8217;s done, they don&#8217;t quit to early. They know how to pick themselves up and keep moving. There are husbands who will agree with me that had it not been for their wives who stood by them through thick and thin, they would have made some wrong business decisions, given up on dreams, jobs, desires, progression you name it. Some husbands almost threw in the towel but their wives believed in them to encourage them not to give up. God created help meet, God pulled her not from the head so she would rule over him or from the legs that she would be beneath him but from the side that they would be on the same page and work together.<strong> Practical living celebrates one\u2019s strength in the midst of one\u2019s weakness and not letting one\u2019s weakness bring you down<\/strong>. You can see your spouse through the eyes of faith that if the Lord has not given up on him or her in his or her weakness, you too shouldn\u2019t. Great lessons are learnt a lot in those times where weaknesses manifest. God uses them to refine us.

For a responsibility to be accomplished there has to be a someone or some responsible people to accomplish it. It&#8217;s good to be responsible as it eliminates a lot of aggravations. I don&#8217;t fool around with irresponsible people because they are a burden. Responsible people are easy to work with, they are reliable, accountable, able to make moral or rational decisions, can be trusted, need minimum or no supervision, can make good judgments and act on them and they are sensitive.<\/p>\n<p>I believe a good marriage is also based on being responsible. It&#8217;s one of the ingredients to a successful lasting marriage. Working together as a team and accomplishing what needs to be accomplished together. I know of wives who hope their husbands would learn more on how to be responsible. See things they need to work on and not be told or nagged to do them. A husband who is sensitive to the needs of his wife. Knowing how and when to step in and help, many times going out of his way to do things for her that he never feels comfortable doing or he is not used to simply because he loves her.<strong> Not doing things out of obligation but out of love<\/strong>. I don&#8217;t think they are asking for too much. Imagine a wife coming home, has hard a long day at work and may be the husband got home early, got some time to relax in front of TV. I would say it will be responsible for the relaxed husband to help ease up the burden the wife has had by starting dinner, or maybe helping clean, getting her tea ready when she comes home. Let her sit and relax too. This is doing the right thing without being told. If working in the kitchen together, one doing dishes and the other cooking, talking and catching up. This makes work easy, opens doors of communication and being on the same page. I don&#8217;t believe a wife needs another mama&#8217;s boy who she has to tell what he should and shouldn&#8217;t do. I thank God for a mom and a dad who set such a high standard for me to learn and live by. God bless them.<\/p>\n<p>I love the story of the Shunnamite woman; I have shared about her so many times. They called her the notable (great) woman. Very sensitive to other people&#8217;s needs. In this case to a man of God by the name of Elisha. She has a void in her life, has no child but none of that steals her character. She does everything that she can and knows how, to make sure that the man of God is fed and is well cared for. Husbands, thank God for your notable wives. After sometime, she receives a gift inform of a child spoken in her life and indeed it comes to pass. Not only is she blessed but her husband is blessed too because he has a son in his old age. A son he can pass his inheritance to. As the son grew it happens that one time while working with his father, he became sick and what does the father do, he tells the servants to take him to his mother.<strong> As long as it&#8217;s whole, it&#8217;s OUR responsibility, but when it&#8217;s broken, it&#8217;s YOUR responsibility<\/strong>. The priest of the home should be responsible, in control, doing everything he can with the help of his partner (wife) to take care of a responsibility (son). Be it broken or not, it&#8217;s &#8220;OUR&#8221;, putting thoughts together, using different abilities and skills, strengthening one another during tough time and not tearing or making it difficult for the other person. This is practical living. To continue. Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Kings 4:18, &#8220;And the child grew.

It subdues and mortifies evil desires and blasphemous thoughts as they rise within; and answers unbelief and error as they assault from without. A single text, well understood, and rightly applied, at once destroys a temptation or an objection, and subdues the most formidable adversary. Prayer calls for submission as you cannot resist without first submitting,<strong> James 4:6, \u201cTherefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you\u201d<\/strong> . The bible will keep you from sin and sin will keep you from the bible. We must fasten all the other parts of our Christian armor if we are to be overcomer. If you are not in submission to the Lord in word, in prayers, in serving Him, you can chase the devil all you want only to be defeated.

Twice this king and his people are told to go against them. Like I said yesterday, you and I are still required to report to the battlefield<\/p>\n<p><strong>2Chronicles 20:16&amp;17, &#8220;Tomorrow go down against them &#8230;. 17, &#8220;You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the LORD, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!&#8217; Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, for the LORD is with you.&#8221;<\/strong> If you go to a battle field, the enemy knows you are there to battle and here the Lord says, &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to fight&#8221;. No one goes to a battlefield with no aim to fight; the enemy will not stop attacking you simply because you are not there to fight. Why is it that we have the tendency of feeling that we must fight, try and resolve issues, have answers for everything? I believe Jehoshaphat and his people were sent to the field to see God move. God did not need their help; we feel at times that unless we help God it cannot be done. When God brings you to the battlefield you&#8217;ve been trying to avoid, it&#8217;s not because He wants your help or see if you had good strategy of facing it, He wants to show you what He is capable of. He has brought you to a place where He can boost your faith. He is there to remind you that your strength is not in your position or leadership, money, notoriety, or fame, your strength is in Him. David refers to Him as &#8220;MY Strength&#8221;. Now we can tell the reason David was more concerned about the presence of God and not like Saul who cared about position. Moses had a great position yet he would not go back to Egypt alone without the presence of God accompanying Him. What can we say then, as long as the presence of God is going with us, we can face any battle, situation, or circumstances because<strong> Romans 8:31 says, &#8220;&#8230;If God be for us, who can be against us? (KJV).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that the king knows that his strength is not in his position, he positions all the people in readiness to go to the battlefield. He is going strong in the Lord with his people encouraged,<strong> vs. 20, &#8230;Jehoshaphat stood and said, &#8220;Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem:<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Believe in the LORD your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.&#8221;<\/span> <\/strong> He knows that he is going to the battlefield where the Lord has control of the situation. He also feels that being there to watch the Lord fight is not good enough, so he gathers singers and musicians to praise the Lord. It&#8217;s easy to pray and then sit and do nothing waiting for God to move, these people saw an opportunity to praise God, turned their fears into praise.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> They couldn&#8217;t fight, but they could praise God<\/span><\/strong>. Worship was not about what they could do but what God could do. They were not doing sorry, low, dull numbers; they lifted their voices to praise Him.<strong> vs. 22, &#8220;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Now when they began to sing and to praise<\/span>, the LORD set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated<\/strong>&#8220;. Through praises and worship, they made the Lord look good. P<strong>salm 28: 6 Blessed be the LORD, Because He has heard the voice of my supplications! 7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, And with my song I will praise Him<\/strong>\u201d. The Lord set an ambush upon their enemies. When the Lord says the battle is His, praise Him in the battle field while He fights for you.

Looking at what you need to do, then sizing it with what you have leads you to believe that unless a miracle happens there is no way you can have it done. 2Chronicles talks about king Jehoshaphat who the bible says did that which was right before God. He followed the footsteps of David. As king, he had his own battling troops no doubt, yet in one occasion he was faced with a fierce battle. Instead of one army, he had several to face. He was to fight the Moabites, Ammonites among others. He looked at what he had, what he was to face and what he needed and saw no way out unless he had back up.<\/p>\n<p>This king had no problem admitting he was not able, the world might say he was weak, I would call that humility. Believers shouldn\u2019t be afraid to admit they are unable. Sometimes I hear preachers say don\u2019t confess you are defeated, sounds like bad luck if you do. I believe most people God has raised are people who admitted their lack of ability and were vulnerable to admit it. King Jehoshaphat says,<strong> <\/strong><strong>2Chronicles 20, &#8220;&#8230;we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us.<\/strong> In rare cases do you hear leaders confess they are unable but until one declares bankrupt, you are not ready for God.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Your strength does not lie in your position<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">,<\/span><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">your strength lies on Who is able<\/span><\/strong>. He admitted they had no power, second he admitted that they did not know what to do and third he confessed that their eyes were upon God. Over the years, I have learnt that God loves to demonstrate His power before and for His children. David says, in<strong> <\/strong><strong>Psalm 68:1, &#8220;Let God arise, Let His enemies be scattered&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Watch this, after king Jehoshaphat and his people prayed to God, the word from God through Jahaziel came to Jehoshaphat in<strong> <\/strong><strong>vs. 15, saying,<\/strong>\u201d<strong>..Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the LORD to you: &#8220;Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude,<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">for the battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s<\/span><\/strong>.\u201d\u00a0<strong> <\/strong><strong>The Lord encouraged them without changing their situation<\/strong>. He says, &#8220;<strong>do not be afraid<\/strong>&#8220;, how many times do we hear God encouraging His people through His word not to be afraid?. Fear and doubt are the enemies of faith.<strong> <\/strong><strong>Before God does anything, He first deals with our fears because fear has a way of messing things up<\/strong>. Then He tells them not to be dismayed meaning not to loose courage. Joshua was told to fear not and be courageous for the Lord was with Him. If the battle is the Lord&#8217;s, then that means I don&#8217;t need to be in the battle field right?. I can&#8217;t be afraid when I know I don&#8217;t have to be there. Not only are they not to be afraid nor dismayed, they are told&#8221;,\u00a0<strong>2Chronicles 20:16, &#8220;Tomorrow go down against them<\/strong>&#8230;&#8221;. \u201cLord, You said the battle is Yours but You are telling me to go against them? How is it Yours if I have to face what I want Your help with?<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">This is not about what you can do in the battleground, this is about taking God at His word by faith<\/span><\/strong>. I have battles facing me and my wife as I believe you too have battles. Could be financial battles, marriage battles, disobedient children,\u00a0 change of job or career battles, and like this king you just don\u2019t know what to do. Don\u2019t be afraid to admit you need help and call on God. We are encouraged not to be afraid nor dismayed, the battle is His but we still need to show up on the battlefield, let\u2019s move and face it head-on at His word because He has a plan we don\u2019t know.

From now on you will catch men.\u201d 11 So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him<\/strong>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Peter was one of the most ordinary people in the bible anyone of us can identify with. He wasn&#8217;t the sharpest pencil in the box yet he was one of the closest disciples to Jesus. His calling was remarkable having been taken from his fully understood occupation of fishing fish to a new occupation of fishing men. Acts 4:13 describe him and John as uneducated and untrained men. You have to understand that Peter was a professional fisherman; this is what he knew to do but even his professionalism was limited to things beyond his control.<\/p>\n<p>We see in this passage how Peter and 3 of his friends had toiled all night catching nothing and were somewhere washing their nets. Jesus uses Peter\u2019s boat to teach the crowd and then turns to him and says,<strong>4, \u201cLaunch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.\u201d 5 But Simon answered and said to Him, \u201cMaster, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.\u201d<\/strong> The catch was great, bigger than what they could imagine or think but that did not cause Peter to go home happy, it caused him to drop on his knees and repent of his sins. The Lord takes a disadvantage and turns it into an advantage. Only God could do this spectacular thing but to Peter, he wasn\u2019t worthy to receive this kind of attention in miracles. Jesus then says to him,<strong> <\/strong><strong>vs. 10, \u201cDo not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.\u201d 11 So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him.<\/strong> I can see the miracle was not for business but for calling.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus could have called fish into the boat, or make them float. We see that Jesus used Peter\u2019s skills to net out what He Himself had provided. He then tells him that he will be fishers of men using the same concept of fishing to lead people to Christ who Jesus had drawn. Jesus allows you to catch fish he has already provided, take the Lord at His word. Expect to catch fish where you least expect it.<\/p>\n<p>The Lord was going to use his fishing skills for a different purpose. How do we sometimes loose what we have when we get saved instead of turning it and letting the Lord use it. God can use your personality, sales skills, creative ideas, singing, poetry, writing, etc to accomplish His will in reaching the lost. God will have us to be diligent, purely in duty to his command and dependent upon his goodness, rather than with an assurance of worldly success.<\/p>\n<p>In the day of Pentecost, Peter lowered the net of the gospel and caught 3,000 people the Lord had provided, in Acts 4, the nets of the gospel caught about 5,000. what does this tell us,\u00a0God can take anything in our for His glory if we let Him. God does not call the qualified, He qualifies those whom He has called and we now have to take the gifts He has given us, the gifts we used to serve the devil and turn them and use them to serve His purpose. What\u2019s your net that you are willing to let down at the Lord\u2019s command for a catch? Do something, do something, do something.

And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was preparing a different devotion on Peter\u2019s call in Luke 5 when the verse above caught my attention so profoundly. As I began to meditate on it, the Lord opened my eyes to see something to share with us all.<\/p>\n<p>If each one of us sat down and evaluated our lives, we would be humbled by the fact that there was nothing attractive about us that would have caused Christ to draw us to Himself. With that said, I look at Levi considered by most scholars as Matthew the tax collector. Tax collectors were widely despised, not only because they served the oppressors of the Jews the Romans, but also because they made a profit by adding their own charges to the established levies. They were classified as unclean publicans and sinners, thieves and traitors.<\/p>\n<p>While Levi (Matthew) was in office working, Jesus came to meet him, a picture of Christ reaching to sinners, calling them to Himself.<strong> vs. \u201c28 So he left all, rose up, and followed Him<\/strong>\u201d, a new life, set free from the bondage of sin. What he does next is what most people who get saved neglect to do. He did not receive the gift and move on, he turned into an evangelist using something that once condemned him, his office as an opportunity to introduce his once upon a time friends and workmates to Jesus. He used what was within his reach, a rod in his hands just like Moses to free others..<\/p>\n<p><strong>29<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Then Levi gave Him a great feast in his own house. And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them.<\/span>\u00a0<\/strong> A great feast for the Master also used as opportunity to invite others. Levi met a Jew who was willing to call him as an outcast and spend time with him. With no words of his own to share, he did something within his reach and capability that brought about the Savior to meet with his friends who were also outcasts.<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t know how many of Matthew\u2019s friends became followers of Jesus as a result of his efforts. Maybe some did and maybe none did. But that\u2019s not really the issue, what\u2019s important is that something happened to Matthew that drove him to act.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> He became an evangelist in a way that was appropriate to his personality and the situation<\/span><\/strong>, He did what he must have known how to do best, throw a party, with Jesus as the center of the gathering, then pointed everyone to the Savior who had the perfect saving story, His story.<\/p>\n<p>There was nothing special about Matthew. He was a lot like us, an average ordinary 9-5 working guy. All he had was a life transforming experience with Christ, a heart for his lost friends and the guts to try to reach them. And that allowed God to use him in an extraordinary way &#8230; just as God will use ordinary people like us &#8230; if we\u2019ll let him. What do you know how to do best that you can use to bring others to Christ? If you are like Matthew who couldn\u2019t speak, create an atmosphere where you can have people come in and have someone point them to Christ.

I think many times we have enough excuses for not doing what God requires us to do. We hope for bigger things before we can start accomplishing God\u2019s work while neglecting to utilize what God has granted us because it appears small in our eyes. We forget that God has given us enough to get us started. The Lord will always refer to what he has placed in our hands.<\/p>\n<p>In response to God\u2019s call to deliver the Israelites from the land  of Egypt, Moses concludes that no one will listen, believe him or take him seriously. Then we see God not giving him an army or even latest weapons, only a rod of a shepherd in his hands he used to take care of Jethro\u2019s flocks in the desert. A once upon a time ordinary rod used to lead sheep, God was going to use is it while in Moses hands to demonstrate His power and free the Israelites. It was now referred to as the rod of God, Exodus 4:2.<\/p>\n<p>You and I can dismiss doing God\u2019s work because the rod we have in our hands appear insignificant but God wants to use what\u2019s in your hand. What you have access to, what is at your fingertips. When was the last time you prayed, \u201cLord you have blessed me beyond measure, what do you require of me as a service to you with the rod in my hands?\u201d One of my prayers for young people is that they waste not their youth doing nothing for the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>When I got saved, I immediately knew there was a rod in my hands, God\u2019s word. I Did not know how well to use it to reach others but used I it anyway. God was faithful, His word does not return void. The other day I spoke to my childhood best friend who I had not been in contact with for 12 years, couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. I remember witnessing to him while I was a baby Christian the best I knew how and God later saved him. He is now serving in ministry, working with the youths and evangelizing. I thank God I did not wait for bigger things before I could start doing God\u2019s work, reaching others. You start with little, the Lord gives increase.<\/p>\n<p>It was the prince of preachers Charles Spurgeon who said,<strong> \u201cbrethren, do something, do something, do something<\/strong>\u201d. He knew God had placed in the brethren\u2019s hands a rod to free the lost from Egypt. We are used mightily in our weak state, when we yield to Him for His glory. Anyone who is saved has a rod in his or her hand to do something with it. Yes we battle fear but as someone used the word \u201cFEAR\u201d as an acronym,<strong> F<\/strong>alse<strong> E<\/strong>vidence<strong> A<\/strong>ppearing<strong> R<\/strong>eal, we got to love God more to overcome fear.<strong> 1 John 4:18, \u201cThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, ..\u201d<\/strong>. will you let fear paralyze you not to do something, read this, &#8220;<strong>Have you no wish for others to be saved? Then you&#8217;re not saved yourself, be sure of that!&#8221;<\/strong> Charles Spurgeon.<\/p>\n<p>A rod in your hand is God\u2019s rod to be used for His glory. Be creative, write a gospel message, email to family and friends, record a gospel presentation, post it on your face book, website; order gospel tracts, leave them in bathrooms, kitchens, give them to cashiers as gifts, send them out with your bills to be paid, leave them in shopping carts, public seats.<\/p>\n<p>God used the rod in Moses hands, will you let Him use yours? I did a gospel video presentation that was used this summer on a missions trip in Africa at a free medical clinic, I thought a video could reach more people than I could physically, over 3000 people watched it and was well received. I did one as a tribute to my late cousin which was watched by over 800 people on face book. I knew video was a rod in my hands God could use. We\u2019ve ministered to more people in the world by email devotions, this was another rod in my hands. We take the gospel on the streets, that\u2019s another rod. None of these have a wow factor behind them but God is faithful to use what we give to Him.<\/p>\n<p>You are welcome to check out the video on my face book page and you are welcome to share it with your friends and loved ones. This could be a rod in your hands among others to reach them. Once again, do something, do something, do something.

Yes I still struggle to pray, the will to do it is there but the strength sometimes is a miss.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">If we are going to get heaven&#8217;s attention on a matter, we have to do what it takes.<\/span><\/strong> Prayers gets God\u2019s attention, it causes heaven to be in motion. Hannah had something she desired of the Lord and she understood the only way to receive it was to come before the Lord.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> God rewards persevering faith in prayers<\/span><\/strong>, she had it. The bible says in<strong> Hebrews 10:35, &#8220;Therefore do not cast away your confidence,<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> which has great reward<\/span>, 36.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> For you have need of endurance<\/span>, so that<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise<\/span>&#8220;.<\/strong> Our confidence in God drives us to pray to Him as there is a reward in seeking God. Seeking Him calls for endurance (patience) and we see this with Hannah too. After we have done the will of God which is to seek His Kingdom first and His righteousness, Mathew 6:33, then the promise of the things we have desired according to His will shall be added unto us.<\/p>\n<p>One thing about this woman was that she learnt to pour her heart to the Lord. A lot of things were in her spirit, all she could do was cry out to God. Eli mistook her for being drunk with wine and even asked her to refrain from it and her response was, &#8220;I have poured my soul before the Lord&#8221;.<strong> I would say that you have to be broken to pour what\u2019s inside you. Part of being broken will cause you to be real when you pray<\/strong>.<strong> When you are broken, you have no ability to hold anything inside<\/strong>. A woman came to wash Jesus feet wiping them with her hair, she brought with her an Alabaster box that contained precious ointment; she was willing to break the box and have the oil\u00a0 flow out.\u00a0 She did not want to save anything so she poured it all out. If we are going to pray effectively, we are going to break everything and pour our hearts to the Lord like Hannah. A tax collector in Luke 18:13 poured his heart to the Lord by beating his chest and saying,<strong> &#8220;God, be merciful to me a sinner<\/strong>&#8220;, he poured it all. If you remember the Pharisee that was standing next to this publican, he came to pray but was proud and arrogant and God would not listen to him. We can pray for sure but can we pray effectively? have we learnt to pour our hearts to the Lord to say everything that I am dealing with, troubling me, destroying me, I desire, I choose to pour it out to you? Just as I am, I am coming to you, casting all my cares upon you. What are you trusting God for today? are you willing to endure praying and pouring your heart to the Lord like Hannah did? If we want God to move, this must be the year of prayer. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve shared more devotions on prayers so far this year.<\/p>\n<p>Be blessed Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Samuel 1:8-18, &#8220;But Hannah answered and said, &#8220;No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit.

The father Jor-El spoke words of truth about the destiny concerning his son.\u00a0 Listen to what God the Father said about His Son.

Where are all His wonders that our fathers told us about when they said, `Did not the LORD bring us up out of Egypt?&#8217; But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian.&#8221;<\/strong> <strong> The Lord saw victory where Gideon saw defeat, and the Lord saw &#8220;Superman&#8221; where Gideon saw &#8220;Clark Kent &#8211; mild mannered reporter&#8221; <\/strong> I myself from a young child was drawn to the man inside the man, when it came to super heroes.\u00a0 Clark Kent would slip into a phone booth and come out as Superman; Bruce Wayne would disappear to the Bat Cave and emerge as Batman.\u00a0 What boy is not drawn to this imagery, and this identity?\u00a0 Because in the heart of every boy he wants to play the hero, live the adventure, fight the battle, and rescue the beauty.<\/p>\n<p>The Lord saw the &#8220;Batman&#8221; the &#8220;Superman&#8221; within Gideon.\u00a0 He saw a mighty warrior and therefore identified him as such.\u00a0 Oh how I would personally love to one day hear the words from my Lord, &#8220;<strong>Well done thy brave and faithful warrior!&#8221; <\/strong> This has to be one of most favorite accounts, for I try and picture myself there, and am fired up at the thought of God saying those words &#8220;Mighty Warrior&#8221; and directing that at me and for me.\u00a0 Gideon didn\u2019t see himself as God saw him.\u00a0 That sounds all too familiar, like us.\u00a0 What do you see when you look in the mirror.\u00a0 Many see a failure, a foul-up, a pretender, a hypocrite.\u00a0 But what does God see when he looks at you?<\/p>\n<p>The LORD turned to him and said, &#8220;<strong>Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian&#8217;s hand&#8221;<\/strong>. Am I not sending you?&#8221;\u00a0 Go in the strength you have, I can imagine was the furthest characteristic from Gideon\u2019s mind.\u00a0 The Lord was using identity terms such as &#8220;warrior&#8221; and &#8220;strength&#8221;, to describe Gideon, and he was probably thinking responding words like &#8220;Not me&#8221; or &#8220;Strength&#8221;, you must be mistaking me for another Gideon.\u00a0 Gideon even voices further &#8220;<strong>But Lord, &#8221; , &#8220;how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.&#8221; <\/strong> Gideon saw himself clearly as &#8220;Clark Kent&#8221; the victim, not &#8220;Superman&#8221; the Mighty Warrior.<\/p>\n<p>Application:\u00a0 Look up all the &#8220;I am&#8221; statements that refer to you in God\u2019s Word and use them in your prayer time to help you see yourself in truth.\u00a0 You will be shocked by your findings.

You have a God shaped hole in your heart and only Jesus can fill it.\u201d Dozens, hundreds or thousands of people who want to get their spiritual life on track make their way to the altar. They ask Jesus into their heart.<br \/>\nCut to three months later. Nobody has seen our new convert in church. The follow up committee calls him and encourages him to attend a Bible study, but to no avail. We label him a backslider and get ready for the next outreach event.<\/p>\n<p>Our beloved child lies in her snuggly warm bed and says, \u201cYes, Daddy. I want to ask Jesus into my heart.\u201d You lead her in \u201cthe prayer\u201d and hope that it sticks. You spend the next ten years questioning if she really, really meant it. Puberty hits and the answer reveals itself. She backslides. We spend the next ten years praying that she will come to her senses.<\/p>\n<p>Telling someone to ask Jesus into their hearts has a very typical result, backsliding. the Bible says that a person who is soundly saved puts his hand to the plow and does not look back because he is fit for service. In other words, a true convert cannot backslide. If a person backslides, he never slid forward in the first place. \u201cIf any man is in Christ, he is a new creation.\u201d (II Cor.5) No backsliding there.<\/p>\n<p>Brace yourself for this one: with very few if any exceptions, anyone who asked Jesus into their hearts to be saved\u2026is not. If you asked Jesus into your heart because you were told that is what you have to do to become a Christian, you were mis-informed.<\/p>\n<p>If you have ever told someone to ask Jesus into their heart (like I have), you produced a false convert. Here is why.<br \/>\n<strong>1. It is not in the Bible.<\/strong><br \/>\nThere is not a single verse that even hints we should say a prayer inviting Jesus into our hearts. Some use\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bible.logos.com\/passage\/esv\/Rev.%203.20\" target=\"_blank\">Rev. 3:20<\/a>. To tell us that Jesus is standing at the door of our hearts begging to come in.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBehold, I stand at the door and knock.\u201d There are two reasons that interpretation is wrong.<br \/>\nThe context tells us that the door Jesus is knocking on is the door of the church, not the human heart. Jesus is not knocking to enter someone\u2019s heart but to have fellowship with His church.<br \/>\nEven if the context didn\u2019t tell us this, we would be forcing a meaning into the text (eisegesis). How do we know it is our heart he is knocking at? Why not our car door? How do we know he isn\u2019t knocking on our foot? To suggest that he is knocking on the door of our heart is superimposing a meaning on the text that simply does not exist.<\/p>\n<p>The Bible does not instruct us to ask Jesus into our heart. This alone should resolve the issue, nevertheless, here are nine more reasons.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Asking Jesus into your heart is a saying that makes no sense.<\/strong><br \/>\nWhat does it mean to ask Jesus into your heart? If I say the right incantation will He somehow enter my heart? Is it literal? Does He reside in the upper or lower ventricle? Is this a metaphysical experience? Is it figurative? If it is, what exactly does it mean? While I am certain that most adults cannot articulate its meaning, I am certain that no child can explain it. Pastor Dennis Rokser reminds us that little children think literally and can easily be confused (or frightened) at the prospect of asking Jesus into their heart.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. In order to be saved, a man must repent (<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/bible.logos.com\/passage\/esv\/Acts%202.38\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Acts 2:38<\/strong><\/a><strong>).<\/strong>Asking Jesus into your heart leaves out the requirement of repentance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. In order to be saved, a man must trust in Jesus Christ (<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/bible.logos.com\/passage\/esv\/Acts%2016.31\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Acts 16:31<\/strong><\/a><strong>).<\/strong><br \/>\nAsking Jesus into your heart leaves out the requirement of faith.<br \/>\n<strong>5. The person who wrongly believes they are saved will have a false sense of security.<\/strong> Millions of people who sincerely, but wrongly, asked Jesus into their hearts think they are saved but struggle to feel secure. They live in doubt and fear because they do not have the Holy Spirit giving them assurance of salvation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. The person who asks Jesus into his heart will likely end up inoculated, bitter and backslidden.<\/strong> Because he did not get saved by reciting a formulaic prayer, he will grow disillusioned with Jesus, the Bible, church and fellow believers. His latter end will be worse than the first.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. It presents God as a beggar just hoping you will let Him into your busy life.<\/strong> This presentation of God robs Him of His sovereignty.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. The cause of Christ is ridiculed.<\/strong> Visit an atheist web-site and read the pagans who scoff, \u201cHow dare those Christians tell us how to live when they get divorced more than we do? Who are they to say homosexuals shouldn\u2019t adopt kids when tens of thousands of orphans don\u2019t get adopted by Christians?\u201d Born again believers adopt kids and don\u2019t get divorced.<\/p>\n<p>People who ask Jesus into their hearts do. Jesus gets mocked when false converts give Him a bad name.<br \/>\n<strong>9. The cause of evangelism is hindered.<\/strong> While it is certainly easier to get church members by telling them to ask Jesus into their hearts, try pleading with someone to make today the day of their salvation. Get ready for a painful response. \u201cWhy should I become a Christian when I have seen so called Christians act worse than a pagan?\u201d People who ask Jesus into their hearts give pagans an excuse for not repenting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. Here is the scary one. People who ask Jesus into their hearts are not saved and they will perish on the Day of Judgment.<\/strong> How tragic that millions of people think they are right with God when they are not. How many people who will cry out, \u201cLord, Lord\u201d on judgment day will be \u201cChristians\u201d who asked Jesus into their hearts?<\/p>\n<p>So, what must one do to be saved? Repent and trust. (<a href=\"http:\/\/bible.logos.com\/passage\/esv\/Heb.6.1\" target=\"_blank\">Heb.6:1<\/a>) The Bible makes it clear that all men must repent and place their trust in Jesus Christ. Every man does have a \u201cGod shaped hole in their hearts,\u201d but that hole is not contentment, fulfillment and peace. Every man\u2019s heart problem is righteousness. Instead of preaching that Jesus fulfills, we must preach that God judges and Jesus satisfies God\u2019s judgment\u2026if a man will repent and place his trust in Him.<\/p>\n<p>If you are reading this and you asked Jesus into your heart, chances are good you had a spiritual buzz for a while, but now you struggle to read your Bible, tithe, attend church and pray. Perhaps you were told you would have contentment, purpose and a better life if you just ask Jesus into your heart. I am sorry, that was a lie.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ten reasons NOT to ask Jesus into your heart.

And the LORD blessed Obed-Edom and all his household&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The ark that Noah built with direction from God saved a family of 8 humans, Noah and his wife with their three sons and their wives. Noah&#8217;s ark was a big ark that had it&#8217;s work for a season, when you talk about the Ark of God, though it appears small in size, it supersedes Noah&#8217;s ark by far that saved only 8 souls. God&#8217;s ark, the Ark of the Covenant saved and blessed the Israelites.<\/p>\n<p>The Ark of the Covenant had such a great significance, it was the center of Israel&#8217;s worship and Elohim (the strong Creator) performed many miracles by Ark of the Covenant.\u00a0 The purpose for the Ark of the Covenant was to symbolize Yahweh Elohim\u2019s visible throne on earth. The covenant was God&#8217;s promise to human race, a promise He would not break simply because He is God. Because people would not approach God directly then, I believe the Ark of the Covenant was to always remind the Israelites of God&#8217;s presence amongst them. To bring hope and strength as they faced many challenges especially their enemies. As already said, the ark did not just symbolize the presence of God, by it God also performed miracles. Victories over the enemies were obtained through it, people were blessed through it. This really troubled their enemies especially the Philistines that they decided to capture the ark. Instead of gaining blessings and victories through it like the Israelites did, the ark brought about curses to them. The Ark of the Covenant could not also be handled carelessly and by anyone. The way it ended in Obed-Edom&#8217;s house, Uzzah reached to support the Ark when it stumbled and God killed him for doing that. Not sure why but maybe he thought he could help God, or he thought his hands were clean enough to handle the ark. We know the main reason was a proper process of handling the ark did not take place. The Levites were the elected ones to handle the ark; they were consecrated for that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>What turned out to be Uzzah\u2019s and the Philistines\u2019 curse became Obed-Edom&#8217;s blessing. I don&#8217;t think Obed-Edom did anything special for God to bless his house while the ark remained there. Ordinary guy letting God be God in his house.\u00a0 Worshipping and yet feeling unworthy to have the ark in his house but still glad that God chose to bless him in spite of. His spiritual life must have been blessed and increased, his marriage, his children, his business were blessed because God had his hands over his household. For three good months he was blessed, I don&#8217;t think after those three months he would have wanted the ark to leave. Just one touch from God is enough to change your life completely, the very reason we don&#8217;t want to let go of God. When you sought to have the presence of God, the first thing, the enemy can&#8217;t stand it, second your life is defined by the presence of God, you see yourself a whole lot clearly in the light of His glory and you are changed in His presence. 1John 3:2, &#8220;Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is&#8221;. You are reminded of his covenant to mankind, His promises he made to His children and all you can desire is His presence and His blessing. Obed-Edom might have been an ordinary guy but that did not stop God from reaching out to him. This is to let us know that it&#8217;s not just pastors, evangelists, key leaders who can have or experience the presence of God, anyone can. Allow the Ark of the Covenant to rest always in your life, in your family, business, in everything and everywhere you go. You too can be an ordinary person with an extra ordinary blessing.

If the doors closed as you tried to walk through them, praise God and move on He has better things for you.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">It&#8217;s interesting to see some Christians waste their lives waiting for God to say something He already revealed to them<\/span><\/strong>. They sit frustrated and defeated because they missed seeing the opportunities God had displayed.<\/p>\n<p>You can stop trying because someone said you are not good enough. If anything to say \u201cnot good enough\u201d ought to be a compliment, it\u2019s God who works in you to become.<strong> <\/strong><strong>Philippians 3:13, &#8220;Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead<\/strong>&#8220;, Paul did not consider himself as someone who had arrived therefore, he wouldn\u2019t stop living. As long as God gave him breath, he would live to serve Him till the end. He was taking another opportunity to forget those things behind and press on wards.<strong> <\/strong><strong>Whether other people forget your failures or not should not be an issue, you are the one who has to forget those things, put them behind and move forward<\/strong>.

God does not evaluate our worth and victory based on people&#8217;s opinions, He bases it on what He has done.<\/p>\n<p>We all long to have a meaningful life worth fighting for. God our creator has given us such a purpose. If we graced even 10% of the significance of His purpose, it will give our lives a deeper meaning, high motivation and sense of worth, in other words a reason to live.<strong>2Corinthians 4:1, &#8220;Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">we do not lose heart (We faint not)<\/span><\/strong><strong>\u201d,<\/strong> I have my family, ministry etc, what God has provided through His grace and mercy.

Yes there are days I am down and times I feel like throwing in the towel and calling it quits yet I pick myself up and keep on moving. Paul had those days but listen to what he says, 2<strong> <\/strong><strong>Corinthians 4:8, &#8220;We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 9, persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed&#8211; 10, always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. 11,<\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus&#8217; sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh<\/span><\/strong>&#8220;. What away to say no retreat, no surrender. Things will stand in the way but cannot terminate what God is not done with.

The Expositors Bible Commentary tells us \u201cTwo hundred denarii represented the pay a common laborer earned in a period of about eight months (cf. Matt 20:2-15, where the usual pay for a day&#8217;s wage is one denarius). Not even that amount of money would buy enough bread for all to eat (cf. John 6:7: &#8220;for each one to have a bite&#8221;).\u00a0 Knowing this, makes their feelings make a lot of sense.\u00a0 Then he asked them how much food they had with them, and they replied five loaves of bread and two fish.\u00a0 Perhaps again they were thinking, \u201cJesus if you take the little bit of food we have and give it to these people you will have done two stupid things, one there is not enough to feed these people, and two we won\u2019t have any food to eat then.\u00a0 However, Jesus had his men instruct the crowd to sit down in ranks of hundreds and by fifties.\u00a0 Jesus was beginning to show his men how he would use their lives, help, and resources to be a blessing to others.\u00a0 Jesus took the food they had, blessed it, broke it, and gave them to his disciples. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">The result was two fold.\u00a0 First, \u201cthey did all eat AND WERE FILLED\u2026 and they that did eat\u2026were about five thousand men [not counting women and children].\u201d\u00a0 Second, \u201cand they [the disciples] took up TWELVE baskets full of fragments, and of fishes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">When we sow our resources into the Kingdom of God, hence give the Lord what is really rightfully His everything we are caretakers of, he can bless it, break it and feed multitudes with it.\u00a0 He can do miracles with what you sow into the Kingdom.\u00a0 The disciples, although not knowing the outcome, and perhaps being nervous about their own hunger being in jeopardy, obeyed Christ and were blessed.\u00a0 Their sowing of food, resulted in everyone being feed to their hearts content, and there were TWELVE baskets left over.\u00a0 Were there not twelve disciples?\u00a0 You see when you so into His Kingdom with the little you have, He will provide for your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">Application<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">:\u00a0 God is asking for you to invest (sow) your time, talents, and treasures into His kingdom.\u00a0 What will you give to Him to bless, break, and \u201cfeed\u201d others with of yours first?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blessings Pastor Phil<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, So they sat down in ranks, in hundreds and in fifties.

Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.\u201d <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">Failing makes man miserable and it&#8217;s because no one wants to fail. If you have a standard you&#8217;ve set, or one set for you, the last thing you want to do is fail. Hearing the words, &#8220;You&#8217;ve failed!!!&#8221; makes your heart faint because failure hinders you from moving from one point to another. Failing either leaves you stagnant or moves you a step backwards. Failing is lack to perform, ineffective or deficient. It&#8217;s to be unsuccessful, it is to decline. Fail (failure, failing) does not paint a pretty good picture does it? Yet as humans at times we do not achieve what we set out to do. How often do we hear about failed marriages, grades, heart failure, failed to perform etc? It&#8217;s an indication that something did not live to its expectation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">Imagine Peter standing and telling Jesus just before he is taken away that he will not fail Him,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">Mark 14:27, &#8220;Then Jesus said to them, \u201cAll of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, \u2026 \u201d 29 Peter said to Him, \u201c<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Even if all are made to stumble, yet I will not be.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"> A standard Peter had set and he wanted to stand by it. Looking at where he had come from with Jesus, there was nothing else that could cause him to fail as he might have thought. Jesus knew Peter very well and knew that his spirit was willing but his flesh was weak to stand the test because of the enemy of the flesh. What if someone told you that you will fail on what you plan to succeed in, what would your reaction be? get angry at them or quit? What if someone told you that before you get to where you want to go, be ready for some setbacks, will that change your direction and zeal for success? Jesus said to Peter, &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">Satan has asked for you, that he may<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">sift you as\u00a0 wheat&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">Jesus is telling Peter that though he has a desire and wants to stick by it, he should be ready for a setback because Satan was going to sift him as wheat. I would say Satan was going to reveal some things in him that needed to be worked on and Jesus said, \u201c32<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"> But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.\u201d.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">Taking a closer look at what Jesus said, it would reveal that even though Satan desired to sift Peter,\u00a0 Jesus prayer was that only chaff would pass through the sift and the wheat, the good seed will remain in the sift. If you are like me, you would sit down and wonder why Jesus who had power over Satan did not stop Peter from having setbacks, He allowed it. I believe this experience was going to help him in the life\u00a0 ahead of him since Jesus was going back to heaven.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">The setback was not to kill or destroy him; the setback was to prepare him for even greater things. Judas Iscariot had a setback, to him it was a failure and you know what happened to him,\u00a0 it was a setback for Peter\u00a0 but a channel to greater things. We can&#8217;t quit living when we have setback , God has given us opportunities and avenues for a come back, The bible says<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">Proverbs 24:16, &#8220;For a righteous man may<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">fall seven times And rise again<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">&#8230;&#8221;<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\">Thank God that what we call failures he considers as temporary setbacks.

The Master has a way of meeting us in our weakest, blinded, confusing times. He knows without Him we can do nothing. It troubles me when someone or some people ask me to pray for a need in their lives they themselves are not burdened with to do something about it. In other words, they are not fervently, effectively praying to God themselves but call on me to pray with them as opposed to pray for them. I believe God wants to hear from the person in need first as other rally behind him.<\/p>\n<p>The story in the book of Luke gives us a clear picture of a blind man&#8217;s life, we are not told of his name only his condition. He was sitting by the roadside where many people passed by. This must have not been his first time there; it must have been his usual place of begging everyday. Ever found yourself many times in one place not moving any more\u00a0 with things you desired God to deal with? The fact was he was blind, incapable of doing anything but beg. How many times have you felt the same, begging people to be affirmed, hoping someone will say something nice, begging for recognition, hoping for attention. Jesus was on His way to Jericho when the blind man heard some noise, he began to inquire on what was going on. That\u2019s when they told him that Jesus Christ of Nazareth was passing by. Multitudes had passed by this place but there was something different about Jesus that caused this man to stop and think for a minute. I believe he had heard the miracles Jesus had performed and nothing\u00a0 could stop him from seeking a miracle for himself?. He turned and called on Jesus, he said, &#8220;<strong>son of David have mercy upon me&#8221;<\/strong>. While everyone was trying to quiet him down, he cried the most. Is this not the same picture of a blind sinner calling on the Savior to save him because he heard He was passing by?.\u00a0 When you know that you miracle is just around the corner, no one can pull you down when your time to rise up and receive has come. People, situations and opinions may try and cause you to forfeit the blessings but that is the time you need to cry the most. Seize the moment, exercise your faith, call on Him, let your voice go beyond all the obstacles, stop Jesus on His tracks just for a touch.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks be to God that after crying out, despite the multitude, His attention was on the\u00a0 blind man. Jesus commanded the people who tried to keep him down to bring him over to Him. When you pray, God uses your obstacles to bring you closer to Him. Jesus asked, &#8220;<strong>What do you want me to do for you?<\/strong>&#8220;. In as much as Jesus knows your needs, He still desires to hear you mention them to Him. The blind man said, &#8220;<strong>Lord that I may receive my sight&#8221;<\/strong>, he was specific, be specific in your prayers. I love the way Jesus does it, He says,<strong> &#8220;receive your sight; your faith has made you well<\/strong>&#8220;. Have Faith in God, do not let the Master&#8217;s opportunity pass you by this day,<strong> SEIZE THE MOMENT<\/strong>. Read the passage in Luke 18:35-43 to strengthen what I have mentioned. I could break it down line by line but that could take pages of emails. I pray that this morning you will be blessed and encouraged as you go for all that the Lord has in store for you today.

He is complete within Himself lacking nothing. If He was able then, He is still able. If He did it then, He can do it again. He is the God of now the bible calls Him Jehovah Shammah to which in other words is Jehovah present.<strong> Psalm 46:1, &#8220;God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&#8221;.<\/strong> He is present in your situation today and He is more than able. Nothing in realty intimidates God, though situations and circumstances may be getting worse and I you may feel like He is delaying, know that He is in control.<strong> 2Tim 1:12, &#8220;For the which cause I also suffer this things, but I am not a shamed for I know whom I have believed and I&#8217;m persuaded that<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> He is able<\/span> to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day&#8221;<\/strong>. Whether we choose to believe it or not He is able and the least time we expect Him to be there and help, that is the time He will show up. I cannot only believe Him for the future, I can believe Him for now (current). Remember Lazarus sister\u2019s only believed Christ to raise their brother in the last day, Jesus came disable the present situation and make it able, he came to bring Lazarus back to life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jude 1:24, &#8220;Now unto Him<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> who is able<\/span> to keep you from falling, and present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy&#8221;<\/strong>. The opposite of the word able is disable and we know that anyone who is disabled cannot function fully depending on their disability. We also know that when we use the word disable can also mean disconnect, our God is not in a dysfunctional mode so stop putting Him in that mode. He has not disconnected Himself from His children so stop putting Him in a box. God is able by Himself to keep each of us from falling and then present us faultless before His presence.<\/p>\n<p>The message is simple, God is able and more than able. I\u2019ve repeated the word &#8220;able&#8221; more times to drive it into our heart. Everything that concerns you and I today can be brought to the able hands of God. I\u2019ve said this before,<strong> I don&#8217;t pray because God will, I pray because God can (able) my ability to believe that He can produces faith to believe He will<\/strong>. Change the way you pray and believe God regardless of whether it comes or not. Daniel prayed and answer did not come immediately but he kept praying for he knew God was able.<strong> Romans 4:3, &#8220;Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness&#8221;.\u00a0 Nick Vujicic, a man without arms and legs says, \u201cwhen you feel -DISABLE, add GO- at the beginning to make it sound \u201cGO-DISABLE\u201d making it complete GOD IS ABLE\u201d.<\/strong> He is one man who has proved this truth.

though not through a white sheet and animals on it, but the white pages with Scripture on it!\u00a0 When will we understand that He really does COMMAND us to GO?\u00a0 We must use the fact that Peter struggled with this as a get-out-of-witnessing card for ourselves.\u00a0 Notice when Peter finally did understand the revelation from the roof top to Cornelius\u2019s home, Peter did not deliver any other message, other than the Gospel.\u00a0 Was Cornelius to know what he was calling Peter for exactly and did he know what would happen once Peter arrived?\u00a0 Peter did not even fully comprehend things initially, yet Peter still went and then preached the Gospel.\u00a0 You too may not know exactly know what to say, how to say it, or to whom you will say it to.\u00a0 After all Peter may have offended Cornelius and those in his home, yet he spoke the Gospel anyway.\u00a0 The Gospel of Christ should compel you to go.\u00a0 I often see Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Mormons evangelizing their communities much more than Christians do.\u00a0 This is greatly troublesome.\u00a0 However, what is worse is that Christians fall back on the fact that those to cults do those \u201cworks\u201d for their salvation which is true.\u00a0 In other words to earn salvation cults have to evangelize otherwise how can they please their god.\u00a0 However, Christians are grateful that they don\u2019t have to earn their salvation, yet most are still not compelled by the love of the Lord to go out and speak the Gospel because of the great love for the Lord Jesus.\u00a0 We as Christian must be compelled even more so to go out and speak about the Savior out of our love for him.\u00a0 It should be natural to talk about our loved ones, and we should love Christ more than our loved one.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cIf any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple (Luke 14:26).<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How would anyone know this?\u00a0 One must look to the Scriptures.\u00a0 Remember that Peter did not have the luxury of looking to the New Testament as we do, as we unlike Peter have the benefit of hindsight.\u00a0 These things were unfolding before Peter\u2019s life.\u00a0 Of course Peter had the Holy Spirit, but we must also test the spirits to assure that it is the Holy Spirit, and we test it first and foremost by the Word of God.\u00a0 The Bible is not words about God, as one \u201cpastor\u201d stated, but it is the Word of God.\u00a0\u00a0 There were those who examined Paul\u2019s words to see if they were of God.\u00a0<strong><em>\u201cNow the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><em> <\/em> If you think that you have heard from God, test it against the Scriptures.\u00a0 Where does the Holy Spirit come in, good question?\u00a0 George Wood, Superintendent of the Assemblies of God stated that,<strong> <\/strong><strong>\u201cThe Holy Spirit is like a river, and the Bible like a river bank.\u00a0 The river will never overflow past the bank.\u201d<\/strong> If God reveals something through the Holy Spirit it will be confirmed by the Word of God, so make sure you know God\u2019s Word.<\/p>\n<p>Peter preached the Word of God, the vision was confirmed, and the Holy Spirit was poured out.\u00a0 There it is the confirmation of the Spirit and the Word of God TOGETHER!\u00a0 Peter preached the Gospel and any \u201cvision\u201d you may think God is giving you, the end result should be the Gospel, so that God is glorified, not the vision!\u00a0 If you are not sure, saturate yourself in the Gospel, if you are not sure what to say, speak the Gospel, if you are not sure how to live, live the Gospel.\u00a0 As John Piper would say \u201cYou never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never outgrow your need for the Gospel\u201d.\u00a0 Paul Washer said, the Gospel is not would you need to just get saved like some sort of flu shot and then you go on to the deeper things.\u00a0 There is nothing deeper than the Gospel!<\/p>\n<p>I close with the words of Peter from Acts 15:7 \u201cAnd when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up<em>

and we don\u2019t see things clearly.\u00a0 God had given Peter this vision for Peter\u2019s own sake, but ultimately for God\u2019s glory, as He does all things for His own glory.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When did Peter actually comprehend the vision God had exposed him to?\u00a0 Peter went to meet Cornelius and upon meeting Cornelius fell down at Peter\u2019s feet and began to worship Peter.\u00a0 Boy would this have been a great time for Peter to grab the glory for himself.\u00a0 Yet Peter said to him \u201cRise, I myself am a man.\u201d\u00a0 Peter put himself on par with Cornelius.\u00a0 As a side note, it must sicken God to have people kiss the hand, or ring of the Pope who readily receives worship cloaked in \u201cveneration,\u201d when the supposed first \u201cPope,\u201d Peter did the exact opposite.\u00a0 Nevertheless, as Peter stood before Cornelius and now as Cornelius stood before Peter , partially understood why he\u00a0 was there as he said, \u201cYou know how<sup>

To keep the Israelites separate from their idolatrous neighbors, God set specific dietary restrictions regarding the consumption of such animals (cf. Lev. 11:25, 26)<\/span><strong><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">(v.12).\u00a0 He tells him to eat what is traditionally unclean for Jewish people to eat.\u00a0 Yet He is touching on a much greater truth in this account, and the bigger picture is not about the food itself, but rather the nourishment that comes from feeding hungry people, which are starved of spiritual nourishment because they have not partaken of the Gospel.\u00a0 The fully Gentile people like the half Gentile women at the well, were part of the harvest that the Lord desired.\u00a0 This is why Jesus said, \u201cWhat<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">God has cleansed you must not call common.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> John MacArthur points out, \u201cMore than just abolishing the OT dietary restrictions, God made unity possible in the church of both Jews, symbolized by the clean animals, and Gentiles, symbolized by the unclean animals, through the comprehensive sacrificial death of Christ.\u00a0 Apart from Christ, we can do nothing (John 15), and apart from Him \u201c<\/span><strong><em><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">We are all like an unclean thing, And all<\/span> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">our righteousnesses are like<\/span> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">filthy rags<\/span><\/em><\/strong><em><\/em><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> (Isaiah 64:6)\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Was the woman at the well really any filthier than Peter when Christ found him?\u00a0 Are fishermen more spiritually pure than adulterous women?\u00a0 Were the Gentiles really any more unclean than Peter apart from the Gospel?\u00a0 Our spiritual cleanliness is not contingent to our outward fa\u00e7ade, ethnicity or culture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Our ethnicity and culture must take a back seat when it attempts to create a roadblock for the Gospel and hence obeying Christ.\u00a0 Jesus Christ transcends culture!\u00a0 This is why unlike the religion of Islam, which is a cultural religion, and other world religions, Christianity cuts across cultural boundary lines, because Christ died for the sin of the world.\u00a0 Jesus will not compromise on this issue and please recall the words He spoke to the Pharisees that were saturated in this thinking when \u201cHe said to them, \u201c<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">All too well<\/span> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">you<\/span> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">reject (set aside) the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">(Mark 7:19).\u00a0 They should have set aside their traditions to keep the Word of God so as to please God, but instead they had things done in reverse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">It is important to note where this interaction between Peter and the Lord took place.\u00a0 Peter was at Simon the tanner\u2019s house, who was also a Gentile.\u00a0 John MacArthur states, \u201cPeter breaks down a cultural barrier by staying with a tanner, which is an occupation despised by Jewish society because tanners dealt with the skins of dead animals. The local synagogue probably shunned Simon.\u201d\u00a0 Yet he didn\u2019t always seem to be able to make this transition so easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Christ loved His Father and wanted Peter to glorify His Father.\u00a0 Unlike the mindset of the Pharisees which clung to tradition, He refused to allow Peter\u2019s Jewish ethnicity and cultural mindset to get in the way of the Gospel going forth and thus God being glorified through Peter\u2019s life.\u00a0 Jesus was pushing Peter through his prejudice issue as this was a struggle in his life, because something bigger than Peter is at stake, the Gospel is at stake.\u00a0 Even the Apostle Paul had to put Peter in his place over virtually this same issue, withstanding Peter to his very face (Gal. 2:11)!\u00a0 Peter was guilty of sin by aligning himself with men he knew to be in error and because of the harm and confusion he caused his Gentile brethren. Unfortunately, Peter was affirming the very dietary restrictions he knew God had abolished (Acts 10:15) and thus striking a blow at the gospel of grace (MacArthur Study Bible).

We Make Christ A Stranger &#8211; By Giving The Holy Spirit Pre-Eminence Over Him!<\/p>\n<p>We praise a Christ to whom we will not pray! We have become a praising people, but not a praying people. For many of God\u2019s people the prayer closet is a relic of the past. \u201cWhy ask God for what He has already promised? Just get hold of the promises and simply command deliverances!\u201d We no longer want Christ as much as we want what He can do for us. We want an escape from pain and suffering. We want our troubles to vanish. And we are so caught up in our escape from pain, we lose the true meaning of the Cross. We refuse crosses and losses &#8211; no Gethsemane for us! No nights of agony! We don\u2019t even know this suffering, bleeding, resurrected Christ!<\/p>\n<p>We want His healing power. We want His promises of prosperity. We want His protection. We want more of this earth\u2019s goods. We want His happiness. But we really don\u2019t want Him alone!<\/p>\n<p>The Church once confessed its sins &#8211; now it confesses its rights.<\/p>\n<p>How many of us would serve Him if He offered nothing but Himself? No healing. No success. No prosperity. No worldly blessings. No miracles, signs, or wonders. What if &#8211; once again we had to take joyfully the spoiling of our goods? What if &#8211; instead of clear sailing and problem-free living, we faced shipwreck, fears within and fightings without? What if &#8211; instead of painless living, we suffered cruel mockings, stoning, bloodshed &#8211; being sawn asunder? What if &#8211; instead of our beautiful homes and cars, we had to wander about in deserts in sheepskins, hiding in dens and caves? What if &#8211; instead of prosperity, we were destitute, afflicted, and tormented? And the only better thing provided for us was Christ?<\/p>\n<p>Very few of God\u2019s people pray anymore! They are too busy working for Jesus to talk to Him! Ministers especially have become so busy doing kingdom work, they have little or no time left to pray. There is time to visit, to build, to travel, time to vacation, to attend meetings, time for recreation, reading, counseling &#8211; but no time to pray!<\/p>\n<p>Preachers who do not pray become promoters. They become frustrated building contractors. When they lose touch with God, they lose touch with their people and their needs. Preachers who don\u2019t pray have egos that spin out of control. They want their own way. They substitute sweat for unction (anointing).<\/p>\n<p>Evangelists who do not pray become stars, storytellers. They lack humility, so they manipulate crowds through emotional gimmicks. The cry of many pastors is, \u201cOh, God, where can I find an evangelist who doesn\u2019t care about money, or who is not promoting something? One who can bring heaven down and make Christ real! Oh, God &#8211; give me a praying man to bring my congregation to its knees! \u201d The shame of this generation is that we have too many talented men of God and only a few who have touched God in prayer.<\/p>\n<p>There is even less praying in the congregation! I\u2019m 100% for getting prayer back in our public schools! But that\u2019s not God\u2019s real problem! His problem is getting prayer back in our homes! His problem is to get His own chosen people to pray! And you are a phony if you fight for school prayer and neglect secret-closet praying yourself!<\/p>\n<p>The fullness of the Spirit is the fullness of Christ. If you do not have a consuming love for Christ, you do not have a Holy Ghost baptism! Christ, the baptizer, sent the Holy Spirit to fire our souls over lost humanity, to get us out into the highways and hedges to reach the unsaved. To shake up our lazy lifestyles and get us to doing His work. The blessed Holy Spirit will be grieved, and finally withdraw, the moment men try to exalt Him above the Son of God! He will not permit His power to be abused by those who want only the gift and not Christ, the Giver!<\/p>\n<p>What is a true Holy Ghost meeting? Is it where people all speak with tongues? Or where people are healed? Where saints jump for joy? Where saints are prophesying? More &#8211; much more than that! It is where Christ is being exalted, where His holiness pierces the soul, where men and women fall before His holy throne, broken, humbled crying, \u201cHoly, Holy.\u201d The moving of the Holy Spirit is a moving closer to Christ, deeper in Christ, with a greater submission to His Lordship!

The name of the Lord and his work is seriously abused out here. What is heard and elevated in the name of Christianity is not Christ centered, it&#8217;s Christ packaged, labeled, and transported locally and abroad. Many are done in the name of Christ but I believe Christ is not in it. The otherday I came across one of the most influential pastors in America with a big congregation on TV, he was kinda preaching for half hour, the bible was not opened and read, Christ name was not even mentioned once leave alone glorified, exalted, honored. His message was how to get along with everyone. The Gospel is about Jesus, &#8220;<\/font><font face=\"Cambria\">The bible places Jesus as the center of God\u2019s plan not the sinner&#8221;, Keith Green<\/font><font face=\"Cambria\">.

The good sound biblical teachings don&#8217;t even make it on TV, if they do, very few. The bank tellers are trained on how to know counterfeit notes by getting acquainted with legal notes, true notes. The more they spend time touching and studying the true ones, the better they can detect the counterfeit. I believe this is the same with believers, you study the true gospel (God&#8217;s word) and you will discern the false whichever way it&#8217;s packaged or labeled.<\/font><\/p>\n<p><font face=\"Cambria\">For next few days I would like to share in bits some truths from an article I came across and I pray may help you as you read the bible and pray and evaluate those who you listen to their teachings if they exalt Christ or men.

He has been characterized as the Reporter of the Azusa Street Revival. Nearly 75 years ago, during the outpouring, he wrote a tract warning of a Christless Pentecost. He warned:<\/p>\n<p> \u201cWe may not hold a doctrine, or seek an experience, except in Christ. Many are willing to seek power in order to perform miracles, draw attention and adoration of the people to themselves, thus robbing Christ of His glory, and making a fair showing in the flesh. The greatest need would seem to be for true followers of the meek and lowly Jesus. Religious enthusiasm easily goes to seed. The human spirit so predominates the show-off, religious spirit. But we must stick to our text &#8211; Christ.<\/p>\n<p> \u201cAny work that exalts the Holy Ghost or \u2018gifts\u2019 above Jesus will finally end up in fanaticism. Whatever causes us to exalt and love Jesus is well and safe. The reverse will ruin all. The Holy Ghost is a great light, but focused on Jesus always for His revealing.&nbsp; \u201cWhere the Holy Ghost is actually in control, Jesus is proclaimed the Head &#8211; the Holy Ghost, His executive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p> In another place, Brother Bartleman warned: \u201cThe temptation seems to be toward empty manifestations. This does not require any particular cross, or death to the self-life. Hence it is always popular.<\/p>\n<p> \u201cWe may not put power, gifts, the Holy Ghost, or in fact anything ahead of Jesus. Any mission that exalts even the Holy Ghost above the Lord Jesus Christ is bound for the rocks of error and fanaticism.<\/p>\n<p> \u201cThere seems to be a great danger of losing sight of the fact that Jesus was \u2018all in all.\u2019 The work of Calvary, the atonement, must be the center for our consideration. The Holy Ghost will never draw our attention from Christ to Himself, but rather reveal Christ in a fuller way. We are in danger of slighting Jesus &#8211; getting Him \u2018lost in the temple,\u2019 by the exaltation of the Holy Ghost and of the gifts of the Spirit.

He had a call of God in his life; it took years of learning experience in the sea of life as he waited for the promise. He depended on God, knowing God was in control in good and bad times. His experience shaped his character, kept him humble, and taught him how to be generous.<\/p>\n<p>In this chapter, we see how David came home with his men only to find the Amalekites had invaded their camp capturing their wives, children, possessions then burnt the place down. David and his men lifted up their voices and wept until there was no more strength left in them. As David\u2019s men conspired to stone him, vs.6<strong> \u2026 But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God\u201d,<\/strong> I believe that when he encouraged himself in the Lord, he gathered strength and generously encouraged his men too. But that\u2019s not the end of it. They then inquired of the Lord if they should pursue the enemy; the Lord gave them a green light. David and his 600 men left for battle, on the way, 200 men got weary and exhausted and were left behind. He continued with 400 men knowing that the victory was not in the number but in God. So they get there and destroy the enemies,<strong> vs. 18, \u201cSo David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives. 19 And nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything which they had taken from them; David recovered all. 20<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Then David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those other livestock, and said, \u201cThis is David\u2019s spoil.\u201d<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>David received double for his trouble. They were restored each man his family and possession and much more. As they travelled back to meet with the 200 who were left, his 400 men did not want to share the much more with them. They were not willing to be generous, here is what the bible calls them,<strong> 22<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> Then all the wicked and worthless men<\/span> \u2026.<\/strong>\u201d They failed to understand that it was the Lord who blessed them and not their strength. And they were the first ones on the blessings but that did not mean they were to keep all the blessings to themselves. The Lord blesses us each differently not that we can accumulate blessings to ourselves; he blesses us so that we may be a blessing to others. In Africa we have what we call the HARAMBEE spirit, which means togetherness. That even if you are able to meet a need by yourself, the family, and community rally around you and generously bless you.<\/p>\n<p>Not only did David generously bless the other 200 men, he blessed others beyond his territory. Vs<strong> 26 Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, \u201cHere is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD\u201d \u2026<\/strong> read the remainder of the chapter and you will see.<\/p>\n<p>Generosity knows no bound, it\u2019s not dictated by actions, it\u2019s driven by kindness. It becomes harder when you look back at the battles you faced, trying moments, but remember like David, you are the first on the blessing, God allowed you to get there first for a reason. It\u2019s not a blessing to those who deserve; it\u2019s a blessing for those in need. Not all men battled but all received generously. Generosity is not a waste neither is it a loss. \u201c<strong>What will make Jesus more valuable is when because of how precious He is to us that we sacrifice to the good of others so that it looks to them like we have a treasure somewhere else than in the stuff\u201d,<\/strong> John Piper, I pray that we will shine for the Lord by how generous we are to the need of others.

Some people fear God like they would fear burning in hell. This is not the<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">fear of the Lord<\/span><\/strong><\/span> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">but<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">afraid of the Lord<\/span><\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. Being afraid of the Lord is being scared of what the Lord will use as His punishment\u00a0 when we don&#8217;t do things right.\u00a0 Let me share a few thoughts on the fear of the Lord.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">The fear of the Lord is giving God the honor which is due to Him, in words, thoughts and deeds. It&#8217;s reverencing in His presence.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">This is where we don&#8217;t treat God as one of our buddies, trying to fit Him in our clubs and clicks. He is no ordinary God, He&#8217;s dwelling place is in heaven and we are on earth. In as much as we know that His presence is everywhere, we know that His dwelling place is in Heaven, His teaching to the disciples on prayer starts by saying,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;Our Father who art in Heaven&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">He is so awesome and wonderful we have no option of treating Him casually. The reason why at times we fail to do things right is because we lack the fear of the Lord. For instance, they say<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">cleanliness is close to godliness<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">and being that we at times don&#8217;t care, we will just walk to church on a Sunday morning not caring about how we look simply because we believe the Lord does not look at our outside appearance but the inside and that is true. Then in that case, our in word appearance should affect our outward appearance. I&#8217;m not putting much emphasis on the dressing, but the point I am putting a cross is that how we begin will determine how we end.\u00a0 So we also worship casually, some songs are casual songs, pray casually and the rest. Jesus approached His Father by prayer in a very reverend way. The priests did not just meander into the presence of God casually; they got themselves ready looking presentable before the Lord, for God is holy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Proverbs 8:13, &#8220;The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride and arrogancy and the evil way, and froward mouth, do I hate&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">If we have sin in our lives and don<\/span><span style=\"font-family:SimSun;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">t feel convicted to deal with them, we lack the fear of the Lord. There is a big difference between<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">someone who is struggling with sin<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">and<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">someone who is in sin and has no desire to break out of it<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. I want the Holy Ghost to always convict me of the sin so as to break out of it for I love the Lord so much that I want to fear Him even more.

Fasting calls for discipline, forgoing what you love and value for something greater. It shows how serious you are. The dictionary definition for fasting is abstaining from food. If I took &#8220;ING&#8221; from the word \u201cFASTING\u201d, I\u2019m left with &#8220;FAST&#8221; which means moving quickly or swift.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">I can confidently say that adding FASTING to our prayer speeds up the process of prayer being answered<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. Fasting is not easy when you know what you have to miss but when you know you want to grow more in the Lord or you want to see God move mightily in your life,<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">fasting will be like a substance you add to speed up the prayer reaction<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">.<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Job 23:12, &#8220;I have not departed from the commandment of His lips;<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\"> I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;. Do you need God&#8217;s intervention so bad that you have to for go what you treasure and need for survival so that you can see Him move?<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">How serious you are depends on what drastic moves you make.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">2 Chronicles 20:3, &#8220;And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD,<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">. Having something that troubles you will cause you to rearrange your priorities. This king needed God&#8217;s intervention so bad that he had to seek the Lord, and for quick response, he added fast. As you continue to read, all Judah including wives, children joined in prayer and fasting, you can tell they really needed God&#8217;s intervention and God intervened right on time. A comedian was making a joke by saying that there are prayer requests he made to God, as time went by he realized they were the kind that needed prayer and fasting for things to happen. Realizing fasting was involved, he changed his mind, and he did not need those prayers answered anymore. Only those who are desperate to see God do something will go to the extent of setting their priorities right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Daniel on the other hand in the book of Daniel chapter 1 decided to do a different kind of fast to show that God sustains when you set your priorities right. People who served the king were to eat good food, balanced diet including drinks like wine. Daniel purposed not to defile himself with any of the king&#8217;s stuff cause he desired God more than what they offered him and his friends. Daniel decides to change, adjust his eating to\u00a0 only vegetables and water for 10 days,<\/span><strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Daniel 1:15, &#8220;And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king&#8217;s delicacies&#8221;.<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">You can think that when you fast you are loosing, the truth is you are winning, you are becoming stronger than you could have ever imagined. Being that Jesus had not eaten for 40 days, the devil thought He was weak. He did not understand that like Job, Jesus had esteemed God&#8217;s word more than His necessary food. No wonder He said, &#8220;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of God<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">&#8220;. He might have been weak physically but He was strong Spiritually. And when He overcame, the bible says, the angels came and ministered to Him. When you and I pray and fast, God will send His angels to minister to us too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Cambria;\">There is such a tremendous breakthrough when we add fasting to our prayer lives why, because some victories will not be gained without the two working together. The disciples could not cast out demons in\u00a0 little boy, not because they did not have faith or pray, they needed all that and more, they needed fast. They needed FPF (Faith, Prayer &amp; Fasting) and so do we.

              "<strong>Matthew 22:12, “So he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn part 1 of the Parable of the Wedding Feast, we looked at the reality of the Kingdom of God, and how it is opposed to the Kingdom of this world. Jesus has a Kingdom, and the Kingdom of God dwells within His children. <!--more-->The Kingdom of this world should not the one that God’s people chase after, but rather they should embrace the Kingdom of God, and the King (God) of the Kingdom!\r\n<strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>There is a Kingdom banquet!</strong> However, not only does a heavenly Kingdom exist, but<strong> there is a Kingdom banquet!</strong> The king threw a banquet on behalf of his son’s marriage. Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle <em>are</em> killed, and all things <em>are</em> ready. Come to the wedding. The king made that everything was prepared to his liking and his will. He ordered the meal, and wanted to make sure everything was set just right. The King is still throwing a banquet. John wrote in the book of <b>Revelation, “</b><strong>9 Then he said to me, “Write: ‘Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb (19:9)!’</strong> There is still a GREAT DAY coming for those that are the Bride of Christ, which will partake in wedding feast in Heaven. Will you be there? When Jesus sent out the 70 on their ministry assignment, they came back rejoicing that darkness (the demons) were subject to their authority in Christ. However Christ said, “<strong>Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven”, </strong> <strong>Luke 10:20.</strong> You may have your name written on your birth certificate, on your social security card, on your marriage license, and one day your name will be written on a tomb stone. But if your name is not written in the Lambs (<strong>Philippians 4:3; Revelation. 3:5</strong>), it does not matter if your name is written anywhere else. Those that have their names written in heaven’s role, will be the ONLY ones that will be at the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Kingdom servants spread the news</strong>! “<strong>3 and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come. 4 Again, he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding.”</strong> The King sent the servants out, and they obediently went out as the King commanded. They were to call all those invited to the wedding, but those they called were not willing to come. Still the king sent more servants out to tell those invited that the king has prepared a banquet table and has killed both his oxen killed and the fatted calf for the celebration. God is still sending his servants out to call people the upcoming banquet. Jesus sent His disciples out to minister (<b>Luke 10</b>) and his last words “<strong>Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature</strong>.” Instead of staying in all the church building, Jesus said “Go into all the world…” We are to be mobile, and that involves MOVEMENT. As you are going into all the world (the place you live, your community, the people you know, and the strangers you meet) you are to preach the Gospel. “20 <strong>Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ’s behalf, be reconciled to Go</strong><b>d (2Corinthians 5:20</b>).” The Gospel is simply the good news that Christ Jesus alone has paid the penalty (fine) for the Law (the 10 Commandments) that you and I have broken. “<b>While we were yet sinners Christ died for us.</b>” So to partake in this you are commanded to “<strong>Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the </strong><b>presence of the Lord (Acts 3:19)</b>.” Why is this crucial? “<b>And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment (Hebrews 9:27)</b>.” A servant obeys his or her master. Jesus said, “<strong>But why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do the things which I say</strong>? This is why Paul’ heart was so burdened that he proclaimed, “<strong>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel</strong> (<b>1Corinthians 1:17)</b>.” “<strong>For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel! 17 For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have been entrusted with a stewardship. 18 What is my reward then? That when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel</strong> (<b>1Corinthians 9:16-18</b>).”\r\n\r\n<strong>Kingdom servants will be persecuted</strong>. <b>“5 But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business. 6 And the rest seized his servants, treated them spitefully, and killed them.</b>” Some will outright reject the call and make light of it. I spoke to someone just recently, and he said, “<i>I’m just not into that,</i>” when I shared the Gospel with him, making light of his need for a Savior. Those that are servants of the King (God) are godly people, and God has promised something for them to look forward to. Paul wrote, “<strong>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution</strong> (<b>2Timothy 3:12</b>). The king in the parable sent out his servants, and his servants were seized, spitefully treated, and even killed. But there is another promise from God here, straight from the lips of Jesus. Jesus said, “10 <strong>Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11“Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. 12Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you (Matthew 5:10-12)</strong>.” This is not the kind of promises that most focus on, but in the full council of God, one cannot leave out these types promises in <b>2Timothy 3:12; Matthew 5:10-12. </b>The servants of the king were blessed by the persecution that they received as they received it on behalf of their king. To be continued…\r\nUntil the nets are filled…\r\nBlessings, Phil Sessa, Evangelist – Soulfishing Ministries <strong>&lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Matthew 22:11-12 “11But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment. 12 So he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>There is a Kingdom vindication</strong>. “<strong>But when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city”,</strong> (<strong>Matthew 22:7</strong>). <!--more-->The King cares about his Kingdom servants, and he did not sit idly by while his servants were being persecuted for their duties in serving their king. No, he would not stand for this when he heard the news. His anger welled up within him and he became furious. The most powerful one in this parable became angry and he would unleash his anger upon his enemies. He had invited many people to the banquet by the word of his servants, and previously some made light of it, and others were persecuted because of the message they carried from the king. However, the king would vindicate his servants proclaiming that they would not die in vain. He immediately dispatched his army, and destroyed the murderers and burned up their city. The people and the land were destroyed. His servants had gone out with the invitation, but when persecuted, he sent his soldiers out with judgment to vindicate his servants. Recall with me when Cain killed able. God said to Cain, “<strong>What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground”,</strong> (<strong>Genesis 4:10</strong>). I can imagine that those persecuted to death by the king’s enemies I can picture that their blood as well cried out to their king, a prayer as from the psalmist in <strong>Psalm 26</strong> “<strong>Vindicate me, O Lord, For I have walked in my integrity. I have also trusted in the Lord; I shall not slip (26:1). Do not gather my soul with sinners, Nor my life with bloodthirsty men, In whose hands is a sinister scheme, And whose right hand is full of bribes”</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you belong to the king and have been persecuted for your faith in Christ, or those you know belong to Him have been persecuted to the death, do not believe for a second that the Lord has overlooked this. He can hear even the blood that cries from the ground for His beloved servants, and He will make vindication for His names sake, so He will be glorified! <strong>Do you thank Him for this?</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Kingdom Inspection will be made. </strong>Notice who it was that came in to see the guests, it was the king! I can imagine that he was enjoying the sight of his guests each having a good time, each enjoying the company of one another, and the food that the kingdom so graciously provided for them to eat. As the king scanned the room, he saw each person properly dressed for the wedding, but then suddenly he eyes came across one that “<em>did not look like the others.”</em> As the King inspected each person he himself saw one man without the wedding garment. The king did not and would not overlook this man. He didn’t say, “<em>Well it’s only one person out of the multitude of guests, so I will simply overlook this man’s attire</em>.” No, not at all! The king summoned the man to himself and questioned him as to why he did not have on a wedding garment at a wedding, after this was the occasion. God will be the one that will inspect each person’s life one day. When He inspects your life, what will He find? <strong>Will you have on the wedding garment</strong>?\r\n\r\n<strong>The Kingdom wedding garment MUST be worn! </strong>Many people were called to the banquet, but according to the king’s requirements. It is evident that wearing this wedding garment was a requirement for the banquet. John MacArthur masterfully shares,<strong> “</strong><em>All without exception were invited to the banquet, so this man is not to be viewed as a common party-crasher. In fact, all the guests were rounded up hastily from “the highways” and therefore none could be expected to come with proper attire. That means the </em><strong><em>wedding garments were supplied by the king himself</em></strong><em>. So this man’s lack of a proper garment indicates he had purposely rejected the king’s own gracious provision. His affront to the king was actually a greater insult than those who refused to come at all, because he committed his impertinence in the very presence of the king. The imagery seems to represent those who identify with the kingdom externally, profess to be Christians, belong to the church in a visible sense—yet spurn the garment of righteousness Christ offers as Isaiah wrote, </em><strong><em>“I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, My soul shall be joyful in my God; For He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, And as a bride adorns herself with her jewel.</em></strong>\r\n\r\nInstead they seek to establish a righteousness of their own (see <strong>Romans. 10:3; Philippians 3:8, 9</strong>). Ashamed to admit their own spiritual poverty, they refuse the better garment the King graciously offers—and thus they are guilty of a horrible sin against His goodness.” <strong>Do you have the wedding garment on at this time</strong>?\r\nTo be continued…\r\nUntil the nets are filled…\r\nBlessings, Phil Sessa, Evangelist - Soulfishing Ministries"

              "<strong>Matthew 22:12-14, 12 So he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless. 13 Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’14“For many are called, but few are chosen.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Kingdom judgment is FINAL</strong>\r\n\r\nHumanity has created a vast number of ways in which to torture others. It seems that over the years, humanity has created more and more gruesome ways in which to torture one’s enemies.<!--more--> Some of these torturous methods use water, fire, lack of oxygen, harmful/poisonous gases, physical beatings, sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, overstretching of limbs and body, etc…. Yes the kingdom of this world has created some vicious ways to torture people, but can it really compare with the eternal torture pronounced by the Kingdom of God? This may sound strange, because you may think, like many, that God is a God of love and would never send anyone to Hell, or allow them to suffer for all eternity. However, one must not look to ones feelings, but rather to Scripture to validate if God would indeed judge humanity.\r\n\r\nIn part 3 of this series we left off with the focus of the wedding garment being rejected by the ONLY one that did not wear the wedding garment, who stood speechless before the King when questioned about it. This next part looks at what the Kings response is to this man’s rejection of the King’s gift of a wedding garment to him. The king summoned once again his servants. Recall that previously some of his servants were killed, but he vindicated his servants by destroying their persecutors and burning their persecutors city to the ground. Now as he calls his servants to stand before him he commands them to respond to the garmentless guest. He commands them, “<strong>Bind him hand and foot</strong>.” Now there is NO way he can put a garment on at all! Then he commands, “<strong>take him away</strong>,” now the king will not have to look upon this man that rejected the king’s free gift of a garment any longer. Finally he says, “<strong>cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth</strong>.” This certainly does not sound like a good thing. But where is this place that he is referring to? This speaks of inconsolable grief and unremitting torment. Jesus commonly used the phrases in this verse to describe hell (cf. <strong>13:42, 50; 24:51</strong>). The kingdom of this world cannot and its most horrific torture cannot compare to the eternal torture of an eternal Hell! Once again, I realize that there are those that would say, “<em>My God would never create hell.”</em> Those who say that are right: their “god” would never create hell, because he couldn’t. He doesn’t exist. He is a figment of their imagination, a god they have created to suit themselves. It’s called “idolatry,” and it’s the oldest sin in the Book. Idolaters will not inherit the kingdom of God. The one true God, however, could and did create hell for those who reject His mercy. They will reap His just wrath. Hell is a reasonable punish from a Holy King. Jesus said in <strong>Matthew 10:28, “And fear not them which kill the body [the world’s torture] , but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hell is real!</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Evidence Bible states,<strong> “</strong><em>Obviously, those who flippantly say such things don’t believe in the biblical concept of hell. Their understanding of the nature of God is erroneous. The slowwitted criminal thinks that the electric chair is a place to put up his feet for a while and relax. It may be wise therefore to speak with him for a few moments about the reasonableness of a place called hell. Reason with him by saying, “If a judge in Florida turns a blind eye to the unlawful dealings of the Mafia, if he sees their murderous acts and deliberately turns the other way, is he a good or bad judge? He’s obviously corrupt, and should be brought to justice himself. If he is a good judge, he will do everything within his power to bring those murderers to justice. He should make sure that they are justly punished. “If Almighty God sees a man rape and strangle to death your sister or mother, do you think He should look the other way, or bring that murderer to justice? If He looks the other way, He’s corrupt and should be brought to justice Himself. It makes sense then, that if God is good, He will do everything in His power to ensure justice is done. The Bible tells us that He will punish murderers, and the place of punishment—the prison God will send them to—is a place called hell. “God should punish murderers and rapists. However, God is so good, he will also punish thieves, liars, adulterers, fornicators, and blasphemers. He will even punish those who desired to murder and rape but never took the opportunity. He warns that if we hate someone, we commit murder in our hearts. If we lust, we commit adultery in the heart, etc.” Then take the time to tell him of the reality of hell. Sinners like to picture hell as a fun, hedonistic, pleasure-filled place where they can engage in all the sensual sins that are forbidden here. But Jesus said that it is a place of torment, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched (</em><strong><em>Matthew 9:45-47</em></strong><em>). We tend to forget what pain is like when we don’t have it. Can you begin to imagine how terrible it would be to be in agony, with no hope of relief? Many human beings go insane if they are merely isolated for a long time from other people. Imagine how terrible it would be if God merely withdrew all the things we hold so dear—friendship, love, color, light, peace, joy, laughter, and security. Hell isn’t just a place with an absence of God’s blessings, it is punishment for sin. It is literal torment, forever. That’s why the Bible warns that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. God has given His Law to convince men of their sins, and unless a sinner is convinced that he has sinned against God, he won’t see that hell is his eternal destiny. He may consider it a fit place for others, but not for himself. That’s why we mustn’t hesitate to open up the Law and show that each individual is personally responsible for sin, and that God’s wrath abides on him because of it. Ask him to consider why you would say such things to him if it wasn’t true. Tell him to examine your motives. You are so concerned for his eternal welfare that you are prepared to risk offending him. Then ask him if he would sell an eye for a million dollars. Would he sell both for ten million? No one in his right mind would. Our eyes are precious to us. How much more then is our eternal soul worth? </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Annihilationism and Soul Sleep are false doctrines </strong>\r\n\r\nThere are those who accept that hell is a place of punishment, but believe that the punishment is to be <strong>annihilated</strong>—to cease conscious existence. They can’t conceive that the punishment of the wicked will be conscious and eternal. If they are correct, then a man like Adolph Hitler, who was responsible for the deaths of millions, is being “punished” merely with <strong>eternal sleep [soul sleep]</strong>. His fate is simply to return to the non-existent state he was in before he was born, where he doesn’t even know that he is being punished. However, Scripture paints a different story. The rich man who found himself in hell (<strong>Luke 16:19–31</strong>) was conscious. He was able to feel pain, to thirst, and to experience remorse. He wasn’t asleep in the grave; he was in a place of “torment.” <strong>The Seventh Day Advents and the cults of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Mormons hold to these doctrines.</strong>\r\n\r\nIf hell is a place of knowing nothing or a reference to the grave into which we go at death, Jesus’s statements about hell make no sense. He said that if your hand, foot, or eye causes you to sin, it would be better to remove it than to “go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched” (<strong>Mark 9:43–48</strong>).\r\n\r\n<strong>A biblical description of Hell</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Bible refers to the fate of the unsaved with such fearful words as the following:\r\n\r\n“Shame and everlasting contempt” (<strong>Daniel 12:2</strong>)\r\n“Everlasting punishment” (<strong>Matthew 25:46</strong>)\r\n“Weeping and gnashing of teeth” (<strong>Matthew 24:51</strong>)\r\n“Fire unquenchable” (<strong>Luke 3:17</strong>)\r\n“Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish” (<strong>Romans 2:8,9</strong>)\r\n“Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord” (<strong>2Thessalonians 1:9)</strong>\r\n“Eternal fire...the blackness of darkness for ever” (<strong>Jude vs. 7,13</strong>)\r\n\r\n<strong>Revelation 14:10,11</strong> tells us the final, eternal destiny of the sinner: “<strong>He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone...the smoke of their torment ascended up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day or night.”</strong>\r\n\r\nPlease, if you are reading this and you have never repented of your sin and trusted Christ alone for your salvation do it NOW. Likewise if you are a Christian then please with all the compassion you have in Christ Jesus, please use the Law of God (The Ten Commandments) to warn others both those you know as well as strangers you meet of the coming judgment. Do it for someone you love, even loving your enemies.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…\r\nBlessings,\r\n\r\nPhil Sessa, Evangelist Soulfishing Ministries <strong>&lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Psalm 118:8, \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put your confidence in man\"<a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image1.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-6267 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image1.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"236\" height=\"236\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nLife is a long and bumpy road. We each carry our troubles, like heavy load. There are many hard turns and some dead ends. However whenever we are stuck, we must know whom look to. Think of the elections, majority put their confidence in the next president hoping he will turn things around.\r\n\r\nThe scripture verse above is right in the middle of the bible. I would call it the heartbeat of every man who understands what life is. When I look at a scripture, I tend to pick out a word or two to understand why the author chose to use those particular words. In this case, the author used the word <strong>\"Confidence</strong>\" instead of \"<strong>Faith</strong>\" and my first reaction was, is there any difference? Let's start with “faith”, faith is trust, belief and confidence. <!--more-->Can we say then that both faith and confidence are the same? The answer is yes but their use has different WEIGHTS. <strong>Confidence is derived from the word confide which is to tell confidential matters or imparting secrets</strong>. <strong>Confidence is also faith that one will act in a right proper and effective way</strong>. My favorite definition, <strong>confidence stresses faith in one's self and one's power without any suggestion of conceit or arrogance. God is confident in Himself, His ability can no one match. This is my personal conviction, I can have faith in man but I CANNOT have confidence in man.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhy is this so important to us then? Confidence in man is a shaky confidence as man is weak in the flesh and can stumble over what they have committed themselves to. Putting unrealistic expectations on people is not wise, be it in a ministry, workforce, relationships. If they don't come through, views of them may change. I have seen people attach themselves to relationships for ages because at the beginning, they gave out everything about themselves and put their total confidence in that person. When things did not work out, they were left hurt, confused, raged and some went into depression.\r\n\r\nIt's been proven that man finds it hard to maintain what he is committed to. When you and I understand people’s weakness, how we handle and how we are handled becomes different. Man is weak without God and we know that in every believer, there is nothing good in a person except the Lord. When the bible says man has fallen short of the glory of God, it's an indication that however hard man tries, there will always be an area of deficiency in his life.\r\n\r\nLet's look at it from relationships point view. A man and a woman meet, they get attracted to each other, they begin to date, they fall in love, everything appear to be going well. The man can't stop talking about this woman he has met who has all the qualities he ever desired, perfect mate for him with no flaws. He can't wait to see her, does everything for her, she is the first thing in his mind and the last thing and the same goes for the woman. Secrets have been shared, some confidential matters because of the bond. Not long after, little irritating, annoying things begins to pop up; certain behaviors that you never imagined are revealed. Now they don't look as wonderful as they looked before, the thoughts, things they used to do diminish. This is life, things happen and yet we still tend to put our confidence in man in a way hoping that they will not fail us or we fail them. If they survive knowing how to work it out, great. But how about those who did not work it out and ended up breaking up? as said before, they will be left hurt, confused, pushed a side, feeling used and misused. Now no one wants to be even friends and if there are other friends, they will try to talk them out of their developed friendships. This is what amazes me right after, everyone believes they were wronged and would want an apology without them giving it. I have heard stories of break ups and each side had a different story blaming the other one but not hearing anyone say, “<em>I messed up here and I messed up there I need to be forgiven</em>. <em>I should have handled this more maturely. Yes, I might have been wronged but the way I handled it was not good at all</em>”\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 118:8, \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put your confidence in man</strong>\". People can fail you and so will you fail them, the heartbeat of the scripture teaches us that it's okay to trust man and have confidence in him but it is better to have both trust and confidence in God. I would say the reason is simple, if you can learn to confide in God, if you are failed, you will have learnt to handle people. Distancing yourself from them wouldn't be right, but you will learn to forgive and move on. You will have someone to completely trust in who will teach you how to handle a person who either has failed you or can fail you. God never fails and shouldn't be looked at the way the other person who failed you. He holds the secrets without blowing your cover, knows your weakness yet still accepts you. He wasn't attracted to you based on what you presented to Him. If man failed you, know that God has not therefore let this scripture strengthen you, <strong>Psalm 118:17, \"I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord</strong>\". Let nothing make you faint. If a relationship did not work, it might have left you wounded but it did not kill you. Ask the Lord to give you strength and grace to speak <strong>Psalm 118:17</strong> and move on, God whom you have confidence in has a way of blessing you again. Blessing Evans"

              "<strong>Jude 22-23, “Be merciful to those who doubt; snatch others from the fire and save them; to others show mercy, mixed with fear—hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.” </strong>\r\n\r\nI once watched a movie Volcano starring Tommy Lee Jones about a volcano that erupts in downtown L.A. I began to meditate on one scene in particular whereby a group of firemen are down in the subway rescuing unconscious people that were aboard a train. <!--more-->While the men were carrying people to safety, the fire chief would go to the next car on the train and pick up an unconscious man, but as he saw the lava headed his way melting all in its path. The fire chief selflessly carried the man through the train, and his shoes began to melt. When he got to where the lava was flowing he had a choice to either drop the guy on the floor, leaving him for dead, thus saving his own life or jump into the lava and throw the victim to safety. The chief chose to jump into the lava flow and throw the man to safety causing the chief to be consumed by lava. This scene reminded me of the verse from Jude which speaks of “<strong>snatching others from the fire and saving them”</strong>. To have the actions like the fire chief Christians must be willing to do the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Be where lost people are</strong>. The people aboard the train were lost and unconscious until the firefighters searched the train. Most Christians disconnect with all their unsaved friends within the first two years of their conversion to Christ. I understand that relationships need to change when one is converted to Christ, but most are unbalanced in the manner in which they do so. As a result many forsake those Christ died for by severing relationships with the ungodly, rather than to be “<strong>a friend of sinners</strong>” like our Savior.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Pick up lost people (not in the dating sense)</strong>. The fire fighters did their job to pick up the lost that were in danger of burning in the lava flames. As Christians it is our job to pick up relationships with the lost purposefully to try and lead them to the only safe haven from the flames of Hell and that is Christ, the Living Water.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Some need you to deal with them very directly and vigorously</strong>. The chief just grabbed the victim in urgency because it was a life and death situation. Salvation is God's work, but Christians are God's instruments for<b> s</b><strong>natching brands out of the fire</strong> (<strong>Zech 3:3</strong>). The picture is of a person slipping into the eternal fire but rescued from error by the grace and truth of God carried to them by a Christian. <em>Darrell Robinson</em> said “<strong>The world says you can’t confront people with Jesus; you’ll run them off. Where are you going to run them to? Hell number 2?</strong>”</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Be selfless. </strong>The fire chief gave his own life to save the unconscious victim. What is the worst thing that can happen to you when sharing your faith? You can be rejected or killed (being killed is unlikely). However what is the worst thing that can happen to the unsaved person? They end up in Hell. Who, may I ask, has a worse outcome? No of us want to feel rejected by others. Christ and His twelve were rejected on many of occasions. If we are preaching the Gospel according to Jesus there will be those that reject us as well. Choose to purposefully be around lost people being a “<strong>friend of sinner,</strong>” pick them up, deal at necessary times directly and vigorously with a selfless attitude toward them. Seek and save the lost like out Master, because the harvest in plenty, but the laborers are few.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Judges 6:11-40&amp;7:1-25, &quot;...The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor&quot;</strong>\n\nWe all love the presence of God, His Son, the Holy Ghost and God’s Angels. Any time we feel alone and the thought of no one cares, there is always a way God reaches out to us in ways no one else can.<!--more-->\n\n\nIn the book of<strong> Judges 6:11 </strong>begins by reading<strong>, &quot;Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress in order to hide it from the Midianites&quot;. </strong>In the story if you begin from the previous chapters, we find how Israel had disobeyed God and how God brought Midianites, Amalekites and the people of the East to come against them. The reason why this came to them was because of the idols they worshiped, this led to some of them taken captive and while others were hiding in caves, on mountains and under some sacred tree where Gideon was found. Gideon was hiding avoid dealing with present situation, he felt like there was nothing more to live for. He had lost hope and confidence, he came from one of the poorest and youngest families. He was hiding in shame, despair, weak, broken, rejected, abused, feeling like a failure, confused wondering where is God when he needs Him the most. Have you ever been in a situation where all you felt was a victim of circumstance and you wondered what is wrong with me that I have to deal with all these?, where is God when I need Him?, He seems to be blessing everyone but me? My neighbors are happy, my friends seem to get it all together, their families are not broken like mine. Ever felt like some people were getting promotions but you? you seem to be trying very hard but they keep raising someone instead of you?, have you ever been somewhere where everything wasn't working right?, you try to say the right thing but it comes out the wrong way?, you try to succeed but you keep failing? I know some have felt this way and that is what our friend Gideon also felt. This led him to do nothing but thresh wheat under winepress. He had stopped trying, he didn’t see any future out of it and so what was left to do was sit and call it a quit. In his dilemma, the Angel of the Lord appears, sits down under the tree and watches what Gideon is doing in his lost thoughts.\n\n<strong>Chapter 6:12-13, &quot;And the Angel of the Lord appeared to Him, and said to him, The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor. Gideon said to Him, &quot;O my Lord, &quot;if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about,....now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites&quot;</strong>. Here is a man who had suffered for a while, the Angel of the Lord (The Lord in an Angel form) appears and tells him, &quot;<strong>the Lord is with you</strong>&quot;. <em>Lord if you are with me, how come I am suffering?, if you are with me, how come I had to go through this and that?</em> Something to think about, we don't have to feel the Lord to know He is present, the bible calls Him <strong>Jehovah Shammah </strong>which means He is present. When you think He wasn't there He was. You may have not felt like He was doing anything but be assured He was there and in the case of Gideon, He was always there and yet Gideon did not know. Think of it, if God wasn't with him, he could have been captured, he could have been killed, greater terrible things could have happened but because God was with him, none of these happened to him. You might have been wondering where the Lord was when you broke up with your girlfriend or boyfriend, where was He when you lost your job, when you were sick, when they lied on you, when they prevented you from receiving what you know was meant for you, where was He when your parents went through a divorce, where was He? You did not feel Him when you needed Him and now He appears and calls you what, <strong>&quot;mighty man (woman) of Valor&quot;?</strong>\n\nTo close on part 1, I have to say that whenever God is going to lift someone up, the rooted issues have to be dealt with for where you are going doubts, fear, un answered question cannot come with you for they will be an hindrance to what He wants to do. Gideon is launching His complain but all he needed to understand that regardless of what he went through and had to deal with. And though the presence of God was always there, he needed to appreciate the fact that He manifested Himself in other words revealed Himself marking a beginning of something greater. Whenever the Lord reveals Himself, He has something in mind to accomplish through His chosen vessels who appear to be weak for His own glory. To continue."

              "<strong>Judges 6:11-40&amp;7:1-25, \"...The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe looked Gideon’s response to the Angel of the Lord when He appeared to him and said, <strong>\"The Lord is with you\" </strong>. It did not make sense to him having suffered for a while. He did not see how the Lord could have possibly been with him, and I agreed with Gideon at one point until I looked deeper and realized the Lord was with him the whole time, otherwise worse things could have happened to him had it not been for God’s hands protecting him. We said, where we are going doubt, fear, un answered questions cannot come with us, they are a hindrances to God’s move.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Judges 6:12, \"... you mighty man of valor</strong>\"<strong>. </strong>The Lord called Gideon a might man of valor in the midst of his well versed history. He was like a little boy hiding himself from harm’s way not imagining himself as a mighty man for valor. <strong>Your past history is not a mystery to God</strong>, He is not even moved an inch by who you used to be, He knows your history. If He was concerned of your past, He would have killed you after He saved you. When you did not even know Him, He protected you, you could have died in that hospital bed, you could been crushed in that car accident, many things could have happened but He kept you. We are not better than those who have not made it this far. This is <strong>the favor of the Lord for when we were not, then we were because of what He did on the cross</strong>. If He cared for us when we did not know Him, how much more will He care for those who know Him and are His? If God needed someone else, He could have gone after them, but down in your need, in pain, in a state of confusion He revealed Himself. <strong>God is not a respecter of any man </strong>and that's why in <strong>1Corinthians 1:27-29, \"But God has chosen the foolish things of this world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of this world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, that no flesh should glory in His presence\". </strong>\r\n\r\nI was never chosen because I was eloquent, strong and educated, I was chosen in midst fears and weakness and so were you.<strong> Romans 8:30, “Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these also He justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified\"</strong>. Moreover whom He predestined which means He preordained to which I would also interpret as He pre approved their destiny, and why pre? because God has approved people's destiny and for the people to get to their destiny, <strong>they have got to be willing to get there (human response).</strong> This is no different in setting a table with food before someone, you don’t force them to eat, all you do is set a table before them. <strong>Isaiah 1:19, \"If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land\". </strong>The Lord will not force anyone to their destiny, He will reveal His plan and then you have to be willing to move. This is where faith comes is <strong>Hebrews 11:1, \"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\", </strong>it's not the Lord hoping but we His people. So the people He predestined, He also called and those He called, He also justified, Justify here could also mean qualified for we failed the qualifying test from day one but He still qualified us anyway in Christ Jesus. Those He justified (qualified), He also glorified which I would say He talked highly off, exalted. <strong>1Peter 5:6, \"Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due season</strong>\" Mark the word <strong>HE MAY</strong>not <strong>I MAY</strong>. God will exalt you in due season. God did not <strong>CTQ</strong> <strong>(Call The Qualified), He QTC</strong> (<strong>Qualified The Called)</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Angel calls him Mighty man of Valor because He was not done with him. This is not an indication that God needed Gideon but rather, God chose to magnify Himself through Gideon. The Lord was going to draw out of Gideon <strong>hidden potentials </strong>He had been reserving for a time Israel needed them the most. If you thought this was it, wait till the Lord reveals the potentials He put on reserve. Under the winepress was your hiding place from your enemies, however with your new birth, new call, you have to be willing to change and move as He instructs. To continue, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Judges 6:11-40&amp;7:1-25, \"...The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Judges 6:16, \"And the Lord said to him, \"Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man\", </strong>Our God is full of promises that He keeps, David reports God's faithfulness in keeping promises. <!--more-->\r\nIn <strong>Psalm 37:25 he says, \"I have been young and now I am old, and I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread\", 2Corinthians 1:20, \"For all the promises of God in Him are yea, and in Him Amen, unto the glory of God\"</strong>. God promises Gideon to be with him and then He promises to help him defeat the Midianites. Let me make a point here, <strong>the promises of God can only be fulfilled if you stick with the plan</strong>. Jesus stuck with the plan by going to cross. At one point He desired that the cup of wrath of God would pass Him, nevertheless He said, “<strong>not my will but Your will be done</strong>”. By the time Jesus was done, He came out as One Man/God and the same is promised to Gideon if he stuck to the plan.\r\n\r\n<strong>Willingness and promise requires a change </strong>for in <strong>verse 18 of Judges 6, \"The he said to Him, \"Do not depart from here, I pray, until I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You.\" And He said, \"I will wait until you come back\". </strong>Gideon has encountered with the truth, for the first time someone has told him something about himself he never knew, he has been promised God's presence and victory, he is so blessed by what he hears that he cannot afford to lose the opportunity to be in the presence of the Lord. When you encounter with the truth like Gideon you can't miss the opportunity of always wanting to be with the one who has revealed to you who you are, has promised to always be with you and has also promised victory. <strong>For Gideon his time of receiving ended now it was his time go give,</strong> he goes to the house to bring the best sacrifice to offer before the Angel of the Lord (the Lord). Human beings in general are selfish people it’s about us, about our gratification, about what I can gain out of it. We always love to be in the receiving end but to effectively walk with God, there is receiving and giving, <strong>Luke 6:38, \"Give and it shall be given to you...\".</strong> <strong>Jesus was the Master yet He gave, God so loved the world that He gave and so can we</strong>. <strong>Sacrifice is giving up something for the sake of someone else. Hebrews 13:15, \"By Him therefore let us offer sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name\", </strong>where you want to go will cost you time, availability, faithfulness, teaching, money, sleep, reaching out to the unlovely, washing all manner of feet. It will cost you to pray even fast.<strong>If it doesn't cost you anything, I wouldn't call it a sacrifice</strong>. Gideon goes and prepares a sacrifice brings it over and it's presented to the Lord.\r\n\r\nI thought that is all that he needed to do and all would be fine but there is more. But then <strong>Judges 6:25, \"Now it came to pass the same night that the Lord said to him, \"Takes your father's young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal...\". </strong>Basically this means that now you got to bring down everything that is a hindrance to your move, things that are more important to you than God has to come down. If you've been worshipping a person, position, your money, your favorite game, they must come down. Gideon was not forced to bring them down, he was told and now the decision had to be his. <strong>Judges 6:26, \"and build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this rock in the proper arrangement\"</strong>. It's tough to bring down what you consider valuable to you. it's scary even for Gideon but he knows that either now or never, he is scared of bringing that which they love but for the sake of his people, family, community, himself he is compelled to do it. What sacrifices have you made to walk effectively with God? what altars have you brought down and built that you know were not of God? Are you willing to change? and if so, what are you doing about to change? Who are you looking to. To finish, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Judges 6:11-40&amp;7:1-25, “…The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Judges 6:33, “Then all the Medianites and Amelikites, the people of the East, gathered together; they crossed over and encamped in the Valley of Jezreal”</strong> you read of these people camping somewhere in readiness to attack Gideon and his people, <!--more-->vs. <strong>34&amp;35, “But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon; then he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites gathered behind him, and he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh…Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; they came to meet him”</strong>. I’m beginning to see a different Gideon for the first time since we started talking about him. Remember how he would hide when he knew that their enemies were coming. We read of the Spirit of God coming upon him, he begins to exercise the calling for what He was not, now He is because of the Spirit of God. When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon you, He empowers you to become what He had called you to be which is a sign that you will take less and do much with it.\r\n\r\nGideon was now a leader gathering all 5tribes to listen to him. I ask myself, don’t the tribes know who he was and how he came from the smallest family in Israel? well let’s be reminded that the Favor of the Lord would cause you to be favored by many. I saw it when Jesus arriving in Jerusalem riding on a donkey, people were casting their garments, leaves, robes and cloaks on the ground that the donkey (favored donkey) would ride on it. Now let’s not get over heel thinking that when we see them do the same before us that they are doing it for us, they are actually doing it for the Man who sits on the donkey and to us the Man who sits inside. <strong>1John 4:4, “Ye are of God, ye little children for you have overcome them, for greater is He that lives inside of you than He that lives in the world”</strong>. I know we have used this line “<strong>than he that lives in the world</strong>” in reference to the devil but let’s look at it again, greater is He who lives inside of me than us who live in the world. He who lives me is greater than I.\r\n\r\nLet’s jump to Chapter<strong> 7:2, “And the Lord said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Medianites into their hands, lest Israel claim glory for itself against me, saying, ‘My own hand saved me”</strong>. The 5 tribes he gathered resulted to 33000 people ready to fight. He believed that the greater the number, the greater the victory. I have been in positions where I knew God was doing and He did not use what I thought He would. Please don’t start loosing heart because what you thought the Lord was going to use in your life is actually contrary to what He had in mind. Many who had dreams and visions for their lives and Spirit of the Lord was upon them discovered the Lord chose to go a different direction. God always has a perfect plan.\r\n\r\n<strong>Judges 7:3, “Now therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, “whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn and depart…”</strong> And 22 thousand of the people returned and ten thousand remained. The victory would not rest on numbers but trust in the Lord. <strong>Psalm 118:8, “It’s better to trust in the Lord than to put you confidence in man”</strong>,. In response to the big number, the Lord responded to him <strong>vs. 4, “... “The people are still too many; bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there…” Vs 5, “So he brought the people down to the water. And the Lord said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set a part by himself; likewise everyone who gets down on his knees to drink, vs. 6, “And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth was 300 men” </strong>and the rest were sent back home. This always come back to me, <strong>Mathew 22:14, “For many are called but few are chosen</strong>” 33,000 men were called, only 300 men were chosen. Those who lapped like a dog, they were the right people for the job, they were not ashamed to make a fool out of themselves before the Lord, they were cautious because as they scoop the water and lap out of the hands, their eyes were set to see if the enemy was coming, they were the type of people God knows that whatever He tells them to do, they would obey, they had the same spirit Gideon had. These are FAT people, (Faithful, Available and Teachable)\r\n\r\nDo you want to be used of God? Then be FAT, you have to be faithful in serving the Lord, you have to be available to be used and you need to be willing to be taught. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>James 1:19-20, “My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/image1.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6263 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/image1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"232\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nGod gave us all two ears and only one mouth. I think by our mere creation, God has designed us to do twice as much listening than we do speaking. First we must be quick to listen. Are you a careful listener, intent listener? Husbands do you give your wife your undivided attention when called upon by them during a time when they need your ears to just listen and not your mouth of advice?\r\n\r\nYour communication with your spouse should be a two-way conversation that involves time effort, <!--more-->intention (what’s in their heart), sending clear messages, and understanding clearly. Your communication with your spouse involves more than a speech but voice tone, eye contact and body language. Does your face, your eyes say I love you when your mouth speaks those words?\r\n\r\nMen are fixers for the most part, and when our wives share something with us, they many times don’t want us to fix the problem but rather listen to their feelings concerning the problem. I wouldn’t want to be treated like a project that needs fixing. Many times in marriage, arguments are due to misunderstandings or miscommunication, and sometimes flat out bad, or even no communication. When we are quick to listen, we engage our ears and our mind. We shouldn’t treat our wives words like background elevator music, hearing vice tones but not processing their words. <strong>Proverbs 17:28</strong> says,<strong> \"Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue</strong>.\" We learn much more by listening to our spouses then. Formulating our next response in our minds, just waiting for them to breathe or pause so we can blurt out our response is not listening. This is why James says to be not only quick to listen but also slow to speak. This is to bring proper balance lest we are quick to listen and quick to speak. Seek first to understand then to be understood.\r\n\r\nHave you ever tried to reflectively listen when spoken to, that is try and reiterate or sum up what you think is being said back to your spouse? What is she really trying to communicate to me? Does she feel uncared for when I ….? Does she feel unwanted or unappreciated when I do.? The more you listen to her the more you will understand her at her core. That is why Jesus stated, “…<strong>For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks (Matthew 12:34)</strong>. You can tell someone’s heart by listening to their words, views, concerns, cares, interests, etc.\r\n\r\nIn<strong> 1Samuel 3:1-10</strong> we see that God was trying to speak to a young boy Samuel who God would call as a prophet. For some time Samuel kept thinking that Eli was calling him. It’s the Lord who was calling Samuel three times before it was realized that God, not Eli was trying to speak to him. The LORD came and stood there, calling as other times, <strong>\"Samuel! Samuel!\" Then Samuel said</strong>, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\"<strong>Speak, for your servant is listening</strong></span>.\" Samuel said speak, for your servant is listening. Wow, how we too should respond to God that way, be quick to listen to God and slow to speak (interrupt) Him. That same attitude can be applied to our spouse. What I’m not my spouse's servant I’m God’s servant you may say. Jesus said instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be a servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. (<strong>Mark 10:43-44</strong>)\r\n\r\nMy pastor shared with me something that I would like to echo to you. He said you know about half of yourself, and God is going to use your wife to learn the other half. Wow! That is similar to what Evans shared about when he asked what if God brought you and your wife together not to make you happy as His first priority but to make you holy. Who will know you better than your wife? You and your wife are the best students of one another.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: Be a servant to the Lord and your spouse, and be quick to listen to them, hearing their true heart, and seeing the privilege of them speaking to you. God should be listened to first and your spouse second</strong>. Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Philippians 3:13&amp;14, “Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended; but this is one thing I do, I forget those things which are behind reaching unto those things which are before, I press towards the mark of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ Jesus”</strong>\r\n\r\nI think that one of the greatest struggles for a Christian is trying to keep up with the Lord. Often times as we walk with the Lord, we get distracted on the way and we loose focus and it takes us time to get back to where we need to be. Also a few people get beaten by their own opinion about themselves especially being affected and infected by their past and so they cannot progress. We know for sure that there is nothing good in man except Christ and in as much as we have failed miserably and we ought to be thrown into the lake of fire, Christ in us cannot deny Himself by casting us away. The fact is we don’t deserve to live but the truth is He has called us His own. We are adopted to be sons and daughters of God.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Romans 7</strong>, Paul talks much on the struggle with sin, how he learnt what sin is all is, he tells us of what sin does and then he concludes the chapter in<strong> Romans 7:24-25, “24 O wretched man that I am, who shall rescue me from this body of death? 25, “Thanks be to God-through Jesus Christ our Lord!. So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin”.</strong> He discovered how vulnerable to sin he was but he did not leave it there, he is transitioned from defeat to triumph in the next chapter where he writes, <strong> Romans 8:1, “There is therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus”.</strong> It’s very easy to dwell on who you used to be instead of looking at what the Lord is doing right now. We can’t deny the fact that we all have histories, we are all from the past, good things and bad things happened. While trying to live in the past we concentrate on the bad things that happened. We keep on bringing to remembrance what the Lord forgave us of and forgot about. Instead progressing to the healing part of our growth, we keep falling back to the same things we thought we dealt with.\r\n\r\nHave you ever assassinated victories in your life because you still dwelt on who you used to be? cried yourself to sleep, couldn’t reach level of trusting someone again with your life because of what they did to you, haunted by a memory, an incident, an accident and you can’t see clearly where you are going.<strong> I am terrified of becoming who I used to be, just the thought of it makes me sick but I cannot undo what’s been done</strong>,<strong> I cannot change where I have come from and I cannot waste my time trying to fix what has been broken</strong>. I am too wise for that, every time I bring to remembrance my past failures, I want them to remind me that they were the bridge the Lord would use to tailor me to become who I am today. If I don’t see my past as bridge, it’s time leave it in the sea of forgetfulness. As long as the past haunts you, ask the Lord for strength to put it behind you otherwise you will not move far in Christ. Paul tells us how wretched he was then he moves to the next verse and thanks the Lord for he is reminded that what he is not, he can be if Christ is in his life.\r\n\r\n<strong>Philippians 3:13&amp;14, “Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended; but this is one thing I do, I forget those things which are behind reaching unto those things which are before, I press towards the mark of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ Jesus</strong>“. In NIV it says, “<strong>Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it”.</strong> What an indication that the struggle continues, he knows where he’s come from, he used to persecute Christians and then he got saved and the struggle continues.<strong> \"...But this is one thing I do, I forget those things which are behind reaching unto those things which are before...\".</strong> He knew that for him to progress, he had to put all the past failures behind otherwise his next move will be hindered.<strong> \"...I press towards the mark of the high call calling of God in Christ Jesus\", </strong>meaning, I have a destiny and so I press on. The word press does not mean walk into it,<strong> but fight and pushing your way through, pressing also means applying some force</strong> and that is resisting the past that tries to assassinate your move. Mark how he puts it, <strong>pressing TOWARD (FORWARD), toward the mark</strong>, the goal Christ set for me from the beginning. I am looking at the end result while I am still moving towards it. Talk to God about who you used to be and who you are and He will talk to you about the mark of His high calling in your life. We as believers have received a calling and not just a calling but a HIGH CALLING and with that in mind,<strong> YOU CAN’T CHANGE WHERE YOU COME FROM, BUT YOU CAN CHANGE WHERE YOU ARE GOING BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CALLING. YOU CANNOT UNDO WHAT’S BEEN DONE, YOU CAN UNDO WHAT’S NOT BEEN DONE.</strong> Break out of what is putting you down and forget those things which are behind and begin to press on towards the mark of His high calling.

              "<strong>Daniel 3:17&amp;18, “17…our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18, But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.”</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce in a while in life you will experience disappointments. As I’m put this message together, someone has been disappointed in the last few days. If you’ve never been disappointed, I guess you haven’t hit puberty yet. Disappointed in your job, relationship, boss, children, church, friends. Either you will disappoint someone or they will be disappointed by you, that is a fact of life. <strong>Disappointment simply means a feeling of dissatisfaction that results when your expectations are not realized</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nDisappointments go hand in hand with shock because it just darned to you that what you had hopes for, worked for, groomed, expected has turned out to be something else. Shock leads to lock in, being extra careful, cautious and not ready to go through the same path again because of what you experienced last time. Often times disappointments leave people disoriented, confused leading them to want to do something they will regret later. It could lead to trying to frustrate the person who has disappointed you so as to get even with them or lead you to stay away. How can one deal with disappointments? I really don’t have a concrete answer but let me share with you how God has taught me to deal with them.\r\n\r\nFirst lets look at three men Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. These men were brought from Israel to serve in the land of Babylon but not as slaves. Men required for the job had to be, <strong>Daniel 1:4, “young men in whom there was no blemish, but good-looking, gifted in all wisdom, possessing knowledge and quick to understand, who had ability to serve in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the language and literature of the Chaldeans”</strong>. By looking at what was needed, these men had all the qualities. They saw themselves living in the king’s palace, serving in the high ranks and they did until one day a decree was passed that everyone was expected to bow to an idol. I can imagine them being disappointed because what they hoped for had changed. They came to serve the king but not his gods, they had a God whom they were serving and living for. They had been faithful to the Almighty God, why would they be in a place of disappointment at this time? After a while, it was explained to them of the furnace heated seven times just for them if they did not bow but this was their response, <strong>Daniel 3:16-18, “…, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 17, If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18, But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.”</strong> Why would they speak in this manner in a situation like this?, They had shock absorbers. Unless you have shock absorbers, disappointments will ruin your life. What are shock absorbers? Shock is a violent collision or impact, simply a heavy blow what disappointments are. Absorbers means enduring or accommodating. Cars have absorbers to help steady the impact on the bumps and pot holes it might or will hit. Shock absorbers help level what is already there and that is what the three young men did. I believe they looked at what the Lord had done in their lives. The qualities and the abilities they had that some other young men did not have and that became their shock absorbers. Though disappointed in one area, what had been done could not be compared to what lied a head of them. Because of that, they were able bounce back with a new message, “<strong>Our God whom we serve is able…”, </strong>their shock absorber was on what God had done and what God could do<strong>, “…But if not…”, </strong>you can not make a statement like this without having your shock absorbers on. These men’s minds were made up, their disappointments could not keep them down. Would you allow your disappointments to keep you down when you have your shock absorbers on?\r\n\r\nBounce back, shake it off, get right back on the track, move on, put everything that has happened in the past only carry what can boost you a head. Let it go, let it fade in the dark. If you got to cry, swim through your tears, dry it out and kiss it goodbye because God has given you shock absorbers. Don’t allow your disappointments to dictate what you can be, you can use them to create new appointments. For the three men, their disappointments allowed them to see God in a new dimension because they created appointments out of them, and in that was God glorified. If you’ve been disappointed, find your shock absorbers and bounce back on the track. Blessings Ev."

              "<strong>Exodus 14: 13-14, “…And Moses said unto the people, Fear not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will show to you today: for the Egyptians (your enemies who are pursuing after you) whom you have seen today, you shall see them again no more forever. The Lord shall fight for you, and you shall hold your peace”. </strong>\n\nI want to bring to your attention, today, that life is not easy, and that your life is and will be full of trouble. No matter who you are or where you are, you will encounter moments and experiences that will leave you not knowing what to do. <!--more-->\nHave you ever said to yourself in the face of a problem or situation, “<em>I don’t know what to do”?</em> I have, many times. We each face times when our life is filled with fear, doubts, confusion, hopelessness, sorrow, pain, anxiety and uncertainty, exhaustion and desperation, distress and depression, and a lot more than I can catalogue here. Sometimes, we are surrounded by pain and perplexity. In addition, we wonder whether life is still what it used to be or should be. We sometimes question the love of God and even, accuse him of negligence. We sometimes ask questions like “<em>Why has God allowed this to happen to me?’ or “What I have done or not done to deserve this?” or “Why can’t I be successful or be blessed with this or that, like other people or my friends?” </em>\n\nWhatever your questions are or may be, I don’t have an answer, but I want to remind you or make you aware of a few facts of life that you need to know and live by, and give you some recommendation of what to do to overcome, be blessed and stay blessed.\n\nOne, understand and accept that life is full of trouble and that as a man (human being) born of woman, all your days on earth, you will face and deal with trouble. Job, one of the patriarchs of faith, who faced more problems than you can imagine understood and accepted that fact positively. Here is what he said: <strong>“Man that is born of woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down: He fleeth also as a shadow, and continues not”. Job 14: 1-2.</strong>\n\nTwo, understand that no effort of your own will deliver you. You need God to save you. When Israel faced the impossible Red Sea and didn’t know what to do, God, alone, intervened and instructed them what to do. <strong>Don’t move. Do not cry or try to fight. Stand still and see God’s salvation</strong>. That is what they needed to do. They needed to stop crying, complaining or blaming everyone else, but themselves.\n\nThree, understand and accept that no one's got an easy ride in this life. Everyone has their own share of trials, challenges or trouble. Yours is not unique nor are they special. They are only different. Even Jesus had His, and at one point wished, He could escape one of the worst and most painful experiences of His life when He was dying on the Cross felt lonely. He could not bear or endure the pain, alone. He cried <strong>“…My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”, Mathew 27:46. </strong>God, His Father, strengthened Him to go through that pain. <strong>It was His exit to recapture eternal glory</strong>. May be, today, you are resisting and fighting something that could be your last exit to a brand new day of victory, peace, hope, prosperity and pleasure, in the Lord. Stop fighting and stand still, instead, let go and let God. Don’t just fold your hands passively, doing nothing. Stand still in prayer, faith, hope, love, and perseverance. Listen to His instruction, and do His will. Not yours. Do your <strong>“Will Alignment” </strong>today. Align your will to His. If you don’t, you will wobble, shake, veer off the road and you may be very dangerous to yourself and others, who are around you and who depend on you or look up to you. Stand still. Will you? God will surely visit you and bring you up, and out. <strong>Blessings Boaz</strong>"

              "<strong>James 4:14-15, “14 whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. 15 Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6145\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/image.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>You are familiar with this line, <em>“I am the master of my own destiny”</em> said by a number of people. They feel they can navigate their lives correctly to its destiny. Let’s keep some of these things in mind; can anyone control how they breathe? For instance, close you nose and mouth and see if you can control it even for a minute. Have you ever caught yourself falling a sleep? If you think about it, you only discover that you already slept but you can’t see yourself falling a sleep step by step till you actually sleep.<strong> Statistics shows 10 out 10 people die</strong>. Can we control our destiny? We can’t even add a minute to our lives. Who knows for sure that they will live another day or better narrow it down, who can guarantee to live another minute?\r\n\r\nI have used this story before of a young teenage woman is engaged to be married but she gets pregnant before she is married and the child is not her fiancée’s. What would you recommend for her to do? Tough situation, remember she is a teenager, she is engaged, she is pregnant and the child is not her fiancée’s. Based on the life a head of her and the current situation that makes it hard, should she abort? Should she be the one to define that baby’s destiny? I will answer this question at the end.\r\n\r\nEvery minute we breath and live, we owe it to God. He is the Master of our destiny. In as much as we plan what we will do, our lives are in His hands. No one knows if they will make it another day, life is like a vapor. It’s here today and gone tomorrow. James encourages us to say, “<strong>If the Lord wills, we shall live</strong>”.<strong> The out come is in His hands</strong>. A little boy was talking to a very wise old man. There was no question the old man did not have a wise answer for. This little boy determined to prove that the old man was not as wise as they  thought and decided to play a mischief on him. The little boy caught a live bug and covered it gently with both his hands; the old man could not see if it was alive or dead. The boy then turned and asked the old man if the bug was alive or dead. The old man knowing what was in the mind of this little boy thought for a second. This is what ran through his mind, “<em>if I say it’s dead, he will open his hands and let the bug fly away but if I say it is alive, the boy will squash that bug and kill it</em>” whichever way he looked at it, he was going to be wrong so he applied wisdom. The old man turned to the boy and said, “<strong>The life or death of that bug is in your hands</strong>”. Like the bug in that little boys hands, so are we in God's hands. Our prayer ought to be, “<em>we can only make it if God gives us a chance”</em>. We ought to live as though there is no tomorrow (prepared for eternity) and live as though there is tomorrow physically totally depending on God.<strong> I can only live if He gives me a chance and not because I planned to.</strong> <strong>“If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.”</strong>\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you recommended for the young teenage woman to abort, she would have aborted Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the giver of life.

              "<strong>Ezra 7:9-10, “9…for the gracious hand of his God was on him. 10 For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the LORD, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel” <a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/image2.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6432 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/image2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"211\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThe book of Ezra whose name likely means, “The Lord Has Helped,” shares the life of Ezra who served as a priest and teacher, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the LORD for Israel (7:11). A key phrase in his book is <strong>“The Hand Of The Lord.”</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen I think of the classic movie Pinocchio, I remember the very lonely woodcarver, Geppato, makes a wooden boy (a marionette) which magically comes to life. Pinocchio longs to be detached from his marionette strings and wishes he could be a real, live boy and truly become Geppato’s son.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLike Pinocchio many want to live lives with no strings attached. We don’t desire anyone to control our lives because we want to be at the controls. However as a Christian God has cut the strings of our previous puppet master Satan from our lives. Pinocchio eventually runs away to the Land of Toys with his friend, Lamp-Wick. After five months of play, Pinocchio wakes up one fine morning and finds a great surprise awaiting him. His ears become like those of a Donkey. In a little while he changes into a real Donkey and begins to bray. Pinocchio having become a Donkey, is bought by the owner of a Circus, who wants to teach him to do tricks. The Donkey becomes lame and is sold to a man who wants to use his skin for a drumhead.\r\n\r\nLike Pinocchio we have the tendency to run into sin, even though God has cut the strings from the enemy from our lives. The Apostle Paul said “<b>1 </b><strong>What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 2 By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? It is for freedom that Christ has set us free”</strong>. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. The thing that makes the difference once having the strings of bondage cut, is to stay in the boundaries that God sets for our lives by letting him control our lives. The repeated phrase “the hand of the Lord,” is what kept Ezra walking in righteousness before His Lord and God. Because God’s hand was upon Ezra, Ezra prepared his heart to seek God’s law, and to do it, and to teach it. God was Ezra’s authority and Ezra needed to make sure he pleased God just as you would like to please your employer. So Ezra prepared his heart (mind) by looking at his job description in God’s Law to make sure he was fulfilling his priestly role in God’s way.\r\n\r\nThe description of Ezra’s tasks and attitude would be laid out in the Law of God. Furthermore Ezra not only studied God’s law he did it. James reminds us, “<b>Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.</b>” Satan is not moved by your reading, listening, singing, etc…, of God’s word, as long as you don’t obey it. Obedience to God’s Word is what Satan hates what God loves. Lastly Ezra went another step and taught God’s Word to Israel. I imagine that Ezra and God desired that God’s hand would be upon all Israel and therefore they needed to be instructed in God’s Law. Ezra was a reader, doer and teacher of God’s Law and with God’s hand upon him was God’s ambassador to the people of Israel.\r\nMay the Lord help us all to walk with His hand upon our lives, seek His Word, Obey His Word and teach His Word.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled….Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Psalms 42:1, “As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God, My soul thirsts for God, the living God, When can I go and meet with God?”</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are some specific animals in the bible with some characteristics that are symbolic to a message it’s passing across and for us to learn and to relate to. We hear about the Lamb of God, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, The righteous are as bold as a lion, a dove descending on Jesus as a sign of the Holy Spirit, etc. Let’s talk about deer and it’s characteristics that applies to us.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Song of Songs 4:5</strong> speaks about fawns (deer) of the gazelle that browse among the lilies. How is the deer described in the bible and it’s symbol? Let’s find out\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Psalms 18:33 states, \"He makes my feet like that of a deer; He enables me to stand on the heights</strong>“. What is making our feet as that of a deer? Just imagine the feet /running of a deer – the swiftness, the speed, the strength, etc are the highlighting features. When a tiger runs towards it, the rapid speed at which it runs is simply superb. In spiritual terms, when there is sin enticing (symbolic of the tiger), are we galloping like the deer or faltering or stumbling? How are our feet in this wicked world? Can be they compared to that of a deer? <strong>Isaiah 40:30</strong> says that even the young men may stumble and fall, they may grow weary. This is the order of nature. But verse <strong>Isaiah 40:29</strong> states, \"<strong>it is God who gives strength and increases the power of the weak\" </strong>He can strengthen our feet like that of a deer and enable us to stand on the heights..\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Psalms 42:1, “As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God, My soul thirsts for God, the living God, When can I go and meet with God?”</strong> Are we like the deer panting for streams of water, for the springs of water welling to eternal life- Jesus the source of the living water? What are we panting for? King David with his vast army, kingdom, wealth, mansions and what not, was panting for meeting with God…What an awesome experience !\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Job 39:1-4</strong> God speaks to Job about the doe bearing her fawn, their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds. This verse speaks about the young of the doe which thrive, or rather prosper, succeed, luxuriate. How do they thrive? And then become strong in the wilds… We also ought to gain strength from the Lord and thrive. The next point in the verse is that they leave where they are born and do not return. Yes, at last, we ought not to return to the wicked world but to our dear Lord… Our hope is for our eternal Home…There are some instances in the Bible where His children were asked to leave certain situations. Abraham in <strong>Genesis 12:1</strong> was asked to leave his father’s household, his country. There is a usual tendency to become complacent in our own place. May be, we have to move/leave some places according to God’s direction to learn dependence on Him, rather than our own household, kith/kin. <strong>Psalms 45:10 </strong>also explains this context.\r\n\r\n4. <strong>Deuteronomy 14:3-5 </strong>certifies deer to be a clean animal. Bible classifies animals as clean and unclean based on certain characteristics- split hoof which is completely divided and that which chews the cud. Chewing the cud is to eat initially and later draw the food back to the mouth to be thoroughly chewed, bit by bit, enjoyed in a cool manner- for better digestion/ absorption of the nutrients. Deer does this . We also ought to read the Word of God and also keep meditating on it , enjoying it, rethink it, digest as we draw the full strength /nutrition of it.\r\n\r\n5. Strong antlers (horns) of a deer are basically for its protection against the enemy. While fighting, it first attacks the enemy with its antlers (horns) to bruise it’s attacker that it may flee. We too should possess the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God so that the enemy cannot attack us. The deer in Song of Songs is found to be browsing among the lilies, rather grazing on the pastures. What are we browsing? Where are we grazing? Is it on the green pastures of the Lord- church with sound doctrine?\r\n\r\nEvery minute thing in nature, created by the Wonderful Almighty speaks /narrates of His greatness, His wisdom, which none can fathom.\r\n\r\nIn Christ\r\nSis Sarah"

              "<strong>Daniel 6:4–5, “At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.” </strong>\n\nIn America when one makes the statement “<em>Big Brother is watching,”</em> one is referring to the “eyes” of the government keeping watch upon the people. <!--more-->\n\nWhen you go into a store perhaps there are video cameras around that monitor the activity of the people in the store which are being viewed by someone behind the scenes. In this same way the eyes of the ungodly are watching you! In this passage of Scripture Daniel was being watched by ungodly leaders who like Jesus’ accusers, could find no fault in his life. His conduct and government affairs were found to be with consistent integrity. These corrupt leaders manipulated the king to sign a decree which would eventually be broken by Daniel. How did Daniel respond to these ungodly watching eyes?\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Keep keen awareness</strong>. The Scriptures point out, “<strong>Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published.</strong>” How did Daniel learn of this decree since this ordeal was a setup against Daniel? Perhaps because Daniel too was in the place of leadership and all the leaders were made aware of this fact. Daniel kept a keen awareness of the news, laws, and events surrounding his exile. By Daniel’s wisdom perhaps he made it a point to know the latest news and how it would affect his godly lifestyle as a godly leader in an ungodly land (Babylon). Do you keep a keen awareness of the law, news, and surrounding events in light of how they will affect you?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<strong>2. Develop a Habit of prayer</strong>. Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just <strong><em>as he had done before</em>. </strong>Prayer to the Lord was not a once in a while event for Daniel, but a lifestyle that he implored three times each day. How’s your prayer habit?\n\n<strong>3. Refuse to Compromise</strong>. Daniel knew the decree was signed, and that breaking the decree to keep the law of God would result in being placed in the lion’s den. Did a lion’s den defer, slowdown, or cancel Daniel’s living for his God in the face of the ungodly, NO WAY! Daniel would rather die than to allow some laws negatively affect his relationship to the Lord. Is there anything that causes you to compromise?\n\nUngodly eyes are watching you every day, but <strong>what are they seeing</strong>. Are you keeping keen awareness of what is going on around you? Are you developing a habit of prayer, and do you refuse to compromise your walk with God? You can’t stop the world from watching you, nor should you try. Rather <strong>shine brightly for Jesus and give them an eyeful!</strong>\n\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Psalm 78:22, \"Because they believed not God, and they trusted not in His salvation.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is helpful for you to read the whole chapter to really get the full effect of what's going on in this verse.\r\n\r\nBelieving is a word tossed around to and fro, but in a nutshell it is how one thinks about something or someone. It is how one pictures something to be, or understands something to be with or without evidence. This may sound somewhat confusing so let me illustrate.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhen you sit in a chair you believe it is strong enough to hold you up, even without examining the chair. When you go out to eat you don't usually wonder if you are about to eat poison or you would never put it in your mouth. You believe it will fill you.\r\n\r\nIsrael believed NOT God! If you read the entire chapter you'll see that they forgot the covenant, refused to walk in His law, and forgot His works and wonders. Can someone say trouble? They forgot and refused all that they needed to nurture their belief, therefore it went by the way side, and caused unbelief. When they forgot the covenant they gave up their relationship commitment, when they refused His law they gave up the rules that helped to protect them and govern that relationship. And when they forgot his works and wonders, they even forgot to recognize the miraculous memories of seeing God's power displayed before their very eyes. This is a great formula for disaster, or as it were practical atheism.\r\n\r\nMany say, \"seeing is believing\", perhaps to an extent. But, seeing miracles obviously doesn't necessarily produce faithful followers of the Lord, no matter if you saw the Red Seas split and walked by dry land.\r\n\r\nAnd atheist by definition is one that does not believe in God. <strong>Psalm 14:1</strong> reads, \"<strong>The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God</strong>\". But in practical atheism one could say the believer has said by his actions and decisions there is no God. Yes many times Christians by the way they live, much like the children of Israel, live as though God was not real. If character is what you do when no one is looking then practical atheism is treating God as if He were a fairy tale or a figment of one’s imagination, during a time when you are looking to be selfish and get away with something God would not have you to do. Let me again illustrate:\r\n\r\nPerhaps when you were younger you snuck an ungodly movie or TV because no one was watching you. But when mom walked into the room the movie or TV show went off or to another channel with your finger frantically on the remote control. It was OK when no one was watching, but the moment you were discovered, or about to be it became unacceptable. Why, because of practical atheism, God saw you watching it the whole time, but when someone with flesh on entered the room, the conviction of God moved in and suddenly God was real again. You became a believer again in God's truth and holiness. Every time we live as a practical atheist we try and make God out to be a liar. King David in <strong>Psalm 139</strong> said, ...<strong>You are acquainted with ALL my ways...where can I go from your spirit or where can I flee from your presence...?</strong> Adam, the first practical atheist, found this out in Genesis. He sinned acting as if God were not around. And when God said \"<strong>Adam where are you</strong>,\" He wasn't asking for Adam's physical location either. Rather He was asking for his spiritual, mental, emotional, and relational whereabouts. \"Adam where are you in your head, in your decision\", is a more accurate way to look at it.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Israel’s desire led to death through pestilence. And when we go after our desires in place of God, poison enters our spirit causing spiritual death. God's desires for you to pursue Him, in life, liberty and the pursuit of righteousness.\r\n\r\nHow are you living? Who keeps you accountable?\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\nPastor Phil"

              "<strong>2Corinthians 12:9, &quot;My grace is sufficient for thee, my strength is made perfect in weakness&quot;</strong>\n\nSometimes ago I started to experience something with my car I had not experienced before. I watched it closely as I was driving and realized it was losing power. Breaking sound from the exhaust system made it more clear and I wondered what was wrong with my car. Later I took it to a garage where they found the car needed tune up. The plugs were not firing properly and my fueling system was out of place. The car was still performing but not with power.<!--more-->\n\n\nWondering why I'm talking to you about my car? You may be feeling tired, worn out, spent, finished, exhausted. And your current state is affecting your life for you cannot function effectively like you should. Yes you are functioning but not with power. Just like my car, it was still performing but not with power simply because it did not have strength it needed. Everyone needs strength to make it up the mountain, strength to fight the enemy, strength to accomplish a task. When there is no strength we become vulnerable and less effective. God has His garage (if I may use this term) where we can go and be restored and strengthened again. I was told my plugs were not firing properly let's look at this in the Spiritual realm, your prayer life plug is weak, reading the word plug is weak too, witnessing plug is weak and reaching others plug is weak so what happens, you find it hard to perform your duties at work, home, ministry because your plugs are not firing enough strength to your life.\n\n<strong>2Corinthians 12:9, &quot;My grace is sufficient for thee, my strength is made perfect in weakness&quot;. </strong>We need to understand that God's grace is more than enough. Grace is given and not earned. We are told that it’s more than enough for them that are His. Can you imagine receiving grace and new mercies everyday and yet it never runs out? The bible says &quot;…<strong>My strength is made perfect in weakness</strong>&quot;<strong>. </strong>I love this line for it reminds me that His strength is completely made perfect in my weakness, in other words it was already there, fits like a glove regardless of what happened when I lost my strength. When you come to His shop, He will boost your strength into perfection even in your weakness. <strong>Psalm 46:1, &quot;God is my refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&quot;. </strong>The strength in our lives is God Himself, so many times when we feel weak and tired in the Spirit, we need to check again to see who is in control of our strength.\n\n<strong>Psalm 73:26, &quot;My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion forever&quot;, </strong>We can't put our confidence in the flesh, the psalmist tells us the flesh and the heart fails but God is the strength of our heart. Thank God for His strength, you may have a lot to do and should be complaining and murmuring, you should be looking gloomy and you should be mean to people who hand you more work but because you know the Lord is the strength of your heart, you will draw strength from Him and give your job, ministry, home 110% for your hope and strength is built on nothing less than Jesus. Everyone will expect you to be overwhelmed and sink but you will sail on top of what other people are sinking in for God is tuning you up, taking off the old plugs clogged with dirt, cleaning the fuel system and making it clear that your strength may be back. You still have more mountains to climb, more valleys to go through, more work to do. You still need to clock more miles than men ever expected for God has given you His strength.\n\nCaleb in the Old Testament was 80 years old but he felt like 40 for he says the same strength he had when he was 40 is the same strength he had when he was 80.<strong> “I can do all things, survive all things, deal with all things, face all things through Christ who strengthens me Philippians 4:13</strong>.<strong> Psalm 18:1-3, &quot;I will love thee Oh Lord, my strength, the Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my strength: my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my High Tower. I will call upon the name of the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies&quot;. Isaiah 26:1, &quot;Trust in the Lord forever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength&quot;</strong>\n\nGod is interested in seeing us get strong and perform His duties. We know for sure we cannot by ourselves that's why <strong>in Him we live and move and have our beings</strong>. Everyday we will be strong because He makes us strong but we always need to go to His garage (prayer room, His word) for tune up for the race ahead.\n\nNow my car went through restoration to a position in which it was not when I bought it in. Watch this, <strong>my car was not made bigger having been tuned up, it was made better</strong>. The Lord will not bring us a secretary or greater machines and the like to do greater things, He will equip us to be better in any place He plants us. Be unique in all that you do for God's strength is unique. Feeling weak and tired, take a few minutes and walk to His throne for tune up and expect to be made better and not bigger. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Isaiah 8:13, “Sanctify the Lord of Host Himself: and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Sanctify the Lord of Hosts of Hosts Himself: </strong>To sanctify is to set apart. How can someone set God apart? Is He not already set apart, doesn’t He set Himself apart? But here in this verse the context is focused on the criticism between Isaiah and his disciples. Why, because anytime one speaks the truth for the Lord, the critics will be quick to rise up. And many times it seems as if the critics are the majority against you and the other bold Christians who are speaking the truth about the reality of God. When I was in my public high school, I had a Bible club there that was kicked out on the grounds of <strong>“separation of church and state</strong>.” The critics were students, some teachers and the superintendent. Here’s where the decision lay, do I fear the superintendent, students, and teachers, or fight for the Lord fearing His call to evangelize my school which the majority are going to hell? I choose to fear the Lord, and fight. After 3 months it was back in school. Why?, because we <strong>will always serve what we fear</strong>. If you fear man, you will serve him; if you fear God you will serve Him; and the opposite is true also in not serving what you don’t fear. You ever wonder why only 2% of Christians reach the lost?, It’s because of FEAR. FEAR stands for: <strong>False Evidence Appearing Real</strong>.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Let Him be your fear: </strong>Everyone fears something; <strong>why not fear something worth fearing</strong>, namely the Lord of lords. He is the highest position of authority in every land and in every nation. Most don’t stand up for God because again they fear man. Who are you fearing more than God? We don’t live in the fear of the Lord sometimes, but always. \"Let Him\"…shows a submissive spirit, verses a prideful one. Fire could burn you, but God is a consuming fire; man can kill you, but the Lord is a warrior;, and a tidal wave can overtake you, but my God is a Tsunami (Japanese Major Tidal Wave) of unmatched power.\r\n\r\n<strong>Let Him be your dread: </strong>The NT puts it this way: <strong>Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. (Mt. 10:28). </strong>\r\n\r\nThough man may have power, the worst thing man can do can never match the worst thing God can do. God has the power to send the disobedient, unregenerate, unsaved to Hell. And although Satan too may be powerful, only God can destroy both body and soul in Hell. That is why “<strong>The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom…”</strong>\r\n\r\nAsk yourself (Reflect honestly)\r\n\r\n1. Is there anyone: boss, spouse, brother/sister, co-worker, friend, authority figure, that I fear more than God?\r\n\r\n2. Do I abide in the fear of the Lord daily and consistently in what I choose to watch, listen to, read, say, think about, and how I work. Do I share the Gospel with the lost so they won’t end up in hell like the (2%) or am I like the 98% of Christians who walk past the sinner like the Levite priest verses the Good Samaritan?

              "<strong>Judges 15:18-19, \"18 Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the LORD, “You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?” 19 Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived.\", (NIV).</strong>\r\n\r\nThe desire to be victorious in every area is a thirst majority craves for. A desire to let everything run smoothly in one’s life yet we find that there are times you are victorious in one area and a failure in other areas. We are like trees that go through different seasons, the winter, spring, summer and autumn. If you took time to look at trees in these different seasons, you will discover that there is change on how they look. During winter time, their leaves are gone. For someone who may not know may conclude the trees are dead but the truth of the matter is, they are alive and well adjusting to the season in which they find themselves in. Their existence is not dependant on the season, their existence is dependant on the roots that have gone deep underground in search of water and nutrients. So the days they may not look attractive, they still have a way of surviving one season while they wait for the next season.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIs this different from a life of a believer? I don’t think so, we too go through different seasons. There are seasons of great victories, the seasons where everything you touch is blessed, every move you make prospers then there are those times that everything you touch is a disaster. The seasons of defeat, every believer have different seasons. The key is to learn to adapt in every season, causing your roots to go down deep into the ground in search of water provided by the Almighty God, meanwhile you wait and prepare for the next season.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Judges 15</strong>, Samson had such a season of great victory. By just a jaw bone of a donkey, he had killed a thousand men. What a huge success, great victory not by his own hands but by the help of God. Then out of the victory, right in the sun, tired and exhausted, he thirsts for water. He turns to God and cries out to God, “”<strong>You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised</strong>\" This is to some how say, “<em>God if you gave me victory over one area, will you let me be defeated in another area?\"</em> He desired water that may give him strength to survive the heat of the sun. He desired water to revive him to face another season. It’s sad to know that there are people who abandon God when they find themselves in a season that is not comfortable being in. Like Samson, right in that hot season, we can cry to God for water, His words to give us strength and revive us. Just as the disciples said, <strong>John 6:68, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life”</strong>, seasons had changed for them too from being fed with bread to being fed with the word, many stopped following Jesus and the disciples had a chance to leave too. They knew that instead of turning away in a new season, they desired to cling to the water giver and that is what they did.\r\n\r\nAmazing thing about seasons, they change but God remains the same and believers can learn to adapt in every season. The same God who gave Samson strength to destroy God's enemies is the same God who gave Him water to sustain him in that victory and the life to come. <strong>Hebrews 12:2, \"… looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith\", blessings Ev</strong>"

              "<strong>1Samuel 1:8-18, \"But Hannah answered and said, \"No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured my soul before the Lord\"</strong>\r\n\r\nPeople do struggle to pray. You may have struggled numerous times to pray and still got nowhere. And if you prayed, your prayers felt so dry, not effective, and did not even enjoy it. I remember years back when I had the same kind of struggle and God had to teach me to pray effectively changing my whole perspective on prayers and how to approach the throne of grace. Yes I still struggle to pray, the will to is there, the strength and the effectiveness sometimes fail.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>If we are going to get heaven's attention on a matter, we have to do what it takes. </strong>Prayers gets God’s attention, it causes heaven to be in motion. Hannah had something she desired of the Lord and she understood the only way to receive it was to come before the Lord. <strong>God rewards persevering faith in prayers</strong>, she had it. The bible says in <strong>Hebrews 10:35-36, \"35 Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward, 36. For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise\". </strong>Our confidence in God drives us to pray to Him as there is a reward in seeking God. Seeking Him calls for endurance (patience) and we see this with Hannah too. After we have done the will of God which is to seek His Kingdom first and His righteousness, <strong>Mathew 6:33</strong>, then the promise of the things we have desired according to His will shall are added unto us.\r\n\r\nOne thing about this woman was that she learnt to pour her heart to the Lord. A lot of things were in her spirit, all she could do was cry out to God. Eli mistook her for being drunk with wine and even asked her to refrain from it and her response, \"<strong>I have poured my soul before the Lord</strong>\". <strong>I would say that you have to be broken to pour what’s inside. Part of being broken will cause you to be real when you pray</strong>. <strong>When you are broken, you have no ability to hold anything inside</strong>. A woman came to wash Jesus feet wiping them with her hair, she brought with her the Alabaster box that contained precious oil, she was willing to break the box so that oil would flow out. She did not want to save anything so she poured it all out. If we are going to pray effectively, we are going to break everything and pour our hearts to the Lord like Hannah. A tax collector in <strong>Luke 18:13</strong> poured his heart to the Lord by beating his breast and saying, <strong>\"God, be merciful to me a sinner</strong>\", he poured it all. If you remember the Pharisee that was standing next to this publican, he came to pray but was proud and arrogant and God would not listen to him.\r\n\r\nWe can pray for sure but can we pray effectively? have we learnt to pour our hearts to the Lord to say everything that I am dealing with, troubling me, destroying me, I desire, I choose to pour it to you? Just as I am, I am coming to you, casting all my cares upon you. What are you trusting God for today? are you willing to endure praying and pouring your heart to the Lord like Hannah did? If we want God to move, this must be the year of prayer.\r\n\r\nBe blessed Evans"

              "<strong>Psalm 103:1-2, “1 Bless the LORD, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His holy name! 2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, And forget not all His benefits:”</strong>\r\n\r\nTo God be the glory great things He has done. He is worthy to be praised, He redeemed our lives from destruction. One woman who had been delivered by Jesus, at one point brought in an alabaster box full of precious oil. She broke the box and out of it came precious oil with fragrance filing the room. She took that which was precious to her to wash Jesus’ feet wiping His feet with her hair. I see a woman blessing the Lord, she is taking that which is precious and giving it back to God what belongs to Him. She is sacrificing and doing what is right and not everyone is happy about it especially Judas Iscariot.\r\n\r\nWe are blessed to know that we can offer back to God what He requires, worship. I know that we are used to being on the receiving end, but let’s begin to bless the Lord commanding every fiber of our being to acknowledge that He deserves our worship<strong>. Psalm 150:6, “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord” </strong>We choose to bless the Lord this day, <strong>Psalm 34:1, “I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in my mouth”.</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->We don’t bless Him because we have it, we bless Him because He deserves it. Blessing the Lord is not reserved for special occasions, He deserves to be blessed at all times just as we don’t except to receive blessings on special occasions. Bless Him in the morning, at noon time, in the evening, all night long. The Psalmist in our text begins by blessing the Lord, giving God back what He requires of us which is worship. He understands that the moment he begins to give this service, not every part of his body will comply with his desire, but if he can get his soul to begin, the soul has a way of affecting his entire being. This is why the Lord deals with the heart first before dealing with the body and mind. If the heart is touched, the heart is in a position to affect the mind and the body. With our hearts, we bless His holy name for He is holy.\r\n\r\nAs we bless the Lord, we are reminded of the benefits bestowed upon us. There is a great difference between the benefits and the benefactor for there can be no benefits without the existence of a benefactor. It’s in our process of worshipping God that we are reminded of His benefits. Today I will touch on the benefit of healing (Who heals all thy diseases). Healing is a benefit from the Lord, a benefit that came with salvation package. Salvation is the main thing just like applying for a job, the job is the main thing but besides the main thing, there are benefits to go with it. Not only does healing become a benefit, we are told that He heals all our diseases. If He said some, then we will dig in further to find out which ones are covered in the benefit but when He said all, it’s an indication that there is no sickness that cannot be handled by God. <strong>Isaiah 53:5, “He was wounded for my transgressions, He was bruised for my iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon Him and by His stripes we are healed”.</strong> He was beaten that I may be saved and not just saved but healed also from all my diseases. He says, “<strong>I am the Lord that heals you, I sent forth my word and it healed all your diseases for there is nothing too difficult for Me</strong>”.\r\n\r\nSince the year started, we have heard cases of people sick and we’ve been praying for them. You might be sick in your body this morning or someone whom you know is sick, know that sickness is not from the Lord, it’s from the devil. You might have this thought that sickness could be coming in as a punishment for sin from the Lord, well God is not the author of evil but good, He may allow but He will not start it. We have a chance to bless the Lord, remember His benefits and call on Him to bring them to pass according to His will. He is a God of restoration <strong>Joel 2:25, “And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten…”</strong>, God will restore health in the days, weeks, months, years that the enemy has brought sickness in your life and loved ones. The word restoration is to bring back to its original state before losing anything. Some people’s health need to be restored, you may be having a cold, asthma, stomach pain, chest pains, back pains, cancer, kidney problems and you name it. God is able to restore back your health because that is His benefit for us. <strong>Ephesians 3:20, “Now unto Him who is able to do exceeding, abundantly, above all we ask or imagine according to the power that works in us”.</strong> Let God be God in your situation and may He receive glory for being God in your needs. Healing is a benefit, why not trust God to move in your situation according to His written will? Have a blessed day full of healing. Blessings Ev"

Praise God there are those who are teaching about the Lord Jesus desire to heal. It is all there in his precious Word. Let us read and understand, and then appropriate this gift for ourselves and our loved ones and brethren. But...we must have or aquire the necessary faith to lay hold on it. \r\nHe, the Lord Jesus could do no mighty works in his own country because of their unbelief. And so, these apparently continued on in their suffering. How sad. \r\n\r\n \"Without faith it is impossible to please God\""

              "<strong>Psalm 139:1-24, “Search me, O God and know my heart; Try me, and know my thoughts (anxieties).</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist in this text had an encounter with God in a way that caused him to know that God has a perfect knowledge of man. He begins by saying in<strong> vs. 1, “O Lord, You have searched me and known me”,</strong> He knows more than just my name, He knows me inside out. The Psalmist is giving us examples to show how the Lord knows him.<strong> \"You know my sitting and my rising up; You understand my thought a far off\", </strong>God knows when we are weak and when we are strong. He knows when we need more and He knows our thoughts from a far off, both wicked and pleasant thoughts. When you are thinking of what to say, He already knew what you were thinking and what you planned to say.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 3, “You comprehend my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways”,</strong> Lord You understand when I take this road, when no one else understands me and when many criticize me for taking this path, You are the only One who understands. My lying down also is not news to You for You know when I am tired and weary, You protect me when I am lying down. Vs. 4, “<strong>For there is not a word on my tongue, but behold, O Lord, You know it altogether”,</strong> I’m glad Lord that You know the words that are coming out of my mouth, You know what I’m trying to say, when I’m trying to say it and how I’m trying to say it. Before I even pray, You already know what I’m going to pray about for nothing in my life escapes You.<strong> vs. 5, “You have hedged me behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me”,</strong> I remember when You told the children of Israel that You will go before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire, I know You are doing the same in my life, for the wind cleans my path and the fire builds a hedge of protection around me and lights my path. When I feel like I’m alone, Your hand upon me gives me the assurance that I am not alone.\r\n\r\n<strong>vs. 6, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain it</strong>“, Lord just being convinced up to this far that You know me blows my mind for it’s just to much to really understand that in as much as I do not know myself like I should, You know me better than anybody else in the entire world.<strong> vs. 7 “Where can I go from Your Spirit”,</strong> With all this knowledge about me Lord, where can I go where your presence is not there for You are everywhere. They call you Jehovah Shammah which means God present, You are our refuge and strength, a very present help. I am encouraged to know that I can never escape Your presence for when I find myself in heaven one day, Your presence will be there. You are there in good times in my life and in bad times. And if I put my bed in hell which in other words if my actions, denials and rebellion puts me in a state where I feel like I am in hell, You will still be there with me because You know how to deliver me. <strong>Vs 12, “Indeed even darkness shall hide from You, But the night shines as the day; The darkness and the light are both a like to You</strong>“, Lord I’m reminded that you are not intimidated by darkness in my life for you see through and beyond the darkness. The moment You come in, darkness has no choice but to leave. Whatever is a mess in my life, You take it and turn it around to make something good out of it. You are the only God who has a way of taking my mess and making it into something useful. Thank You for taking me a mess and making me into a vessel of Honor to store treasure in.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs 13, “For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb”,</strong> Lord the fact that You formed me blows my mind. You took time to make this being, crafted me in Your arms. A lot could have killed me or caused me to be aborted or miscarried but You covered me, You protected me and natured me until I was ushered into the world and even with that, still You did not say the work is done.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs 14, “I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, marvelous are Your works</strong>“, This is now too big to comprehend Lord, that out of the 6 billion people on the earth, You fearfully and wonderfully made me that no one else is like me. To make it even interesting, You did not make me a junky but took time to form, fix, straighten me the original version and therefore there can be no one that can beat me being me. I’m a piece of art designed and developed at a time like this, marvelous are Your works and my soul knows it very well.\r\n\r\nThis is just too good to be true but it is, God knows each and every one of us in a way we could never understand. He can hear everyone at the same time and to prove what He can do,<strong> Matthew 10:30, “The very hairs on your head are numbered</strong>” not counted but numbered.\r\n\r\nIn the whole devotion there is one little important word repeated over and over again, it’s the common denominator<strong> “YOU”</strong> which is God Himself. Without Him, we can do nothing. Why not sit back and let “YOU” take over your life. To finish. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Psalm 139:1-24, “Search me, O God and know my heart; Try me, and know my thoughts (anxieties).</strong>\r\n\r\nFrom what we shared in part 1, the common denominator word<strong> “YOU”</strong> which refers to God in everything and in every step of the way, for He knows us inside out, whether we be sleeping, waking up, talking, standing, fallen and so on and so forth, He still knows us. Let’s continue from vs. 15 of <strong>Psalm 139.</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 15, “My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth”.</strong> My frame which are my bones which form the skeleton were not hidden from You Lord, after all You made me. I’m amazed how You applied skills in making my internal and external organs in secret that all people could see the finished work. You created my spirit out of nothing, formed my body out of something and breathed in life in me and I became a living soul. My life is in your hands.\r\n<strong>Vs. 16, “Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And Your book they were all written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them”.</strong> Lord I could stop here for this is just too wonderful, You already knew how I would be born, how I would live and the days You fashioned for me in this world. You told Jeremiah that I had plans for you before he was formed, You knew him and ordained him to be a prophet to the nations.<strong> He made us to glorify His name the reason He can brag on His handiwork”</strong>.<strong> vs. 17, “how precious also are Your thoughts to me O God”,</strong> Lord You think about me even when I don’t do the same many times, every single day of my life Your thoughts towards me surely stands and I know that they cannot be numbered. It’s not because I am worthy of that precious thought but because Your loving kindness.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 19-22,</strong> In these verses I know of those who hate You and oppose Your existence oh God, they hate and blame You for certain things they had to go through but they forget to look at the great things that You have done in their lives already. No one can add even a second to their lives. We therefore humble ourselves for we are motivated by reality that without You we can do nothing.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 23&amp;24, “search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts. And see if there is any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting”.</strong> Lord in as much as there are people who don’t believe, live or even walk with You, there could be something in my life that could be holding me back from knowing You fully. I know You hate sin and do not want anything to take Your place in my heart. I could feel like everything is fine for your word says, “<strong>a man’s ways are pure in his own eyes</strong>”. You are the One to declare us righteous by what You do therefore search me O my God and know my heart,. Like a doctor who performs tests in a person to detect sickness, You are doing the same with my heart. Try me and know my thoughts that will reveal to me where my trust is in. Lord see if there is any wickedness (pride, hatred, anger, lust, resentment, un-forgiveness etc.) in me and then lead me to Your everlasting way. Lord I could perform my own search but I know I might compromise your holiness by qualifying some sins so I give You full control. By this I mean not just be the Savior of my life but also the Lord of my life. NO ONE KNOWS ME LIKE YOU DO. Blessings Ev\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

              "<strong>2Kings 5:1-14, vs. 1, “Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, but a leper”.</strong>\r\n\r\nI am amazed by how God works, His ways are not our ways and His plans are not our plans. He is the God of the impossibilities. We know He will do it because He has said it in His word, yet often times we do not know how He will do it. We tend to work well with recipes because if we stick to a recipe, we can tell what the result will be. Often times we bring this also in our Christian life as we feel God has a recipe of doing things. It’s like He has set a method A,B,C of how to get it done. <!--more-->God is not a respecter of methods and that is why with God there is no recipe. All you need to know is that it will be done, let the way it’s done left for Him to execute. Another thing, God is no respecter of persons, He can bless anyone including sinners why <strong>Matthew 5:45, “… for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Those who validates God’s ability by a recipe are those who lack understanding that He is unlimited God.</strong> How often did you know God was going to come, you thought He will come through the door only to see Him come through the roof?, that is God who does not use recipes. Naaman was a commander, there is no indication that he was a just man because in the later verses of the same chapter, he gets to know the true God. Reading the first line, he was honorable in the eyes of his master because the Lord had given him victory in the battle field. You can tell the rain rained also on the unjust. He was a respected man, had servants, honored, successful but had leprosy. Being told that there was a prophet in Israel who could cure him of this disease, led him to seek help but from the wrong person, the king of Israel. To further complicate things, he came with his own recipe of what he believed God will or should do to heal him. After all he wanted to maintain his status, and deal with certain ranks of people.\r\n\r\nWell the king of Israel could not heal him and the prophet who was to heal him did not even meet him though he had what people would consider success. At least we know the prophet was not also a respecter of persons but principles. Naaman was asked to go and dip himself in the river Jordan seven times and he would be cured. Why didn’t God heal him instantly while he was still in his land or respecting his status? Simple God did not have a recipe for this man. And so are we, God can use someone who we don’t even get a long with to bless us, a job that has turned out to be a frustration, something that did not seam like a good thing God could use. He can use the least expected, the least likely, the stones that the builders rejected. If we have a recipe, then the recipe becomes God for we will be out to dictate God on what He should and shouldn’t do. We might be tempted to tell Him of a step on the recipe He might have missed. So don’t keep your eye on one thing He used before thinking that is what He will always use. <strong>Namaan had an end result of what he desired but not by the method he had in mind.</strong>\r\n\r\nJesus healed two blind men in differently, one he spat on the ground, anointed his eyes and told him to go and wash, the other he spoke to. Same results, different methods. When are you going to stop creating recipes from what the Lord did last time and trust Him to do a new thing? Hasn’t His word said, “<strong>Behold I am doing a new thing?</strong>”. If we can know the end result, let the method be left in His hands. Throw away your recipe book, watch, pray, have faith because He is doing something new that is not on any recipe book. Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>Ecclesiastes 5:4, \"When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it; For He has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you have vowed 5, Better not to vow than to vow and not pay\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIn a movie entitled \"It could happen to you\", we see officer Charlie (Nicholas Cage) a NY city cop with a heart to serve. At the beginning of the movie he goes to this particular restaurant and buys coffee, upon checking his wallet, he finds that he has only enough change for coffee and nothing on the side to leave for tip. At that moment he remembers he had a lottery ticket in his hands he and his wife had purchased hoping to win.<!--more--> His promise to the waiter was to come back and give her the tip or split with her half of the lottery if they won. The waiter (Yvonne) who had dealt with many people who make promises they can't keep including the man she was married to had a hard time believing him. She did not see any way possible for this cop to come back however the cop vowed to come back with tip or half of the lottery win. Not long after, he and his wife discovered they had won 4million dollars. 4 million dollars?, half to go to the waitress? he had a chance either to fulfill the promise (vow) or break the promise (vow). His wife tried to discourage him from giving out the 2 million bucks, but his friend who was also a police officer told him to do the right thing. The thought that ran through his mind was either to lie to the waitress and give the tip but then he decided to \"keep his word\" for that was the kind of person he was. With the word kept, the waitress received 2 million in the midst of his wife’s protest. I'm told the movie was based on a true story.\r\n\r\nIn as much as I believe that Christians should not gamble because we don't live by luck but by faith, there is something about the story I just shared that brings the point I would like to make, \"<strong>making a promise and keeping it</strong>\". It's very easy to make a promise but hard to keep it. You can say you will do something just to be left alone and then find it hard to fulfil it or not do it at all. At times promises are made on the basis of \"what it is in for me\" and how can I benefit from it. You ask yourself, “<em>will it inconvenience me in any way?</em>” Marriages are based on promises (vows) but if you look at it, performing those vows are hard for many couples because it's more about them than others. People say something like this, \"<em>I don't feel the love in this marriage like I used to, I don't get satisfaction like I used to\"</em> the word here is \"I\" (ME, MYSELF and I), it doesn't matter how the kids will be affected as long as \"I\" get what \"I\" want if I have to stay. It's not about what \"I\" can do to improve it, it's a matter of what can \"I\" gain from it. There is no \"I\" in teamwork.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ecclesiastes 5:4, \"When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it\". </strong>What is a vow anyway, <strong>it's an earnest promise to perform a specified act or behave in a certain manner</strong>. It has to come from the heart and you've counted the cost of performing it. When we make vows to help someone, we do it in the presence of the Lord and unto the Lord. God takes vows seriously and He would rather you make no vow than make it and break it. The scripture also says, do not be slow to fulfill a vow, it needs to be fulfilled on the specified time. You make it, you owe it and should pay it. Charlie from the story made a vow, he had a chance to pay that vow in time as promised and his conviction moved him to perform it and perform it soon. In <strong>Matthew 21:28,</strong> we are told of two sons who were asked by their father to go and work in the vineyard, the first one said he will not go but after some time he regretted and went and performed it. The second son said he will but did not go. Out of the two boys, only the first one did the will of his father, the one who said no but then later went. <strong>1Corinthians 10:3, \"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God\" Colossians 3:17, \"And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , Colossians 3:23, \"And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men\" 3John 1:5, \"Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers\".</strong> If you said you will do it, take the time to do it, go out of your way to do it, it may not benefit you in anyway but do it, this goes for ministry, work, family, community service you name it. Keep your word. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Peter 5:10, “And the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.”</strong>\r\n\r\nGod sometimes speaks loudly through His Word, I was excited as I read this scripture which refreshed and revitalized me . We should remember that the trials the devil seeks to use to destroy us, God desires to use, to make us stronger and more equipped to follow Him. Every tree that produces fruit, He prunes so as to make it stronger. (<strong>John 15:2</strong>) Suffering wasn’t a sign that they were doing something wrong, but Peter reminds us that through the sufferings, God strengthens us spiritually. Satan may try to tear us down through failures, discouragements and humiliation, but God builds you in the midst of all the pain. Want to know more? Stay tuned!<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAs I look back into my life, the most humiliating moments have been the ones which helped to break me and mold me. We need some breaking in order to be blessed. Too many successes makes us haughty and proud; when God steps in, He loves to cut that off. Remember, Moses was handsome, when he was born but God had to put him 40 years in the wilderness and then made use of him. Never get proud of your height, color, personality and intelligence or whatever; God can spot that subtle ego buried inside you and He would deal with it severely. God has a way to look deep into our sins. We may think it “small” and insignificant but it is “big sin” for God. Understand? Once while on the stage I suddenly lost the Presence of God near me, I felt lost and scared. I was screaming on the inside for God to give me the anointing back, but He allowed me to suffer on the stage. After the meeting, I fasted and prayed seeking for an answer. God showed certain things which might be petty for me but pretty big deal for Him and He was dealing with me to crucify me and make me fruitful. I can suffer anything in this world but not the pain of losing His anointing, I still shiver at the thought of being left stranded without the anointing!\r\n\r\nThese words, “<em>after you have suffered a little while</em>”, catches our attention, is it not? While waiting on God, seeking the face and advice of my God, he dropped this word into my spirit – it will only hurt for a little while! Friend, since I am a mother of two children, I can surely explain this better to you today. When my children come home hurt and bruised, I would take the first aid box with antiseptics, soap, water, sponge, and bandages in it. My kids would look at my face pathetically and I would lovingly tell them, “If we don’t clean it, it will get infected, and besides it will only hurt for a little while.” When the antiseptic is applied it burns, but it heals. Sometimes children insist on just putting a band-aid on the infected place which would result in the wound getting septic.\r\n\r\nGod is trying to pour on the antiseptic on our wounds, hurts, and pains. It is only to eventually heal you. The subtle pride that is buried in you, the infection of laziness, rebellion, disobedience, self-righteousness everything would go. God knows everything about us. Sometimes we need ‘deep treatment’ for cleansing, but once He touches us, He brings about a marvelous change. The ‘treatment’ that God gives us may be in the form of illness, financial loss, job loss, misunderstandings in relationships, rebellious children and so on. Only when it hurts us do we understand the hurt that we had done to others, which stirs us to repent and change. When God pours that antiseptic into your wound you will be reminded of your ill spoken word and you will have to go and ask that person to forgive you. Observe the above scripture closely, it says, ‘He will Himself restore you.’ Comforting is it not? He will never leave you to be burnt, but through the trial period, God makes us strong, firm and steady. Blessings, devotion by Sis. Bala Samson"

              "<strong>Romans 12:2, \"And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAnything that we do most of the time does not just affect a day but days to come. The more reason we need to be careful about what we plant in our lives for sooner or later, we will look back and see why it was good or bad to plant some things. Let me share briefly on three things I call <strong>CCD</strong>. These are <strong>CHOICES</strong>, <strong>CHANGES</strong> and <strong>DECISIONS</strong>. <strong>We are what we are because of the choices, changes and decisions we make</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>According to thesaurus, Choices are options, alternatives, selection, preference and pick</strong>. We can see that choices are not one thing or one plan; they are many things that give you and me a chance to pick from. Choosing is preferring one thing or a person over another. This is my theory; choices tend to start from the beginning where you choose what direction to take. <strong>The choices you and I make today will have the ability to affect our tomorrow</strong>. People choose based on the surrounding, situation, peers, the present and even more. Everyone has to make some type of choices in their lives, choosing who to marry, what kind of job you desire, what kind of house you want to live in etc.\r\n\r\n<strong>Change</strong> on the other hand is to <strong>alter, modify, vary, transform, revolutionize, adjust or amend</strong>. No one can say that they have no ability to change. There are two types of changes, <strong>the change that occurs in a person </strong>and <strong>the change a person makes</strong>. Change is as vital as Choice is only that Change allows you to improve a Choice made. The change can be big or small but everyone can see its significance. Changing your community begins with changes inside out to put aside what you don't normally do and begin to develop a mindset of desiring to do it anyway, making it better. The change is not supposed to make it worse but better. Couples ought to change inside to make their marriages better and then using their change inside to change, perfect, revolutionize their marriage. <strong>Anyone who is not desiring to change is not ready for progress</strong>.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, “Decisions”. Decisions sound like choices and it is, but I look at choices as the beginning before anything happens. Decisions are made in the middle of something and now a mind has to be made up. Decisions is making judgment, assessing the situation and making a resolution to it.\r\n\r\nAll these three have one thing in common, <strong>they improve</strong>. Paul writes to the Romans and he is giving them guidelines to help them exercise these three things. One, <strong>\"Do not be conformed to this world\", </strong>meaning do not try and copy the life style of this world to effectively bring these three to life because the world has set its standard on how to view them. Second, \"<strong>But be transformed by the renewing of your mind</strong>\", Choices, changes and decisions are not made on emotions as many do; they are based on clear minds. It's easy to do things without thinking and it affects us in the long run, but when our minds are renewed, they become in tune with our hearts, and with that we are ready to progress. \"<strong>That you may prove what is that good and acceptable</strong>\", the three has to be approved. Example, when manufacturers build anything, they are not quick to bring it to the market. They test, prove, asses it to make sure it works well. They do not just look at what it can do today, they look at how long it will last, can it be effective, will it serve the purpose and so is with Christians, we have to prove what is that good, but by whose standards? Men's or God's? God's standards are acceptable because they are based on His perfect will.\r\n\r\nWe can make Choices, Changes and Decisions based on what is proved to be good and acceptable and perfect will of God. What choices are you making today? what changes have you purposed to make? What decisions do you have to make? Have you proved them to know that they are good and acceptable and are in line with His perfect will? Prove Before Executing, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 5:43-44, “You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbour, and hate your enemy “But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;” See Full passage (Matt 5:43-48)</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe that each one of us has people in our lives that are enemies. Who are the people in your life that seek your demise, hate when you move forward in life, try to get on your last nerve, and are vindictive and outright cruel to you? <!--more-->I gather that some name(s) just surfaced in your mind rather quickly. These enemies play a vital role in your life of you becoming more like Christ. God sent us an example (<strong>John 13:15)</strong> in His Son, that we should be conformed to His image (<strong>Romans 8:29</strong>) and walk as Jesus walked <strong>(1John 2:6).</strong> What does any of this have to do with your enemies helping you to become more like Christ?\r\n\r\nJesus pointed out that we are to love, bless, do good to, and pray for our enemies. “<em>If we want to make a difference we must be different.</em>” Jesus continues by saying, <strong>“For if you love them which love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same? And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more than others? do not even the publicans so?”</strong> The essence of what Jesus is saying is that if you follow Me (Jesus) and you treat your enemies the same way the world does how can you rightly say you are a Christian?\r\n\r\n<strong>Acts 6-7</strong> tells the account of Stephen. He rehearsed the history of Israel to his Hellenistic compatriots that were disputing with him (<strong>6:9</strong>) showing themselves to be his enemies. Stephen <em>“pushed the envelope</em>” hard when he said to them, “<strong>Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him-you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.”</strong> The truth hurt! “<strong>Upon hearing these things, were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth</strong>.” And as these men ran upon Stephen to stone him, Stephen looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw Jesus standing NOT sitting on the right hand of God. As he is about to breathe his last breath he says, “<strong>Lord Jesus, receive my spirit”…and cried with a loud voice, “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge</strong>.” Wow, Stephen has become so much like Christ in dealing with his enemies that his last dying words paralleled and were almost identical with Christ’s and certainly in the same Spirit of our LORD (<strong>Luke 23:34)</strong>. Read the gospels and examine how Jesus responded to his enemy Judas, to the point of allowing Judas to betray him with a kiss. Wow! Even as Christ was being verbally and physically abused He still died for sinners.\r\n\r\nYour response to your enemies speaks volumes of how Christ-like you are. How do you treat the Judas’ in your life? Is it like our Master, or like our previous father, the devil? If you don’t treat your enemies any different than the world does, then you are acting like your enemies. Ouch! When dealing with your enemies, show them Christ’s love, share the gospel with them. When they curse you, bless them. When they show you hatred, purposefully be and do good unto them. At the time they persecute you and despitefully use you, pray for them. Proverbs says “<strong>If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you</strong>”. This is “godly revenge!”\r\n\r\nOh Lord, may we bless, pray for and show kindness and love to those who are our enemies and those who are yours, in response to their treatment toward us .\r\nBlessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Colossians 3:23, “And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men”</strong>\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the order of things should drive how we handle things. There is always a continuous battle on how we do things especially in the job set up. We need to understand that where we are number one it’s God who brought us there and not our education or ability.<!--more--> If you think about it, how many have more degrees than a thermometer and yet are still struggling to find a place to put those degrees to work? We have to come to grips with the truth that we are where we are because of God and this leads us to have a sense of humility for He is the Boss (Master). We tend to forget that our employer is God and through our earthly employers He fulfils His plans and purposes, that is part of where His character shines because He has His ambassadors representing Him in the job set up. God is the SOURCE, our earthly employers are the MEANS by which He provides.\r\n\r\nIf we can distinguish between the Source and the Means, then we are channeled to look and deal with things differently. I can therefore work hard in the job He has placed me in knowing that He is my employer. I can be faithful with little or much knowing that He knows why He has placed me there. Take ownership by understanding you are out to please the Lord in the job He has placed you in. <strong>Colossians 3:23, “And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men</strong>”. I look at the last part of this scripture and it says “AS TO THE LORD” which gives me this understanding that how you would treat the Lord is how you would treat your boss, you are doing it unto the Lord through them. I know there are some who are not happy with their jobs and their bosses and just like Joseph who did not have his dream job, where he was prepared him to where God would move him too. His qualification for the next move was in his hard work, obedience and faithfulness in what he was doing. Moses was reduced from a prince in Egypt to a shepherd however you can see his faithfulness that channeled him to be elevated in due time to be a leader of millions. I believe God allows us to be in certain jobs not as a punishment but training grounds for character enlargement. A place to learn obedience and faithfulness. You can be faithful where you are as you trust God for where you want to be.\r\n\r\nThe bible says in <strong>Colossians 3:22, “Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God”.</strong> How would we please a Boss (Master) we cannot see without pleasing a boss we can see. If we know we are pleasing a boss we can see to please the Boss (Master) we can’t see then our attitude towards work will be different. We will not slack, steal time, be careless or be lazy because we are not where we want to be. The scripture says, obey in ALL things but not please them when they are looking or when you can see what you will get out of it but with sincere heart, fearing God. This is pleasing to the Lord. I believe there are days we mess our progress to greater levels because of our attitudes towards work and our bosses.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself this question, why are you in your job? Why do you do what you do? Who do you do it for? Do an attitude check, see what changes you need to make and be the best worker the Lord wants you to be, you are His ambassador in that company.\r\n\r\nBlessings Evans, God’s servant."

              "<strong>Psalm 37:4, “Delight yourself also in the Lord and He shall give you the desires of your heart.” </strong>\r\n\r\nGod has a grand plan to bless your life in a very special way. How do you get to know what plans He has for you? What do you need to do to receive His blessings, both spiritual and material? Here are a few recommendations to meditate on today:\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to have a relationship with Him. You must be made His child and remain his forever (<strong>John 1:12</strong>). Only God’s children have inheritance to the blessings of God. The righteous shall inherit the earth, the Bible says.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nSecond, you need to search the word of God and find out every promise he has given which assures you of His blessings. The word of God is His will for your life. He knows the plans that He has for you. Do you know them?\r\n\r\n<strong>“For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.”, Jeremiah 29:11</strong>\r\n\r\nGod has good thoughts and plan toward His children. However, He expects His children to have personal expectation. What you expect, is what God confirms and releases in you. <strong>You cannot have what God has if you do not desire it and expect it. Your desire and expectation, faith, in Gods ability and willingness to bless you, are your elevators to His throne room where mercy and goodness dwells. </strong>So, get into the elevators.\r\n\r\nThird, you must follow the Lord Jesus Christ’s teaching and instruction on how to prosper. The Bible is the authentic source of God’s instruction. It reveals the mind, ways and will of God. When read, understood, believed and applied, you get what God has promised. <strong>What you desire, pray for and you believe is what you can expect from God when you are sure it is in line with His will. </strong>Jesus said:“<strong>Therefore I say unto you, what things so ever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them and you shall have them.”, Mark 11:24</strong>\r\n\r\nThe verse is specifically talking about things. Moreover, we do need things. Things, perhaps, are the greatest concern of your life today. That is why we are working hard so we can afford things. God has no problem giving things as long as things will not draw you away from Him and hinder your fruitfulness in the Christian life and ministry. You are saved by grace and, have been preserved for His purpose only. When you desire, pray and believe for anything that will help you fulfill His purpose, be sure you will have it.\r\n\r\nAsk god today to fill your heart with godly desires. Ask Him in prayer to grant you the desires of your heart. Believe, wait and receive, in His time, your expectation. Do not limit God to your own desires and dreams. <strong>Let God and let go of yours</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>“Delight yourself also in the Lord and He shall give you the desires of your heart.” Psalm 37:4, Blessings Pastor Boaz</strong>"

              "<strong>Jeremiah 1:5, \"Before I formed you in the word I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe more I walk with the Lord, the more I see my life being changed as I go to new dimensions. As a child growing up, I had some thoughts of what I wanted to be and always dreamed of it. The more I have lived, the more I have come to realize that what I thought was what I needed cannot be compared to what God has done. In other words, I got more than I bargained for.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI believe with all my heart that there are many things deposited in us that we know not of. Some are reserved for a certain time when we are ready. If we knew our end result, it would scare some of us to death. <strong>We always try to see our destiny based on our history</strong>. One of the people who was told of his destiny was Jeremiah, it scared him to death. The first thing we are told of where God was involved in his life. It was not when he was born or when he was conceived, God knew him when He thought of making him. \"<strong>Before \"I\" formed you in the womb \"I\" knew you\". </strong>God was telling Jeremiah that he was a result of His making and God does not make anything that has no purpose. God orchestrated every life not when it was born but right before the thought of the parents to have one. Why is it so important? because you begin to understand your life is God planned. God planned it, stepped in, made it, fixed it. \"…<strong>Before you were born I sanctified you</strong>\", He knew that Jeremiah would be born in sinful world but He was already sanctified in the womb. Sanctify means to set a part, to make holy or purify. Those who are saved are sanctified even if they don’t feel like it. It's not a matter of feeling but knowing that you are. \"…<strong>I ordained you a prophet to the nations</strong>\", this was to be Jeremiah's calling, a prophet. The word ordain means to invest with ministerial or authority. Three things God told Jeremiah about himself, <strong>I</strong> <strong>FORMED, SANCTIFIED, ORDAINED</strong>. I can see how no one can form, sanctify or ordain but God.\r\n\r\nIn our thinking we would wonder how can this be? 1. Jeremiah was too young to understand all these; 2. He could not see how he could be what God had called him to be. Now I know why God would not show us everything. We would not understand them even if He explained, they would not make sense, they would look and sound foolish compared to what we know of ourselves so He just leads us to them. <strong>Romans 8:30, \"Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified</strong>\". Paul talks about how God works and says that those whom he predestined, in other words those that He elected by divine will, He also called them. Something to think about, when he predestined them, there is no where it shows they were perfect or complete. This is because the next line reveals to us that He also justified them. Justified means, declared free of blame from guilt and penalty attached to grievous sin. And those that He justified, He also glorified. The glory part puzzled me a bit for I know Only God receives the glory but how can He glorify us then. Here is an interpretation the Holy Spirit gave me. That which has been taken through the process of formed (predestined), sanctified (justified), ordained (called) He lives in them and glorifies Himself in them. You shine because He shines through you.\r\n\r\nIf you are a believer, there is a calling in your life. It may not be what you thought you will be or planned to be. I never saw myself preaching, teaching, encouraging, writing, praying etc. I grew up a very shy skinny boy, bullied by a number in school, I was nicknamed every name I could think of, an average student. I never thought or saw myself being used of God mightily but now I understand that I was Formed, sanctified and ordained. God had deposited so much in me I did not even know until the right time. It's the same with you, you have no idea what God has deposited in you yet to be revealed. <strong>You may be looking at your history, God is looking at your origin</strong>. Since you have no recall of your origin, let God who was there tell you of what He made you to be. My history did not affect my origin though I concentrated on my history. My history showed more of my failures than success, my origin showed \"Formed, sanctified and ordained\" Blessings Evans"

              "Jeremiah 29:12-14, “<strong>Then you will call upon me and you will find Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And if you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for me with all you heart…”</strong>\n\nHave you found God? If you are saved and have been born again through faith in Christ and by the power of the Holy Spirit, I know for sure that God found you. I also know where He found you from. <!--more-->\nAnd I know the marvelous change He has brought into your life. I also know about the promises He has given you. I also know about His love and willingness to help you walk in His power and live a victorious Christian life. But, the question that I want ask and would like for you to think about and mediate on is this: <strong>Have you also found God as He has found you? </strong>\n\nFinding God? What does that mean? Is it necessary? Is it practical? Does God hide at times, and then give us hard times to find Him? If God found us and saved us, why then do we need to find Him? Why can’t we just lay back, recline, take it easy and just enjoy the ride to heaven? Why put effort when Jesus did everything for us so we could be saved and go to heaven?\n\nYou might have asked these questions and even more just like many of us have. You probably are still wondering whether it is necessary, logical, and practical to find God. For one, God is bigger than big. The whole world cannot contain Him. So, how could He be contained in you if you found Him and desired to retain Him in your heart? You may also be thinking that because He is Omniscience and Omnipotent, He is everywhere and all powerful and so it is not necessary and theologically correct to urge believers to search and find God? Whatever your thinking is or your belief is, you need to listen to what God is saying about the need for you and all believers to find Him. You need to understand that God, from time immemorial, has required His children to seek and find Him. There is something special about that requirement. It has a dual purpose. One, God delights in seeing His children taking time and reverently seeking Him with all their heart, and Secondly, the children of God benefits a great deal when they seek God and find Him. <strong>The union between the believer and God, following the believer’s desperate and selfish search of God’s presence, is the most perfect and highest level of spirituality anybody can attain.</strong> You can’t go higher than that. And you can’t get better than that. Everything life is and all that we could ever desire or want, according to God’s will, is within reach when we seek God and find Him. <strong>Righteousness and Holiness, without which no man shall see God</strong>, become attainable by we the mortal when we have searched God and found Him. Isn’t that wonderful? <strong>The call to seek God is a call that must be heeded, because it is a call with a purpose and a promise. </strong>It does not matter where one may be; there is always a call from God to seek Him.\n\nFor example: When the Israelites were exiled in Babylon, God through the Prophet Jeremiah urged them to seek Him with all their heart until they found Him. The prophets, priests, elders, men, women and children were urged by God Himself, to seek Him till they had found Him. Following is the ‘call’ and ‘directive’ God gave: <strong>“Then you will call upon me and you will find Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And if you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for me with all you heart. And I will be found of you, ‘declares the Lord, ‘and I will restore your fortunes and will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, ‘declares the Lord, ‘and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile.”, Jeremiah 29:12-14</strong>\n\nYou may not be in exile right now, but you need to seek the Lord. You need to pray. You need to put effort. You cannot give God leftovers and please Him. You cannot find Him when you are not searching and seeking Him with all your heart. It is not where you go to seek Him that matters; it is the condition of your heart and the ardent desire you have and the faith you have that matters and will lead you into His presence. You need to seriously set yourself to go on an expedition to find God. Once you have found Him, live in His presence daily through the power and presence of the Holy Ghost. <strong>The Holy Ghost cannot be your occasional Holy Guest. He must be a permanent resident and the president of your heart and home.</strong> You must retain God in your heart, mind body and soul. God has to fill your entire being. When you wake up in the morning, you need to crave for God like an addict craves for drink, drugs or cigarettes. Be filled with His Spirit. Walk in the same power everyday wherever you are. You truly will be turned from exile-whatever the exile may be that you are in right now, when you seek God with all your heart. In exile or not, find God. Do whatever it takes to find God. Don’t be satisfied and limited by your current level of the knowledge of God you have. You can’t know God fully as He really is even if you searched throughout eternity. But, He will reveal Himself to you in response to your searching and according to the level of your faith. Then you will Grow in His knowledge and <strong>His righteousness will be revealed to you from “faith to faith”</strong> glory to glory (<strong>Romans 1:17).</strong> Let the Holy Spirit help your infirmities, and pray on your behalf and lead you into your search for God. If you seek Him with all your heart, you will sure find Him. God bless you! By His Servant, Pastor Boaz Olang."

              "<strong>Psalm 1:1–2, “BLESSED is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful. 2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.” </strong>\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Psalm 1</strong> two lives are contrasted, the blessed life and the cursed (ungodly life). Many people think that they can stay on the fence, having one foot in the church and one foot in the world. If a soldier did that in war, stood in between both sides, he would surely be killed by the crossfire of both sides firing at him. <!--more-->Yet, many still try to blend in with both the world as well as the church. Jesus came to earth and split time in half from BC to AD, and his position in your life or lack of position in your life has the same effect spiritually. Either you are living life as a blessed godly person, or you are living life as a cursed ungodly person, which one are you? Why, because outside of God's blessing, man is \"cursed\" and ultimately leads a meaningless life (<strong>Ecclesiastes 1:2).</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 1</strong> instructs us that a blessed man does not take counsel from the ungodly. There are many advice givers, but is that advice coming from a godly source? One that is blessed will take life counsel from spiritually mature Christians. A blessed man also will not stand in the way or will not flow in the thinking of sinners. Sinners are the ungodly, enemies of God, while saints are the godly, righteous, redeemed children of God, and again you are either one or the other. Yes saints sometimes struggle with sin, but if they are a saint, that is the identity given to them by Christ. A blessed person will not sit in the seat of the scornful, those that mock God. The \"mockers\" have no regard for God and his commandments. The mocker is <strong>a fool in the language of wisdom</strong> (<strong>Proverbs 9:8; 14:6</strong>). <strong>He does not respond to instruction </strong>(<strong>9:7; 15:12</strong>) but <strong>stirs up strife by his insults </strong>(<strong>22:10</strong>). He <strong>delights in mocking </strong>(<strong>1:22</strong>). The blessed life takes delight in, God and His Word.\r\n\r\nThe blessed life is the one that responds to God’s commands begrudgingly, by gritting their teeth and sheer will power, kicking and screaming. No way, the blessed life delights in God’s Word so much so that he meditates on it day and night. (<strong>Josh 1:8</strong>).\r\n\r\nIn his book “<em>What in the World is God Doing”, </em>Dr. Ted Engstrom, former president of World Vision, relates a story told by a Korean believer. The story concerns three Korean workmen who found jobs in China in the 1880s. While in China they heard the gospel and embraced Christ as Savior and Lord. They were now determined to find a way to bring the gospel to their own country of Korea, even though evangelizing was illegal. They decided to try and smuggle a copy of the Chinese Bible, because the Korean alphabet was so similar. The first man buried the Bible in his luggage and walked many days to the border. His bags were searched, the Bible was found and he was executed. Word got back to the two friends, and the second friend tore pages from his Bible, stuffed them throughout his luggage, made the long journey, only to be searched and beheaded. The third friend determined to do what his friends did not succeed in, ingeniously tore his Bible apart page by page. He them folded each page into tiny strips and wove the strips into a rope. He tied the homemade rope around his bag, made his journey, was searched, and succeeded in passing over the border. The man arrived home, untied the rope, and ironed each page. He reassembled the Bible and began to preach Christ wherever he went. Now that is delighting in God’s Word. Charles Spurgeon said, “<em>Some of you have enough dust on your Bible that you can write the word ‘damnation’ in the dust with your finger</em>.” Ouch, hopefully that’s not you!\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: Are you living the blessed or cursed life? Who do you take counsel from? Do you stand in the flow of sinners and mockers? How much do you delight in his word? By Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>Psalm 1:3-4, “And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he does shall prosper. Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.” </strong>\r\n\r\nThe blessed is personified as a tree that is planted and therefore rooted. Jeremiah tells us “<strong>But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in Him. He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit</strong> (<strong>17:7–8).”</strong> <!--more-->Trees have a root system and all of the roots go down into the soil and branch out underground that is all except one root. The tap root drills straight down into the earth, and the older and stronger a tree is, the more deeply rooted it is. I love the popular bonsai tree, but to keep the tree small the roots are cut therefore the tree is left dwarfed. It looks great aesthetically, but the roots do not go down deep. However think of a Great Oak Tree whose roots drive deep into the earth. Its tap root is what causes it to be rooted and grounded. The Apostle Paul writes in<strong> Ephesians 3:17, “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love.”</strong> This person is rooted and grounded because and ONLY because they are connected as a branch to the Vine. In <strong>John 15</strong> Jesus likens our lives to branches and Himself as the Vine, with God the Father as the Gardener. Jesus says more than once in this passage that apart from Him we can do NO-THING, nothing. Do you believe that? Both in <strong>John 15</strong>, and <strong>Psalm 1</strong>, the key to being fruitful is the connection to the Vine and to the rivers of [Living] Water [emphasis mine]. God wants fruit from His tree, because He is the Owner and the Gardener. The blessed life will produce fruit in his season, as those living in right relationship with God will receive God's blessing and enjoy life as a gift of God.\r\n\r\nThe cursed life is personified as the chaff that the wind blows away. Chaff, in the vernacular is, light straw which can be easily be blown away. Ultimately the wicked will be easily blown away. I picture the western movies when the tumbleweeds, like chaff, blow through the town. Why can the chaff be easily blown away, because it has no root, it becomes dried out, and can be eaten by the animals. Paul tells us “<strong>Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming</strong> (<strong>Ephesians 4:14</strong>).” Again in <strong>John 15</strong>, Jesus spoke of the branches that a branch that fails to remain in Him is thrown away, withers, and thrown into the FIRE! Although it may seem at times that the wicked are really getting ahead in life, over and above the Christian. The ultimate thing that the cursed life, which is dead in sins and transgressions (<strong>Ephesians 2:1</strong>), will be death. Death will blow and the wicked will move to its influence, wither away and be thrown in the fire.\r\n\r\nWhen death comes reaching for, and blowing murderous threats at the blessed life, the Lord Himself will not allow that life to be budged in any way. Why, because whatever the blessed life does shall prosper. Did Jesus Christ prosper in this life? That is almost a foolish question I realize, but as we live like Him and in Him, we will process like Him because we are in Him. When your faith is put to the test will you bear fruit in season? The storms of life will show if you are a tree planted of chaff getting blown. Make sure that you are attached to Christ, and that you remain in Him.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: If you were put on trial for being a Christian would there be enough evidence to convict you? Your faith MUST stand trial to see what you are putting your trust in.</strong>\r\n<strong>By Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>John 15:4–6, “…No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. “I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.” </strong>\r\n\r\nMany professing Christians seem to be religious, but not fruitful ones. What Jesus did when He was alone with His disciples is that He spoke to them about living productive, fruit-bearing lives. Just as in <strong>Psalm 1</strong>, the key for the tree to be nourished was being rooted near the streams of water and having the water travel up the root system all the way to the branches to produce fruit, so to do we find a similar illustration here.<!--more--> Jesus emphasized strongly that “…<strong>no branch can bear fruit by itself”.</strong> Can you imagine cutting off a branch from a tree, and expecting it to produce fruit when disconnected from the source of nutrients? That would be absurd. Jesus points out that in the same way, no one can live a fruitful life UNLESS and only UNLESS they remain in Him! It is not enough for a branch to be near the vine (trunk), it must be connected. Jesus tells us that HE is the VINE and we are the branches.\r\n\r\nIf we are in Christ it will show forth from our lives. A healthy vine cannot but help bear grapes, a healthy orange tree will bear oranges, etc…, and a healthy Christian life will bear the character of Christ and reproduce souls into the Kingdom of God. It has been rightly said that when a husband and wife are intimate children are born, and likewise when one is intimate with the Lord souls are born again! Peter denied the Lord, wept bitterly in repentance, and eventually became the leader of the Apostles as he preached at Pentecost (<strong>Acts 2</strong>), he wrote first and second Peter, and eventually would be crucified upside down for Christ not feeling worthy to die in the same exact manner as his Lord.\r\n\r\nWhy would a professing Christian stay fruitless? Jesus tells us that some branches don’t produce fruit ever, because they are not connected to the vine. A branch cannot bear fruit unless it is attached, and if it is not it withers up because the branch can only die without life flowing to it. When I cut branches off from trees all they were good for eventually was firewood because they were nice and dry and dead, as dead wood burns the best. A life unconnected to Christ will be one that is picked up and thrown into the fire. Judas was a fruitless branch that betrayed Jesus and ended up committing suicide. Judas was NOT connected and everything that Judas influenced was toward death! Jesus said, “<strong>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy (cast) both soul and body in hell.” </strong>Unconnected lives that stay unconnected will end up in the Lake of Fire. <strong>Rev. 20:15</strong> reads, “<strong>If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire</strong>.”\r\n\r\nAn absolutely fruitless life is evidence that one is not a believer. <strong>“Fruit bearing is not only possible but certain if the branch remains in union with the vine. Uniformity of quantity and quality are not promised. But if the life of Christ permeates a disciple, fruit will be inevitable (EBC).</strong>”\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: Is there fruit in your life that you are Christian? Do others recognize that Christ is in your life? Ask two trusted believers and two non-believers how they view your relationship with God? And above all remain in Him and you will bear fruit and show to belong to Him! Go and reach the unconnected lives in your life and connect them to Christ! Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>Mark 11:14, “Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again...” </strong>\r\n\r\nJesus spoke a destructive miracle into being! Of all the miracles that Jesus performed, none of them was of a destructive nature other than the cursing of the fig tree. Upon leaving Bethany Jesus was hungry, and saw a fig tree in the distance, and therefore went over to it to satisfy his hunger. However the tree He noticed only bore leaves, but NO fruit. Then Jesus spoke the words of cursing upon the tree, “<strong>May no one ever eat fruit from you again</strong>.” This doesn’t quite make much sense in light of Mark stating, “<strong>He [Jesus] found nothing but leaves</strong>, <strong>because it was not the season for figs</strong>.” Why is Jesus cursing a tree for having no figs, but every other fig tree had the same testimony, “<strong>because IT WAS NOT THE SEASON FOR FIGS</strong>.” Was it reasonable for Jesus to curse the fig tree for not bearing its fruit out of season?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nDr. Christie in his book ‘The Barren Fig Tree,’ explains six weeks before figs were actually to bear upon the tree in April, the tree would first have the foliage coating complete. Coincident with [this], and sometimes even before, there appears quite a crop of small knobs, NOT THE REAL FIGS, but a kind of early forerunner. They grow to the size of green almonds, in which condition they are eaten by peasants and others when hungry. When they come to their own indefinite maturity they drop off. These precursors of the true fig are call <em>taqsh</em> [”pre-figs”] in Palestinian Arabic. Their appearance is an indication, a sign, of the fully formed figs which were to appear six weeks later in. Mark says the time for figs had not come yet. However if the leaves appear without any <em>taqsh</em> [pre-figs], that is a sign that there will be no figs appearing six weeks later. Since Jesus was hungry and found nothing but leaves, leaves without any <em>taqsh</em>, He knew that it was an absolutely hopeless, fruitless fig tree, and said as much.\r\n\r\nJesus said in <strong>John 15:5, “I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.</strong>” And in <strong>Matthew 7:21-23 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’</strong>\r\n\r\nPeople will say to Jesus on that day [Judgment Day], look at all the things I did in Your Name Jesus. In Your name we prophesied, cast out demons, performed miracles, we knew every worship song and joined the choir, we even started ministries, etc…. God wants fruit in lives and many people will point to things in their lives, all of their spiritual accolades, but Jesus was saying to those in <strong>Matthew 7</strong>, <em>“All I see in your life is leaves, but NO FRUIT. You did those things all right, but I NEVER KNEW YOU, because you never did ABIDE IN ME all that is plain to see now because all of your efforts are just leaves and that is not my will, my will was that you bear fruit. There is only one reason that you produced leaves instead of fruit, because you lived disconnected from me, although you were very religious, you did NOT do my will, but YOUR OWN! Depart from me! Many do works for God, apart from abiding in Him</em>”. If faith without works, hence works without abiding, being connected to His heart and will is also dead (fruitless). If the life of Christ permeates a disciple, fruit will be inevitable, NOT leaves. May we give Him what He wants, FRUIT.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: Are you bearing leaves or fruit in your life, because Jesus only honors fruit! Blessings Pastor Phil</strong>"

              "<strong>Luke 17:7-10, \"7 And which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come at once and sit down to eat’? 8 But will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare something for my supper, and gird yourself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink’? 9 Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not. 10<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, ‘We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.’”</span>’ </strong>\r\n\r\nWe all have a drive to be acknowledged, be thanked for things we do. We also love to be compensated for a job well done, we feel we deserve and are entitled to a number of things.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe feel we have done enough merit or have some qualifications for something in light of a duty performed. And we become frustrated when what we think we have earned or deserved goes unrecognized or appreciated. One televangelist hammers this in his broadcast of what believers are entitled to and deserve because of their relationship with Christ which is totally unbiblical.\r\n\r\n<strong>I want us to be reminded that God owes us nothing</strong>. Even that which He does for us is not because of us but because of Jesus who was obedient to the Father even to the point of going to the cross. If you asked apostle Paul if he was special having done great things for God, he will say no. He was just fulfilling his call and in that he also benefitted.\r\n\r\nListen to Jesus address this issue in vs. 7. \"<strong>But which of you having a servant ploughing or tending to the sheep...\". </strong>While this bible verse uses the word<strong> \"servant\", </strong>in the original text the word is<strong>\"slave\". </strong>In order to keep the disciples humble in the performance of miraculous works; and that they might not imagine they could have any thing at the hands of God by merit; and to excite them to go on from one duty to another; and never think they have done, or done enough, or more than what is their duty, Christ delivers this parable. The servant goes to the field to plough or tend to the sheep or both. When he gets back, he does not sit and wait for his master to prepare food for him, no, he prepares supper for his master and feeds him and when he is full then his servant (slave) sits down to eat. But does the master thank the servant for doing his job? Jesus says no. How then do we sometimes accuse God for not being fair? If He gave us what is fair we are all in trouble \"<strong>for the wages of sin is death...\", Romans 6:23.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. \"10 ....When ye have done all, say, We are unprofitable servants\". \"</strong><em>Aman cannot profit God. Happy is he who Judges himself an unprofitable servant: miserable is he whom God pronounces such. But though we are unprofitable to Him, our serving Him is not unprofitable to us. For He is pleased to give by His grace a value to our good works, which in consequence of His promise entitles us to an eternal reward\", </em>John wesley\r\n\r\nOur Master owes us no thanks when we serve Him faithfully, for we have only done our duty. The heavenly reward to the faithful is of grace, not of debt. We have not, as his servants (slaves), profited or benefited God at all. We do not benefit God by being obedient, we benefit ourselves. This thought should be a load lifted off us to be free from the thought that obedience makes us special entitling us for blessings.\r\n\r\nThe servant in this parable is cared for by being given identity, duties, protection, food and shelter, all provided for by the master, but not because the servant is worthy but because the Master is. May we walk in obedience not because we are special but because He is special. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong> John 14:6, \"I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE</strong>\"\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is uniqueness of Christianity? No one in any religion in the entire world has ever risen to claim they have the POWER TO FORGIVE SIN, Jesus Christ of the Christians has. <strong>Matthew 9:6, \"But that you may know that the Son of Man (Jesus Christ) has power on earth to forgive sins\". </strong>This is one of the reasons they hated Him the most, they didn’t mind Him healing the sick and raising the dead<strong>. </strong>Not only has He the power to forgive sins, He has distinguished Himself as unique. He was here on earth <strong>100% God and 100% Man </strong>meaning He was the infinite God Man. <strong>John 1:1, \"In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God and the word was God...without God nothing made could have been made....the word was made flesh and dwelt among us (paraphrased). </strong>Jesus the living word came in flesh yet without sin. The reason He came to us inform in flesh was to relate to us and redeem us. <strong>You can only redeem what you are related to</strong>. He understood what it meant to be tempted, go without, be exhausted, loose a friend, to be attacked but still became a victor. Who understands the nature of suffering like He does?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nBecause of His uniqueness, He has described Himself as THE only way to God,<strong> John 14:6, \"I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE</strong>\". To get to God, Jesus is the way; to know the Truth, He is the truth; to have life, He is the life. Why do we pray in Jesus name? because as I have mentioned, that is how we get access to the Father, <strong>John 14:26, \"...that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you</strong>\". If He used the word I Am “A” way, “A” truth and “A” life, that would mean that there is another way to get to God and that would mean that He is not THE only way as Oprah Winfrey and many other professing Christians states. STATING that HE IS shows that there can be no one besides Him. This is where the 2nd commandment comes in, <strong>Exodus 20:3-5, vs. \"You shall have no other gods before Me. vs. 4 \"You shall not make for yourself a carved image--any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; vs. 5 you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God</strong>\". This is also the God in Jesus saying that He is the only ONE. See when He died on the cross, not only was He the Savior of the world, He also became the Lord. Being Lord means taking ownership and there can be no two owners but one, <strong>Romans 14:9, \"For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that He might be Lord both of the dead and living</strong>\", <strong>1Corinthians 8:6, \"yet for us there is ONE God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and ONE Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live</strong>\".\r\n\r\nPeople like to come to people who will receive them, Jesus came to His own and His own rejected Him. He knew He would be rejected way before He came to us. As someone said, the best way He could glorify His Father in heaven was while here on earth and we glorify God when we submit to Jesus. <strong>Philippians 2:5-10, “5 Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, 6 who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, 7 but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. 9 Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</strong>\r\n\r\nJust like a woman cannot have more than one husband, Christ is a husband to one wife to those who received Him therefore we call Him Lord. He says, choose ye this day whom you will serve, either be God or .... the choice is ours. <strong>He has revealed to us who He is, what He stands for and what He requires of us</strong>.\r\n\r\nDifferent religions teach that it's by works that we are saved, the bible teaches in <strong>Ephesians 2:8&amp;9, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast\". </strong>We don't get to heaven by our good works but by the gift of grace through faith. <strong>And Grace is a favor rendered to one who desires it and does not deserve it. No one can take the credit of making it to heaven by themselves, Jesus is THE way to Heaven. Blessings Ev</strong>"

              "<strong>Psalm 1:1-6, \"... He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings fruit in it's season...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe the opening chapter in the book of Psalm down to a few verses is one of the guidelines to being blessed of God. God has no shortcuts for His people to get blessed despite the many teachings we hear especially with televangelists. I believe God would want us to move from expecting miracles to being blessed. Being blessed in my judgment is a working progress. Let’s see what <strong>Psalm 1</strong> teaches us how to be blessed.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 1, “Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful”.</strong> It’s interesting to note that the bible already calls you blessed when you are set apart from the world. This verse puzzled me for a very long time as I was not sure whether it meant I should not walk with the unbelievers. The verse does not mean we cannot walk with the unbelievers, it says we cannot go by their counsel (wisdom), thinking or their ways. To grow, your counsel and their counsel has to be replaced by His. The primary reason we should hang out with the unbelievers is to witness to them.\r\n\r\nTo be blessed is vs. 2, “<strong>to delight in the law of the Lord, and on His law, meditate day and night”. </strong>Though we know the law is to tell what sin is, God uses it also to keep and safe and sound but you have to delight in it. Here the law is more than rules but the word of God.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 3, “ He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper”</strong> Every tree is planted for a reason. Trees don’t just grow for nothing and no one also plants trees for nothing. Some plant trees for beauty, shade, timber, fruits. God does plant His trees for fruit. He wants to see us grow. As a tree, we are planted by the river of the living water to bring forth fruit. As branch in <strong>John 15</strong> we abide in Him that we may bear fruit. You can see that to be blessed you have to be connected to the right source. So what kind of fruit is the bible talking about, <strong>Galatians 5:22-23, “22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law</strong>”. I don’t see how one can bear this fruit real quick. It takes time and growth. Do you realize the bible does not say produce fruit or grow fruit? It’s because if we are planted by the river and are abiding, the fruit will come. Our leaves will not dry and whatever we do, we will prosper.\r\n\r\nGod has planted us by His rivers and as He living water, He continuously flows in us. The river is not stagnant water but moving water always bringing in the fresh water. When the word of God dwells in our hearts daily and we pray and meditate on His word daily, we get continuous supply for our day to day. I believe that when we are planted by the His river, we get our nourishment every day. We don't need to struggle to stay good or be fruitful because it will happen without any struggle. Many will see the change in us and would desire to know where we are planted. Remember that everyone is planted by a certain river, the question is, which one? Christ gave the Samaritan woman the living water and she went back to be a witness in Samaria. She did not struggle to do it as she was now planted by the river of life. The more I see the fruit of the Spirit in my life, the more I consider myself blessed. It takes time because of the growth process but it’s worth it. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Corinthians 10:4-5, “For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5972\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blog.jpg\" alt=\"blog\" width=\"188\" height=\"188\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nIt is better to try to keep a bad thing from happening than fix it once it has happened. And I will apply this to dealing with demonic forces, satanic oppressions. Anyone who is vulnerable is setting him or herself as an easy target for the enemy. Why be an easy target then try and deal with them after they come in? It’s hard to empty a boat that is being filled with water due to holes in that boat.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe bible says in <strong>2Corinthians 10:3, “For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh</strong>”, it’s clear we are at war, spiritual war daily. The enemy is not at rest neither should we. The question then is, what is the strategy to overcome the enemy of our soul, vs. 4 tells us, “<strong>4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ”, </strong>our weapon is the truth of God’s word, 1. It pulls down strongholds (fortified) places where His word is trying to reach, 2. It casts down imaginations (made up thoughts) and every high thing that tries to arise above the knowledge of God, (things the enemy elevates above God’s word), we see this in the garden of Eden where he tells Eve to doubt God’s word 3. It brings every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ (submission). Jesus used the truth of His word cast down imaginations in the dessert. “<strong>…the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; </strong>also<strong> 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints”, Ephesians 6:16-18</strong>. The more you are in the word, in prayer and doing the work of the Lord, the less you become vulnerable to yielding to the enemy. His strategy is to tempt the elect to drop down their weapons and surrender. I would rather have prevention measure than cure.\r\n\r\nA Scriptural expectation of victory, will purify the soul, and keep it from being defiled by Satan. It subdues and mortifies evil desires and blasphemous thoughts as they rise within; and answers unbelief and error as they assault from without. A single text, well understood, and rightly applied, at once destroys a temptation or an objection, and subdues the most formidable adversary. Prayer calls for submission as you cannot resist without first submitting, <strong>James 4:6, “Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you” </strong>. The bible will keep you from sin and sin will keep you from the bible. We must fasten all the other parts of our Christian armor if we are to be overcomer. If you are not in submission to the Lord in word, in prayers, in serving Him, you can chase the devil all you want only to be defeated. You can gain victory after attack but remember, cure may leave scars. Why not act on preventive measures today. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Galatians 1:6–9, “is a curse on anyone who distorts the gospel of Christ:”</strong>\n\n<strong>“6 I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, 7 which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed”,</strong> <strong>Galatians 1:6-9</strong><!--more-->\n\n\nWe live in a world with the genuine and the counterfeit, the true and the false, the real and the fake. We have genuine currency (monies) and counterfeit. There are genuine works of art, and then there are frauds. Ask any magician and he will tell you that fooling people is certainly possible as they use optical illusion to illustrate that the hand is quicker than the eye. Therefore it should not be a surprise that there are false gospels in our time that attempt to go against the true gospel. Paul gave a sober warning that anyone that preaches a distorted gospel will be anathema, that is to say accursed. The gospel did not originate with man but with God, therefore who are we as humans to come up with our own version of the gospel? We must under no any circumstances veer off from the gospel that Jesus preached. The opening line of Paul’s warning states vs. “<strong>6 I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, 7 which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.”</strong> Turning to other gospels are always for selfish ambition and vain conceit as it puts the word of man above the Word of God. Many in evangelicalism having certainly gone off the beaten path that our Lord paved by His blood, His life and His Word, and have abandon it for a different gospel. This was happening in Paul’s day, hence the reason that he writes, therefore it should be of no surprise that the false gospels still corrode many lives today.\n\nWe live in a world that at one time used <strong>John 3:16</strong> as the staple verse from the Word of God. Now many use a new verse as the staple verse, <strong>“Do not judge, or you too will be judged</strong>”, (<strong>Matthew 7:1</strong>). This is said because many don’t want to call sin for what it is, sin. These same people have not looked to the balance of this verse out of John’s gospel which reads, <strong>“Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a RIGHT JUDGMENT!</strong>” When we use the Word of God we can call one that steals a thief, and one that tells lies, a liar. I close part one with a quote from author and Pastor, John McArthur from His book the gospel according to Jesus writes, “<em>The gospel in vogue today holds forth a false hope to sinners. It promises them they can have eternal life yet continue to live in rebellion against God. Indeed, it encourages people to claim Jesus as Savior yet defer until later the commitment to obey him as Lord. It promises salvation from hell but not necessarily freedom from iniquity. It offers false security to people who revel in the sins of the flesh and spurn the way of holiness. By separating faith from faithfulness, it teaches that intellectual assent is as valid as wholehearted obedience to the truth.”</em>\n\nThus the good news of Christ has given way to the bad news of an insidious easy-believes that makes no moral demands on the lives of sinners. It is not the same message Jesus proclaimed. Is the gospel you believe, what Jesus preached? Is the gospel your pastor preaches, the one that Jesus preached? Examine your Bible, and your belief, do they line up? In the following messages, I will share on some of the different gospels that many are embracing today such as the prosperity gospel, happiness gospel, the emergent gospel, the racist or prejudice gospel, the Mormon gospel, the Jehovah’s Witness gospel, the Muslim gospel and of course the Biblical Gospel (the one Jesus preached). Please, examine the gospel you believe, is it truly the Gospel Jesus proclaimed, died for, and the one many today still die for? If not repent, and believe the gospel, and be transformed by the truth of Christ. Because of the seriousness of this issue, I welcome any responses to the crucial issue facing our lives today. Until the nets are filled, Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Galatians 1:9, “As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be anathema (accursed).”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn part one of what gospel do you believe, some groundwork was laid showing the framework of the real gospel is not the gospel that everyone is following these days. Paul was greatly disturbed recognizing that the Galatians in fact so quickly deserted the biblical Gospel for a different gospel.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nPaul rebukes the Galatians for their departure of the true gospel for the false. Perhaps through these messages, if you have left the biblical gospel for a false one, you too may hear the words of Paul rebuking you as well, and repent quickly.\r\n\r\nOne of the “different gospels” in our day that is preached is surely the prosperity gospel. What is the basis for the prosperity gospel? <strong>Anyone who watches “TV evangelists” has no doubt heard the Prosperity Gospel. </strong>A central tenet of the prosperity gospel is that God wills the financial prosperity of every Christian. If a believer lives in poverty, he/she is living outside God’s intended will. “You must realize that it is God’s will for you to prosper” (Copeland, Laws of Prosperity, p. 51).<em>- Source: </em><a href=\"http://www.watchman.org/profile/wordpro.htm\"><em>Word-Faith Movement</em></a><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5095\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/picture-device-independent-bitmap-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"9\" height=\"6\" /><em>, “Other Doctrines,” a </em><a href=\"http://www.apologeticsindex.org/w00.html\"><em>Watchman Fellowship</em></a><em> profile</em>\r\nThose that preach a prosperity gospel make some grave errors. First, isn’t it interesting that many of these preachers don’t preach this gospel in the poorest areas of the world, where “financial blessing” it most needed, places like Calcutta India. Secondly, the preachers are selfish and have vein conceit desiring you to send your faith seed (your money) to their ministry, or should I say their bank account? Thirdly, they actually make it harder for people to get into the Kingdom, because the Kingdom of God then comes with a financial price tag, not simply laying one’s life down to follow the Christ.\r\n\r\nIt would follow suit then, that Hollywood celebrities don’t need Jesus, because they are wealthy already. Is that a sign of God’s blessing on Hollywood out of their right relationship with the Father? Fourthly, why are these prosperity preachers most often not using the financial gifts they receive through manipulating people with the Word of God, to help the needy, to reach the unsaved? God can certainly flow finances through a believer, for what end? If anyone should have modeled a wealthy life, if according to the prosperity gospel, shouldn’t it have been Jesus? He was born in a stable not a palace, as he grew up in common Jewish family. Jesus made replied to one desiring to follow Him, “…<strong>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air<em> have</em> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay<em> his</em> head” (Matthew 8:20).</strong> This hardly sounds like the words of a wealthy man. Jesus said, “<strong>From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.</strong>” Where are the prosperity preachers in their personal giving? Recall Peter when He was asked to give alms by a needy person, to which Peter replied, “…<strong>Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have given I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.”</strong> Peter gave the man the biblical gospel and demonstrated it in faith and power! <strong>Proverbs 11:4 states, “Riches profit not in the day of judgment, but righteousness delivers from death</strong>.” If a millionaire dies without the Savior his money will not impress God. Jesus told the rich young ruler to sell all he had to follow Christ. It wasn’t until the prodigal son lost all his money that he was humbled to repent toward God and his father.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity preachers are not preaching the biblical gospel. Recall Simon the Sorcerer wanting to buy the power of the Holy Spirit. Peter said, “<strong>Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money</strong>.” Perhaps you have been financially blessed of God, use it for His Glory and not your own. We are not to “name it and claim it!” He tells me what to do, not the reverse that is why He is Lord!\r\n\r\nHere are some links to further investigate the dangers of the Prosperity Gospel and the preachers associated with this false gospel. Please be wise, let God be the Lord of your heart and finances. Perhaps there is someone that you could financially bless, expecting nothing in return. Our Father has a way of taking care of all of our needs, not our greed To be continued….\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Be watchful…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_Gospel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_Gospel</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.watchman.org/reltop/health$.htm\">http://www.watchman.org/reltop/health$.htm</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.gotquestions.org/prosperity-gospel.html\">http://www.gotquestions.org/prosperity-gospel.html</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.trinityfi.org/press/latimes04.html\">http://www.trinityfi.org/press/latimes04.html</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.apologeticsindex.org/139-prosperity-teaching\">http://www.apologeticsindex.org/139-prosperity-teaching</a>"

              "<strong>Galatians 1:6-7, “6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.” </strong>\r\n\r\nThe Gospel means good news. Paul states that some have moved to another gospel, which is not another. The false gospels, such as the Prosperity Gospel, is a false gospel, therefore it is bad news, because it does not teach the way of salvation through Christ. Let’s examine this next “gospel” in this series, which is perhaps brothers with the prosperity gospel, hence the feel good gospel. The question is asked, “Why not preach that Jesus gives happiness, peace, and joy.” Jesus didn’t initially come to bring us happiness, but rather holiness.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nMy brother in Christ that I look up to very much has done an incredible job with this, so I will defer by sharing brother Ray Comfort’s sound teaching on the happiness, feel good “gospel”.\r\n\r\n“<em>Two men are seated on a plane. The first is given a parachute and told to put it on as it would improve his flight. He’s a little skeptical at first, since he can’t see how wearing a parachute on a plane could possibly improve his flight, he decides to experiment and see if the claims are true. As he puts it on, he notices the weight of it upon his shoulders and he finds he has difficulty in sitting upright. However, he consoles himself with the fact he was told that the parachute would improve his flight. So he decides to give it a little time. As he waits he notices that some of the other passengers are laughing at him for wearing a parachute on a plane. He begins to feel somewhat humiliated. As they continue to point and laugh at him, he can stand it no longer. He slinks in his seat, unstraps the parachute and throws it to the floor. Disillusionment and bitterness fill his heart, because as far as he was concerned he was told an outright lie.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The second man is given a parachute, but listen to what he is told. He’s told to put it onbecause at any moment he’ll be jumping 25,000 feet out of the plane. He gratefully puts the parachute on. He doesn’t notice the weight of it upon his shoulders, nor that he can’t sit upright. His mind is consumed with the thought of what would happen to him if he jumped without the parachute. Let’s now analyze the motive and the result of each passenger’s experience. The first man’s motive for putting the parachute on was solely to improve his flight. The result of his experience was that he was humiliated by the passengers, disillusioned, and somewhat embittered against those who gave him the parachute. As far as he’s concerned, it will be a long time before anyone gets one of those things on his back again. The second man put the parachute on solely to escape the jump to come. And because of his knowledge of what would happen to him if he jumped without it, he has a deep-rooted joy and peace in his heart knowing that he’s saved from sure death. This knowledge gives him the ability to withstand the mockery of the other passengers. His attitude toward those who gave him the parachute is one of heartfelt gratitude.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Now listen to what the modern gospel says: “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ. He’ll give you love, joy, peace, fulfillment, and lasting happiness.” In other words, Jesus will improve your flight. The sinner responds, and in an experimental fashion puts on the Savior to see if the claims are true. And what does he get? The promised temptation, tribulation, and persecution—the other “passengers” mock him. So what does he do? He takes off the Lord Jesus Christ; he’s offended for the Word’s sake; he’s disillusioned and somewhat embittered...and quite rightly so. He was promised peace, joy, love, and fulfillment, and all he got were trials and humiliation. His bitterness is directed at those who gave him the so-called “good news.” His latter end becomes worse than the first, and he’s another inoculated and bitter “backslider.” Instead of preaching that Jesus improves the flight, we should be warning sinners that they have to jump out of a plane. </em><strong><em>That it’s appointed for man to die once and then face judgment (Hebrews 9:27).</em></strong><em> When a sinner understands the horrific consequences of breaking the Law of God, he will flee to the Savior, solely to escape the wrath that’s to come. If we are true and faithful witnesses, that’s what we’ll be preaching—that there is wrath to come—that God “</em><strong><em>commands all men everywhere to repent: because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness” (Acts 17:30,31).</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<em>The issue isn’t one of happiness, but one of righteousness. It doesn’t matter how happy a sinner is, or how much he is enjoying the pleasures of sin for a season, without the righteousness of Christ, he will perish on the day of wrath. </em><strong><em>Proverbs 11:4 says, “Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivers from death</em></strong><em>.”. Peace and joy are legitimate fruits of salvation, but it’s not legitimate to use these fruits as a drawing card for salvation. If we continue to do so, the sinner will respond with an impure motive, lacking repentance.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Can you remember why the second passenger had joy and peace in his heart? It was because he knew that the parachute was going to save him from sure death. In the same way, as believers we have joy and peace in believing because we know that the righteousness of Christ is going to deliver us from the wrath that is to come. With that thought in mind, let’s take a close look at an incident aboard the plane. We have a brand-new flight attendant. It’s her first day. She’s carrying a tray of boiling hot coffee. She wants to leave an impression upon the passengers and she certainly does! As she’s walking down the aisle she trips over someone’s foot and slops the hot coffee all over the lap of our second passenger. What’s his reaction as that boiling liquid hits his tender flesh? Does he go, “Man that hurt!”? Yes, he does. But then does he rip the parachute from his shoulders, throw it to the floor, and say, “The stupid parachute!”? No, why should he? He didn’t put the parachute on for a better flight. He put it on to save him from the jump to come. If anything, the hot coffee incident causes him to cling tighter to the parachute and even look forward to the jump. If we have put on the Lord Jesus Christ for the right motive—to flee from the wrath that’s to come—when tribulation strikes, when the flight gets bumpy, we won’t get angry at God, and we won’t lose our joy and peace. Why should we? We didn’t come to Christ for a better lifestyle, but to flee from the wrath to come. If anything, tribulation drives the true believer closer to the Savior. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>Sadly, we have multitudes of professing Christians who lose their joy and peace when the flight gets bumpy. Why? They are the product of a man-centered gospel. They came lacking repentance, without which they cannot be saved.</em>”\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Galatian 1:6-7, “6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ </strong>\r\n\r\nPaul was marveled at those that decided to jump ship from the real gospel to a false gospel. As I have been going through this series, God has put this series on my heart to convey His heart about false gospels as compared to the only true gospel. <!--more-->\r\nHow does one know that although God is not surprised by yet angry with these other gospels? Recall this occurrence of Jesus in the gospel of John. “<strong>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables”(John 2:15)</strong>. It is clear that God opposes all while God opposes error and sin, He is especially passionate about expressing this opposition when error and sin come into His house and when His children are affected. Another error, false gospel that has become very popular at this time is the gospel of the emergent church. <em>“The Emerging Church movement consists of a diverse group of people who identify with </em><a href=\"http://www.apologeticsindex.org/c110.html\"><em>Christianity</em></a><em>, but who feel that reaching the </em><a href=\"http://www.apologeticsindex.org/p02.html\"><em>postmodern</em></a><em> world requires us to radically reshape the church’s beliefs and practices to conform to postmodernism.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Postmodern rejects the fact that words have meaning which causes them to “deconstruct” the language of texts (including Scripture), redefining the words and reinterpreting the texts to mean whatever they feel as they have an encounter with the text’s language” (Apologetics index). </em>Ravi Zechariahs in his message postmodernism and philosophy brings out a question that was asked on a TV program<em>, “Do words have meaning, or does the speaker reserve the right to fuse his or her own words, with his or her own meaning? Is there a point of reference for language, or does the speaker determine the right to say whatever he or she wants, and mean whatever he or she wants? The program put out a survey to hear from the world on this issue. If words have no meaning how can one see meaning in the question itself? The surveyors responded that words do not have any meaning the speaker reserves the right to fuse in his or her own meaning. A second question asked, does morality have any meaning or does each individual reserve the right to choose his or her own morality? The surveyor respondents to hear from the world at large, morality doesn’t have any absolutes, one reserves the right to create his or her own. The third item was that if Saddam Hussein didn’t stop playing word games over the airwaves, the US was going to start bombing.” </em>\r\n\r\nIf words and morality have no meaning then what does the Christian do with the words of the Scripture, especially those spoken in the gospels by Jesus Christ, who used words to convey meaning about our bankruptcy of morality and our need for God’s forgiveness? We are born dead in our sin and transgression and then proceed as we grow older to break God’s moral Law (the Ten Commandments). The emergent church gospel does not subscribe to words having absolute meaning nor absolute truth. Also there is no moral absolute because a Christian can then assume moral superiority over a non-Christian. Furthermore, they do not seek to save the lost like Jesus did, because they use modern methods of evangelism, also known as “friendship evangelism”. Satan is not creative but rather deceptive. A faithful brother in Christ of mine named Ivan shared with me, Satan will use our need for sleep and try to lead us to be lazy, he will use our design for work and try to cause us to become “workaholics”. The emergent gospel has its roots in Satan back in the Garden of Eden when the serpent said to Eve, “<strong>1 Did God really say, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?” 2 And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; 3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’”4Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. 5 For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil (Gen 3:1-4).”</strong> Did God really say? If the emergent gospel can redefine things, then humanity can play God and redefine both good and evil.\r\n\r\nThe emergent gospel wants everyone to be accepted and for everyone to feel good about oneself. So then Jesus makes a statement such as in <strong>Luke 14, </strong>“<strong>26 If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. 27 And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple</strong>,” this is extremely exclusive, it excludes some people who fail to do what Jesus is commanding as a prerequisite.\r\n\r\nThe emergent gospel really wants Christ-less Christianity. Brian McLaren, one of the emergent gospels leaders said, <strong><em>“Good evangelism</em></strong><em> is the process of being friendly without discrimination and influencing all of one’s friends toward better living, through good deeds and good conversations…Christian commitment is where I’m coming from…This is not to say that there isn’t a place for Buddhist or Jewish evangelism, but someone else will be better suited to write on these topics</em>.” Compare this to the beginning of Jesus’ ministry, <strong>“From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Perhaps the following dialog will put the unbalanced, “friendship evangelism,” which perhaps many of you subscribe to in its true light:</strong>”\r\n\r\n<strong>Preacher’s Progress (by ray Comfort)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “Hi, Mrs. Smith. How are you doing? Is Erik in yet?”\r\n<strong>Mrs. Smith:</strong> “Lunch again, huh? I haven’t seen him come through the lobby today. He came into work last week with a bad hangover. Probably the same thing has happened today. How was church?”\r\n<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “It was really good. We had Brother Don Waterdowns come in and do a series of healing meetings. Hundreds gave their hearts to the Lord. I’m in charge of the follow-up program. Man, I didn’t realize how easy it is to get people saved. Lots were getting healed and people were coming to the altar without even being preached to.”\r\n<strong>Mrs. Smith:</strong> “What a blessing. We had him at our church too. He advocates ‘friendship evangelism,’ doesn’t he?”\r\n<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “Yes. I like that. It’s what I’ve been using on Erik. We’ve become good buddies over the years.”\r\n<strong>Mrs. Smith:</strong> “I like that approach. It’s so much better than shoving the gospel down people’s throats.”\r\n<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “True. That can alienate them. I’m waiting for the right time to mention the things of God to Erik; I don’t want to make him feel uncomfortable. Erik came to one of the meetings, and he really seemed to enjoy it. That’s the good thing about non-confrontational evangelism. He didn’t give his heart to the Lord, though. Maybe today he will bring up the subject. I never do, because I don’t want to offend him. I’m just a good friend, and I think that’s the right approach.”\r\n<strong>Mrs. Smith:</strong> “I agree. I’ll call the Third Floor and speak to his secretary. Perhaps she will know why he’s late.”\r\n<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “Okay.”\r\n<strong>Mrs. Smith: </strong>“Jeannie, Rose Smith. Is Erik Tuday in yet? Christian Loveless is here to see...”\r\n<strong>Christian Loveless:</strong> “What’s wrong? Your face has gone pale!”\r\n<strong>Mrs. Smith:</strong> “I’m afraid Erik died during the night. He had an aneurysm in his sleep and was pronounced dead at 8:17 this morning...”"

              "<strong>Galatian 1:8, “But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed”</strong>\n\n“<em>Friendship Evangelism that doesn’t seek a way to quickly tell people about their eternal fate is the ultimate betrayal of trust. How can we call ourselves a friend of someone we don’t bother to warn of terrible danger? Friends don’t let friends go to hell”, </em>(Ray comfort)<!--more-->\n\nI realize that these messages are longer than usual. It has been a challenge both in the study, because the topic is so vast, and a challenge communicating effectively to you, those we deeply care about. May you stay aware of the dangerous, false gospels being preached, and hold fast to the Gospel According to Jesus Christ (see Bible for complete text). For further study on the emergent church please check out, <a href=\"http://www.apologeticsindex.org/\">www.apologeticsindex.org</a> and click on the right side bar, emergent church. Today we will look at the Mormon Gospel.\n\nIn Paul’s defense of the true gospel he does not fail to mention that “<strong>an angel from heaven</strong>” may come and preach to you another gospel. In Paul’s day the Mormon belief systems did not exist at the time. However it certainly is preaching its false gospel today. Perhaps you have Mormon friends, or have been approached by Mormons. We should not run away from them, but rather give them the Biblical gospel, their lives depend on it.\n\nIn 1823, the angel Moroni allegedly visits a man named Joseph Smith in his bedroom three times one September night. These visits are the start of a series of lessons that results in Joseph’s getting gold plates that were allegedly buried in Hill Cumorah, just a few miles south of Palmyra, in Manchester, New York. In 1827, Joseph allegedly receives from the angel Moroni the gold plates that were buried in Hill Cumorah. Written on them in “Reformed Egyptian” is the history of a previously unknown New World people. With the help of God Joseph translates the writing into what is now the Book of Mormon. What the book of Mormon teaches is that <strong>Salvation,</strong> a word that Mormons qualify in one of three ways: <em>unconditional </em>or <em>general</em> salvation is simply resurrection from the dead, granted to all through Christ’s atonement; <em>conditional</em> or <em>individual</em> salvation involves entering the celestial kingdom through works of Mormonism; <em>full</em> salvation means exaltation to become a God as a result of temple ceremonies and other works (Farkas, J. R., &amp; Reed, D., A. (1997, c1995). <em>Mormonism: Changes, contradictions, and errors</em> (electronic ed.). An angel of God would not contradict the Word of God, and we certainly cannot become a god ourselves, that is idolatry!\n\nMormonism is a self – righteous system that can earn their own salvation through good works. If one could earn salvation then who needs Jesus Christ to die for the sin of the world. <strong>John 3:16, 1 Peter 3:18,</strong> and numerous other verses of Scripture make this plane. “<strong>For by grace you have been saved ﻿through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of ﻿﻿works, lest anyone should ﻿﻿boast”,</strong> (<strong>Ephesians 2:8, 9</strong>).”\nRemember that Satan masquerades as an “<strong>angel of light</strong>” <strong>(2 Cor. 11:14).</strong> There is only one God, not many, as the Mormons propose, <strong>(Isaiah 43:10 – 11; 44:6, 45: 5 – 6, 21 – 22)</strong> all other “gods” are idols (<strong>1 Cor. 16:26, Exodus 30:3, 23</strong>). The God of the Bible created the entire universe (<strong>Gen 1:16; Psa. 8:3; Jer. 31:35</strong>). Jehovah (translated as “LORD” in all caps) and Elohim (translated as “God”) are the same being (<strong>Duet 4:35; 1 Kings 8:60; Psalm 100:2</strong>). Jesus and Satan are not brothers, as put forth in Mormonism. Jesus is surely the only way to Heaven. “<strong>Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved</strong>.”\nMay you help Mormons find their way to the truth lest they end up in Hell for all eternity!\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Jude 1:4, \"For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThere’s a famous Greek story about the conquering of the city of Troy. The story goes that Greeks laid siege to the city of Troy for over ten years, and in that time, were unable to capture it. Finally, a man by the name of Ulysses decided to have a large wooden horse built and left outside the city walls as a gift to the unconquerable Trojans. The Greeks then sailed away in apparent defeat. The curious and proud Trojans felt confident enough to drag the horse inside their walls.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThat night Greek soldiers crept out of the horse and opened the city gates from within, allowing Greek forces into Troy. The Greeks then massacred the population of Troy, looted the city, and burned it. Throughout history the “Trojan Horse” has been a symbol of infiltration and deception.\r\n\r\nThere's a movement spreading through the church today that I believe to be a \"trojan horse.\" It’s referred to as the “Health and Wealth, Name it and Claim it or Prosperity Gospel.” This movement isn’t new. It is however, extremely popular. A majority of what is being broadcast on Christian television is consistent with “Word of Faith” theology. Christian bookstores prominently display books that are written by people who leaders in this movement.\r\n\r\nHere’s a few statistics that show the extent of this movements reach: 46% of self proclaimed Christians agree with the idea that God will grant material riches to all believers who have enough faith. 90% of Pentecostals in Nigeria, South Africa, India and the Philippines believe that: :“<em>God will grant material prosperity to all believers who have enough faith.”</em> Nearly half of American Christians in any denomination, and roughly ⅔ of American Pentecostals now embrace the basic premise of the Prosperity Gospel that: “<em>God wants you to be happy, healthy, and rich</em>.” Although names like the “Health and Wealth, Name it and Claim it, and Prosperity Gospel” accurately describe some of “Word of Faith” teaching, they only begin to tell the whole story.\r\n\r\nWOF preachers teach that we can speak things into existence. That our tongue actually has power to bring about life or death. They would reference <strong>Proverbs 18:2</strong>1 which says that “<strong>death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those that love it will eat its fruit.</strong>” So is that true? Do I have that kind of power with my words to bring about death? Well, not in the way that they would lead you to believe. This verse is talking about someone who gossips and the inevitable consequences that will ensue. It is in no way telling us that we have the ability to create life or death in a literal sense.\r\n\r\nThere is so much to share in the next posting, keep reading, blessings Matt"

              "<strong>Jude 1:4, \"For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAnother Word of Faith doctrine is faith being an actual substance or a force that we can direct at God. For this, they would appeal to <strong>Hebrews 11:1</strong> which says “ <strong>now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</strong>” From looking at this verse you would think they’re right, but if you look at the word “substance,” which in the greek is “hypostasis,” you’ll see that a more accurate translation in today’s speech, is the word “assurance.” <!--more-->In most other translations, other than the KJV, the word assurance or confidence is used in place of substance. This is because the King James translation is about 400 years old and language has evolved since then. WOF teachers hold that we can use this substance, or specifically, faith filled words and direct it at God, which causes Him to act. They insist that just as God created with His words, so can we.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, Word of Faith preachers have a distorted view of the person and work of Jesus Christ, and His atonement for our sins. There are some, like Kenneth Copeland, that say that Jesus wasn’t God, he grew into his Godhood. Others claim, like Paula White, say that Jesus isn’t the only begotten Son of God, only the first of many. E.W Kenyon, who is known as the Grandfather of the WOF movement, claimed that Jesus’s death on the cross didn’t atone for our sins, but there was a “Spiritual Death” that occurred, which served as our atonement. This is taught by many in the WOF movement, including Joyce Meyers, and is a complete contradiction of the Word of God. <strong>1Peter 3:18</strong> says “ <strong>For Christ also died for sins ONCE and for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are some that feel that questioning the doctrinal accuracy of certain teachings is divisive. That we should all just get along and not test popular teachings against the bible. In response to this kind of criticism, the late Dave Hunt said this “<em>Biblical unity is not something we establish by making an agreement not to disagree with each other. We are to KEEP the unity that has already been established by God the Holy Spirit, of whom Christ said, ‘When He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.’ Christians are united in Christ not by some joint effort they put forth but by the Holy Spirit, who indwells each member of His body, and by the truth that each member embraces. Such unity is not MAINTAINED but BROKEN by compromise\"</em>\r\n\r\nIn the book of Galatians, there’s a confrontation that takes place between the Apostle Paul and the Apostle Peter. What led to that was that prior to certain men coming to Antioch, who were members of the “Party of the Circumcision\", Peter used to eat with the Gentiles. But once these men arrived, he began to separate himself from the Gentiles. You see, he was reverting back to Jewish customs, and in doing so, he was causing other men to do the same, including Barnabas. That in itself doesn’t seem like something that would be cause for Paul to “<strong>oppose Peter to his face</strong>,” but when you look at verse 14 it becomes more clear as to why he did. It says in <strong>Galatians 2:14, “when I (Paul) saw that they were not straightforward about the TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL, I said to Cephas (Peter) in the presence of all, ‘If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”</strong> Paul opposed him in such a way because they weren’t being straightforward about the TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL. Paul knew that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Jesus Christ. He was compelled to stand up for the TRUTH much like Jude is urging us to do in his epistle.\r\n\r\nTo finish, blessing Matt"

              "<strong>Jude 1:4, \"For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nJude appeals to us in <strong>chapter 1:3 </strong>to “<strong>contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.</strong>” I think it’s important to really understand what’s being said here. The word contend in the original Greek literally means to struggle for, or fight. And the faith he’s talking about isn’t a spiritual commodity. <!--more-->He’s not telling us to struggle for our faith in God. The faith he’s talking about is the culmination of all that we believe. It’s the same faith of <strong>1Timothy 6:12 </strong>where Paul tells Timothy to “ <strong>fight the good fight of THE FAITH.”</strong>\r\n\r\nJude tells us that this FAITH was delivered to us once for all. How was this faith delivered? It was delivered to us in the Bible. To sum it all up, he’s telling us to contend or struggle or fight for the preservation of the TRUTH, for God’s WORD.\r\n\r\nAnd who are we fighting? <strong>2Timothy 4:3</strong> says “<strong>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires; and will turn away their ears from the truth, and will turn aside to myths.</strong>” Dave Wilkerson said this: “<em>There is an evil wind blowing into God’s house, deceiving multitudes of God’s chosen people. This perverted gospel seeks to make gods of people. They are told, ‘Your destiny is in the power of your mind. Whatever you can conceive is yours. Speak it into being. Create it by a positive mind set. Success, happiness, perfect health is all yours. If you will only use your mind creatively. Turn your dreams into reality by using mind power.’ Let it be known once and for all, God will not abdicate His lordship to the power of our minds, negative or positive. We are to seek only the mind of Christ, and His mind is not materialistic; it is not focused on success or wealth. Christ’s mind is focused only on the glory of God and obedience to His Word. No other teaching so ignores the Cross and the corruption of the human mind. It bypasses the evil of our ruined Adam nature, and it takes the Christian’s eye off Christ’s gospel of eternal redemption and focuses it on earthly gain. Saints of God, flee from this!”</em>\r\n\r\nThe men and women who are teachers in the “Word of Faith” movement, are not being straightforward about THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL. Their doctrine is in direct opposition to the TRUTH, and it’s causing many believers to be led astray.\r\n\r\nThere is much more to Word of Faith doctrine that I haven’t touched on. I also haven’t elaborated fully on the topics that I did mention. I will go through each topic in the future, one by one, to bring to light the many falsehoods being portrayed as biblical truth. I can’t stress enough the enormous reach that this movement has. <strong>2Timothy 2:15, \"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\" </strong>Blessing, Matt"

              "<strong>Romans 12:2, \"do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6173\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nI struggle at times to know whether I am being led by my will or the will of God. Today I will share on some principles from a verse you have heard or read many times.\r\n\r\nFirst I pick two words \"CONFORMED\" and \"TRANSFORMED” from the verse. The bible says, \"<strong>do not be conformed to this world</strong>\". <!--more-->Conformed is to act or be in accord or be in agreement with something, in this case the world. How will you know the will of God when the world sets up your standard? What you respond to the most will dictate where your life will lead. If you are conformed to the world, you do things and become like the world. For example dating the unsaved, whoever you are dating at one point will pull you to his or her side and you will agree with things that you had purposed never to do. You have moral standards, they may not have or if they do, they could create their own. <strong>2Corinthians 6:17, \"Therefore \"Come out from among them And be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, And I will receive you.\"; 2Corinthians 6:14, \"Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?\"; Psalm 1:1, \"Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly...\" </strong>No need to pray for a situation like this to see if it's God's will for your life. He has already given us guidelines of knowing His will in the area of relationships and marriage. You are canceling the will of God in your life by being yoked to the unbeliever. By the way, this is for our own good.\r\n\r\nTRANSFORMED is to change the nature, function or condition in other words convert. Why not use the word improve instead? The reason is this, the things of the world in someone’s life are not worth improving. They need transformation, not with what it has but by something or someone foreign to it, <strong>2Corinthians 5:17, \"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new</strong>\". When we come to Christ, our old nature is not improved but changed, made new <strong>Jeremiah 18:4, \"...he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make\". </strong> The potter did not improve the existing vessel, He took the same broken material conformed to this world and transformed it into another vessel<strong>. </strong>\r\n\r\nWho will make a vessel if He has nothing to put in it, unless He makes it because He wants to pour <strong>HIS WILL </strong>in it, <strong>Luke 5:37, \"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined\". </strong>Because we are made new, we have new desires, new dreams, new ambitions, our old selfish things are gone because we are transformed. One of God's will for our lives is to be transformed by the renewing of our minds. Why our mind? <strong>Romans 8:7; \"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God; nor indeed can be\"; Colossians 1:21, \"And you; who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works; yet now He has reconciled\"</strong>. The mind is the stumbling block we have to overcome, it fights the will of God. To finish. Blessings Ev, God's servant"

              "<strong>Romans 12:2, \"do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6175\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nWe looked at \"conformed\" and \"transformed\", two key things to lead us to know the will of God. In this session let's look at the last part of vs. 2, \"…<strong>that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God\". </strong>From the beginning of this verse, I see a wide angle and the more you read and study it word by word, the more you can see how it's being condensed to a common denominator \"...<strong>perfect will of God</strong>\".\r\n\r\nWhile I was in school in my math class, I was taught about the common denominator which means a quantity into which all the denominators of a set of fractions may be divided without a remainder. <!--more-->A commonly shared theme, a place where it ends, its final destination. Let's break it into phrases <strong>\"...that you may prove</strong>\". To prove, you have to establish truth and determine the quality by testing. The bible says<strong> 2Corinthians 13:5, \"Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. ...unless indeed you are disqualified\"</strong>. This is the greatest test of all, seeing if you are in the faith (saved), then in <strong>1Thessalonians 5:21,\"Test all things; hold fast what is good</strong>\". <strong>1John 4:1, \"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; ...</strong>\". It all comes back to, are you in the faith and what does the Word of God have to say about a situation.\r\n\r\nNext to tackle <strong>\"...what is good and acceptable</strong>\". Something can be good but it may not be good for you for a number of reasons. It could destroy you by making yo forget God, pride, selfishness to mention a few. For example riches are good, God is the author of it but it's not good for some people. Solomon said, \"<strong>Do not give me riches lest I forget you</strong>\"(paraphrased). Your character has to be enlarged if God is going to bring it your way. A number cannot be trusted with more good things because they have not utilized what God gave them before. In other words, they cannot be trusted with more. You can see this being narrowed down, it has to be approved according to His Word, it has to be good and acceptable just for you, now let's look at the last part <strong>\"...and perfect will of God\". </strong>I believe that when we are not conformed but transformed and we have approved what is good and acceptable, we will have no problem knowing the perfect will of God in our lives in most situations. The reason being, when we have narrowed it down, all we are left with is to see one way out, God's way of bringing victory through His will.\r\n\r\n\"…<strong>Thy will be done</strong>\" is our common denominator, all we need are things that get us ready to know His will and then yield to His will. If your will is in conflict with His will, you abandon your will and you submit to His. May He teach us how to be in His will. I am still learning, how about you? Be blessed Evans, God's servant"

              "<strong>Matthew 6:33, \"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you\".</strong>\r\n\r\nLooking around, I see so many trees standing, an indication they are alive and growing. Big, tall, thin, young trees are everywhere. Some do bear sweet fruits and some don't. Many have pleasant looking leaves making them look attractive and yet some don’t. I also see that some do provide shade in hot and sunny seasons. We appreciate trees for many reasons because of the results, what they have turned out to be, but the question is, <strong>where does their strength lie?</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nEvery believer has to know where his or her strength lies. Others things will fall in place when the introduction to this is correct. In as much as everyone appreciates the trees, the strength of those trees lies in their roots. I believe that for a believer to be strong, he or she has to have roots grounded somewhere. When we look at the trees, we don't see the roots but we see the result of what the roots are doing. The deeper the roots, the healthier and stronger the trees can be.\r\n\r\nPrayers is one of the biggest and strongest roots a believer can have as part his or her life. <strong>The destination of the tree depends on the introduction of the roots</strong>. If the roots are shallow, most likely when it rains heavily, that tree will be washed away. If it's also shallow, the wind will blow it away. The only way that trees can stand and look good is by allowing it to be planted in the right soil, the roots going deeper and deeper seeking and searching for food that will sustain it. In my life I found out that my prayer life is my roots, very important. I am what I am because of my prayer life. The more I was shallow in prayers, the more I could not stand for long however the more I prayed, the more my roots went deeper and the more I became stronger as I sought the Lord.\r\n\r\nPeople appreciate the outcome, but they don’t understand that my strength is not on what they see but on the roots they don't see. To grow in righteousness, I have to sink my roots deeper in prayers and God’s word, the same in reaching the lost, being a good husband, good worker etc. <strong>Psalm 1:1-3, “1 Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful; 2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night. 3 He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper</strong>.”\r\n\r\nWhen we pray, we don't pray to be seen, it’s done in secret, the results is what everyone sees. You want to be blessed, stay strong, grow?, the secret is being willing to do whatever it takes to dig your roots deeper. It’s easy to ask someone to help you out by praying for you, or even encourage you, I believe the greatest way you can be a victor is by going to the Lord yourself. Let someone come and add to what you already have. The woman with the issue of blood sought the Lord, her strength was in her faith in God and her move, and so was the blind man who cried out to the Lord while everyone tried to silence him. He knew his moment, his strength was in his faith in God and voice. <strong>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness (develop your roots) and all these things shall be added unto you (You will blossom in the natural). Where does your strength lie? Blessings, Ev</strong>"

              "<strong>Hebrews 11:4, “By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks”.</strong>\r\n\r\nWe constantly meet people who refer to themselves as spiritual or religious. Most serve a god in their making, a god they are more comfortable with instead of serving the Living God. People try to offer their very best to God, question is, is it ever good enough.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Genesis 4,</strong> brothers, Cain and Abel one time brought sacrifices before God, <strong>Genesis 4: 3-4, “3 And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord. 4 Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord respected Abel and his offering”. </strong>They both brought what they felt was acceptable to God. If “<strong>Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God”, Romans 10:17, </strong>they must have known what the Lord required of them. We see Cain bringing fruit of the ground. Now the ground was cursed in <strong>Genesis 3</strong> and here he is trying to make something for himself, in his own effort, and he brings it to the Lord (works). On the other hand, Abel offers to God “<strong>the firstborn of his flock and of their fat</strong>”. He is offering to God what is from God, a lamb. God honored his sacrifice. <strong>Hebrews 11:4</strong> gives us the reason God honored his sacrifice, he offered it by faith. His sacrifice by faith was counted to him as righteousness.\r\n\r\nIt’s the saving faith that honors God, receiving from us what is from Him. What can we offer God on our own that is good enough? nothing. Hasn’t the bible said already in <strong>Romans 3:20, “Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight</strong>”. That in as much as we offer to God the offering from the ground, something we have worked, what we are comfortable with, our accomplishments, it’s never good enough. God requires a perfect sacrifice. To offer a sacrifice from the fruit of the ground is not to offer a perfect excellent sacrifice. We all fall short. We need to offer to God a perfect sacrifice and He is the only One who can give that perfect sacrifice. And He did, He gave His Only begotten Son to suffer and die for our sins. And by repentance and faith, we can offer to God Christ (the firstborn (position), first fruit) who offered Himself as the Lamb, the blood sacrifice to save us. <strong>Revelation 1:4-6, “4 …Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, 5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, 6 and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen”. He is the more excellent sacrifice.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Galatians 3:11, “But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for “the just shall live by faith</strong>.” a different bible version puts it this way, <strong>“he who is righteous by faith shall live</strong>.” God demands His requirements be met in His way. Ritual in itself never satisfies God and is an abomination to Him. If you are trying to get saved by good works “fruit of the ground”, then you’ve disqualified yourself like Cain. <strong>What God has commanded in the law (ten commandments), He has provided in the gospel of His Son Jesus</strong> and for you and I to satisfy the demands of the law, we have to abandon our sins, turn away from them and receive Christ as the Lamb of God to wash away our sins.\r\n\r\nHave you repented of your sins?, are you counting on your “fruit of the ground” to save you?, what you are counting on may be the very thing that will condemn you. “<strong>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks”, Hebrews 11:4, Blessings Ev</strong>"

              "<strong>Deuteronomy 1:6-7, “6 The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: ‘You have dwelt long enough at this mountain. 7 Turn and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring places in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Israelites had left Egypt under the leadership of Moses by the hand of God. They journeyed to Mount Sinai, a place where they would worship the Lord and be ready to continue with their journey to the Promised Land. <strong>Exodus 19:1 says “In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai”. </strong>Mark how long it took them to get there, about 3 months and how long it took them to stay there, 40 years, <strong>Deuteronomy 1:3, \"Now it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him as commandments to them”</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nFrom a land of bondage, a land of less than enough, a land of hard labor, the Israelites were by this mountain cared for, protected, and provided for. They became comfortable, way too comfortable. Of course they were to be there for a season, they had not arrived to their destination. They had come from a land where the Lord fought for them; the time had come where the Lord would fight with them and through them. This is where they became paralyzed. Where they were going was going to require total trust and confidence in God, to which they were not ready for. So they sat by this mountain year after year and that’s when “<strong>The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: ‘You have dwelt long enough at this mountain</strong>”<strong>, Deuteronomy 1:6. </strong>Are we anyway different? There are people who have been in one place forever; the same prayers they prayed 5-10 years ago are the same today, they became used to being out of Egypt but done progressing to God’s promise land because they fear battles ahead to make it there. If you were to evaluate your spiritual life, would you discover you are stagnant, no challenges, no desire to move forward? Satisfied right where you are, complaisant, lukewarm, and not allowing the Lord to use you? only depending on Sunday morning church to keep your spiritual life alive? If you are experiencing any of these, you are no different from Israelites who dwelt by the mountain long enough, stagnant.\r\n\r\nSinai dwelling was supposed to be temporary; they made it a permanent dwelling. You and I need to have something big before us that serve as a challenge otherwise we too will stop moving with the Lord. I’m glad to be out of Egypt but I’m not bound to die by the mountain when God has revealed that there is more. We ought to turn to the One who is more than able, who has made us more than conquerors and we take Him at His word and vs<strong>. “7 Turn and take your (our) journey, and go to the mountains of (whatever your mountain is)</strong>. The following verse, tells us we are not there yet, <strong>1Corinthians 2:9,” But as it is written: “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.” </strong>Imagine the time they wasted and the time we too have wasted not obeying His voice due to fear of the battle a head of us. We have battles to fight, mountains to climb, valleys to go through, all these serves as challenges. They bring more glory to His name, something we all want. Examine yourself, where are you stagnant by a certain mountain for too long. Rise and move. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1 Kings 19:3-5, “3 Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.” 5 Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.” </strong>\r\n\r\nThe following is a message that I was deeply inspired by from Charles Swindoll’s book Elijah, about the time in Elijah’s life when he went from victory to depression. Here are some great truths for us to learn:<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Firstly, Elijah was not thinking realistically or clearly.</strong> Who made the threat? It was Jezebel not God that came against Elijah. How was Elijah able to so boldly challenge 450 prophets of Baal, but yet this one woman caused him to feel so threatened and vulnerable to his core? Often it’s the little things that we make bigger than God in our eyes that seem to threaten all that we hold dear, and all that we identify with.\r\n\r\n<strong>Secondly, Elijah separated himself from strengthening relationships.</strong> Why did he get alone? Often when one is depressed one tends to retreat to be by oneself, instead of connecting as one should, often one will disconnect at the time he or she so desperately needs others. However when this happens others are pushed away and whatever encouragement others try to give, it is appreciated but not received or heard as much as it is needed. One looks inward and refuses for a time to look outward.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thirdly, Elijah was caught in the backwash of a great victory</strong>. Often after a victory, often comes temptation and vulnerability. Elijah previously battled against and proved that God NOT Baal is the true God that manifested Himself by answering by fire.\r\n\r\n<strong>Fourthly, Elijah was physically exhausted and emotionally spent</strong>. When we are in this state, our spirit is affected. We tend to drag, become sluggish, tired, weary in well doing, etc….\r\n\r\n<strong>Fifthly, Elijah got lost in self-pity. </strong>Have you ever had the “victim mentality,” whereby you blamed the world, “the system,” and everyone and everything else for your unhappiness? The blame game has been played since Adam blamed Eve when he was questioned by God. When we are in self pity, as far as we are concerned we are the only one with problems, and they are larger than life, even greater than the Lord. God will not allow us to stay in self – pity if we are following Him, because He has too much for us to do, and to come to glorify His name in victory, and not in defeat.\r\n\r\n<strong>God’s ministered to Elijah</strong>. God allowed Elijah a time of rest and refreshment. God communicated wisely with Elijah (v.9), and gave Elijah a close personal friend (v.19-21) <em>ELISHA.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Elijah reminds us</strong>. <strong><em>Let’s look up</em></strong>after the Lord graciously delivers us from our depression. <strong><em>Let’s look up</em></strong> when he allow us rest and refreshment following an exhausting schedule that has taken its toll on us. <strong><em>Let’s look up</em></strong> and thank Him when He gently and patiently speaks to us from his Word after we’ve climbed out of a pit of self-pity. <strong><em>Let’s look up</em></strong>and praise Him when He faithfully proved the companionship and affirmation of a friend who understands and encourages us. <strong><em>Let’s look up</em></strong> and acknowledge the Giver more than the gift.\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Hebrews 13:3, \"Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering\".</strong>\r\n\r\nA while back my wife and I attended the Voice of the Martyrs Missions Conference in Oklahoma. This gathering was filled with our precious family members, many that have been imprisoned, beaten, tortured, and almost killed for Christ. Many of us have probably never met a brother or sister in Christ that has been through real persecution in this day and age<em>. \"It didn’t end at the Coliseum, Christians still die</em>\"<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>1Corinthians 12</strong> speaks about the body of Christ, being of one body but many parts all operating by the same Spirit. God designed each member of His body to fulfill their purpose in which they have been designed for. <strong>1Corinthians 12:26</strong> states, If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. Picture if you broke your foot, lost an eye, or went deaf. Would your whole body not be affected by it? As our brothers and sisters around the globe are being beaten for faith in Christ do we as the Body “feel it?” Many don’t know, or care, and some don’t care to know about Christian persecution.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are part of the body, even now your heart will ache for these dear family members. Go to www. Persecution.com and be exposed to the reality of Christian suffering. Now this is not shared with you to give you a morbid day, but rather to expose you to the reality of your family that is suffering. We don’t experience much of this in the U.S. but this is not so in China, Iran, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq etc.\r\n\r\nTo remember them that are in bonds is more the cognitive recollection. Rather remembering is an active love toward those in the bonds. This may take in prayer, financial support, letters written to them, or visiting them yourselves. Whatever you can do at a practical level, please feel their pain. We are called to not only remember them as if we were in prison with them, but as if we ourselves were suffering. If you were the one in jail, if you were the one suffering would you not desire your brothers and sisters to love you and support you? Our family needs us desperately.\r\n\r\nRead <strong>Hebrews 11:36-38</strong>. The world may not be worthy of them, but they are worthy to Jesus, and worthy to us. They counted not their lives unto death. (<strong>Revelation 12:11</strong>)\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\nPastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Isaiah 6:1-9, \"In the year king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAt the introduction of the book of Isaiah chapter 6 shows us the preparation of Isaiah’s life to respond to the call God had for him. \"<strong>In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord</strong>\", I am yet to study who king Uzziah was. Let me for now say by looking at the scripture that he looks like a king who blocked men like Isaiah from seeing God as He is. Can’t tell how he might have done it. I believe Isaiah was raised under his leadership and he must have looked up to him. Through that, Isaiah may have had self-righteousness in that compared to his people he talks about in the earlier chapters. He had not had a revelation from above to the true holiness of God, therefore as the bible puts it in <strong>Romans 10:3, \"For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God</strong>\". Any time you can think to yourself that, \"<strong>I'm a little bit better</strong>\" will be a sign of establishing your own righteousness.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf you have someone or something blocking your view of the true thing, it's easy to get satisfied by what is there. Why would I want to progress in my spiritual walk if I feel I have arrived? I am going to heaven, sounds good. I feel a little bit better compared to those who have not received Him. I give to the Lord, I make it to church, what more could the Lord require of me? I used to feel this way, I was comfortable being saved and going to heaven that I did not want to do anything else besides that. Just when you feel comfortable, God will disrupt your life causing you to see something extraordinary. Something that has been clouding your way has to die and be removed. Remember there are two kingdoms here, King Uzziah's and King Jesus'. As king Uzziah faded from the picture, Isaiah began to encounter with the God of holiness. <strong>Isaiah 6:1, \"...I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple</strong>\". <strong>I believe that you can never see who you really are until you see who He really is</strong>. Seeing who He really is exposes you to who you really are in His light. As long as king Uzziah was alive, Isaiah had no understanding of who God was (is) because king Uzziah’s living clouded his eyes to see Who He was(is). Isaiah in this case first saw Him sitting on the throne, <strong>HE is the King</strong>. High and Lifted up, <strong>Worshipped</strong>; train of His robe filled the temple, <strong>covering everything exposed</strong>. <strong>vs. 2, \"Above it stood seraphim; each with six wings: with two he covered his face, with two covered his feet, and with two he flew</strong>\". If Seraphim is a heavenly being, a type of an angel, he must be holier than us. Bowing before God, covering his face, everything that Isaiah may have known about holiness was shattered at that moment. And the angels cried one to another, <strong>\"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory\"</strong>. Of all the things that describe the nature of God, none has been repeated more than once as the word \"holy\". You don't hear, faithful, faithful, faithful but \"Holy\" always mentioned three times perhaps referring to each member of the Trinity.\r\n\r\nHoliness is what God requires of us, <strong>1Peter 1:16 \"Be holy for I am holy …</strong>\". The holiness is not based on men's standard but God's. The holiness of God humbles me to the fact that I’m undone. Not only did Isaiah see the holiness of God, he also saw that he had not worshipped the God of holiness. I am always reminded by God that I am not there yet even though He has used me mightily. I am grateful to be reminded to keep pursuing more and more. So Isaiah's standard of holiness had been disrupted, what will he do about it?.\r\n\r\nHis response,<strong> Isaiah 6:5, \"So I said, \"woe is me for I am undone!..\". </strong> As Isaiah, we are not complete yet, whether God has used us mightily or not, we are not there yet. Why drift back when you haven't reached yet? why relax and be comfortable because you established your own righteousness by looking at someone's life? Pray that God will let all the king Uzziah's in your life die that you may see Him as He is and in turn open your eyes to see yourself in His true light, and confess like Isaiah did. Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>Isaiah 6:1-9, \"In the year king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord...\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 5, \"So I said: Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts\"</strong>. As we said in part 1, you will never see who you really are until you see who He really is. His holiness raises a standard for us and not men. I know that when God is bringing you to a place where He can reveal to you who you really are, He will bring you to a place where it's one on one. He did the same with Jacob, Moses, Abraham, Mary the mother of Jesus to mention a few. Over and over again I see the Lord eliminating everything that is distracting and letting you be in a place where you concentrate on what He is showing you.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nGod revealed Himself to Isaiah not in front of everyone. And Isaiah's words were, \"<strong>woe is me, for I am undone</strong>\", in other words \"<strong>distressed is me for I am incomplete</strong>\", It wasn't \"<strong>woe they are not complete</strong>\" neither was it \"<strong>woe we are not complete</strong>\", he personalized it. “<em>It's me who needs work, it's me still under construction</em>”. I wish I could wear a sign on my back saying, \"<strong>Be patient with me, I'm still under construction</strong>\". Why I'm I man of unclean lips? what has been harbored inside is manifested through the mouth and actions. If I had thought that everyone else was not good enough, eventually that will be manifested outside through my mouth. To make it even interesting, Isaiah also realizes that there are people who have been like him, proclaiming self-righteousness and have been ignorant of it. He has a new vision of who he is and who God is but how about the rest? He had seen the King to know that He was not where he needed to be. Here is something that turns many people away when they come to God, they think God will just take over from where they left. God first shows you how far you’ve missed the mark, strips you of self-righteousness and when your mouth is stopped, then He cleanses you, takes all the guilt and shame away and <strong>Romans 8:1</strong> becomes your pillar, <strong>\"There is therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the seraphim flew with live coal and touched his mouth saying, <strong>vs. 7, \"...Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away and your sin is purged</strong>\", if I am under construction, I need all the help I can get. My sins taken away, my joy restored, my peace upgraded because I still have a journey to make, a race to run, a mountain to climb, a valley to pass through, battles to fight. If we are not complete yet, then we are not there yet. Of all we have talked about revolves around a man under construction.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 8, \"Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: \"Whom shall I send and who will go for Us?\", then I said, \"Here am I! send me\". </strong>Here is the work of the saints, not to sit and enjoy but be ready to be sent out. The working in him propelled him to see that the people he was living among were deceiving themselves just as he was thinking they were fine while they were not. <strong>1John 1:8, \"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us</strong>\", how many deceive themselves everyday thinking that their life style is okay? How many establish their own righteousness being ignorant of the righteousness of God? who will point them to the truth? Isaiah did not want to receive a revelation, be changed and be comfortable. What he saw rocked his world that when the Lord was looking for someone to send, he responded to the call.\r\n\r\nIsaiah carried a message of both hope and judgment. He described and predicted the coming of the Messiah: Jesus Christ. We too are carrying a message of hope and judgment and proclaiming the second coming of the Lord. Have you responded to His call in your life or are you okay with the fact that you are going to heaven? do you feel you are there yet or are you still journeying? Are you under construction or is your house complete? Are you establishing your own righteousness and not that of God? Has He touched your mouth with live coal and taken your iniquity away? my message is simple today, \"<strong>WE ARE NOT THERE YET</strong>!!\" Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>Matthew 6:21, “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”-</strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to legend as popularized by the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, pirates, open sea rebels travel far and wide in search of treasure ranging from gold coins to Aztech gold. Even though it's been said that not all that glitters is gold, they never grow weary in search of priceless trinkets because that's what their hearts beat for.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLike pirates who will travel open seas through peril for a chest of gold, do you search for Christ with all your heart? Is he the treasure your heart longs for, or are you wasting away chasing after silly rainbows that fuel nothing more than the lust of the eyes. According to <strong>Matthew 6:19-20</strong>, we shouldn't store for ourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust can destroy them, but in heaven where they are eternal. Pirates waste away to their death searching for trinkets because for every stolen trinket, their hearts lust for larger, pricier and more lavish pieces. To keep stolen treasure, they are also susceptible to betrayal, theft, and death because there is no honor among thieves. It's the never ending battle for mortal satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Bible, when we seek after righteousness, we shall be filled because this heavenly treasure profits the soul and not our carnal lust. <strong>Matthew 5:6</strong> declares that blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. If the Lord is your treasure, you will never grow weary in seeking after Him because only in the Lord will your heart be also. <strong>Jeremiah 29:13 says, “You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart</strong>.” If we desire the Lord on a constant basis like a pirate longs for treasure, we shall receive the everlasting fulfillment that can't be found in silver, gold or any other corruptible thing. Blessings Kefa Olang."

              "<strong>Ephesians 4:32, the Bible says, “Be compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you” (NIV1984).</strong>\r\n\r\nAt one time or another, we have all struggled with letting go of the past. This resonates even deeper if emotions were tied to a specific incident. We have all held on to things that have crippled, consumed, and literally sucked the life out of us. Betrayals, regrets, bad choices, emotional, and even physical hurt generally make up the past's lexicon. More often than not, for many, the past is usually married to un-forgiveness. <!--more-->Like misery attracts company, the past walks hand-in-hand with un-forgiveness. Maybe at one time in your life someone broke your heart leaving you to scramble to put the pieces back together, or you faced betrayal's sting in the worst possible fashion. For Christians and non-Christians alike, hurt, and primarily un-forgiveness unflinching aura has a way of scarring us to the point where the future seems like a distant uncertainty. In fact, one writer described un-forgiveness as “spiritual poison.” Getting past clouds of pain and emotional torment to see the light of forgiveness on a hill becomes more of an illusion than reality.\r\n\r\nLike many, I know how challenging un-forgiveness and letting go of the past can be. I know what it's like to look betrayal, hurt, and frustration in the eye. As depicted in The Lion King, un-forgiveness for ourselves and others will always plague us until we finally let go. While chants of “Hakuna Matata,” as highlighted in the popular animated movie does nothing to relinquish this burden, we can only let go of the past once we submit to forgiveness. Bearing the burden of un-forgiveness follows men even in their dying days. In <strong>Ephesians 4:32, the Bible says, “Be compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you” (NIV1984).\r\n</strong>\r\nFor many, a scripture such as this has no meaning because even the most powerful literature ever written has little effect if we haven't reached a place of brokenness to forgive and let go. Sometimes scripture makes forgiveness seem easier said than done right? Off course; however, there isn't a writing on a wall, a self-help book, or a motivational speaker that can persuade you to forgive. When we get hurt, our heart's undeniable fragility leaves us hardened, and often as cold as ice. For some, not even love can penetrate this icy exterior because the walls we build hold off anything and everyone. Like the burning desire to love and be loved, we all know that we should forgive. Even though it's written on the tablets of our conscience, only a broken heart can lead to such an epic conclusion. Unless the Lord breaks this hardened shell and softens our hearts as he declares in <strong>Ezekiel 36:26</strong>, we will always wallow in our past hurts with this immense cloud hovering over us.\r\n\r\nTo be concluded..., blessings by Kefa"

              "<strong>Ephesians 4:32, the Bible says, “Be compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you” (NIV1984). </strong>\r\n\r\nWhen should we forgive and finally let go? How should we do it? Does the offender even need to know that you forgave him? Whenever these questions start to haunt you, it may be an indication that the Lord is stirring up a spirit of forgiveness. Now don't get me wrong; this does not mean you'll wake up one morning to a chorus of \"Oh Happy Day,\" smiling at the birds chirping, feeling all happy and dandy saying, “<em>yes! yes, I have forgiven my offender, and I am finally letting go</em>.” <!--more-->Truth be told, that's more likely on a utopia than the real world. On the contrary, forgiveness and letting go is a process that takes time; it can come to fruition if the desire is evident. When you read scriptures addressing un-forgiveness, you can clearly tell that it was intended to be a tough battle we must fight vigilantly and ferociously. The battle can only be won if we fight our pride to its last stand.\r\n\r\nAs I stated in the first part of this devotion, no one can tell you when or how you should go about forgiving. Anyway who attempts to is clearly out of touch with the reality of your hurt. Un-forgiveness causes restlessness and lack of peace. There's no greater discomfort than when we are not at peace. But as we desire to forgive just as our heavenly father Forgives us of our countless sins, He starts a restoration process, which even begins to highlight just how irrelevant the offender actually is. You finally realize that you aren't forgiving your offender for his sake, but for the Lord. Coupled with hurt, un-forgiveness is a heavy burden to carry. It gives your offender so much power over you. Choosing to run or hide only does so much to suppress these emotions, because just like the buoyancy that causes a log to float, these feelings will always resurface<strong>. In Matthew 11:28, the scripture says, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (NIV1984).</strong> If you're struggling with past hurts and un-forgiveness for months or even years, bring it to the Lord because there is rest for the weary. To paraphrase <strong>Philippians 4:6-7,</strong> the scripture says that whatever we ask in his name through prayer and thanksgiving he can do it and provide peace that surpasses all understanding. If you desire to be free from the bondage brought by the past's gripping hold to, submit it to the Lord consistently, so that you can finally forgive and let go to receive the sweet release of peace in the Lord.

              "<strong>Ephesians 5:33, “Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThis was shared by one of my favorite pastors.\r\n\r\nThere is sometimes a tendency to prioritize our children to the neglect of our marriage. There are at least three reasons that make prioritizing our children over our marriage both foolish and dangerous:<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Our children will eventually leave home. Prepare your marriage for the empty nest:</strong>\r\nTo my knowledge, I’ve never talked to a person who divorced after twenty-five or thirty years who didn’t say something like this: “<em>Once the kids were gone, we realized we really didn’t have much of a marriage.</em>” Building a marriage on the foundation of the preeminence of children is like building a house on a rented removable slab. You may have days or even years when you feel completely secure, but the day is coming when the lease will be up and the foundation upon which your home stands will be taken away. A family shepherd must not allow his family to fall into this trap.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Our marriage forms the cornerstone of our children’s security:</strong>\r\nIronically, those who prioritize their children above their marriage are not only jeopardizing their marriage, they’re actually depriving their children of the very thing they desire to provide them. The greatest source of security our children have in this world is a God-honoring, Christ-centered marriage between their parents. Putting the children first is like a police officer putting away his badge and gun in order to make the public feel more at ease. A family shepherd must put his marriage before his children in order to provide them with the security they both need and desire.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Putting your marriage first will actually prepare your children for marriage:</strong>\r\n\r\nPrioritizing your children above your marriage is both foolish and dangerous because it sets a precedent that contradicts one of the greatest lessons you’ll ever teach your children—how to be good husbands and wives. We must first and foremost model a commitment to marriage. Failure to do this will communicate ideas that are contrary to what we believe—starting with the narcissism it tends to create in our children—including the pitfalls that may follow them into their marriage. For example, if we prioritize our children above our marriage, we teach our children that marriage exists for children. If this is the case, how will our children react to the early months or years of their marriage when there are no children? How will they respond if, God forbid, they should struggle with infertility? If the heart of marriage is “living for the kids,” these scenarios could be difficult at best.\r\n\r\nJesus our Savior—and our example of what a bridegroom truly is—laid down his life for his bride (<a href=\"http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+5.25\">Eph. 5:25</a>). He doesn’t neglect her for another. And it’s this relationship of our Savior to his bride that governs our understanding of our role as husbands and family shepherds. We must give ourselves to and for our wives. We must view them not only as ours but as us! As I often remind myself concerning my wife, “She’s not just mine; she’s me. She’s bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh (<a href=\"http://www.esvonline.org/Gen.+2.23\">Gen. 2:23</a>); she’s my body (<a href=\"http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+5.28%E2%80%9329\">Eph. 5:28–29</a>), and I am her head (<a href=\"http://www.esvonline.org/1+Cor.%2011.3\">1 Cor. 11:3</a>; <a href=\"http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+5.23\">Eph. 5:23</a>). We are one (<a href=\"http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+5.31\">Eph. 5:31</a>; see also <a href=\"http://www.esvonline.org/Gen.+2.24\">Gen. 2:24</a>); and our union is a blessing to our children (<a href=\"http://www.esvonline.org/1+Cor.%207.14\">1 Cor. 7:14</a>).”\r\n\r\nAs family shepherds, our primary mission is to love our wives as our own selves. We must not allow anything to interfere with this mission. Neither our careers nor our children can be allowed to keep us from our task of modeling for the world the beautiful, mysterious, one-flesh union of our Savior and his bride (<a href=\"http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+5.33\">Eph. 5:33</a>).

              "<strong>2Kings 5:1-19, “But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, “Indeed, I said to myself, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.’”</strong>\r\n\r\nWorthiness is having adequate or great merit, character, or value. Worthy people command great attention and respect. In this passage we meet worthy Naaman but by his own standards.\r\n\r\nTo understand who Naaman was, we look to<strong> 2Kings 5:1</strong> to get his resume, 1. He was commander of the army of the king of Syria, 2. He was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, and 3. He was also a mighty man of valor. He commanded attention because of who he was, however he had leprosy. Upon hearing that there was a prophet in Samaria who could heal him of his leprosy, he does not come humbly, no, he comes with great entourage for his healing service and a plan. <strong>Vs. 9, \"Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and he stood at the door of Elisha’s house\"</strong>. The worthy man as he thought came in style and others would recognize his position by his resume and surrounding.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhat happened next would infuriate the worthy Namaan almost forfeiting what brought him to Samaria, vs. <strong>10, \"And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and you shall be clean.”</strong> How dare Elisha dishonor Namaan by not showing up to meet with him but rather send a servant, a messenger and to add salt to the injury the servant brought degrading news that he should go and wash in the dirty river of Jordan. The instruction was for him to dip himself not once but 7 times in the presence of all those who had respect for his statue. Not even one of his servants was to do it on his behalf.\r\n\r\n<strong>2Kings 5:1-19, “But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, “Indeed, I said to myself, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.’” </strong>Because Naaman considered himself worthy of the attention of the prophet for his healing, he indeed said to himself how he thought his healing would come about. He expected Elisha to treat him as a worthy man like the rest only to find that he needed to come as a beggar in need of a free gift, not as lord to demand or purchase it. Jesus said, <strong>“… whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted”, Matthew 23:12</strong>\r\n\r\nElisha did not need Naaman, Naaman needed Elisha. Here Elisha is the type of Christ who has the free gift but the seeker must come in Elisha/Jesus’ terms. The name Elisha means “God is salvation”\r\n\r\nIn the light of this story, we need to be reminded that the gospel is not how worthy man is, the gospel is how worthy Jesus is. The gospel is not how God needs man, the gospel is how man needs God. The gospel is not how in trouble God is for not having us, the gospel is how we are in trouble without God. “<em>The way by which a sinner is received and made holy, through the blood, and by the Spirit of Christ, through faith alone in his name, does not sufficiently humour or employ self, to please the sinner's heart</em>”, Matthew Henry.\r\n\r\nA sinner must come because Christ is worthy and not because he is regardless what others think of him. He must come broken and humble in need of a Savior. While Naaman would have thought his success may have come by his hands, the bible says it was God who had made him successful and even his healing would have to be done by God, for God. That revelation would cause Naaman to humble himself.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story, he humbled himself and did as he was instructed and in response, <strong>2Kings 5:17, “So Naaman said, “Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD</strong>”. He came in chariots and horses, he came with gold and expensive clothing however with the change, he took two mules (donkeys) considered humbled, what Christ rode upon. He took loads of earth as a reminder of how low and dirty he was to remind him of humility and vowed to serve the Lord in His terms.\r\n\r\nYou who is not saved and think you are worthy of attention, have you looked yourself in the light of Naaman’s story to see your sin of pride and arrogance hoping to come to the Lord in your term? You must humble yourself, see your sin in its true state, then Believe, and be saved; Repent, and be pardoned; Wash and be clean. Simple and direct to the point, you need Elisha (Jesus).

joy is a wonderful by-product of our fellowship with God.  David knew the joy which John mentions; he said, “In Your presence is fullness of joy” (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps.+16%3A11&amp;version=NIV\">Ps. 16:11</a>).\r\n\r\nFor the most part, sin is the cause of the unhappiness that overwhelms our world today.  Sin promises joy, but it always produces sorrow.  The pleasures of sin are temporary—they are only for a season (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+11%3A25&amp;version=NIV\">Heb. 11:25</a>), but God’s pleasures last eternally—they are forevermore.\r\n\r\nThe life that is real produces a joy that is real—not some limp substitute.  Jesus said, the night before He was crucified, “No man will take away your joy” (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A22&amp;version=NIV\">Jn. 16:22</a>).  “I have told you this so that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete” (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A11&amp;version=NIV\">Jn. 15:11</a>).  In this letter, John is saying, “Faith in Jesus Christ gives you a joy that can never be duplicated by the world.  I have experienced this joy myself and I want to share it with you.”\r\n\r\n<b><i>That we may not sin (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A1&amp;version=NIV\">2:1</a>)</i>.</b>  John faces the problem of sin squarely (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A4%E2%80%939&amp;version=NIV\">1 Jn. 3:4–9</a>) and announces the only answer to this enigma—the person and work of Jesus Christ, who not only died for us to pay the penalty of our sins, but rose from the dead in order to intercede for us at the throne of God: “I write this to you so that you will not sin.  But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One” (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A1&amp;version=NIV\">1 Jn. 2:1</a>).\r\n\r\nChrist is our Representative.  He defends us at the Father’s throne.  Satan may stand there as the accuser of the brethren (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zech.+3&amp;version=NIV\">Zech. 3</a>; <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev.+12%3A10&amp;version=NIV\">Rev. 12:10</a>), but Christ stands there as our Advocate—He pleads on our behalf!  Continuing forgiveness, in response to His intercession, is God’s answer to our sinfulness.\r\n\r\nIt isn’t <i>necessary</i> for Christians to sin.  As we walk in fellowship with God and in obedience to His Word, He gives us ability to resist and have victory over temptation.  The life that is real is a life of <i>victory</i>.  In this letter, John tells us how to draw on our divine resources to experience victory over temptation and sin.\r\n\r\n<b><i>That we may not be deceived (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A26&amp;version=NIV\">2:26</a>)</i>.</b>  More than ever, Christians today need the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, between truth and error.  The notion is widespread in our generation that there are no “absolutes”—that <i>nothing</i> is <i>always</i> wrong and <i>nothing</i> is <i>always</i> right.  False doctrines, therefore, are more prevalent than at any time in history—and most men and women seem to be willing to accept almost any teaching except the truths of the Bible.\r\n\r\nJohn uses a word no other New Testament writer uses—“antichrist” (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A18&amp;version=NIV\">1 Jn. 2:18</a>, <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A22&amp;version=NIV\">22</a>; <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A3&amp;version=NIV\">4:3</a>; <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+John+7&amp;version=NIV\">2 Jn. 1:7</a>).  That prefix <i>anti-</i> has two meanings: “against” and “instead of.”  There are in this world teachers of lies who are opposed to Christ and their method of “seducing” people is to use <i>lies</i>.  They offer a substitute Christ, a substitute salvation, and a substitute Bible.  They want to give you something <i>instead of</i> the real Word of God and real eternal life.\r\n\r\nChrist is the Truth (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&amp;version=NIV\">Jn. 14:6</a>); Satan is the liar (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A44&amp;version=NIV\">Jn. 8:44</a>).  The devil leads people astray—not necessarily with gross sensual sins, but with half-truths and outright lies.  He began his career by seducing man in the Garden of Eden.  He asked Eve, “Has God really said?” (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen+3%3A1&amp;version=NIV\">Gen. 3:1</a>).  Even then, he did not appear to her in his true nature, but masqueraded as a beautiful creature (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Cor.+11%3A13%E2%80%9315&amp;version=NIV\">2 Cor. 11:13–15</a>).\r\n\r\nSatan today often spreads his lies even through religious groups!  Not every man standing in a pulpit is preaching the truth of the Word of God.  False preachers and false religious teachers have always been among the devil’s favorite and most effective tools.\r\n\r\nHow can Christians today detect Satan’s lies?  How can we identify false teachers?  How can we grow in our own knowledge of the truth, so we will not be victims of false doctrines?  John answers these questions: the life that is real is characterized by discernment.  The Holy Spirit, referred to by John as “the Anointing” (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A27%29%2C+&amp;version=NIV\">1 Jn. 2:27</a>), is Christ’s answer to our need for discernment.  The Spirit is our Teacher; it is He who enables us to detect truth and error and to remain (“abide”) in Christ.  He is our protection against ignorance, deception, and untruth.\r\n\r\n<b><i>That we may know we are saved (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A13&amp;version=NIV\">5:13</a>)</i>.</b>  I have already touched on this truth in <a href=\"http://joequatronejr.wordpress.com/category/doctrine/\">past articles</a>, but it is so important that it bears repeating.  The life that is real is not built on the empty hopes—or wishes—based on human supposings.  It is built on assurance.  In fact, as we read John’s letter we encounter the word <i>know</i> more than thirty times.  No Christian, if he is asked whether or not he is going to heaven, needs to say “I <i>hope</i> so” or “I <i>think</i> so.”  He need have no doubt whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe life that is real is such a free and exciting life because it is based on knowledge of solid <i>facts.</i>  “Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free” (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A32&amp;version=NIV\">Jn. 8:32</a>), promised Jesus.  “We did not follow cleverly devised stories” (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A16&amp;version=NIV\">2 Pet. 1:16</a>), was the testimony of Jesus’ disciples.  These men, almost all of whom died for their faith, did not give their lives for a clever hoax of their own devising, as some critics of Christianity fatuously assert.  They <i>knew</i> what they had seen!  John is saying in his letter, “I want you to be <i>sure</i> you <i>have</i> eternal life.”\r\n\r\nAs we read this fascinating letter, we will discover John frequently repeats himself.  He weaves three themes in and out of these chapters: <i>obedience, love</i>, and <i>truth</i>.  In the first half of his letter, the apostle emphasizes <i>fellowship</i> and tells us the conditions for fellowship are: obedience (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A5%E2%80%932%3A6&amp;version=NIV\">1 Jn. 1:5–2:6</a>), love (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A7%E2%80%9317&amp;version=NIV\">1 Jn. 2:7–17</a>), and truth (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A18%E2%80%9329&amp;version=NIV\">1 Jn. 2:18–29</a>).\r\n\r\nObedience—love—truth.  Why did John use these particular tests of fellowship and sonship?  For a very practical reason.  When God made us, He made us in His own image (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.+1%3A26%E2%80%9327&amp;version=NIV\">Gen. 1:26–27</a>).  This means we have a personality patterned after God’s.  We have a <i>mind</i> to think with, a <i>heart</i> to feel with, and a <i>will</i> to make decisions.  We sometimes refer to these aspects of our personality as <i>intellect, emotion</i>, and <i>will</i>.  The life that is real <i>must involve all the elements of the personality</i>.\r\n\r\nMost people are dissatisfied today because their total personality has never been controlled by something real and meaningful.  When a person is born of God through faith in Christ, God’s Spirit comes into his life to live there forever.  As he has fellowship with and is sanctified by God, the Holy Spirit is able to control his mind, heart, and will.  And what happens then?  A Spirit-controlled <i>mind</i> knows and understands <i>truth</i>.  A Spirit-controlled <i>heart</i> feels <i>love</i>.  A Spirit-controlled <i>will</i> inclines us to <i>obedience</i>.\r\n\r\nJohn wants to impress this fact on us and that is why he uses a series of contrasts in his letter: truth vs. lies, love vs. hatred, and obedience vs. disobedience.  There is no middle ground in the Christian life.  We must be on one side or on the other.  This, then, is the life that is real.  It was revealed in Christ; it was experienced by those who trusted in Christ; and it can be shared today.\r\n\r\nThis life begins with <i>sonship</i> and continues in <i>fellowship</i>.  First we are born of God; then we walk (live) with God.  This means that there are two kinds of people who cannot enter into the joy and victory about which we are thinking: those who have never been born of God and those who, though saved, are out of fellowship with God.  It would be a wise thing for us to take inventory spiritually (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Cor.+13%3A5&amp;version=NIV\">2 Cor. 13:5</a>) and see whether or not we qualify to enjoy the spiritual experience with which John’s letter deals.\r\n\r\nIf a true believer is out of fellowship with God, it is usually for one of three reasons: (1) he has disobeyed God’s will; (2) he is not getting along with fellow believers; (3) he believes a lie and therefore is living a lie.  Even a Christian can be mistaken in his understanding of truth.  That’s why John warns us, “Little children, do not let anyone lead you astray” (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A7&amp;version=NIV\">1 Jn. 3:7</a>).\r\n\r\nThese three reasons parallel John’s three important themes: obedience, love, and truth.  Once a believer discovers why he is out of fellowship with God, he should confess that sin (or those sins) to the Lord and claim His full forgiveness (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A9%E2%80%932%3A2&amp;version=NIV\">1 Jn. 1:9–2:2</a>).  A believer can never have joyful fellowship with the Lord if sin stands between them.  God’s invitation to us today is, “Come and enjoy fellowship with Me and with each other!  Come and share the life that is real!”</div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:1;}"

              "<strong>Deuteronomy 1:37, \"The Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying even you shall not go in there\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIn<strong> Exodus 17:6</strong>, Moses is leading the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt to the promise land. He is leading a people who have not stopped complaining from day one even up to this every moment. Many times God wanted to kill the children of Israel because of their complains and murmuring but Moses kept on pleading with God. On this day in <strong>Exodus 17</strong>, the people had just complained as usual about something they were lacking. Already God had given them everything they cried for and this time they needed water. Instead of looking to God, they began to reflect on how they would have been satisfied in Egypt.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHow possible it is that you can be heading to the promise land while Egypt could still be present in your life. Every time you face a tough situation, your first place to look to is Egypt, a place you come from. <strong>You can be out of Egypt but Egypt may not be out of you</strong>. Egypt represents the world God saved us from. A deliverer Moses (Christ) came to lead us out of bondage but in the process of being led, many people's eyes were still fixed on Egypt. <strong>Egypt was a land of less than enough, the wilderness was a land of just enough and God was bringing them to a land of more than enough</strong>. We have to reach at a place of not always operating in the land of just enough to which the provision is always by miracle to a land of more than enough, a land of blessings. I refuse to live by miracles everyday, yes the miracles are good for miracles are to get me from point A to point B but living under blessings is greater.\r\n\r\nTherefore the people complained and God told Moses in <strong>Exodus 17:6, \"Behold, I stand before thee there upon the rock of Horeb; and thou shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel\" </strong>This is what the Lord chose for this time and that was for Moses to hit the rock for water to come out. Now let's look at another time the Lord wanted to provide water to the children of Israel in <strong>Numbers 20:8, \"Take thy rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give thee forth water, and thou shall bring forth to them water out of the rock\". </strong>Here we see in one instant Moses was asked to strike the rock and another instant he was asked to speak to the rock. God can do anything at any time using any means He chooses, He is God. Don’t expect Him to always move the same way He moved the first time, He is not limited to our thinking.\r\n\r\nAmazing thing about the whole story with the children of Israel is every time they complained and God felt like wiping them out, Moses defended them. This time Moses was fed up with their cry, complains and murmur. He therefore took the word of the Lord and began to speak to the people in an anger. He disobeyed the Lord when he allowed his anger to drive him to strike the rock twice instead of speaking to it. <strong>Numbers 20:11, \"And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice\". </strong>Yes the Lord gave the children of Israel water though Moses disobeyed but Moses was left to suffer the consequences. <strong>Ephesians 4:26, says \"Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath\". </strong>It's very easy to get angry and do something you will regret. The enemy knows how to bring people your way who will try and push you to anger. Moses was on the verge of entering the promise land but because of his anger that led him to disobey God cost him the land he had waited to see in 40 years.\r\n\r\nBe careful about how you deal with things under anger and frustrations for you could be killing what the Lord had been planning to do in your life from day one. As we have seen in the book of Ephesians, “<strong>be angry and sin not</strong>” is very true for the enemy will always look for ways to make you stumble and fall and as Moses tells us in <strong>Deuteronomy 1:37, \"The Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying even you shall not go in there\", </strong>people pushed him to the limit, don't allow people and situations push you to the limit for you could do something you will regret for a long time. Be cool, be still, calm yourself, don't fight fire with fire. <strong>Anger is one letter short for DANGER</strong>. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 15:58, \"Therefore my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nIn 1938 Orson Wells showed America the great power of the media with his \"War of the Worlds\" broadcast. His announcement convinced multitudes that Aliens from Mars were attacking New York and New Jersey. His compelling broadcast had scores of people shaken. Harlem in NYC was one of those places that were severely shaken. \"The parlor churches in the Negro district, congregations of the smaller sects meeting on the ground floors of brownstone houses, took the \"news\" in stride as less faithful parishioners rushed in with it, seeking spiritual consolation. Evening services became \"end of the world\" prayer meetings in some (New York Times, Oct. 31, 1938).<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe Apostle Paul in <strong>1Corinthians 15:58</strong> writes too of what perhaps sounds like a \"War of the Worlds\" type of broadcast as he describes the rapture (the snatching up quickly) of the church at the sound of the trumpet. However God's Word is not a science fiction broadcast but a true account of what happened \"In the beginning,\" and what will take place in the future. Therefore, as we, the Church wait for this Great Day, Paul doesn't instruct us to run around like lunatics with a big sign reading \"The end is near\" while we scream \"Repent while you still have time.\" Paul rather gives sound down to earth applicable instruction of what the Body of Christ is to do as it waits for the return of Christ. He writes, \"Therefore\" hence because this is going to take place, \"my beloved brethren\" those that I love listen to me. Then he touches on three characteristics for believers to have in place as they actively wait for Christ's return as they are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Be steadfast</strong>. The Christian life is not a sprint but a marathon, as Solomon reminds us <strong>\"The race is not to the swift... (Ecclesiastes 9:11)\"</strong> As believers we need to embrace and exhibit a stick-to-itiveness spirit, an attitude of perseverance. The word quit should not be in the vocabulary of a Christian as it pertains to following the Lord. Paul said \"<strong>However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me</strong>.\" Run the race and refuse to give up. When the going gets tough, and your spiritual leg muscles are weary wait on the Lord to renew your strength (<strong>Isaiah 40:31)\"</strong> and <strong>\"...be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus”, (2Timothy 2:1)</strong>\r\n\r\n2. <strong>[Be] Unmovable. Be stable.</strong> This world is a very unstable place that can't ever seem to make up its mind. The Christian although living in the world is not of the world and therefore needs to show the world stability in Christ in their midst of the instability of this present world controlled by the god of this world (the devil).\r\n\r\n3<strong>. [Be] Always abounding in the work of the Lord</strong>. What do you do for the Lord? Are you a Sunday Morning Christian only? Most Christians don't have the work of the Lord in their schedules because much of their work is for themselves or others. Paul employs that we abound in God's Work. Whose work are you abounding in? Are you as efficient for God as you are for your employer? When you exhibit these godly characteristics you do it for the service of the King and therefore <strong>\"your labor is not in vain in the Lord\"</strong> as you are spurred to serve the Lover of your soul.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>2Kings 6:6-7,  “6 So the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there; and he made the iron float. 7 Therefore he said, “Pick it up for yourself.” So he reached out his hand and took it”</strong>\r\n\r\nRiver Jordan though dirty is a learning ground for faith. The Jordan is where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the Son of God and Lamb of God. In biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several miracles, this was where the Israelites crossed dry land under Joshua (<strong>Joshua 3:15-17</strong>). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as \"a witness\" between them and the other tribes (<strong>Joshua 22:10, 22:26</strong>). The Jordan was crossed by Elijah and Elisha on dry ground (<strong>2Kings 2:8, 2:14</strong>). Elisha performed two other miracles at the Jordan: he healed Naaman by having him bathe in its waters, and he made the ax head of one of the \"children of the prophets\" float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water (<strong>2Kings 5:14; 6:6</strong>).<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe mention of the river Jordan here is a reminder to us that it takes God to do the impossible for those who have faith. We ought to teach our young people not to lose sight of trust in God at all times<strong>. </strong>The sons of sons trusted God through Elisha. You even notice in <strong>2Kings 4:</strong>1<strong>, </strong>a certain widow who was a wife of one of the sons of the prophets seeking help from the God of Elisha, showing trust in God. And<strong> 2Kings 4:38-41</strong> when there was famine in the land, Elisha tells them to prepare a pot of stew. There was something wrong with the soup and they turned to Elisha. Each of the miracles, he used something available but the trust was not on what he used but in God. Jesus used a boy’s lunch to feed the multitude.\r\n\r\n<strong>2kings 6:6, “So the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there; and he made the iron float The young man did not lose sight of where the ax head fell</strong>”. Let’s teach our young people to remember where they have failed, this is not to make them miserable but learning from those experiences and trusting God to bring them through. Elisha did not yell at him or even question him, all he did was ask where the ax head fell. And when he was shown, he did not start looking for the ax head in other words leaning on his own understanding or even asking others to look with him, he presented it to the Lord first doing his part “cutting off a stick”.\r\n\r\nLet’s show our young people to cast their sticks (prayers) where the borrowed ax head has fallen. God takes delight in his people calling on him. What a joy to see a young person who has learnt the power of prayer and is not depending on the power of suggestions. Praying for small and big things, praying for knowledge, wisdom, purity, parents, unity, to be godly children, praying for their future careers, future spouses, etc knowing their trust is not in their parents but God and God uses the parents as one of the means to be a blessing to them.\r\n\r\nWhen Elisha threw the stick, the iron did float. It’s not the stick that caused the iron to float and it’s not our prayers that cause things to happen, it’s the means by which God has chosen to hear His children while they recognize it’s His doing. Whosoever wills may call.\r\n\r\nElisha teaches us that sometimes the Lord would require something of us to accomplish what He has planned. He may require what is at our disposal. He has given us many things and while we use what is available, He will provide what is not available. “<strong>It’s not by might, nor by power but by the spirit of the Lord</strong>”. We are learning and teaching our young people that we are not depending on our own strength, that what we accomplish is not the source of our strength but the means by which God is at work in us. <strong>Philippians 2:13, “for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure”</strong>\r\n\r\nAre your young people trusting in you for things or have you taught them to trust in the Lord demonstrating it in prayer? Do they look to you as the source or the means by which God provides for them. <strong>Proverbs 3:5-6, “5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; 6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths”, Psalm 118:8, “It is better to trust in the LORD, than to put confidence in man”, Psalm 20:7, “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God”, Psalm 46:1, “God <em>is</em> our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble”, Psalm 127: 1, “Unless the LORD builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, The watchman stays awake in vain”, </strong>what is the message to us and our young people? God can be trusted. Blessings Ev"

              "“The battle is the Lord’s” Yes, in life, there are many situations, where God Himself does the war for us . He fights for us….At times, we see that when people are working against us, God warns them even through dreams\r\n\r\n<strong>RECONCILIATION</strong>- Classic example is of Laban, the father in law of Jacob ,who was heading to harm Jacob but was warned in a dream …Jacob was running away with fear and agony from his father –in –law along with his wives, children and the acquired property since he was being ill-treated. Genesis<strong> 31:24 “Then God came to Laban , the Aramaean, in a dream at night and said to him “BE CAREFUL not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad”</strong> <!--more-->We can imagine ourselves in this situation –very tensed , but God Himself intervening and warning our enemy, how marvelous it is. Yes, if we recede from fighting but allow God to do the same for us, we can see God planning and moving greatly … Usually, though we all know the verse well that the battle is the Lord’s , we take turn and try to fight it out ..But the plan may not be right and so is the timing and the approach. It may not even suit the situation correctly … If we rely on God to fight for us, we can see the results …Since Laban was warned he did not dare to do any harm to Jacob , though he was very angry. Laban mentions to Jacob in<strong> Gen 31:29 “I have the power to harm you</strong>”. Yes, though he had power and was heading to harm him, God fought the battle and finally safeguarded Jacob and everything he had….\r\n\r\n<strong>SETTLEMENT</strong>- We see Mary, who was only a virgin and betrothed to Joseph, to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Joseph was shocked to hear about this, since they had not yet come together. Since he was a righteous man, he did not want to expose her to public disgrace. So he had in mind to divorce her quietly. ..But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said<strong>” Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name ‘Jesus’ because he will save his people from their sins</strong>”, <strong>Mathew 1 :19</strong> So he took home Mary as his wife .We can imagine the situation of Mary. She never requested someone to pacify Joseph or convince him or speak to him by herself and what not. There were so many ways for Mary to fight the life’s real battle…She completely depended on the Almighty for every minute details happening in her life …. God was mindful of the humble state of His servant and set right, this marriage, rather home ...Yes, God is capable of settling our lives, no matter how many fears /doubts arise. If we trust the Lord for our battle, we can be rest assured.\r\n\r\n<strong>TESTIMONY</strong>-Another instance where God speaks to the wife of a person in authority........ Pilate was seated a judge and when he was about to pronounce judgment on Jesus, his wife sent for him this message<strong> “Do not have anything to do with that INNOCENT man for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him “.</strong>Yes , when Jesus was facing opposition from all sides –all the people in the area were shouting against Jesus, but this testimony gave comfort to our Lord…May be if any other person would have conveyed this message, he would not have considered. But it was his dear wife. So God gave him an opportunity to realize the greatness of Jesus before he could decide whether to release Jesus or Barabbas.\r\n\r\n<strong>GUIDANCE</strong>-Peter saw heaven opened ,while he fell into a trance, and also saw something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. It contained all kinds of four footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. Then God corrected Peter in his thoughts saying “<strong>Do not call anything impure that God has made clean</strong>” Yes, he was guided to go to Cornelius, where he along with his friends and relatives assembled. The Holy Spirit had been poured out on all of them.\r\n\r\nA dream may look simple but if God could use it to convey His message, He can do anything for His people. Even when the king himself forgot the dream he had, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Yes, the God had used a dream as a means to warn Laban while heading to harm Jacob and to reconcile them, to show Joseph the factual situation and build the home, which was going to be shattered, to inform Pilate that Jesus was Lord and totally innocent/blameless/pure, to correct Peter so that he should go to the Gentiles to preach the goodness, to exalt Daniel before the king and his entire kingdom.\r\n\r\nSo we need worry for any situation because He can warn our enemies in face of danger and safeguard us, he can fabricate /put together broken homes, He can prove a person innocent, when the entire world is against the same and He can also correct us so that we may be used for His higher purposes. What a mighty God we serve ! Praise Him that He is the same yesterday, today and forever. We are all privileged to be children of this great and awesome God! By Sarah Susan"

              "<strong>John 11:10-11, \"10 But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.\" 11 These things He said, and after that He said to them, \"Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Lord Jesus is with his disciples one day and someone comes to Jesus and tells Him that a good friend (Lazarus) was sick. Jesus goes to Bethany and while in route, Lazarus dies. This death so moved Jesus that He cried. God then manifested His ultimate power by restoring Lazarus to life. Through this awesome miracle, many people came to believe in Jesus.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nGod's overall intent for humanity is to have life and to enjoy it. When considering the abundance of natural and spiritual gifts He has bestowed upon us to achieve this end, we can do nothing but marvel in the excellence of His work as our hearts are filled with such transcendent joy that we can barely comprehend the full heights of His splendor. Everything God does, has done, and will do involves the furtherance of His desire that we have, enjoy, and preserve life. I want you to consider this point. Think about the commandments of God. The only things that God has forbidden are those things that will cut our lives short! Think about it. I challenge you to name a single thing that God has forbidden that does humanity any good. God only wants us to walk in the beauty of creation experiencing life without insulting His majesty by reducing our dignity through base living.\r\n\r\nThe chief priests who represented the established church of the day harassed the Lord at every opportunity despite overwhelming evidence signaling His Identity. We are not told why Lazarus was sick, but it was clear that even the last effect of sin and the ultimate condition of man was eclipsed by the love of God, which brought life. The established church witnessed God's great work and shortly decided that they would KILL Lazarus.\r\n\r\nImagine that. The Lord Jesus raises a man from the dead and because the chief priests were so fixated on limiting Jesus' actions and preventing Him from expelling the death that resulted from the law that the chief priests decided to assassinate Jesus and flat-out MURDER Lazarus. They wanted to kill Life itself- the Source of Life, and all things that Life impacted.\r\n\r\nMuch can be said about all of this. I want us to remember that the mission of Christ's church is to champion life and remember to value people over systems, rules, laws, and religions- all of which create and maintain death. Beloved, our agenda in this society encompasses more and is broader than our struggle against abortion. Jesus has the ability to remedy every irritant that impacts humanity and is presently restoring life and setting at liberty everything that encounters His Presence and embraces His Word. Whenever people were in danger, Jesus did not miss a single opportunity to suspend the mechanism that empowered death in order to allow life to prevail. Let us go into the world with the same mission. Our message? Receiving the gospel brings spiritual life and obeying the gospel causes natural life to take on new dimensions that will ultimately bring about the fulfillment that we all seek, as our will is conformed to His!

              "<strong>1Samuel 1:1-18, “15 But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord. 16 “Do not consider your maidservant a wicked woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken until now.”</strong>\r\n\r\nTo be misunderstood can be very frustrating. For people to read into things and arrive to conclusions can also be deadly because it’s like a doctor who looks at certain symptoms and prescribes medicine without thorough examination first. Wrong diagnosis leads to wrong medication, wrong medication can lead to catastrophic results.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAnd here we find Hannah who was misunderstood by her rival Peninnah, Husband Elkanah and Eli the priest (her pastor). While Peninnah was jealous of her for receiving double portion of offering, there was great longing in Hannah’s heart that was way bigger than what she was given. Peninnah misunderstood her intentions and therefore made her life miserable. On the other hand, her husband did not seem to understand the longing of her heart when he believed he gave her everything. Yes he loved her more than Penninah even when she was barren, and yes he gave her double offering, yet he could not meet the very hunger of her heart he knew about. Then we meet Eli the priest (her pastor) who could not understand how a woman with a lovely husband would come to the temple each year when she was not required to and look like she was drunk, vs. “<strong>13 Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. 14 So Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!””. </strong>He thought she was drunk and advised her to put away her wine. Eli the priest could not tell the difference between someone who was in agony and someone who was drunk. Can you imagine the thoughts in Hannah’s heart? “<em>no one seems to understand me”.</em>\r\n\r\nIn the midst of no one understanding, she poured her heart to the Lord who she knew would understand. Only God could diagnose her situation and prescribe the right medication to her dilemma. And the comforting words she received<strong>, vs. 17, Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him</strong>.” And her reaction, <strong>vs. “18 And she said, “Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad”. </strong>\r\n\r\nHere is a specimen of the intense desire that reigned in the bosoms of the Hebrew women for children. This was the burden of Hannah's prayer; and the strong preference she expressed for a male child originated in her purpose of dedicating him to the tabernacle service to God. It was a God given burden generated through different circumstances to reveal God’s providence through means that were heart breaking and did not make sense. All these three people pushed her forward to reach the One who knew her dilemma, and more than that had the capability of making it a reality. <strong>Psalm 94:19, </strong>reads<strong> “In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul.</strong>”, why, because God knows you and understands you. He understands what you are saying even before you say them. Let that be your delight, let that be your joy and let that be a reason to call on Him at all times. Hannah knew where to go, how about you?, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Luke 9:23-24- The He said to them all,” If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up is cross daily and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.</strong>\r\n\r\nI would like to talk to you this morning about the life of a disciple of Jesus, the true disciple, no longer self seeking, but surrendering their will to the Father, even as Jesus did. Today’s message is very different, so I feel it pertinent to share on this topic the best I can, may God bless His word today. False teachers have crept in unawares, who have corrupted the way of truth. You see them at the bookstores, smiling from the covers. Names like Osteen, Meyer, Dollar, and Hinn have profited from a message that is leading many away from the cross to seek their own comfort and prosperity, ultimately they are being led away from Jesus.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe message Jesus gives us is very different here in Luke’s gospel. If anyone desires to come, He says, let him deny himself. Desires here means they have chosen, they have determined this to be truth. The individual is presented with options, to come or not, and they, upon consideration, have chosen to follow the path that leads to life, knowing the other path, the one of self-comfort and ease, leads to death. Now they must deny themselves, meaning to renounce(to give up, to reject) oneself fully in all respects, to die daily as Paul says to their own desires and ambitions, to all worldliness, to all distractions. They take up their cross daily, and follow after Jesus. A.W. Tozer used to say <strong>you knew one thing about a man with a cross, he wasn’t coming back</strong>. He was going to die. This is what Jesus is saying to us. When I decide to follow Him, it is not so I can benefit from Jesus, as if He owes me something. Christ has saved me, now my life belongs to Him. I take up my cross and go to my death, out of my love for Him. I seek to live as Christ lived, not seeking my own will, but the will of the Father.\r\n\r\nDon’t listen to the other voices, if what they say is leading you away from the cross, stop right where you are, repent, and give your life wholly to the Lord Jesus. For Jesus says, whoever desires to save(to protect, preserve) his life will lose it, but whoever loses(to put out of the way, to destroy) his life will save it. What a paradox, and a tremendous contradiction to the popular pulpit of our day. The very thing they are desiring to save, they are going to lose. Where are we today? Are we desiring to save our lives for ourselves? Don’t be fooled friends by what you are hearing. Look at Jesus, learn from Him, He is the way, truth, and life, look to Him, desire Him above all else. Blessed, Jesus says, are those who <strong>hunger and thirst for righteousness</strong>, for holiness, for a life entirely devoted to Jesus, surrendered completely to Him, out of a love for Jesus that burns within their heart. He is the true treasure, He alone is life. Are you beaten down today? Abandon yourself to the Lord, be satisfied in Him. Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in His wonderful face, and the things of Earth will grow dim. If you would like, please share any responses you might have.\r\n\r\nIn Christ’s service, Brother Benjamen email: brotherbenjamen"

              "<strong>Isaiah 40:31, \"But those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nLife's problems can be difficult for some Christians. We believe that because we are Christians that no bad thing can happen to us. When unpleasant things do happen to us - they can challenge our faith. We forget that God has not promised to keep us away from harm, but God has promised to keep us through harm. This lesson is hardest for those of us who are still just barely starting out on our Christian journey – or those of us who are restarting our Christian journey for the thousandth time.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nDoes this scenario sound familiar? You start going to church regularly again. Then you start reading the Bible and taking time to pray. You notice a change. You can feel God working in your life. Encouraged, you start working hard at listening for God's voice and giving up your old self-destructive habits. At first the results are amazing. God's voice is clear and God's blessings are abundant. You are certain that you are walking on the road that God has chosen for you.\r\n\r\nThen you hit a snag. The road that you were so sure of takes an unexpected turn. If you are following God, isn't God supposed to take care of you? You feel abandoned by God. You feel betrayed - the safe road that you were on is now gone. You don't understand that God is still standing right beside you and that you are still on the road on which you are supposed to be.\r\n\r\nThis part of our faith journey can be like standing at the edge of a cliff beside a wide, bottomless canyon. Somehow you know that far away on the cliff on the other side of the canyon is the path where you are supposed to be. But how are you supposed to get all the way over there? When you look behind you, you see an easy path going back down the cliff. This is the path back to your old habits, back to your old life. What do you do?\r\n\r\nWhen we reach this point we can become so discouraged that many of us give up and go back down the path we know. We stop going to church and reading the Bible and listening for God's voice. We never get to see the other side of the canyon. The next time that you get to this point remind yourself that the edge of a cliff is the perfect place to learn to let the Spirit carry you. Don't forget that God has given you wings.

              "<strong>Luke 10:41–42</strong>, <strong>“41 Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. 42 But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.” </strong>\r\n\r\nPerhaps you’ve heard the old adage, <em>“if the devil can’t make you bad, he’ll make you busy.” </em>I talk to many people that profess that Jesus is their Lord and Savior, yet many of these same folks don’t seem to have or better yet make time to spend with Jesus? Many people have jobs, families, hobbies, school, homes, and a plethora of responsibilities, so since God knows our heart, He should understand right?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJesus came to visit the sisters of Lazarus in their home one day and in the midst of his visit this whole issue of busyness, and serving Jesus rose to the forefront of His visitation. Jesus enters the home of the sisters and upon doing so each one responded to Jesus in a particular manner. Martha began to become cumbered (distracted) with much serving, and proceeded to question Jesus saying, “<strong>Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?</strong>” It seemed that the conversation centered on the value of sitting which is how Mary chose to respond to Jesus’ visit as opposed to serving, which is how Martha reacts to Christ’s arrival. Martha, seemingly feeling that she chose the better and perhaps more reverend option attempts to force Jesus’ hand by requesting that He tell Mary to join her and serve Jesus alongside her. Perhaps if Mary would serve the foods, sweep the floor, or perform any helpful task, this would lighten Martha’s work load and therefore, help the work move along more quickly.\r\n\r\nThere is in fact always enough time to accomplish our God given tasks, and also to spend time with God Himself if one seeks first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness (<strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>). We must have Kingdom priorities, God’s Kingdom must come, our kingdom must go. In prayer, the Twelve were instructed to pray, “<strong>Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done</strong>.” In the Ten Commandments, God wrote, <strong>“I Am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,out of the house ofbondage. “You shall have no other gods before Me</strong>.” When asked by a scribe which was the greatest Commandment, Jesus responded by saying, <strong>“29 Thefirst of all the commandmentsis:‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. 30 And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength</strong>.’ Thisis the first commandment (<strong>Mark 12:30</strong>).”\r\n\r\nMary to have kept these things in mind in prioritizing the things of God, showing Jesus Himself in this case amidst her choice to be with Jesus instead of doing chores for Jesus. Jesus didn’t repel Martha away, but rather attempted to use the scenario to show Martha that when Christ is present both made a decision as to how they would respond to Jesus’ presence in their home. Jesus said that “<strong>Mary chose the better decision sitting at his feet rather than Martha who served at His side”, (Luke 10:41-42).</strong> In the area of servant hood, a true servant does the will of the one that is being served. Hence servant hood must be on Christ’s terms and not ours. Let me illustrate. A father desires his child to clean his or her room, yet instead of doing the will of the father the child washes the dishes and takes out the garbage. Are you serving Jesus at this time on your terms, or His? To be continued, blessings Phil the Evangelist"

              "<strong>Daniel 1:8, \"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe live in a world that tells us to serve the society that we live in. It’s been said that the world is discipling the church rather than the church going into all the world and making disciples.\r\n\r\nIn the book of Daniel, we are introduced to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah which are Hebrew young men exiled into idolatrous nation of Babylon which served false gods. These four Hebrew boys would have to find a way to serve God in a culture, among a people that did not normally serve Him.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nDaniel 1 informs us that these four were “<strong>Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.”</strong> Daniel’s heart was set on serving God. It is interesting that Daniel equated himself as a servant of the king as long as it did not clash with His servant hood of God. “<strong>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself”, (1:8).</strong> Daniel chose to serve His God even when it was not comfortable him, because it was not about the servant, but about the One in whom Daniel served. Serving God led Daniel to the lion’s den, and led Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah to the fiery furnace. Many seem to feel that when one serves God, life will be smooth because God is pleased not the case of these men.\r\n\r\nAmong Daniel and his friends, the king would soon recognize the resolve of God’s servants as they serve Him faithfully, despite the consequences, even in the face of death. When a decree was made by the king, and Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah refused to worship the statue of the king, they “<strong>16 answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar,we have no need to answer you in this matter.17 If that is the case<em>,</em> ourGod whom we serve is able todeliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver<em>us</em> from your hand, O king. 18 Butif not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will weworship the gold image which you have set up.”</strong> Wow, what a resolve! They are ultimately thrown into the furnace and, “<strong>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire</strong>.” When serving the Lord we learn from their lives the following:\r\n\r\nFirst God is able to bring deliverance in our most seemingly horrific of circumstances. Secondly, we must believe God, for it is in Him that we must put our trust. We may have no idea how God could deliver us from what looks like doom from our perspective, but we must not forget we serve an all-powerful God! Thirdly, we must speak to the ungodly about the deliverance of God, and our resolve in Him. We are to proclaim that no matter what, we will not bow down to cultural expectations that violate the Word of God, even when our stance will be seen by the majority as an unpopular decision. We don’t serve God to be popular with man, but to be obedient to our Lord! Fourthly, we must stay together through the trials; we really do need one another. The Hebrew boys faced the trial together, and through it together. What a great story they lived, that we now read about. Who knows our stories, read our stories, and watch our stories? Fifthly, will the ungodly recognize that we are servants of the Lord by the stands that we take in various circumstances? Will we truly refuse ungodly rules that violate God’s Word, despite the consequence! It’s easy to serve God until you are challenged by law, pressure, etc…, to violate your professed service to God. Your faith must stand trial, and when it does, whose servant will you look like, as there are only two choices. Meditate on these things, and examine if you are a servant of the Most High God.\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Phil (Evangelist)"

              "<strong>Daniel 6:10</strong> , “<strong>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem,he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Serving the Lord on His terms (According to Daniel 6)</strong>\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the famous story of Daniel and the Lion’s Den. Here is what the Scriptures tell us what led Daniel to a lion’s den. <!--more--><strong>“3 Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. 4 At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. 5 Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Danielunless it has something to do with the law of his God.</strong>” Daniel’s enemies began to plot against him, manipulating the king to sign a decree stating <strong>“that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions</strong>”. This jealous plot was not unlike the effort against Daniel’s 3 friends in <strong>3:8</strong>. However Daniel was past 80 years of age at this time, yet he was still on his knees thanking God and asking for His guidance and help. A servant of Jesus seeks the Lord, communes with Him, learns from Him, and obeys Him. How can one do the will of the Lord, without seeking Him? Daniel would not allow the death sentence (being thrown in a lion’s den) deter his prayer life. <strong>Daniel 6:10</strong> reads, “<strong>Now when Danielknew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem,he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime</strong>. Notice the following:\r\n\r\nFirst, he knew the writing was signed, showing he was unashamed (Rom 1:16, and steadfast (1 Cor. 15:58). Second, he opened the windows, he was bold and humble as he cried out to the Lord (2 Chron. 2:14). Thirdly, he kneelt three times a day, he was persistent in his prayer life (Luke 18), he gave thanks among the heathen (Psalm 18:49) knowing the consequence could surly be death by a lion’s den. Fourthly, he prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did AFORETIME (this was a regular practice for Daniel). Do any of these characteristics describe you? I’m sure if you are living in a free nation, and your life is not on the line (not having the fear of receiving the death sentence as the persecuted church around the world faces). If death is not a deterrent from you having a prayer life then what is your reason for staying away from the prayer closet? Is it sleep, friendships, work, household responsibilities, laziness, etc…? Now ask yourself, does even one of these compare to facing death? Do you serve Jesus on your terms or his, by examining your prayer life? Are you consistent in prayer, are you bold in your witness, do you thank the Lord? When Daniel was placed into the lion’s den, the unbelieving king , <strong>“…arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions. 20 And when he came to the den, he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel… “Daniel, servant of the living God,has your God,whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”</strong> Daniel was known by the ungodly for being a servant of God. Is this your testimony among the unsaved? How do you know one way or the other?\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Phil"

              "<strong>2Timothy 2:3–4 , “3 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of<em> this</em> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier</strong>.”\r\n\r\n<strong>Servant of the Commander’s will</strong>\r\nWhat types of events or activities do people train or practice for? I have had to train for sports, competitions, tournaments in order to prepare myself to compete against my opponents. How would our spiritual life change if we took our approach to practicing for sport or musical instrument and applied it to being trained in our faith?<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Hebrews 5:14</strong> reads, “<strong>But solid food is for the mature</strong>—for those whose senses have been trained to distinguish between good and evil. The writer mentions for those whose senses have been <strong>trained</strong> to do something, and that something is to distinguish between good and evil. Each of us have came out of the world into faith in Christ Jesus if we are Christians, and we knew evil well, we loved it, we drank iniquity like water, we were dead in our sins and transgressions. After we were changed we began to see a great difference between good and evil, but yet there are still things that perhaps we still hold to things that the Scriptures consider evil. Do you gossip (1 Tim 5:13), are you a glutton (Proverbs 28:7)? Paul writes (<strong>Ephesians 5:3-7),</strong> “<strong>But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints; 4 neither filthiness, nor Foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 7 Therefore do not be partakers with them</strong>.” The metaphor of the Christian life as warfare (against the evil world system, the believer’s sinful human nature, and Satan) is a familiar one in the NT (cf. <strong>2 Cor. 10:3–5; Eph. 6:10–20; 1 Thess. 4:8; 1 Tim. 1:18; 4:7; 6:12</strong>). Here Paul is dealing with the conflict against the hostile world and the persecution which believers were facing (cf. v. 9; 1:8; 3:11,12; 4:7).\r\n\r\nIf you desire to serve God as your commander, then you as a good solider you will heed His leadership, His word, as He strengthens you in Christ Jesus. Yet he calls you not to take part in the affairs of this life (the evil things previously mentioned). For example, when one is gossiping at the office do you engage or disengage in the gossip, or perhaps share that you would rather not be a part of the conversion? When you are invited to a movie that blasphemes God’s name, is filled with smut and vulgarity do you accept the invitation or reject it? John MacArthur shares, “<em>A military soldier doesn’t </em><strong><em>entangle himself, </em></strong><em>because his call to duty is completely severed from the normal affairs of civilian life, so also must the good soldier of Jesus Christ refuse to allow the things of the world to distract him (cf. <b>James 4:4; 1 John 2:15–17</b>)</em> (<em>The MacArthur Study Bible)</em>.\r\n\r\nWe pull away from the things that we used to do, and replace those things with godly living, for this purpose, <strong>“[that] he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier</strong>.” Recall the account of King David’s men. “<strong>David longed for water and said, \"Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!\" So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD. \"Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!\" he said. \"Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?\" And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men. (2Sam 23:15-17)</strong>\r\n\r\nDavid was the King that had a desire, water. He didn’t give a command, he didn’t make his request part of his men’s job description, and he didn’t have an expectation that these three men should take up the task of his “craving” for water from Bethlehem. King David was in the line of Jesus Christ as reads in <b>Matt 1:1</b> “<em>A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham</em>:”\r\n\r\n<strong>Three mighty men</strong> out of loyalty to David went well beyond “the call of duty.” They were brave and courageous with only three of them breaking through the host of the Philistine army after their twelve mile journey to get there. These men had to break through enemy lines, the Philistine garrison (outpost) in Bethlehem, retrieved the water, and brought it back to David. These men were not commissioned to do this task. They sacrificed their very lives not to gain clout or merit, not to be in the Israeli hall of fame, and not even advance the victory for their army. No these men had one thing on their minds, to bring some water to their king! Why, because this is what would please the King. With loyalty and honor they risked their lives, “counting their lives worth nothing,” just to please the King to which they longed to do, even putting themselves in “death’s way,”. <strong>Haggai 1:8</strong> reads, “<strong>Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,\"says the LORD”. God is our King and desires me to please Him! Are you serving God on His terms, with the motive to please him who has called you? Make Psalm 139:23-24 your prayer this week and always, as you serve him as your highest duty, on His terms for His pleasure.</strong>\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Phil the Evangelist, </strong>"

              "<strong>Joshua 24:14-15,”14“Now therefore,fear the Lord, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt.Serve the Lord!15 And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord,choose for yourselves this day whom you willserve, whetherthe gods which your fathers served thatwere on the other side ofthe River, orthe gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. Butas for me and my house, we willserve the Lord”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Serving Jesus with your talents.</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nThere are so many gifted people in the world in respect to sports, the arts, philosophy, science, theology, construction, etc…. It is interesting that many that began to use their gifts in the church, at some point used it as a stepping stone to use their gifts toward the world. For example, I believe that Pop singer Britney Spears was raised in the Southern Baptist Convention, and began using her voice to sing in church. However, when one looks at her life now, the talent that God gave her has not been one that it used for the Kingdom of God, but rather for the Kingdom of Darkness. There are a number of people that have done the same thing. Why is that? Perhaps it is because there is certainly more fame and fortune outside the church, than inside. However, I would submit in light of this, it depends on who one looking to serve. Everyone serves either God or Satan (although one does not need to be a Satan worshipper to serve Satan).\r\n\r\nRecall the challenge of Joshua who turned to the people and challenged them to make a decision as read in the following: <strong> Joshua 24:14-15,”14“Now therefore,fear the Lord, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt.Serve the Lord!15 And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord,choose for yourselves this day whom you willserve, whetherthe gods which your fathers served thatwere on the other side ofthe River, orthe gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. Butas for me and my house, we willserve the Lord” </strong>Joshua was willing to challenge people in his influence to make a decision as to who they would serve.\r\n\r\nOnce one decides to serve the Lord, one must serve Him in a manner that pleases Him, as I have shared earlier in these series. Jesus tells the parables of the talents in <strong>Matthew 25 </strong>saying, “<strong>Forthe kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country,who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them.15 And toone he gave five talents, toanother two, and toanother one,to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey.”</strong> Notice that the servants were called by the master, and it seemed that the master was the one that knew the abilities of his servants. Then he decided that the talents were to be distributed each ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ABILITY! Each one had different abilities, and the amount of talents was given in light of the responsibility that the master placed on the servant according to their own ability. Upon the return of the master, he would pronounce his approval or disapproval of each servant.\r\n\r\nThe first and second servant, who received five talents and ten talents, pleased the master and doubled their talents. The Lord said, “<strong>Welldone, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things,I will make you ruler over many things. Enter intothe joy of your lord.”</strong> These received the joy of the lord. The servant that received one talent, however didn’t please the master<strong>. “24“Then he who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Look, there you have what is yours.’26“But his lord answered and said to him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed. 27 So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents. 29‘For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”</strong>\r\n\r\nWeeping and gnashing of teeth which are terms that describe Hell, or enter into the joy of the Lord which is a term that describes heaven. Now this does not mean that one can work one’s way into heaven, because one is saved by grace, and this not of oneself (<strong>Ephesians 2:8,9</strong>), but one will show one’s faith by how one lives, and also what one does with the talents that Jesus has given them. Even the wicked are given talents by God, but only those that invest themselves in the Kingdom of God will be rewarded by God. One day at the Judgment (Bema) Seat of Christ each believer will be judged on various things including how one used their talents to serve God. Servants of Jesus desire to bring Him joy, because in the presence of the Lord is fullness of Joy, and the joy of the Lord is one’s strength. In the parable, the talents, are actually money.\r\n\r\nDo you serve the Lord with your finances and your abilities as well? Are the gifts that God has gifted you with for your glory or for His? Think about your talents, how are they utilized, how do they operate in service to the King?\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Phil </strong>"

              "<strong>Proverbs 22:6, “Train up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not depart from it”</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is one of those scriptures I struggled to understand having observed what happens in homes including ours. One thing that bothered me was seeing children from even Christian homes go astray, walk away from God and go their way. They were raised going to church, in the word, parents prayed for them and this is what they turned out to become?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHow is this verse then applicable when it suggests that if you train the child the way he should go, HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM THE TEACHING? Already it appears they are departing according to these statistics “<strong>88% of children raised in evangelical homes leave church at the age of 18 never to return</strong>.” That is an alarming rate. Having studied this verse, the Lord would have me understand it this way, “<em>train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, however hard he may try to run away from the teaching, it will always be present with him, he cannot depart from it</em>”. Whatever he was taught or observed at home will not depart from him. That is why it’s important that children be invested in. As a parent, you don’t want to suffer the heartache of your children rebelling against their Christian upbringing. While only God can save us and keep us, there are biblical principles you can implement to help prevent your children from tragically falling away from the faith even in their later years in life.\r\n\r\nI remember my dad setting the best example for his children and so was mom. I learn more by observing and many of his teachings in my life came from observing his Christian walk. My dad was (is) a prayer warrior, who conquered more devils in his family on his knees. To raise up a big family sometimes making tough decisions had to be done on his knees (praying). I listened to him many times praying for our future (my siblings and I); to be used of God one day, to have godly blessed relationships, to make intelligent decisions, to be successful etc. I learnt what it meant to be in a good respectable relationship by watching him treat his wife (my mom). What I’m I saying, even in my teenage life where the urge to rebel was beginning to creep in, their teachings, their life style could not depart from me. This is why it’s important that parents live an example of grace before their children through worship, reading of the word, praying, relating to each other (husband and wife), and how you train your children. It’s sad when spouses fight before their children, disrespecting each other before their kids. Do everything with dignity, set an example to your children. At times it’s good to show tough love, it may not be popular at the time you are giving it but it will be appreciated later in life. Seeing dads become more responsible at home sets an example to the boys, its key, it’s vital. Who better teach them what it means to work hard, be responsible, have character and integrity than the parents?\r\n\r\nI believe this could be a reason to have brought home the prodigal son in <strong>Luke 15:17-19, “17 “But when he came to himself, …! 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, 19 and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants”. </strong>I don’t think only the food and the good life at home would have driven him to go back. Love, support, the teachings he had received would bring him back home. Yes he tried to run away from them all, but they would not. The earlier teachings brought him to himself to revisit how he was raised and how he turned everything into a mess. This brought about the heart of repentance and willing to go back home because regardless of where he had been, and who would not receive him, he knew he had a father who loved him and would be willing to receive him. How did he know, he had learnt it years back. It is a tough job but you and I have a responsibility to train and therefore it starts with us. We cannot teach what we don’t know and are not willing to live. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Mark 8:22-26, “22 Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him. 23 So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything. 24 And he looked up and said, “I see men like trees, walking.” 25 Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s a scary thing to have the blind leading where a pair of eyes is needed to lead. If you knew of a pilot who was about to fly a plane and you discovered he was blind or a driver of a car, you would be very hesitant to board that plane or get into that car. There is something special about the eyes none of us would want to take for granted. Over 570 times, the word eye(s) has been referenced in the bible.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe definition of eyes in a dictionary is that its is an organ of vision. It’s the window to our souls. Two things I find fascinating, is that the brain that can never be full (out of memory) and the eyes can never be considered to have seen enough so as not to receive anymore.\r\n\r\nWe now come to Mark where Jesus meets this blind man brought to Him. If you read Mark’s writing, he is fond of using the word “immediately”. In other words, every miracle Jesus did, you hear Mark saying immediately something happened. And here we see the only gradual miracle done by the Lord I’ve come across to demonstrate something.\r\n\r\nFirst He leads the man by the hand out of the town away from people of unbelief. The most important in my judgment as I read this passage, He wanted alone time with this man plus only those who believed Him, (His disciples). Then He does something we would consider unusual, spat in the man’s eyes then touched it. Then Jesus asks him if he sees anything, his reply, “I see men like trees”, then He touched his eyes again and he was restored.\r\n\r\nChrist showed in what method those commonly are healed by His grace, which by nature are spiritually blind. At first, their knowledge is confused; but, like the light of the morning, it shines more and more to the perfect day, and then they see all things clearly.\r\n\r\nI see Five things that are related to this blind man’s eyes being opened. 1. The leading of the Master 2. The demonstration of God’s power to make His name great among people, 3. To cause a man who had heard of Him but never had the privilege of seeing Him see Him 4. To bring about a point that its Christ gradually opens the eyes of those seeking Him to see clearly what they could not see on their own, 5. To meet a physical need of one who needed it and believed that only one could make it happen.\r\n\r\nJohn Gill, “<em>Christ's taking the blind man by the hand, and leading him out or the town, and spitting on his eyes, and putting his hands upon him, and then asking him if he saw ought, are emblematical of what he does in spiritual conversion, when he turns men from darkness to light: he takes them by the hand, which expresses his condescension, grace, and mercy, and becomes their guide and leader; and a better, and safer guide they cannot have; he brings them by a way they know not, and leads them in paths they had not known before; makes darkness light before them, and crooked things straight, and does not forsake them: he takes them apart, and separates them from the rest of the world; he calls them out from thence to go with him, teaching them, that, when enlightened by him, they should have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, and the workers of them; for what communion has light with darkness? his putting spittle upon his eyes, may signify the means of grace, the eye salve of the word, which, when attended with a divine power, enlightens the eyes; and which power may be represented here by Christ's putting his hands upon the man; for the Gospel, without the power of Christ, Is insufficient to produce such an effect; but when it is accompanied with that, it always succeeds</em>”, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Judges 6:11-27, \"12 And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, “The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor!” 13 Gideon said to Him, “O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, ‘Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image1.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6414 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"221\" /></a> </strong>\r\n\r\nMeditating on encouragements has opened my heart and mind to many men and women in the bible who encountered discouragements in the lives. These were normal people and their true stories are encouragement to us too that if they overcame their discouraging times, we too can.\r\n\r\nToday I look at a man by the name of Gideon as told in <strong>Judges 6</strong>. Gideon's discouragement is a little different because he felt the Lord was against him and his people. He felt that God had allowed the Midianites to attack them year in year out. He couldn't turn to God whom he felt was against him. If you read <strong>Numbers 31</strong>, you will find that the Israelites had very much defeated the Midianites under the leadership of Moses. The Midianites were no march to them.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHow did it come that the Midianites became a thorn in the flesh unto the Israelites? Vs 1 tells us, <strong>\"Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Midian for seven years,\" </strong>in simple words, the Midianites oppressed Israel as a tool in God's hands. And if you know what oppression is, it is to inflict distress or dominate harshly. This drove the Israelites hiding in caves, mountains and strongholds. The Midianites would come in year in and year out to destroy their produce and their animals leaving them with no sustenance. In this we are told of Gideon who knew well that the hand of the Lord was driving the Midianites against him and his people and like others, he was hiding, distressed, confused, discouraged with no one to turn to.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. “11 Now the Angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from the Midianites\", </strong>looking at the way this verse and others here are presented and punctuated, you find that the Angel of the Lord is identified as the Lord Himself. Either He appeared as an Angel or Gideon would have seen Him as an Angel. Whichever way, the Lord was present with him and watching him struggle threshing wheat in the winepress to hide it. He was used to using oxen to do this kind of job, now he was doing it the hard way by hand, hiding hoping the Midianites would not recognize him or see his stuff.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. “12 And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, “The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor!”</strong> How can it be that the Lord would say He is with him when the current situation painted another picture? Not only that, He called him a mighty man of valor? Doesn't make sense and he challenges it, <strong>vs.”13 Gideon said to Him, “O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us?” </strong>Right now there are people who messed up in some areas and are facing trials and are feeling like the Lord is against them and is out to destroy them. They can't turn to the Lord because of their shame. They know that Lord is dealing with them but feels like He is against them. Feeling like Gideon hiding under the wine press hoping your enemy will not find you? Let this be an encouragement, the Lord is with you and will bring you through. If He was against you, He would have had the enemy destroy you long time ago. The bible says <strong>Proverbs 3:12, \"For whom the LORD loves He corrects, Just as a father the son in whom he delights\". </strong>He has not forsaken the one He corrects<strong>.</strong>\r\n\r\nHow was the Lord with Gideon anyway? God prevented him from being captured, God gave him wisdom on how to keep something for himself. Even in his discouragement, he wasn't suicidal. His tribe was the weakest yet the Lord prepared a leader to be. If you feel the Lord is against you, how come you still have life? Are you going without food? Are there enemies driving you out of your home? etc. Yes we have tough times but are we seeing the Lord present even in them for us to be encouraged that He has it all under control? Gideon was wondering whether the Lord was with him because there were no miracles or victories like before. I would say they were very much present but not as he expected them. Not only did the Lord tell him He was with him, He also called him mighty in that when he was done with him he would be one. <strong>Job 23:10, “But He knows the way that I take; When He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold”.</strong>\r\n\r\nMy message this morning is this, the Lord is with you right where you are. You may feel His correcting rod, you should rejoice because the enemy does not have the rod of correction in his hands; he is a destroyer of life. <strong>Psalm 23:4, “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me\" </strong>The shepherd’s club and crook are viewed as comforting instruments of protection and direction, respectively.

              "<strong>1Samuel 25:2-35, “32 Then David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! 33 And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6205\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"276\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest asset a woman wants in a relationship is COMMITMENT, a thing that haunts many men. Someone made a joke saying, \"<em>he saw a man standing there like he came out of a bad dream because he said the woman he cared for wanted something he couldn't give her, COMMITMENT</em>”. <!--more-->I know for sure that there are men who have chosen loneliness and called it freedom just because commitment wasn't part of their vocabulary. As a man, I know we are quick to making hasty decisions, something that gratifies quickly. Something more of now, then comes the woman who sees far beyond now. She evaluates, equates, weighs things to make better judgment on anything be it on spending, building a home, raising children, on the job. She is not just looking at today, she is looking at down the road. How will decisions made today affect her and her family in the near future. She is looking for stability and security.\r\n\r\nHusbands would agree with me about this because we know that had it not been for our wives who encouraged and advised us is some areas, we would have made decisions which would have made mess of things. God made men help meet (women) because men couldn't handle it themselves as one preacher puts it. Men loose things, women find them. <strong>Women want commitment then they step in committed to make it better by helping their partners make better judgments</strong>. When men get angry, at times it becomes easier for them to make poor judgments and that is the case with David. David was in the wilderness and he encountered Nabal a very wicked man married to a beautiful woman, a woman of understanding Abigail. David had protected Nabal's servants and even protected Nabal's wealth not losing a thing. In time of need, David sent some of his men to Nabal for a favor. Nabal spoke harshly to David's men, vs. “<strong>10 Then Nabal answered ..., “Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master. 11 Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men when I do not know where they are from?”. </strong>Upon getting this message, David became angry and told his men to gird themselves with swords. Not only was David coming to destroy Nabal, he was coming to destroy the whole family, plus the servants and the wealth. Imagine Abigail suffering all these because of one man's hasty decision.\r\n\r\nNabal's servants knew of what would befall them and instead of going to plead with Nabal, they turned to Nabal's wife Abigail, narrated how David had been kind to them and how Nabal treated David's servants. Nabal's servants knew what their fate would be if nothing happened. They told Abigail, vs. “<strong>17 Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that one cannot speak to him.”</strong> The servants knew Abigail pretty well to know that she will make a better judgment in a situation that seemed impossible. She had a way of turning curses into blessings. If Nabal only knew the kind of wife he had, if David only knew the woman about to come his way, if we only knew the women God has put in our lives, we would thank God for them even more. They were our first supporters and committed to making our relationships better by helping us men make better decisions. God brought them for a reason and we are yet to learn more. To continue…Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Samuel 25:2-35, 32 Then David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! 33 And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand\"</strong>\r\n\r\nGoing back to the text, I see two different people, Abigail beautiful and of good understanding and Nabal a fool, the meaning of his name. Abigail has regards for God, Nabal has no regards for God. Maybe in his heart he said there was no God the reason the bible says<strong>, \"A fool has said in his heart there is no God</strong>\" (paraphrased).<!--more--> In all this we still see a woman committed to protecting even the one who doesn't deserve to be protected letting God have His way in her life. She had opportunities to destroy her husband yet not lifting a finger. There is no indication she was in abusive relationship, all I can see is a greedy husband who had no regard for other people and he was about to be spared because of her believing wife<strong>. 1Corinthians 7:13, “... if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. 14 For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife,... (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. “23 Now when Abigail saw David, she dismounted quickly from the donkey, fell on her face before David, and bowed down to the ground. 24 So she fell at his feet and said: “On me, my lord, on me let this iniquity be! And please let your maidservant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your maidservant.” </strong>Why would Abigail take the fault for what her husband did? Perhaps she saw that in marriage you are a unit in good and in bad times. If one is failing, that means the other partner is also affected. Couples can withdraw when the going gets tough, some have only stuck together in good times. Bad times really separated them hence turning around looking for faults and blaming them on each other. <strong>The enemy fights unity in marriages</strong>, if he can set the couple to fight each other, there will be no room to fight him. He is looking for ways to display dirty laundry couples will use against each other. Lack of unity has destroyed many marriages, everything is about me and mine where is ours? They say another killer in marriage is finances, my money and your money there is no our money, no unity even in finances. Remember Nabal saying <strong>my bread and my water and my meat , my shearers</strong>. Abigail takes fault to save their (our) family. <strong>If we only knew the enemy was after our unity, we would fight him who tries to build a wedge between couples</strong>.\r\n\r\nAbigail brings food to David and his men and the first thing she does, repents seeking that all the evil to be on her. Can you see this woman putting her life on the line for her husband? I'm not sure of how many husbands would do the same for their wives and vice versa. Christ was willing to put His life on the line for the ones He loved. He said I love you, then demonstrated it by drying on the cross. If only the sinner knew and understood the sacrifice Christ had to make because of His love, a sinner would repent of his sins and trust in Christ alone with his life. His desire would be to live a life pleasing to the one who first loved him. Christ became the role model for husbands, <strong>Ephesians 5:25, \"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;\". To put it in another way, husbands demonstrate your love by putting your lives on the line for your wives. She should not lose her number 2 place in his life after God (He is FIRST)</strong>.

              "<strong>1Samuel 25:2-35, “32 Then David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! 33 And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAn encouraged person is alive person. Who wants to be around a discouraged person who always talks about nothing but failures and problems? I come across such people, always discouraged. You encourage them today, they will be discouraged tomorrow. When they call you, they wear you down with their discouragements. At times I'm not sure if their calling is to get encouragement or to find someone to join their pity party.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI for one do well with encouragements and husbands need encouragements from their wives. <strong>Behind that macho presentation there is a vulnerability shelled with macho appearance looking for an encouragement to touch it.</strong> I think that some wives feel like their encouragements will not be significant, or he doesn't need one or he appears strong enough to make it without encouragements. A wife who is the number one supporter of her husband has something inside of her that can touch her husband in a way that no one else can. Wives give their husbands a reason to move forward by believing in them and verbalizing it. <strong>Men have feelings too that need a touch from a loving wife</strong>. You've heard some wives tell their husbands how useless they are and how they will never amount to anything, this has killed them even more. They did not look forward to going home and even the need to try was shattered by a judgment already passed with no room for improvement and development. An encouragement will make him try harder and will make him a better husband.\r\n\r\nWhat was Abigail's encouragement to David, <strong>28 ... ... the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, ..., and evil is not found in you throughout your days. 29 Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; .... 30 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD has done for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you ruler over Israel.”</strong> Was David not a mighty warrior? Yes he was and just like any other man, his feelings and vulnerability was shelled by macho appearance needing an encouragement to pierce through the macho appearance to touch the inner being. An encouragement to melt. Maybe he was considered a warrior with no feelings just putting a show and doing the work. Even pastors, evangelists, elders, deacons, teachers, preachers, bosses, ceo's who have excelled in their offices need encouragements. What Abigail was somehow telling David was, \"<em>you don't need to do any shady business to make it to the top, follow God's ways and he will make ways for you for it's not by might nor by power but by His spirit says the Lord\"</em>. Even if you've been offended and should seek revenge, calm yourself down and see how much damage you will do to your reputation, your destiny. Don't do anything you will regret.\r\n\r\nIt may be hard for a husband to admit he needs encouragement, I pray the wives will learn the signals that calls for encouragements. If only wives knew how much their husbands crave for encouragements, they would seek ways to less criticize them and encourage them more. An encouragement will keep him alive and hopeful.

              "<strong>1Samuel 25:2-35, “32 Then David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! 33 And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIf we are going to make it, we need to be open to advice and counsel. The reason we have counsel is because someone else sees what we are blind to see, is experienced, or we are just ignorant of it. I would say it's hard for some people to take advice from their juniors or from the ones they feel they are superior to. <strong>Advice and counsel gives you a chance to add what you are learning new to what you already know to see far beyond what you could see with your limited knowledge.</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nHusbands are going to have to humble themselves to some wise advice from their wives and not feel like it's robbing them of their position as a man and the priest of his home. A husband who is insecure within himself may not be willing to throw in the towel and seek advice, maybe because he might feel his HUMILITY will be a SIGN of WEAKNESS. <strong>Humility is not a weakness, it's strength under control.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. \"32 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, Who sent you this day to meet me.\" </strong>David could have dismissed Abigail because she was a woman, and what advice would a woman give a warrior leading over 600 other warriors, a successful soldier promised to be king? What possible reason would make David heed to the advice of a woman who is not even his wife? Simple, HUMILITY. His humility to heed to the voice of Abigail did not rob him of his manhood and position, if anything it channeled him to greater levels. He would have tried to impress his soldiers by not listening to her but the choice he made once again was out of humility. Abigail may have not realized that God sent her to meet David, David knew pretty well that it was God. Wives, do you realize God has put you in your marriage for a reason? And some of the wise advice He has deposited in you to give is to draw you closer to him as he sees how well favored he is to have such a wonderful wife who cares for his life, destiny and relationship? <strong>Proverbs 31:10, \" A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. 11 Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. 12 She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life\" (NIV). </strong>What a blessing to know that you are more than just a wife but a voice also that God can use to get your husband's attention. <strong>What if marriage was created by God not to make us happy as number one reason but to teach us things about God we would not learn in any other way? That through it we are shaped in the image of God</strong>. I believe there are some accomplishments be it in ministry, work, society that will never be complete without being in a marriage. Abigail that day became a voice God could use to speak to David preventing him from bloodshed and messing the victories God had in line for him. We are blessed when we take advice and we are a blessing when we do.\r\n\r\nHumility may appear to be a setback for some husbands but I believe it tailors him to greater things, why, \"<strong>God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble</strong>\". A humble husband is a husband respected <strong>Proverbs 31:23, \"Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>If only husbands would know that humility is not a sign of weakness, they would heed to those good advices they receive for they are not of men but of God, Blessings Ev</strong>"

              "<strong>Luke 10:20, “Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are certain expressions used to describe people who seem to listen to one’s good news, and then upon hearing it, they find a way to kill the mood. Some additional expressions are being a “party pooper,” “a kill joy,” “a wet blanket,” etc… These types of people seem to have a “gift” of discouraging people.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what I imagine the seventy disciples experienced when Jesus dialoged with them as they came in from the field of ministry. They returned after a powerful time of team ministry, and their highlight was seeing that they were used to deliver demonized people by the name of Jesus. As Jesus hears the words of the disciples he shares what I imagine initially took them by surprise when He states, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven<strong>.Luke 10:19, “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”</strong> Jesus’ focus here was most likely not on the fall of Satan from <strong>Isaiah 14</strong> and <strong>Ezekiel 28</strong>, but He rather spoke hyperbolically here, pointing out that the ministry of the disciples was a direct assault on Satan’s authority and influence upon those that were just delivered. Satan has been a problem for humanity since the Garden of Eden, with all his influential lies and deceptive tactics, which is why he is called the Father of Lies (<strong>John 8:44</strong>), who masquerades himself as an angel of light (<strong>2Corinthians 11:14</strong>) roaming around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour (<strong>1Peter 5:8</strong>).\r\n\r\nJesus continues sharing what He sees having happened by <strong>saying: “Look I have given you the authority in My name to trample on snakes and scorpions and over all power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.”</strong> Jesus was saying that the authority to do these miraculous exploits did not originate in the disciples, but originated in Jesus and His authority. Jesus promised protection to His disciples that are in His keeping power which is greater than Satan’s influence (<strong>Psalm 91:13</strong>).\r\n\r\nA flee would have a better chance of defeating a heard of stampeding elephants, than Satan would have of defeating Christ and the Church by his evil influence. Jesus said, “<strong>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled</strong>”, (<strong>John 17</strong>).” The son of perdition is a reference to Judas, which was a false convert, and I believe is a representative of false converts, which are those that sit among God’s people but are really not Christian, but are goats, or wolves in sheep clothing. He was under the influence of Satan as one recalls Jesus’ words to His disciples, “…<strong>one of you is a devil.” </strong>Jesus says, “…<strong>nothing will ever harm you</strong>.” How encouraging are those words toward the genuine follower of Christ? Nothing will EVER harm you, hence wickedness from the kingdom of Satan will NEVER overtake you. Paul writes in <strong>Romans 8:34-30, “34 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe real reason to rejoice is not that the demonic spirits are submitting to you, but rather because your name in engraved in heaven! Rejoice because the name demons submit to, is the same name that purchased your salvation! Luke writes<strong>, Acts 4:12, “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved</strong>.” How wonderful it is that God’s children have their names written in His Book of Life (<strong>Revelation 20:15</strong>). It is not that God’s children will not experience the effects of Satan’s storms, but that they will never overtake the Christian. Remember Job when Satan attacked him, God allowed him to be attacked, but He would not let Satan kill Job (<strong>Job 1:12</strong>). After going through all that Job went through he cried out, “<strong>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him</strong>: <strong>but I will maintain mine own ways before him (13:15)</strong> <strong>…For I knowthat my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 26 And though after  my skin worms destroy this body, yetin my flesh shall I see God</strong> (<strong>Job 19:25</strong>).”When one considers all of life’s experiences ultimately what could match seeing God! The disciples saw the demons submitting to them, but Jesus said their names are engraved in heaven; they would see God the Father, as they have seen the Jesus the Son. I look forward to seeing the Lord one day, even though He has done ministry exploits through my life, nothing will match seeing Him as He is. Oh, when we see the source of Gospel Himself what a day, glorious day that will be, and to see our names engraved in the book of life. I close with the words from the famous hymn, What a Day That Will Be:\r\n\r\nWhat a day that will be\r\n\r\nWhen my Je-sus I shall see,\r\n\r\nAnd I look up-on His face,\r\n\r\nThe one who saved me by His grace.\r\n\r\nWhen He takes me by the hand,\r\n\r\nAnd leads me through the Prom-ised Land,\r\n\r\nWhat a day, glo-ri-ous day that will be.\r\n\r\nMay you appreciate God’s gift of everlasting life, and may you seek and save the lost so others will know this same salvation.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Phillip the Evangelist (Acts 21:8) &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>1Samuel 1:10 , \"10 In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD. 11 And she made a vow, saying, \"O LORD Almighty , if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nOur society is one that thrives on ownership. There are copyright laws on movies, songs, books, and deeds for houses, and titles for cars, etc... all showing owner of things. However when one has a child to\r\nwhom does that child belong? The Psalmist wrote, <strong>Psalm 127:3, “Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward from Him.\"</strong> In the book of Samuel we are met by a woman in bitterness of soul because she was barren. In those days to be barren was considered to be cursed by God. Hannah would weep and fast from food because she wanted a son so bad and her heart was in deep anguish.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHannah vows a vow and tells the Lord that if He will grant her a son, she will give him back to the Lord all the days of his life. Wow, if the Lord gives her what she yearns for, she will give her son away to the Lord. God takes our vows very seriously as Solomon points out in <strong>Ecclesiastes 5:4-5, \"4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. 5 It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it</strong>.\" Hannah makes her vow in prayer to the Lord, and Eli the priest confirms the answer from the Lord, that indeed God had heard her prayer, and she would have a son. This word from the Lord lifted her spirit and she was no longer sad. God's Word met her right where she was. He met her sadness with joy, hopelessness with hope, and barrenness with a child. Her son is born, to become the prophet Samuel who would later anoint King David to the throne of Israel. Hannah's prayer was desperate, selfless, and committed.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Desperate prayer.</strong> Hannah was in a time of desperation. Much more can be said of women in those days bearing children, but this was her heart’s desire and she brought it to God. Where do you bring your\r\ndeepest hearts desires, your dreams, your vision? Do you bring them to the Lord, or elsewhere?\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Selfless prayer.</strong> Hannah's prayer was answered, and \"unto her a child was given.\" However she promised God that she would give Him to the Lord all the days of Samuel’s life. The very child she was\r\ndesperate for, she was willing to give him back to the Lord as a gift. Are you selfish in your prayers, or selfless? Jesus prayed, \"<strong>not my will be yours be done</strong>.\" Before we can pray \"<strong>Thy Kingdom\r\ncome [thy will be done],\" we must be willing to pray \"my kingdom go [my will be gone] ALAN REDPATH</strong>.\"\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Committed prayer</strong>. Hannah did not delay in fulfilling her vow to the Lord. Hannah brought Samuel to Eli the priest and he was offered up to the Lord saying, \"<strong>Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am\r\nthe woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. 27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: 28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD</strong>.\" When God answers your prayer in a vow do your keep your end of the vow?\r\n\r\nAre you desperate for the Lord? Is your prayer selfless and are you committed to serve Him with that which He gives you, whether things or people. Give to the Lord that which He has given you.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>1Peter 3:15, \"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense (reason) to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe appreciate messages on life enhancements, steps to happiness, how to live a successful life, how to prosper and the like. These messages are good and we should love them but the messages on holiness, righteousness, purity, sanctification, concentration, servant hood should have a greater impact in a life of a believer. The <strong>Benefactor ought to be greater than the benefits. </strong> Christ is the PRIME product so to speak, not the by product. We serve Him because He is worthy of our service.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nA weak example I can use that might drive this point home is this, If you apply for a job in a company, the main thing is not the benefits but the job itself. As you discuss the nature of the job, the requirements, the salary, the environment, the expectations somewhere in between you will discuss the benefits. I don't think that anyone applies for a job primarily for benefits. With this in mind, the first question I ask myself, why I'm I serving Christ? Why did I come to Christ?. I believe that our understanding of why we serve Christ helps eliminates many things that we get frustrated with when we have a clear understanding of why we chose or better, why Christ chose us in the first place. Did I come to serve because He promised me life enhancement, happiness, comfort? Why are you serving Christ?\r\n\r\nI came to Christ primarily because He offered eternal life and bring glory to His name. <strong>Hebrews 9:27, says \"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this is judgment</strong>\" and His judgment will not be based on the life enhancement, it will be based on whether I repented of my sins and received Christ by faith. <strong>If coming to Christ is to receive the gift of eternal life, then serving Christ is life sustenance on the gift </strong>and letting other people know that “<strong>Christ in us the hope of glory”.</strong> We become witnesses of the saving grace. If someone pointed you to Christ, should you not be compelled to do the same?\r\n\r\nOf course serving Christ does have benefits too, <strong>Psalm 103:1-4, \"…, Bless the Lord, O my soul and forget not His benefits, Who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who redeem your life from destruction, who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfies your mouth with goods things etc</strong>\". So should I give up on Christ if some of these benefits are not provided? no, because my coming to Him was to receive the gift of eternal life. <strong>We need to put the emphasis on the hope to come and not on the benefits</strong> that are temporary.\r\n\r\n<strong>Serving Christ is not about happiness but righteousness</strong>. <strong>Romans 14:17, \"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost\"</strong>. Meat and drink is about happiness, for believers it's more than that, it's righteousness, holiness, purity, peace that surpasses all understanding, unspeakable joy full of Holy Ghost. Happiness depends on circumstance, <strong>joy depends on the promise that regardless of what happens, I have the joy of knowing that one day when this life is over I will be with Him in heaven. </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1Peter 3:15, \"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense (reason) to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear\".</strong> Sanctify is to set apart for sacred use, it's also to make holy and purify. The definition I love, sanctify is to <strong>make productive of holiness</strong>. The Lord is holy, because He lives in us, we have to set ourselves apart in readiness for His use. We have to desire holiness and purity. Our uniqueness will raise questions and what a joy to stand and respond confidently the reason why we serve Christ, we contend for the faith.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to give an answer if someone was to ask you of your hope in Christ? If asked, would you answer with meekness (submissive, patient, humbleness) and fear (extreme reverence)?. I want to be different in the sight of men and when they ask what makes me different, I will not be afraid and intimidated to speak of the hope that lies within me. This serves even as a great reminder of why I serve Christ. Blessings Ev"

              "<p><strong>Isaiah 35:8-10, \"8 And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not journey on it; it will be for those who walk in that Way; wicked fools will not go about on it. 9 No lion will be there, nor will any ferocious beast get up on it; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there, 10 and the ransomed of the LORD will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away\"</strong> Robert Frost wrote, \"<strong>Two roads diverged in a wood, I took the one less traveled by, and I- And that has made all the difference</strong>\". <!--more-->If we choose the right road it will make all the difference in life for us as well. Life has often been described as the way one lives on a way, a path, a road, or other such words that depict travel, journeying or direction. Isaiah says \"a highway will be there,\" which is to say that there is a certain highway that is ever present. However although the highway can be seen clearly, not all see it. Even all those who do see it do not travel on it. Why not? It is because it is \"<strong>called the way of holiness</strong>\", as all highways have a name.</p><p>What kind of terrain does this highway have? Is it smooth, void of bumps, potholes, and sharp turns? No, it has its fair share of all of these and more. God Himself is the architect of this road. It is not an easy road to take, because this is not a highway that one can travel on in their own strength. This is a road that one must \"<strong>be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus (2Timothy 2:1). </strong>Since this is a road of holiness, only the redeemed of the Lord may journey on it. To redeem (<em>exagorazo</em>) means \"<strong>to buy out of slavery</strong>\" by paying a price. Christ paid our sin debt by dying on the cross. The redeemed is an elect family, the body of Christ, which helps one another to walk on. It is hard to know what to do at times on this road because one must \"walk in it by faith and not by sight.\" The road is not a wide road, but a rather narrow one because few find it in (Matt 7:14), and there is none other like it. Although many walk on this road, The Apostle Paul described his travels on this road as a race in which he ran for the prize promised. He said<strong>, \"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing (2Timothy 4:7-8</strong>).</p><p>Oh yes Christian if you are on this Highway of Holiness it is because you have the power of Christ in you, because, it is <strong>\"Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the LORD Almighty\" </strong> Oh He knows your every trial and uses them to strengthen and refine your faith in Him, because He has called you to walk by faith and not by sight. There is a crown of righteousness awaiting your victorious arrival and \"to all who have longed for His appearing, because <strong>\"He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him\" (Hebrews 11:6). </strong>So don’t give up and never give in. Get up after every bump you hit, climb out of each pothole that temporally may take you down, \"<strong>for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again</strong>\" <strong>(Proverbs 24:16), </strong>and live diligently with a reckless abandonment to \"<strong>press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me (you) heavenward in Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:14). </strong>Keep your eyes on the finish line though you cannot see it with the natural eye, your eyes of faith has the vision to see \"<strong>Him who is invisible\" (Hebrews 11:27). </strong>And for those that are in ministry or desire to be, then keep your run in the race steady and don’t give up when your legs of faith grow weary. Keep running a good race, and \"<strong>Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up\", Galatians 6:9).</strong></p><p><strong>Application: Be encouraged; stay on the Highway of Holiness, even if it is The Road Less Traveled it is the road Jesus instructed on us to take (Matthew 7:14). You don’t want to travel on the alternative road, the Broad Way (Matthew 7:13)!! Blessings Pastor Phil</strong></p>"

              "<p><strong>2Chronicles 30:17-20, \"17 For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover lambs for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to the Lord. 18 For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the good Lord provide atonement for everyone 19 who prepares his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.” 20 And the Lord listened to Hezekiah and healed the people”</strong><!--more--> I was reading 2 Chronicles chapter 30 this morning in my devotional time, this chapter as you all know is about king Hezekiah and how he was instrumental in bringing true worship back to all Israel and Judah.... you read in the previous chapter how he went right to work with opening up the temples, and getting the Levites and priesthood to return back to true worship , chapter 29. This king did not give up, but encouraged everyone, that there was work that needed to be done. The people needed to return to God, because they went after other things and the GOD Israel was not first in their lives. In chapter 30 we read, that the feast of Passover could not be celebrated until all were cleansed, and purified, including the officiating priest..... but the verses that I want to highlight here is in chapter 30 v 17,18. Since many of the people had not purified themselves, the Levites had to slaughter their Passover lamb for them, to set them apart for the Lord., later in that verse it says that King Hezekiah prayed for them. and v. 20 says and the Lord listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.......what example of prayer, he just did not want to have a \"religious rite\" or \"service\" but knew that God hears, and knew that the condition of the heart was far more important than a religious festival or rite. May we as God’s people not fall into that snare, but may we come to God, daily on our knees, weeping, and breaking before him. We need to be a HOLY people, and to be Holy we must pray and read his word daily and live that life of holiness.....I just wanted to share this from my heart, it is not criticism but an encouragement to me. As a Holy priesthood of believers let’s make prayer top priority, I too am working in this discipline as I walk in the Lord from day to day. Love you guys,., you mean the world to me. continue to lift me up in prayer... I need to be disciplined in this area and other areas as well. MARANATHA! Blessings Bro. Jose</p>"

              "<p><strong>Judges 15:15, \"He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it\"</strong></p><p>I saw “Apollo 13\" movie once or twice that taught me a biblical principle. As depicted in this movie, two days after the launch, the Apollo spacecraft was crippled by an explosion caused by an electrical fault in an oxygen tank. The explosion damaged the Service Module, resulting in a loss of oxygen and electrical power. A failed mission was aborted before it became successful. <!--more-->Not only did the mission fail, to bring the men back to earth safely was a challenge. At one, the man in charge on the ground began to work with his crew to find ways to bring the astronauts to a safe landing. He reached out to one of the top guys, engineers to explain what some of the systems were designed to do only to be told they were designed for specific tasks only and could not be used for anything else. His reaction, \"<em>forget everything the machines were designed to do or not do and let’s see how we can take what we have, modify them to do what we want done and bring the astronauts back home safely</em>\"<em>(paraphrased)</em>. And that is what they did and it worked. God has many ways of bringing victory in situations you thought were out of reach.</p><p>If you know the story of Samson, you will understand that he was a very unique individual. Born at a very specific time in history to fight against the Philistines. If you look at Joshua and David, they were men of war, trained and had men (warriors) with them. Samson was different, not born to be a warrior, had no training of any kind yet he would be used to deliver Israel from the Philistines as a one man army. After being born, he began to grow and God blessed him. He had seven locks of hair that was not supposed to be cut. It was a sign of God’s presence and strength. The uniqueness of Samson was, he did great and mighty things when the <strong>Spirit of God moved in his life</strong>. That is what the Spirit of God does; He empowers you to do what you have no ability to do. He makes you do the impossible by taking something in the natural and using it to accomplish something in the supernatural.</p><p>Anytime the Philistine faced him, the bible says, the Spirit of God would come upon him mightily and use him to destroy the enemy. On one particular day when he was delivered to the Philistine bound, the Spirit of God came upon him. There were so many men against him; he did not have any sophisticated weapons to fight back like Rambo. What was present, <strong>\"...a fresh jawbone of a donkey...”, Judges 15:15. </strong>To think about it, what can a jawbone do? God did not design it to be a weapon. It might injure one or two people, but how can you face over a thousand men with something like that? This is where the Spirit of God makes a difference. <strong>He empowers to the extent that you can take less and do much with it</strong>. <strong>The strength is not on the weapon but in the ability given to one to accomplish something</strong>. Jesus said in <strong>Luke 4:18, \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon, because He (God) has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor...” </strong>Jesus being on earth in the flesh, there are certain things He was limited to do (as designed by His coming) and God had empower Him through His Spirit. He laid aside His majesty and completely yielded to the power from above, the Holy Spirit. <strong>Acts 10:38, \"How God anointed Jesus Christ of Nazareth who went about doing good unto the children of man\".</strong> Just like the captain taking what was designed for other things and improvising it to use to bring victory in one area, so was the jawbone Samson used. God used something that was available, a jawbone. <strong>Judges 15:15, \"...reached out his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it\". </strong>It's not the jawbone that killed men, it's the Spirit of God driven through the jawbone that killed men. Anyone else who might have tried to take the same jawbone to do the same job and would have failed.</p><p>I want us to know that God can use anything around to bring victory in your life. It could be something around you that was never designed for what you want to accomplish but God could use it. It may just be a jawbone, not have significance or even look stupid to use. You may be waiting to see sophisticated things before you see yourself becoming victorious. Let this be a reminder to you, it is the Spirit of God that empowers not what is around. When Samson was done with the jawbone, he did not keep it because of the work it did. I believe the reason was, he knew God had used it just as a means to destroy the enemy. It was a temporary thing to use but it did a work to remember. Pray that the Spirit of God will empower you to take less and do much with it and more so be more like Christ. Blessings Ev</p>"

              "<strong>Luke 9:62, “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.” </strong>\r\n\r\nJesus Christ calls people to follow Him amidst various scenarios. When Christ calls someone, he or she may be “on top of the world” or “in the depths of despair,” or “anywhere in between”. Think for a moment of where you were when Christ called you to follow Him? I can recall that I was a young teen, an average student, heavily involved in sports, and religiously attending the Roman Catholic Church at the time. <!--more-->However upon realizing that “my goodness” would not merit eternal life in heaven, my previous understanding of God was shattered. Upon hearing the truth from the Bible for the first time, I was enlightened and convicted of my sins (breaking God’s 10 Commandments), this caused me to repent toward God and put my faith in Jesus Christ. Sometime afterwards I began ministry in my school, on the streets, and in other venues as began to unfold. Jesus had a conversation about commitment with three individuals. With that said let’s focus on the first of the three people Jesus encountered, in light of the above Scripture.\r\n\r\nThe first person we are introduced to in the context of <strong>Luke 9:62</strong> read, <strong>“And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest”. (9:57).</strong> This man makes a presumptuous claim that he would go wherever Jesus traveled. Many say they will follow Jesus, but Jesus is looking for followers not fans, not those that want to jump on the “band wagon. <strong><em>“</em>And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head”, (9:58).”</strong> Jesus travels to places that not all that say they are willing to go, actually follow when He looks to their level of commitment. There are numerous examples of this throughout the Scriptures, the rich young ruler (<strong>Mark 10</strong>), the various persons described in <strong>Luke 14</strong>, the famous <strong>John 6:66</strong>, and of course the examples given here in <strong>Luke 9:57–62</strong>. Jesus’ chief destination was to the CROSS! How many want to follow before one sees the cross? How many want to continue to follow after one sees the cross?\r\n<strong><em>“The Son of man has no where to lay His head.”</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>This can give us a few things to note about Jesus</strong>:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Jesus cannot be found in one sole location as perhaps a fox in hole, or a bird in a nest</li>\r\n\t<li>Jesus is the King of a moving Kingdom</li>\r\n\t<li>Jesus did not have an earthly place that He called home</li>\r\n\t<li>Jesus’ home was not of this world</li>\r\n\t<li>Jesus went where the Spirit of God directed Him</li>\r\n\t<li>Jesus’ rest was not from physical comfort, but spiritual obedience to His Father’s will</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAlthough one may request to follow Jesus, realize he will go places that will be uncomfortable to many. I never anticipated preaching open – air on the streets while being cursed at. I never imagined having a knife pulled out on me for sharing my faith. Christ has taken me to places that were not comfortable, but He is my Lord, and Him I must follow. What about you? To be continued…\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt; </strong>"

              "<strong>Luke 9:62, “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”</strong>\r\n\r\nAround the time of the Revolutionary War, in the United States of America, a group of men existed, called minute-men. The terms \"minutemen\" and \"militia\" are often thought of as one and the same. However, in early America-- especially in the 18th century-- there was a distinct difference. Minute-men represented a small hand-picked force selected from the ranks of local militia companies and regiments. Approximately one-third of the men in each militia unit were chosen \"to be ready to march or fight at a minute's notice.\"<!--more--> If they were eating with their families, putting the kids to bed, bathing, sleeping, etc…, when the call came they were to immediately switch into battle mode and GO! This sounds like the commitment that Jesus was after we He calls. <strong>Matthew 11:12</strong> reads, <strong><em>“</em>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”</strong> The minute-men had the mentality that Jesus was after, those ready in an instance to obey the call and GO!\r\n\r\nLooking back to the man with the deceased father, I envision what Jesus was saying to him, was, “Come now, not later, I have an urgent job for you, that is to go preach the Kingdom of God! Go preach this living, active, forcefully advancing kingdom. You are spiritually alive, follow me, be my disciple, and preach the Kingdom” . It sounds kind of rough reading, the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force,” however Jesus needs those that have that kind of soldiers’ mentality, ready to “violently fight” for the kingdom. Jesus was saying to this man, “I am calling you for such a time as this.” Remember Jesus said to him, “<strong>Let the dead bury the dead, but you go and preach the Kingdom of God</strong>.” I will always appreciate years back when a dear friend named Pastor Paul came to celebrate my wedding even though his dad had just died. He was able to rejoice with me in what God was doing in uniting my wife and I.\r\n\r\nJohn McNeill, a well known Scottish preach of a past generation, used to tell how he found this saying directly relevant to him. When his father died in Scotland, towards the end of the nineteenth century, he was in the English Midlands, and was advertised to address an evangelistic meeting in a certain city on the very day of his father’s funeral. People would have understood had he sent a message to say that he was compelled to cancel his engagement. ‘But I dared not send it,’ he said, ‘for this same Jesus stood by me, and seemed to say, “Now, look, I have you. You go and preach the gospel to those people. Would you rather bury the dead or raise the dead?” And I went to preach”.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus told the man, “<strong>Let the dead bury the dead</strong>,” it seems that this man did not obey Jesus to go. This sounds like much of the church when this same Jesus calls you and me to go and preach the kingdom of God. When he does most make an excuse and fail to obey the call! “<em>Until we stop relying upon our own efforts, we will be unable to rely upon God</em> (James Beall).<em>”</em> Burying the dead is not a work of the Spirit, obeying Jesus to preach His Word, is a Spirit work. Let’s cast off excuse, and Go, You Go, I Go, and preach the Kingdom! Be blessed, and be obedient.\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt; </strong>"

              "<strong>Luke 9:62 , “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”</strong>\r\n\r\nHave you ever taken a fitness test? I can remember in school having to do a certain amount of push-ups, sit-ups, and various other exercises as part of testing to see if I was physically fit or not. Obviously all people are not physically fit, and in light of this all, are not spiritually fit either. The Apostle Paul wrote to Timothy these words, <strong>“For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.</strong>” The Apostle was not saying that physical fitness had NO value, but rather it did not have the same value as godliness (spiritual fitness).<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJesus is approached by one that said to Him, <strong>“I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family</strong>.” Jesus replied, “<strong>No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.</strong>” Like the man that wanted to first go and bury his father to which Jesus replied “<strong>Let the dead bury the dead but you go and preach the Kingdom of God</strong>,” this man desired also to go to say goodbye to his family. This seemed to be like a reasonable request as well, and respectable in nature. However, Jesus replied again in an unexpected manner. Jesus gives an analogy about plowing, and looking back as seemingly disqualifying someone from the Kingdom. This is until one knows the key word in that verse for “fit,” which in the Greek is euthetos which means “ready for use.” Lot’s family was told not to look back and Lot’s wife chose to look back and she turned into a pillar of salt. Jesus said, “…<strong>no one in the field should go back for anything. 32 Remember Lot’s wife</strong>! Why would Jesus tell this man not to even look back?\r\n\r\n<strong>1. When one looks back, one cannot look forward</strong>. Jesus was looking for mission minded people, not mountainous minded people along for the ride who just desired to maintain the status quo. Some people follow as long as it doesn’t cost them anything, as long as it doesn’t “rock the boat,” of the nice little world one has built for oneself. Mission minded people are engaged in the mission at hand, and will pay the cost, rock the boat, all of which will create a ripple effect in the lives of those closest to them. Some of those people may not appreciate this, yet Jesus still calls us to the mission of following Him\r\n\r\n<strong>2. When Christ calls us to work, He expects work</strong>. If you’ve ever been hired to work at a job, the boss doesn’t appreciate lazy employees. Laziness doesn’t advance his business, and laziness doesn’t advance God’s Kingdom. Jesus said to the disciples, “Come follow me and I will make you fishers of men.” The key is follow, when Christ moves forward as the leader, His followers MUST follow.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. When one looks back one is not ready for use. </strong>As a light bulb was made to shine light, so too was the Christian made to shine the light of Christ. What would happen if a light bulb could somehow unscrew itself so that it was not connected to the socket? It would not be connected to the source that it needs to do its job, shine! When one looks back to the world one is unfit, not ready for use, disconnected to his or her purpose. Don’t look back, and definitely don’t go back. Stay focused, ready for the Master’s use, with your hand to the plow. Remember the harvest is plenty but the workers are few.\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Luke 9:62, “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn Star Wars Episode 1, George Lucas did something phenomenal with his Star Wars films. He went back to the beginning and helped all those that did not read the books to understand how the whole Star War movies began. However, before George Lucas did this with film, Jesus did this sort of thing when he said “Remember Lot’s wife.” <!--more-->Before “the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens,” God gave Lot’s family a warning through the angel. The angel said “<strong>Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!</strong> (<strong>Genesis 19:17</strong>)” I read four instructions here in what seems to me, a purposed order.\r\n\r\n1. First he says <strong>flee for your lives</strong>. Death was on its way from God, and just as God gave Noah a way of escape through the ark, Lot’s family was directed to a way of escape as well from impending wrath.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Don’t look back</strong>. Sometimes we are not given the why behind the command from God, but are simply told to just obey. Lot’s family knew judgment was ensuing and were told not to look back. Jesus said, Remember Lot’s wife, referencing to her looking back. For whatever reason she turned her head, I don’t know the reason for returning to house or field is to salvage possessions. The Expositors Bible Commentary says, “Lot's wife, reluctant to leave her old life, looked back to Sodom.”\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Don’t Stop anywhere in the plains</strong>. Many times stopping and looking back go hand in hand. When one stops, their work stops, and their attention is diverted to the world.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Flee to the mountains</strong>. This allows one to get to higher ground, as they were in the plains. We are to flee the devil and get to higher ground, namely Jesus.\r\n\r\nJesus said “<strong>But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. “It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. On that day no one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything</strong> (<strong>Luke 17:29-31</strong>).”\r\n\r\nWhen the Son returns, there will not be time to look back let alone go back. <strong>Luke 17:34–35</strong> reads, I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.’” Even those closely associated (in bed and at work) are separated. Those who look back now and not fit for the Kingdom, and at Christ’s return will not inherit the Kingdom, despite their close relationship to someone that will be taken by Christ. False converts don’t just look back, they go back! Paul wrote in <strong>2Corinthians 13:5,</strong> “<strong>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?</strong>” If you are saved then, look forward to the fields that are white unto harvest because <strong>the harvest is plenty but the workers are few (Matthew 9:37)</strong>. Seek and save the lost like Jesus did, there’s only a certain amount of time left.\r\n\r\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>1Chronicles 22:1-5, vs. 5,”Now David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.” So David made abundant preparations before his death”</strong>\r\n\r\nI spoke to three young guys I met in a train while going and coming back from NYC a couple of weeks ago. I felt compelled to witness to them but first thing was to find a starting point (ice breaker). Their talk about schools became my entry point to start a conversation with them. I asked them what they thought of shooting in schools and high rate of suicides among young people plaguing our society. I asked them what they believed was the cause and how to fix the broken system. After sharing with them what I will share I believe is partly the problem, they agreed with me.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn the present world, the rate of children coming from broken homes (divorce, single parenthood, children abandoned etc) is increasing at an alarming rate. Besides that, a number of children from certain homes are growing but shielded from things that ought to prepare them for life in the real world. And because some were never prepared for a possible hard life, they find the world hard and not fair. A number even feel its not fair that some are succeeding and not them.\r\n\r\nChildren are left to run wild in some homes with no sense of hard work, responsibility or accountability. Many parents even cripple their children when they say, “I will give my children all I never had\" when some of those things they never had helped them become what they are today. I have seen parents set unrealistic expectations for their children even affirming them on what they know their children could never do or become while saying they can become anything in life, sky being the limit, eg. singing, sports etc setting them up for failure right from the start. And when professionals challenges or disagree with them, they become enemies. While we might think all these are outrageous, there are parents who side with their children even when they know their children are wrong, a recipe for disaster.\r\n\r\nIn the last 20 years or so, a lot has changed in my judgement. Back then, great discipline was huge, there was structure, hard work, responsibility, accountability etc. Parents, grownups and teachers worked together for the well being of the children. The quote \"it takes a village to raise a child\" was a reality. Nearly every parent supported teachers and often gave their unruly child a few more licks when they got home as good discipline. Parents respected teachers, and students listened. Today, over-indulgent middle-class parents are fueling a rise in bad behaviour in schools by failing to set boundaries for their children, and that is why I believe we see many bad behaviors that lead to violence as they escalate. The biblical principles that children lived by have been thrown out the window. The values shared and cherished at the dinner tables are now considered by many worthless and we wonder why we have high rates of shootings, suicides, crimes among other great issues affecting our young people.\r\n\r\nIn the light of our current world, I draw biblical wisdom from David who prepared his son for the life ahead with serving the Lord as priority. We will see how David prepared his son Solomon giving him charge and great responsibility. And may the Lord help us in our day. Blessings, Ev"

              "<strong>1Chronicles 22:1-5, vs. 5,”Now David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.” </strong>\r\n\r\nDavid having learnt that his son Solomon was the one to build a house for the Lord, and also knowing he may not to live long enough to see his son grow up and become all that God wanted him to be, he prepared these 4 crucial areas for the benefit of his son<strong>. 1. Physical preparation, 2. Spiritual preparation, 3. Surrounded him with skillful workers, 4. Surrounded him with good spiritual leaders</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n1. <strong>PHYSICAL PREPARATION:</strong> <strong>1Chronicles 22:5,”Now David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.”</strong>. If David was not going to build directly, he would build through his son. And knowing his son was still young and inexperienced, he made abundant preparations before his death. All that we prepare and do with God’s help is to the praise of the glory of His grace. And parents ought to prepare both physical and material for the well-being of their children with God in mind for His glory. David wanted to make sure his son understood that the preparation was more about God than him. David had learnt that God’s work must be done God’s way and by God’s Spirit if God is to bless it. He needed his son to get that and prepare the same. <strong>Proverbs 13:22, “A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children”</strong>\r\n\r\n2. <strong>SPIRITUAL PREPARATION: 1Chronicles 28:9-10, \"9 As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a loyal heart and with a willing mind; for the Lord searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever. 10 Consider now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it.” </strong>Though time was not on his side, he worked very diligently not only preparing materials but also preparing his son spiritually for what was to come. There are parents who are more concerned about their children being successful in life (financially, family, health) than they are about their children’s spiritual life. Solomon benefited from being given great responsibility when his father passed the manhood responsibility to him and gave him charge before the Lord by first teaching him how to serve the Lord. David was not a perfect father however the bible highlights his faith. He was a man after God's own heart the same charge he gives his son. Read what Paul reminds his son in the faith of the things that shaped his manhood, <strong>2Timothy 3:10-17, “10 But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, 11 persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me”</strong>\r\n\r\n3. <strong>SURROUNDED HIM WITH SKILFULL PEOPLE/WORKERS:</strong> <strong>1Chronicles 22:15, “Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance: woodsmen and stonecutters, and all types of skillful men for every kind of work”. </strong>Mark that he does not tell Solomon he is giving him skillful men to work for him but work with him. This is why we appreciate teachers, instructors, lecturers etc. They are skillful people parents surround their children with to help prepare them for life. Parents help their children select good skillful people and they work with them for the betterment of their children’s lives. We entrust our children to teachers, counselors, instructors considered skillful people with different gifts and talents to work alongside of us and not for us, instilling values of hard work.\r\n\r\n4. <strong>SURROUNDED HIM WITH SPIRITUAL LEADERS</strong>: <strong>1Chronicles 22:17-19, “17 David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, “ 18 Is not the LORD your God with you? And has He not given you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the LORD and before His people. 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God. Therefore arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the house that is to be built for the name of the LORD.” </strong>David surrounded his son with great spiritual leaders to help his son walk in the spiritual charge he gave him. We must surround our children with biblically sound leadership, first knowing what we believe and why and then being in a body (church) where those sound teachings they are receiving at home are cultivated. <strong>2Timothy 3:14-15, “15 But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, 15 and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus</strong>.”\r\n\r\nIt takes a village of people to raise a child for the glory of God, but it all starts at home. We blame schools for taking out spiritual things but who took the spiritual things out of our own homes? We must go back to biblical foundation of raising children in our homes as the starting point as we also surround them with others in this journey . Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 24:7-8, “You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains…”</strong>\r\n\r\nSome time back an earthquake hit Japan which added Tsunami tragedy. How should the church respond to such a tragedy? First Jesus tells us that we should not be alarmed. This does not mean that we shouldn’t care, pray, weep with those who weep, or send relief to the people affected by this horrific event. Jesus instructs us not to be alarmed because these things are a sign of the times. Even though we don’t desire these things to take place, we are reminded that these things are part of biblical prophecy, and can rest assure that our God is in control, in the midst of these times. We can’t explain such an event of this nature without looking to God. <!--more-->The Bible tells us that God cursed the earth because of Adam’s transgression. Weeds are a curse. So is disease. Sin and suffering cannot be separated. The Scriptures inform us that we live in a fallen creation. In the beginning, God created man perfect, and he lived in a perfect world without suffering. It was heaven on earth. When sin came into the world, death and misery came with it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Jesus spoke these things as \"<strong>the beginning of birth pains</strong>\" (<strong>Matthew 24:4-8; Mark 13:8).</strong> Not only men, but the whole creation groans with \"<strong>the pains of childbirth</strong>\" anticipating the revelation of the sons of God at the revelation of the Son (<strong>Romans 8:18-22</strong>). Christians look forward and we<strong>”…wait for the blessed hope-the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ</strong>.” If you’ve given birth, then you understand the feeling of birth pains. Yet think for a moment at the full picture. God brings two people together in marriage. Sometime later they desire children and so through love the wife becomes pregnant. There is much excitement as the parents look forward to the birth of the child. However during the delivery there is great pain involved, until the baby comes, and once again there is joy unspeakable as God’s gift is seen in the birth. Jesus has called those that have repented and put their trust in Him, His children. However, we live in a time of the birth pains.\r\n\r\nThirdly, because of the birth pain it caused us to look forward to the coming of Christ. <strong>Luke 12:37</strong> says, “<strong>Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that He shall gird Himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them</strong>.” In a moment in the twinkling of an eye He’ll return. No one was ready for the unexpected Tsunami that took the lives of thousands. But, we are commanded to have an expectant attitude for Christ’s return, and it too will be sudden! Those who understand Scripture eagerly await a new heaven and a new earth \"<strong>wherein dwells righteous-ness</strong>.\" In that coming Kingdom there will be no more pain, suffering, disease, or death. We are told that “<strong>no eye has ever seen, nor has any ear heard, neither has any man’s mind ever imagined the wonderful things that God has in store for those who love Him (1Corinthians 2:9</strong>).” What an encouragement to us as Christians.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: What are we to do now, just around twiddling our thumbs and wait, no way? Be holy (1Thessalonians 3:13); be zealous for the Lord anticipating His return; be confident (Ephesians 6:12, Revelation 20:10); be an encouragement (1Thessalonians 4:16-18); and be mobilized telling others of His imminent return. The Scripture tells us, “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come (Matthew 24:14).” Are you living godly? If you or one of your loved ones are suddenly swept away by the cold hand of death, are you ready, and are they to stand before the Lord? Blessings Pastor Phil </strong>"

              "<strong>Mathew 23:39, \"...Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe all crave for blessings because blessings are very powerful. Blessings are signs of approval from someone you value their approval. For example, Kids want their parents to approve the relationships they are in and bless it. Esau was destined to receive his father's blessings but his brother pretended to be him and took it away. Esau upon hearing his lost opportunity for a blessing<strong>, \"... he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me—me also, O my father!”</strong>\", <strong>Genesis 27:34.</strong>Throught the bible you read of fathers blessing their children based on how they lived their lives. Blessings are very powerful!!!.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhy blessings? because blessings promote or contributes to the wellbeing of a person, it's a sign of approval. Blessings come with guidelines if we follow them. The fifth commandment is the only commandment with a promise, <strong>Exodus 20:5, \"Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God\", </strong>sadly it’s commonly broken because a number have never learnt to honor their parents. God has destined this to be one means by which kids are blessed. Why do we have a generation that is into rebellion and we hear lives end young. I am convinced many people have denied the parents the honor God has set aside for them for this reason most have missed their blessings and heaped upon them curses. We cry, \"Lord bless me\" but greater blessings begin by keeping this promise. I know not of any parents who deserve such kind of honor due to what they did or failed to do. We honor them because God says so and not because they deserve it. This ought to be taught to all. <strong>Proverbs 20:20, \"whoever curses his father or his mother, His lamp will be put out in deep darkness\"</strong>. We could curse them by failing to honor them and therefore we are storing curses for ourselves, <strong>Proverbs 30:11, \"There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother</strong>\" and we live in that generation.\r\n\r\nEveryone has a chance to be blessed and the blessings will come when we do what the Lord would have us do. <strong>Deuteronomy 28:1&amp;2, \"Now it shall come to pass, if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all His commandments which I command you today, that the LORD your God will set you high above all nations of the earth. 2 And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of the LORD your God: </strong>\". This shows that we can bring curses (forfeit) ourselves by not heeding to keep God's commandments, His Word. We cannot expect to be blessed if we violate the principles of His word\r\n\r\nWhile we obey, doors of blessings will open and overtake us and we will turn the blessings back to God inform of praises. The bible says, \"<strong>Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord</strong>\", the only way you and I can come is because we value the commandments and we desire to keep them. Bless me-me also, O my Father. Make me also a blessing to others starting with my parents. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 6:17, \"But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nTrue religion is not found merely in external duties and acts of devotion. It is not found solely in intellectual understanding, nor in rapturous displays of emotion. These examples can all be faked, many of these are displayed in the most wicked of lives. Just look at the Pharisees. True religion, at its core, is what Paul speaks of here, the life of God in the soul of man. It is a union of the soul with God, a rejoining of the life to Christ through repentance and faith in the cross.<strong> Colossians 1:27</strong> says that Christ ‘in’ us is the hope of glory.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIt is not our works, or words, but the reality of the presence of Jesus Christ within us. It is His holy life, His nature imparted within me. This cannot be faked, you either have it or you don’t. In Romans 8:16, Paul teaches us about the witness of the Holy Spirit, which this joining produces. It is the testimony of a clear conscience before God, and of an upright life. It is an inner life of holiness displayed outwardly as it defines everything we do. Simply, look at what you did last night. Did you spend your time in careful study of scripture, prayer, or Christ centered discussion? Or In front of the T.V., watching some godless program? Now one might say this is too much, but look at what else Paul says in regards to this life within us, earlier on in <strong>Romans 8, v. 5-8</strong>. He says that those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, in v. 6 he says to be carnally minded (which is to have the mind of the flesh) is death, and in v. 7 and 8 he closes this thought stating that this mind is in warfare with God, and that the individual in this state cannot please God. No acts of devotion, no outward works matter here, for those in the flesh cannot please God.\r\n\r\nWe must be joined to Him, as Peter says, being made a partaker of the Divine Nature. The life of Christ in me produces this nature, and God’s nature is holiness, not worldliness. An inner, vital spiritual union with God is the goal of the Christian, counting all as loss to attain this. I must come to the end of myself, and surrender my all to Christ. Jesus cannot merely be a part of my life, He must be my life. And I willingly forsake all else that is not of Him. All sin, all self, anything, I cast it away lest it stop me from entering His blessed presence. More than that, I cast it away, for I love God with all my heart, I love Him more than myself, and so I willingly do those things that are pleasing to Him. The true, born again experience produces this life. I cease to exist, only Christ lives. Friends, nothing in this life compares to the majesty of knowing God, and all those who have truly experienced God know this. If you lack this true experience, then seek God until He pours Himself into your life. Cast all else away, knowing God is the greatest.\r\n\r\nIn the love of Christ, and all for His glory, Brother Benjamen"

              "<strong>Matthew 11:28, &quot;Come to me, all ye, heavy laden and I will give you rest&quot;</strong>\n\nIn today's scenario, no one likes to meet any person, who is heavy laden or to help any such person or spend time with people who are very tensed, depressed or anxious for various reasons. <!--more-->\nBut our dear Lord invites such people who have heavy burdens, whatever the reason may be. Not only, it is an invitation of warm welcome followed by the assurance of PERFECT REST. <strong>1Peter 5:7, says &quot;Cast your burden on the Lord because He cares for you</strong>&quot; Yes God is bearing our burden and that too, gladly... For instance, a young child getting back from school with a very heavy bag , unable to carry it.. His/her mother or father will immediately run to the child and definitely take the heavy bag and give the child some relief ..Why ? The primary reason is love ...Yes, the love of the parents towards their children ...This is a shadow of God's love. Compared to the AGAPE love which is of God, even our earthly fathers falls short of His love.\n\nOne time I woke up only to remember the pressures I was to face during one particular day at office. I had auditors visiting and God strengthened me with this verse <strong>&quot;Praise be to the Lord, to God, our SAVIOR , who daily bears our burdens</strong>&quot; ..I immediately gathered courage for the day, miraculously witnessed God bring me out of this particular situation and every other. I praised God further for strengthening my faith to believe that He loves me and gladly bears my daily burdens...\n\nWhat a blessing it is to be with the Lord who bears our burdens, who loves to listen to us, and also gives us rest despite attacks from Satan /enemies /troubles/ fears/ shocks/day today worries or whatever it is\n\n<strong>Psalms 91 says &quot;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will REST in the shadow of the Almighty&quot;</strong> . What is this dwelling place? it’s a place where one lives/stays/resides/abides. Any person on earth goes home after the days' work ...generally ,a person loves to get back to his house/dwelling as often as possible , as early as possible.. Now let us meditate on God Himself being our dwelling ..\n\nIf we love our earthly dwelling, which is quite temporary, then how much more are we to love our heavenly, permanent dwelling -our temple Himself ? Do we love to stay in Him, reside in Him, abide in Him consistently and continuously? Not just for a season, or time period for a gain or a favor but forever and ever ...If we are inclined to spend time with Him, then we can be assured of His rest.. David states that He loves to stay in the temple of the Lord forever and ever. Yes, let us love to abide in Him and continue in Him so that we can enjoy the rest in His bosom for ever and ever... Let us all eagerly wait for the day when we , all will be in His loving fold, God Himself wiping our tears from our eyes, and providing us REST for eternity... , Sarah Susan"

              "<strong>Psalm 51:1 Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. PS 51:2 Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. PS 51:3 For I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me. PS 51:4 Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight,… PS 51:12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me. PS 51:13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you.</strong>\n\nRepentance is term widely neglected in our time in preaching or sharing the gospel. <!--more-->\nWe say believe and you will be saved when it should be repent and believe. Psalm 51 is a beautiful passage dealing with repentance having been confronted.\n\nWhat is the proper response to someone confronting us, or what kind of response do we look for in someone who has repented from their sin?\n\n1. First someone must look immediately to the Lord. David acknowledged that only God had the mercy that he needed. Mercy is not getting what we do deserve. In other words we deserved death, hell and the grave, and the Lord gave us eternal life, heaven, and resurrection.\n\n2. He asked God to wash him. Soap and water can clean the outside of us, but nothing but God can clean the inside. <strong>Ephesians 5:26</strong> speaks about being holy through<strong> “cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,…</strong>” <strong>John 7:38</strong> states, “<strong>Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of livingwater will flow from within him</strong>.” We need living water to flow throw and cleanse us.\n\n3. David further says blot out my transgressions. In today’s society criminals get what is called in slang “a rap sheet” or a record of their offenses against the law. <strong>Psalm 90:8, “ You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. All things done in darkness will be revealed in the light”</strong>\n\n4. In his search for forgiveness, the psalmist opens his sinful heart. To this end he uses the three synonyms for sin: &quot;transgressions,&quot; &quot;iniquity,&quot; and &quot;sin.&quot; David looked underneath his kingly robes to see his sinful heart. And we must look beneath our flesh at our sin as well.\n\n5. David then professes against “<strong>Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight</strong>.” Question, is this a contradiction in Scripture? Didn’t David, because he broke all 10 of God’s Commandments, sin against more than just God alone? Didn’t he sin against Bathsheba (adultery), Uriah (murdered), and all of Israel as their king? Where is the asking of their forgiveness? Well he couldn’t ask Uriah for forgiveness, but he could have gone to the others. And I believe that his writing of this Psalm for all to read showed everyone how sorry he was for his sin. It served as a public apology. However no one that he sinned against was offended more than God, so his chief priority, as it should be ours, was to repent to the Lord and receive His forgives. Then as <strong>James 5:16</strong> states “<strong>Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective</strong>.” Going to a person that perhaps we’ve sinned against is a biblical principle as well, as long as you go in a humble spirit.\n\n<strong>Application: Here is what we look for when confronting others, although we pray their heart is soft enough to receive it. When you are confronted repent quickly as well. Tomorrow we will look at part 2. </strong>\n\nBlessings,\nPastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Psalm 51:1, “Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. PS 51:2 Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. PS 51:3 For I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me. PS 51:4 Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight,… PS 51:12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me. PS 51:13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you.</strong>\n\nYesterday we took a look at responding to confrontation. David pleaded for God’s mercy, cleansing, for God not to keep record (a heavenly rap sheet) He developed the godly sorrow he had of offending God personally. <!--more-->\nToday let’s examine what David proclaimed he would do when he was forgiven.\n\nHere David offers a prayer for a heart of wisdom and for full restoration to once again experience divine favor.\n\n1. He first proclaimed that God would bring a restoration of joy. David would experience a breath of fresh air because God is in the business of restoration. Satan steals and kills lives, Christ gives it back and restores our relationship back with the Father. God's displeasure with sin brings judgment, metaphorically described as broken bones, so His pleasure brings joy of heart. The joy is more than an emotional expression; it is a contented resting in God. Once again David will experience the security of having been reconciled with the Lord and of having peace with him.\n\n<strong>Romans 5:1-2</strong> reads, <strong>“Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God</strong>.” Peace with God is of great importance.\n\n2. Secondly David shares that after he once again has that joy restored of salvation and peace with God that he would do something with it. David wasn’t just waiting around to die so he could be with the Lord. No, he felt a spiritual responsibility as king to teach transgressors (law breakers) God’s ways and cause sinners to turn back to the Lord. David knew what it was like on both sides of the fence, that is to say in God’s favor and out of God’s favor. But didn’t God love David you may ask? Yes, but God was sorely displeased with him. We see later in his life that God would not allow the son conceived in adultery to be born despite David’s fasting, and pleading with God.\n\nIs our job any different? The moment you are born again (John 3:3), born of water and the spirit (John 3:5) you automatically become a missionary. Remember Jesus’ confrontation of the woman at the well in John 4? After she experienced her forgiveness the Scriptures record that she stirred up the whole town to come to Christ. Look at this spiritual baby missionary.\n\nMany of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, &quot;<strong>He told me everything I ever did.&quot; So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. And because of his words many more became believers.”</strong> <strong>(John 4:39-41) </strong>Only Christ can cause an ex-prostitute to bring a whole town to the Savior. Look at this new converts heart to reach her town.\n\n<strong>Application: If you are not at peace with God, repent quickly. IF you are at peace with God then bring all those you know to Christ, the Savior they too so desperately need. </strong>\nBlessings,\nPastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 13:1-13, “4 Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 5 does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 6 does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things 8 Love never fails”. </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6200\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nWe have safes we keep valuable stuff we don’t want anyone or anything to interfere with; they are very precious to us. My wife and I have a fire resistant safe; in it we keep valuable things such as marriage certificate, passports, important documents and the like because we don’t want to lose them either by theft, misplacement and/or fire. Now a fire-resistant safe is a type of safe that is designed to protect its contents from high temperatures or actual fire. Fire resistant safes are usually rated by the amount of time they can withstand the extreme temperatures a fire produces, while not exceeding a set internal temperature.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAnd so are marriages, there are qualities that must be put in a safe because they are precious to you and unless your safe is built with fire resistant materials, it’s bound to suffer when fire comes. <strong>Proverbs 4:23, “Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life”</strong>. Don’t we hear people say, “<em>follow your heart</em>”, however the heart is deceitful above all things, it wants things for itself, we are told “<em>to keep it with all diligence</em>”. Unguarded heart is a heart that may not survive the heat that come from the fire of life even in a marriage. A heart that is surrendered to God is a heart that has been placed in a safe, <strong>Matthew 6:21, “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”</strong>. To “<em>follow your heart</em>” is setting yourself for disaster. You ought to “<i>lead your heart”</i> not follow it.\r\n\r\nThere’s a quote from the movie (Fireproof), Lt. Michael Simmons says, <strong>“Fireproof doesn’t mean the fire will never come, it means when the fire comes that you will be able to withstand it”. </strong>I believe many marriages are exposed, hearts left unattended, the things that should have been guarded have been left in the open and the enemy knows how to take what is left exposed and sets it on fire. His mission is simple in that “<strong>The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy”, John 10:10. </strong>He parades to you that you are better than the current situation, that you deserve better, that you cannot waste your life. All he wants to do and he has done many times to other people is to let people think about themselves. Marriages have been viewed by many as, “<em>what’s in it for me?”</em> and that is the driving force for love. Look at what Paul says what love is NOT, “<strong>4 ... love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 5 does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 6 does not rejoice in iniquity”. </strong>In other words, these are NOT the things you and your spouse should keep in your fire resistant safe, if you do, they will destroy from the inside. True love is not what it gets but what it gives<strong>, </strong>but you cannot give what you’ve not guarded in the safe<strong>. </strong>These are the qualities you and your spouse ought to safeguard, protect, nature at all cost because fire will come against them. Remember <strong>vs.”4 Love suffers long and is kind, love rejoices in the truth,(God’s word); 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 8 Love never fails”.</strong>\r\n\r\nFires of financial challenges will come, parasites inform of people, health challenges, misunderstandings, disagreements, be sure you have what is valuable in your marriage safe to withstand the fire when it comes, Lead your heart to true love as defined by God and not by the world’s definition.

              "<strong>Nehemiah 8:5-6, \"5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. 6 And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God. Then all the people answered, Amen, Amen! while lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground\"</strong>\n\nMany say the word Amen, but few know what it actually means! Have you ever said Amen in church, at a conference, or at a ministry training either quietly or out loud? What does the word Amen mean, why do you say it, and what does it mean when you say it?<!--more-->\n\n\nJohn Piper writes,  \"In most languages of the world where Christianity has taken root the word &quot;Amen&quot; has been taken over untranslated. Listen to a person pray in Chinese or Japanese or Swahili or Maninka or German or French or Russian or Arabic, and very likely there is at least one word you will understand: &quot;Amen&quot; - pronounced differently perhaps, but discernible. One of the reasons for this is that the Greek New Testament took it over from the Hebrew Old Testament untranslated (even though the Greek Old Testament [the Septuagint, LXX] rarely did, using &quot;let it be&quot; [] instead of &quot;amen&quot; []).\"\n\nSo what we have, all over the world today is a word, &quot;Amen&quot; that is a direct transliteration - not translation - of the Hebrew &quot;Amen&quot;. Now we see from our text that the word was taken to Corinth, a Greek city speaking the Greek language which did not have a word &quot;amen.&quot; And, within a matter of weeks or months, Paul and the other missionaries had already begun to transform the Corinthian culture by grafting a brand new word onto their great Greek language. It wasn't the only one. Paul also taught them the Aramaic words &quot;maranatha&quot; (<strong>1Corinthians 16:22</strong>, Marana qa) - &quot;Lord, come.&quot; And, of course, he taught them a vision of reality that exploded many of their preconceptions.\n\nIn the Old Testament the word &quot;amen&quot; was mainly a congregational response to give a strong affirmation or agreement - to a curse or a word of praise to God. In, Deuteronomy 27:16 the Levites say, \"&quot;<strong>'Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</strong>&quot;\" That is, we agree with that curse, so let it be. Therefore, they affirmed curses as well as blessings. This is not something that generally goes through ones mind in the modern church service when one says Amen. Yet, we should say Amen to everything that aligns with the word of God, whether we read it, or hear it preached, and whether it speaks about a blessing or a curse, a blessing or a judgment.\n\nLook at what took place during the time of Ezra when he was open air preaching in <strong>Nehemiah 8:111</strong> (please read the whole thing).\n\nFirst, there was a gathering and a standing, to hear the Law of God. This expressed the great reverence the people had for it. Secondly, there was preaching of the Law and the blessing of the God of the Law. Thirdly, there was an understanding of the Law because of the exposition or explanation of Gods Law. Fourthly, because of the explanation of Gods Law, there was the understanding of Gods Law. This is paramount, because many understand what the text of the Bible says, but not what it means. We help people understand what it means by using hermeneutics, which is discovering the authors intent through the historical context of the text at hand. Fifthly, there was an answering that took place, showing the people agreed with Gods Law and this is where the Amen was shouted and a lifting of the hands! The agreement with the mouth and outward accompanying praise of the body (lifting the hands) took place among the people. And finally, there was worshipping, which is the proper response to Gods holy Law. This whole scene was a glorious account which you too should say a hearty Amen. Oh how we should long to see this type of reverence for Gods Word, and preaching that pierces the heart which causes people to say Amen! John Piper again shares, The &quot;amen&quot; meant, &quot;Yes, we agree with your blessing! We join in your blessing! All that you have said of God's greatness we let it echo in our Amen. We say, &quot;True, and firm and reliable is what you have said.&quot;\n\nHowever, people say Amen for much lesser things, and usually when it is all about them. Perhaps I should not use the term lesser, but many do in fact Amen when it is about them and are not consistent, when it is purely about God. For example, a man gets a promotion at work, and says, Amen, but the preacher says, God is holy and there is no Amen. Yet it was the holy God that blessed me with the job, and because the job was a blessing, the man focused on the blessing and not on the One who gave the blessing, namely God! Furthermore, people say Amen to things that are totally unbiblical as well. When someone such as the famous Joel Osteen does his motivation speaking, many say Amen, even when he only tells stories and uses the Bible out of context. It is up to Gods people to study Gods Word, and to say Amen when the preacher not the motivation speaker, preaches what is in line with Gods Word. Would the people of Ezras day say Amen if he were merely motivational preaching. Yes there are many that gather to hear many of the preachers on the television, but are the things that are being preached worth an Amen? Be mindful of what you are saying Amen to. When you say Amen you are saying you agree with what you have read, or heard preached.\n\nWould you say Amen to the first part of this message? Well that depends if it is biblical, and if you agree with the truth, or if it is unbiblical and if you are more concerned about pleasing God than hurting my feelings.\n\nTo be continuedBlessings, Phil, the evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Psalm 72:18–20, “18 Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, Who only does wondrous things! 19And blessed be His glorious name forever! And let the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen and Amen. 20The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended”</strong>\n\nThis Psalm of Solomon, son of David brings this powerful psalm concerning the <strong>Glory and Universality of the Messiah’s Reign. At the end of this psalm </strong>what was his focus?\n<!--more-->\n\nFirst, he focused on the Blessings. He wanted God’s name to be eternally blessed for all the wondrous things he has done. Many people long to leave a legacy behind for themselves, making a name for themselves based on the “good things” they hope to be remembered for. Solomon was known for his wisdom, his influence, his wealth, his temple, etc… Yet, in his psalm did he focus on himself? Nope! Did he perhaps focus on any of his greatness, of the greatness of his father David? Solomon wanted God’s name to be remembered more, than he desired his own name to be remembered. Not only did he want God’s name to be blessed, but he also desired that the whole earth would be filled with the glory of God. He wanted the whole earth to be filled the very glory of God. What does Solomon see the earth is filled with if not the glory of God? There is war, disease, death, burdens, destruction, etc…, but Solomon desires that “God’s glory, is to be a holy site of worship, where God makes his presence known (cf. <strong>Exodus. 40:34–35; 1Kings 8:10–11),</strong> and this prayer is that the whole earth be such a sanctuary (cf. note on <strong>Isaiah 6:3</strong>).<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>” Then he says Amen and Amen! This is to say, he agrees with this blessing and yes let him say again he agrees. I imagine he desires if you will, for the whole of creation to say amen and amen that it is filled by the very glory of God, as it was at one time, apart from any residue or presence of sin.\n\n<strong>Psalm 72:19</strong> The filling of the earth with God’s glory will be fulfilled in the consummation <strong>Revelation 21:22–27, “22 And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. 23 And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. 24 By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, 25 and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. 26 They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. 27 But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.”</strong>\n\nThis is the picture that Solomon longs for. Amen! Is this what you long for? Do you long to say Amen, not for Solomon’s temple, but the temple of the Lord? Do you long to say Amen, to abide in a city that has NO need of the sun, for the light of the Lord and His glory will be all the light that will ever be needed or desired? Do you say Amen that all the nations will walk by his glorious light that in the Lamb of God that draws the very nations unto Himself? Do you say Amen, that all the kings and rulers of the earth will bring their glory before the Lord and that their glory will be shrouded only by the greatest glory, the Glory of the Lord Himself! All sin will be eradicated, for no sin can dwell in His presence. Even now does your heart cry out for this reality with a hearty, AMEN! Only those that are born again will be there? There will not be one detestable, false convert, false preacher, heretic, or false teacher present. Many think that their name is written in that book, and many are mistaken. <strong>Matthew 7:21-23</strong> reminds us of this grave reality. Are you truly born again, and is your name written in heaven? Are you saying Amen or ouch! Let us reach the lost so they too may know the glorious Lamb of God, and join the Church of Jesus in saying Amen and Amen! The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “<strong>Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity (2Timothy 2:14),”</strong> therefore those who have their name chiseled in the Lamb’s book of Life will be the only ones present. Will that be YOU? Are you saying Amen! Whether someone is gloriously saved or one goes to the Lake of fire, the name of the Lord will be praised and we can say Amen and Amen. Oh, how I look forward to the day when the Messiah will rule and reign forevermore and to that I say AMEN and AMEN!\n\nUntil the nets are filled….Blessings, Phil, the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 14:13-16, “Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. 15 What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. 16 Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying (– please read the whole context starting at verse 1)?”</strong>\n\nA great bulk of today’s continued message will come from the writing of one of our favorites, John Piper. His message on “amen”, really inspired, and I gleaned much from it, as I both read and listened to the message, I would encourage you to do the same.<!--more-->\n\nJohn Piper shares “Paul would bring the word “Amen” to the Greek culture. This is a most interesting journey. Bringing the word &quot;Amen&quot; to Greece is a little microcosm of what happens spiritually and intellectually and culturally wherever Christianity comes to a new culture. It brings a vision of God and the world that keeps some things in the culture, rejects other things in the culture, and touches everything in the culture. There are no pure cultures, especially ours. Every culture needs more words and more concepts and more ways of viewing the world and deeper combinations of emotions and different patterns of behaving than is native to itself. This word “amen” has seeped into cultures all over the world, which displays that no culture, no language, no worship is complete in itself. Our vocabularies are limited and cannot fully express all the feelings, emotions, thought patterns which people attempt to convey. But let's be more specific. What did the word &quot;amen&quot; come to Corinth to do? What did this Hebrew word mean as it grafted itself onto the Greek vocabulary of Corinthian Christians?” We know that over time words change, new words are created, and this is why there is different translations of the Bible. How could most understand the Bible if it were still in Latin only, or Greek, Hebrew, or Aramaic? Most of us would be reliant on the preacher (which is what happened in Roman Catholicism, where the people were reliant on the priests, because most common people could not read Latin). Amen has become a word common to many languages, and it is Christianity with such servants like Paul, that is responsible for that blessed reality.”\n\n<strong>&quot;Amen&quot; in the New Testament</strong>\n\nPiper continues, “Now here comes Paul into Greek-speaking Corinth, and he teaches them about this word &quot;Amen,&quot; - just as if he were to come to us today with a new Hebrew word we didn't know. What did he teach them? Well, we can see behind <strong>1Corinthians 14</strong>. Paul is concerned that the gift of tongues is being abused in public so that people are speaking what nobody can understand. He is not rejecting the gift of tongues. But he is putting something way above it in the Christian assembly. He is saying that edification comes not by amazement at miracles, but edification comes by the understanding of God. That's why verse 19 says that five intelligible words that help you understand God are better than a thousand unintelligible words that make you tremble with amazement.\n\nPaul is extremely zealous that public speaking (whether prayer or preaching) be an event of group understanding and group agreement - not one person doing his own thing and others boggled. Not even one person doing his own thing and others understanding and silent. What then? His answer is just beneath the surface in <strong>verses 15-16</strong>:\n\nWhat is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also. Otherwise if you bless in the spirit only, how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted say the &quot;Amen&quot; at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?\n\nPaul assumes something here. He assumes that when a public prayer is made, other <strong>people besides the one praying say, &quot;Amen.&quot;</strong> Let's not miss this. It seems to matter to Paul. He could have just said: don't pray in tongues because nobody can understand you and so nobody is built up in their faith, because faith comes by an understood word of Christ. Or he could have said always have an interpretation. But he said more. He said (verse 16): If you pray so people can't understand you, how will they say &quot;Amen&quot;?”\n\nPiper makes some powerful assessments about this passage. When we pray, we do so unto God, but in a corporate setting we also affect the body of Christ that we are gathered with at that time. It was this affect that Evans had on me when I first met my best friend as we prayed in the mornings at our church. Many silently or quietly prayed, until I heard a prayer of thunder, fervency, and zealousness. My prayer life has never been the same since beginning to pray with my best friend Evans. His prayer caused my heart to shout, Amen! I began to get more excited about prayer, and the “amen” continued to be expressed when we would pray together. This is not inspiration such as a painter that is inspired to paint a scenic horizon off in the distance. Rather this is inspiration as the Holy Spirit was working through a life changed by the Gospel! There are few that I can pray with that cause the “amen” to rise up in me. When someone mature and zealous for God is praying alongside you, do you agree in prayer, “amen” with that person? This tends to happen with those that are like-hearted toward the things of God. Hence the things that God loves we should love, and when two or more are praying it would seem a harmony is being played before the throne of grace. Yet when we pray we should be able to understand what is being petitioned concerning, God exalted, souls interceded for, etc…. <strong>To be continued…</strong>\n\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Phil, the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>1Corinthians 14:13-16 “Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. 15 What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. 16 Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying</strong> (– please read the whole context starting at verse 1)?\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Amen\" Affirms Others in the Body</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nJohn Piper again shares, “What if someone says to Paul, \"I don't care if people say \"Amen\" to my prayers\"? Or what if someone says, \"That's not my tradition or my personality to say anything out loud in a group\"? What would Paul say? I think he would say, “This is not about personal taste. It's not about traditions of High-Church or low-church. It's not about culture, say, African-American culture versus Swedish-American culture. It's about God's will for corporate worship, rooted in age-old Biblical patterns of prayer and preaching, and captured in a word that crosses all cultures.”\r\n\r\nIt is awesome that people from different cultures can be drawn not by a sport, or music, or some hobby of sorts, but rather prayer toward the Living and true God of Heaven and Earth. This is what drew a guy from Kenya, and a guy from New York to become best of friends in prayer. It is preached and said that Jesus is a personal Lord and Savior, but where is the corporate Body of Christ in that description? Some treat Christ as if he is their own personally designed Savior, designed just for their needs and lifestyle. This is not a description of Christ, but of a genie. The identity of Christ MUST be drawn from Scripture first and foremost, not from your experience. There is participation in corporate worship on the biblical Christ that is why it is in fact corporate. America is very much about individualism and independence but Christianity is not about that. Christianity is about interdependence, whereby we are dependent upon our shepherd in the midst of our fellow sheep that Christ works through to strengthen one another. There are a host of terms such as “one another” in the Scriptures, therefore we can see that Christ works the Church, therefore we do not gather to be individualistic, and hence there would be no need then to gather. “<strong><a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/the.html\">The</a> etymological notion underlying <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/to.html\">to</a>gether is <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/of.html\">of</a> ‘gathering’ <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/thing.html\">things</a> into <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/one.html\">one</a><a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/group.html\">group</a>. <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/it.html\">It</a> was formed <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/from.html\">from</a> <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/the.html\">the</a> prepos<a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/it.html\">it</a>ion <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/to.html\">to</a> <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/and.html\">and</a> the element *gad- denoting ‘association, company’, <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/which.html\"> which</a> <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/also.html\"> also</a> <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/lie.html\"> lies</a> <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/behind.html\">behind</a> <a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/definition/gather.html\">gather</a> (<a href=\"http://www.word-origins.com/\">http://www.word-origins.com</a>). </strong>\r\n\r\nPiper further explains, “<em>I think Paul would say, God is calling us not to be isolated, silent, encapsulated individuals in worship. Privately coming, privately hearing, privately going, with no one able to tell what we love and cherish and long for, because we haven't expressed resonance - an echo, an empathy - with anything. I think he would say that God is calling us out of our cocoons of emotional isolation and invisible, inaudible, unshared responsiveness. <strong>I think he would say, it's God's will that we echo the excellence of God in preaching and prayer - that we express our affirmation of the truth of God in the Word, and that we resonate verbally with Godward longings and yearnings in prayer</strong>. Let me mention two more reasons for making more of this than we do, and provide some practical suggestions. Consider 2 Corinthians 1:20. This is the passage that gives \"Amen\" its clearest and deepest meaning. <strong>\"For as many as are the promises of God, in Him [that is, in Christ] they are yes [which is a translation of \"amen\"]; therefore, also through Him is our 'Amen' to the glory of God through us.\" </strong>Now what Paul is doing here is precisely what I am trying to do this morning. He is taking the familiar word \"Amen,\" and trying to fill it back up with the <strong>theological freight</strong> that words so quickly lose, so that it has meaning and weight and power to it when we use it.”</em>\r\n\r\nWords lose their meaning at times over time, or the meaning changes. This all depends upon the person using the term and what they mean when they use a particular term. In the public school I work in, I fortunately and unfortunately get to hear all of the latest New York City slang, and hear firsthand concerning words. “OMG” means “Oh my God” and it is using the name of the Lord in a blasphemous manner, which I hear daily. “oh my God” used to always be used in reverence toward the Lord, however, many have simply degraded it, and take the name of the Lord in vain, thus breaking the third commandment. Let us make a BIG deal about the very words used in Scripture, such as “amen.” Let us “amen” that which the Lord would “amen” agree with. If the Lord himself would not agree then why are so many professing Christians say “amen”? I would venture to say that many don’t know the Lord, and many are biblically illiterate. I often see in churches that people don’t worship God in spirit and in truth (John 4:24), but rather in the flesh and in lies! Can you really sing songs such as “I surrender all”, really have you done so? Can you sing, “I am desperate for you”, yet you are more desperate for other things rather than Him? This is why Paul says, “<strong>I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also.”</strong>Your mind must not become disengaged and take a back seat and allow your emotions to takes center stage. No, your mind and emotions must be side by side in the driver’s seat. When you sing this week, be <strong>mindful and emotional</strong> and worship in spirit and truth, and spirit and mind. To be continued….\r\n\r\n<strong>Blessings, until the nets are filled…Phil, the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt; </strong>"

              "<strong>2Corinthians 1:20–22),“20 For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. 2 And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, 22 and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee. Christ Is God's \"Amen!\" (English standard version)</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>The IVP Bible background commentary shares that f</em>rom Troas in Asia (1:8), one could sail to Macedonia, and come overland down to Corinth, as Paul had done before (<strong>Acts 16:11–12</strong>) and planned to do again (<strong>1Corinthians 16:5</strong>), and finally did later (<strong>Acts 20:1–3</strong>). <strong>1:17.</strong> Paul had been unable to fulfill his stated intention. As he says in 1:23, his decision not to stop at Corinth was to “spare” them; instead he sent Titus ahead with a harsh letter (1:23–2:11; 7:7–12). When Titus did not return to the appointed meeting place in Troas, Paul feared for him (given the dangers of traveling in antiquity) and went on into Macedonia (2:12–13). There Paul met up with Titus again, who gave him good news about them (7:5–16).<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> Digressions were standard in ancient writing, and Paul here digresses (1:18–22) to assure them that he indeed had a good reason for not coming; he was a representative of the God who always kept his word, and he proclaimed a faithful gospel. “Amen” functioned as a positive affirmation at the end of a prayer, and Christ became the amen and yes to all the biblical promises of a truly faithful God<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a><!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf you recall the promises of God throughout the Bible, also the format of (Deuteronomy 27:15-26) whereby the people shouted “amen,” now Paul pulls from this backdrop and he says: We utter out “Amen” to God for His<strong> glory. The Glory of God, is what God is all about. God is chiefly concerned with his glory. Many people that speak about God do so starting with humanity. I can think of a well known song that</strong> has as part of the lyrics, “<em>crucified, laid behind a stone; you lived to die rejected and alone, like a stone trampled on the ground, you took the fall and thought of ME above all.”</em> This may come as a shocker, but this song has inaccurate theology. Christ was thinking about glorifying His Father, and not about you or I. Perhaps you think that sounds selfish of God, but fail to realize that God exists for His own glory, and the best thing for us to do is to live for His glory as well. The Westminster Shorter Catechism asks the question, <strong>“What is the chief end of man”?</strong> It answers the question by stating, “<strong><em>Man’ s chief end is to glorify God</em></strong>, (1Corinthians 10:31, Romans 11:36) <strong><em>and to enjoy him for ever</em></strong>. (Psalm 73:25–28)”\r\n\r\nJohn Piper shares beautifully how the glory of God and the “amen” meet saying, <em>“He [Paul] says first that Christ is God's \"Yes\" to all the promises of the Bible: \"As many are the promises of God, in him they are Yes.\" Christ is God's Amen to all that he has spoken. Christ affirms them and even secures them by his blood. The fact that you don't deserve God's promise to pursue you with goodness and mercy all your days, is now no obstacle. Christ has taken your ill-desert on him, and put his righteousness on you. He is God's yes to all the promises in your life. For his sake you will get them if you trust him</em>.” You see God judged Christ as if He lived your life, so He can judge you as if you lived Christ’s life. How can you not say ‘Amen” out of sheer gratitude to a gracious Father! Piper continues “Then he says, in verse 20b, \". . . <em>therefore, also through Him is our 'Amen' to the glory of God.\" In other words, <strong>the reason we say \"Amen\"</strong> through Christ when we hear the promises of God preached or hear a prayer of longing for the promises of God to be fulfilled, <strong>is that Christ has said \"Amen\" to us. He is God's \"Amen\" to us</strong>.<strong> God says \"Amen\" to us through Christ in the cross, and we respond with \"Amen\" to God through Christ in preaching and prayer.</strong> So that's one more reason we should make more of this echo of agreement than we do in corporate worship and prayer</em>.”\r\n\r\nDo you ever think about your “amen” and agreeing with God? Our “amen” should be in that which lines up with the will of God. What is God’s will and where is it found? God’s will is gloriously revealed in His life changing Word. May you look at Christ as God’s glorious “amen” on the cross, and see the eternal Christ as the one that drank the cup of the wrath of God on those that He has gloriously saved by His grace. As you sit with your Bible as see the Word of God, you should “amen” as you read its awesome truth, and see the reality of applying these truths to your life. It is amazing how many sit in churches each week, hear the truths of God’s Word, perhaps say “amen” and then go home and do NOTHING by the way of application. What does your “amen” mean to the Lord, if you allow the truth to “stay in the walls of the church” because you did not absorb it in your life? The Word of God is to be realized, savored and applied to the life of the believer. There will be a hunger to do what God’s Word says. The Jews said, “amen: if you will that they were children of Abraham, yet Christ said, “31 So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, “<strong><em>If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” 33 They answered him, “We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, ‘You will become free’</em></strong>?” We have the answer to that question, we can become free in Christ, the offspring of Abraham, to which we have become His offspring if we are in Christ having been grafted into the vine. Go and search the glories of God’s Word and as you apply it, may that be your “amen” as it displays your agreement with God.\r\n\r\n<strong>Blessings, until the nets are filled…Phil, the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt; </strong>"

              "<strong><em>Hebrews 10:24-25, </em>“24 And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.”<em> (, NKJV)</em></strong>\r\n\r\nThis final part in our series on “amen” to say or not to say will focus on prayer and the word more directly, although it was certainly touched on in previous parts. Can you imagine if you just poured your heart out to someone, and there was no response? How would you know if your wife liked or disliked something you shared? If you were sharing something precious to you with another person, such as the birth of your new child in the world, can you imagine if they were indifferent to what you just shared, how discouraging that would be? <!--more-->Now think of the average prayer meeting. Many seem to become gossip sessions instead of prayer meetings when people say things like, “Oh Lord, help John Smith with his gambling issues, and to stop beating his wife,” when no one in the congregation knew that. Perhaps these things have only happened to me, but I doubt it. When we pray together, God should be the main focus, but you and I can certainly be “cheerleaders” and encouragers for someone that is pouring their heart out to the same Lord you pour yours out to. <strong>Where is the “amen” when we pray together</strong>? John Piper shares. <em> “As others pray, you whisper, \"Amen.\" Whisper, \"Yes, yes.\" Whisper, \"Umhm.\" Whisper, \"Do it, Lord.\" I say whisper, partly because I want to make it easy for you, and partly because you're not supposed to take over or draw attention to yourself. The murmur of quiet \"Amens\" and \"Yes\" and \"Umhm\" is like background music that supports the one who's praying and joins him in the prayer. And at the end of a prayer a deeply felt \"Amen\" in unison is a powerful moment before the throne of grace.</em>” Once again, it was this type of experience in the Lord, which drew me toward Evans. When he prayed, a volcanic eruption of agreement my “amen” began to spew forth from my heart, because there was agreement to what he was praying, and at that first encounter I did not even know Evans, but I did know the same Lord he knew. Honestly, I have a hard time really getting that sense of encouragement in prayer in most prayer gatherings, because the same heartbeat doesn’t seem to resonate. It’s easy to gather and to be routine and dead in a prayer gather, just going through the program type motions, but oh how awesome it is when people are in agreement together!\r\n\r\nThe above verse commands us to consider one another. The word “Consider” is the translation of<em>katanoeo</em>(κατανοεο) which speaks of attentive, continuous care. The exhortation is to take careful note of each other’s spiritual welfare. The purpose of this attentive, continuous care is to provoke each other to the exercise of love and good works. The word “provoke” is the translation of<em>paroxusmos</em>(παροξυσμος) which means “an inciting, incitement, a stimulation.” The word is used also in a bad sense, for instance, “irritation.” Here it is used in its good sense, that of a stimulation. Vincent says: “The new economy demands mutual care on the part of the members of the Christian community … They must stir up each other’sreligious affections and ministries. Another way to translate it it, “And let us constantly be giving careful attention to one another for the purpose of stimulating one another to love and good works. ”<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a><em>Do you consider one another in when you are praying together? </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Where is the “amen “ when the word of God is preached?</strong> When I was looking for a church, one of the criteria I looked for was the centrality of the Word of God in exegetical preaching. This was not easy to come across. It is so much easier for pastors not to labor in study over the Word of God, but to get a sermon off the internet. How would I say “amen” when the Word was not being preached? There would be no stirring up, no encouragement to be a slave for Christ, no conviction to forsake sin, no challenge to live holy, no agreement that God’s Word really changes lives when obeyed. Thank God, Pastor Bill Kanych and John Cornachhio were both men that studied the Word. As a man that went to Bible college, and as one that studies God’s Word myself, I was able to judge if their preaching was biblical, exegetical, and God honoring.\r\n\r\nOnce again looking to the above scripture we see the word forsake, <em>(10:25) “The word “forsaking” is the translation of egkataleipo (ἐγκαταλειπο) which means “to let down, to abandon.” “Assembling” is the translation of episunagoge (ἐπισυναγογε). The word is a compound of ago (ἀγο) “to go,” sun (συν) “with,” and epi (ἐπι). Sun (Συν) and ago (ἀγο) come over into English in the word “synagogue,” the meeting place of the Jews other than the temple at Jerusalem. Alford suggests two reasons for the addition of epi (ἐπι). It was used by the writer to take away the Judaistic sound of sunagoge (συναγογε). Or, it might point to the individual meeting places of the various assemblies. <strong> Some of the recipients of this letter were, under stress of persecution, absenting themselves from the Christian assemblies.</strong> They are exhorted not to egkataleipo (ἐγκαταλειπο), that is, let down in their attendance upon these meetings, or abandon them. They are, on the other hand to exhort each other to continued attendance, and in view of the fact of the approach of the time when the Lord would come. One can translate it this way, “Not letting down on the assembling of ourselves together, even as the custom of certain is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as ye see the day drawing near.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\"><strong>[2]</strong></a>” </em>We need to assemble together, like each piece of yarn to make the whole picture of the tapestry. How helpful are the pieces with being interwoven together? Imagine if a group of archeologists were on a dig, and one discovered an ancient city during their excavation. Would the others not gather around, and become excited, and want to get in on the good news. Then when a man of God is excavating the wonderful treasures found in God’s Word should we not also gather around the Word of God, and let him know that we are in agreement, and excited about the treasure he is sharing with us? We are to “stir” one another up which is the Greek word <em>paroxusmos</em> (παροξυσμός, 3948), “a sharpening of the feeling, or action” it causes the effect of irritation.”<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn3\"> [3]</a><strong>We must stir one another by the Word of God…“AMEN!”</strong>\r\n\r\nLet us stir one another to gather <strong>ESPECIALLY</strong> as the Day is approaching (when the Lord Jesus will return). His children with all creation will say “AMEN” at His return, and His enemies will be in peril, and curse His descending to the earth! “<em>God knows this about worship and preaching. That is why for 4,000 years he has made it simple for us: he has prepared a word. \"Amen.\" There is no talk here about shouting or dominating or distracting. This is simply the call to make preaching and praying a corporate exultation in the supremacy of God. It is a call for authentic heartfelt expressions of \"Yes\" and \"Amen.\"</em> (John Piper)” May “amen” mean more to you now than ever. Amen!\r\n\r\n<strong>Blessings, until the nets are filled…Phil, the Evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt; </strong>"

              "<strong>1Samuel 17:46, \"THIS DAY the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you... that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThere is something about <strong>\"THIS DAY (TODAY)\", </strong>which is present tense that has to be addressed otherwise we start dwelling on either yesterday which is past tense or think of tomorrow which is future tense. God has given us today to make good use as we live one day at a time. There is a song we used to sing, \"<strong>One day at a time sweet Jesus, that's all I'm asking from you, just give me strength to do every day what I have do, yesterday is gone sweet Jesus, and tomorrow may never be mine, Lord help me today, show me the way one day at a time\".</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nOver and over again the bible addresses today, Jesus said, \"<strong>do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will take care of itself</strong>\" in other words, deal with what you have today, what has already been supplied. Worrying about tomorrow or something that has not happened yet is not healthy for there is a possibility of wasting today. Today's wasted can never be recovered, for time is precious. I'm learning most of these the hard way. \"<strong>Choose ye this day whom you will serve\". </strong>\r\n\r\nThere are things we need to do that many times we neglect them thinking that we have a lot of time to do them another day. This is where the word procrastination comes in. <strong>Procrastination is to postpone or delay needlessly, to put off doing something, especially out of habitual carelessness or laziness</strong>. Someone said, <strong>procrastination is the thief of time</strong>to which I am a victim. Procrastination becomes very serious when something of priority is neglected, for example, there are people reading this who have not repented of their sins and put their trust in Jesus Christ alone for their eternal salvation. They are still procrastinating with an idea , <em>“I have a lot of time to one day do it</em>”. If tomorrow is promised to no one, <strong>today is your day of salvation.</strong> <strong>Salvation should be a priority because the day of the Lord is approaching.</strong>\r\n\r\nTo put this to perspective, let’s look at David facing Goliath. For 40 days the Israelites under the leadership of Saul had been threatened and constantly postponed or delayed needlessly their attack, later David comes into the scene and sees an opportunity to do something for there was a man who was blaspheming the name of the Living God. Remember David was not supposed to be here, he was not a warrior at this point, had no training or weapons, and had no army back up yet he is not even looking for time to go and train, build up an army and get his weapons. He understands that if he is going to fight, it's either now or never. David speaks, <strong>1Samuel 17:46, \"This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you... that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel\". This day, today, this hour I need to deal with this</strong>. As he is saying \"this day\", he has God in mind to help him overcome this day. I have so many Goliaths I have been delaying fighting because of the fear just like Saul and his people. I don't want to postpone them for tomorrow or another day, I want to face them today. You can tell that they did not mention the name of the Lord in their situation therefore for 40 days, they were afraid of facing one man. David comes to win not tomorrow but today. Not only is he planning on winning today, he has a strategy of doing it, 1. <strong>the Lord will deliver you in my hands</strong>; 2. <strong>I will strike you and take your head from you</strong>; 3. <strong>my reason for doing this is to let the whole earth know that there is a God in Israel</strong>. Imagine the time lost (40 days), they could have used that time to do better things if they had David's spirit and strategy.\r\n\r\nProcrastination is a condition we have to deal with, certain moves and decisions need to be made, things to accomplish. Delaying them may not help resolve them. Postponing paying bills, certain duties and tasks, certain responsibilities is not healthy. Let's all begin to identify things we have been putting aside that we need to deal with, face, fight and say like David, \"<strong>This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand\"</strong>. The Lord is giving us grace to deal with this day, check this out,<strong> Exodus 32:29, “For Moses had said, consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you blessings this day\", Deuteronomy 11:26, \"Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse\". </strong>If the Lord is mostly talking about this day, we too can live one day at a time dealing with things we have been postponing for so long.

              "<strong>Philippians 4:19, </strong>“<strong>But my God shall supply all my needs according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Most worry is about things that can’t be changed (the past), things that can’t be controlled (the present), things that might not happen (the future).</strong>\r\n\r\nHave you ever worried about anything lately? What is it that you worried about? How much did your worries do to change the situation positively? Were you better off after you worried than you were before?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI am sure we all have worried about something. We wouldn’t be human if we didn’t. And we wouldn’t discover that God cares about us enough to encourage us and reassure us of his ever present hand to help us in time of need. We also wouldn’t have reason to come to God in prayer and seek His guidance and will, in all matters that causes us to worry. So, in a way, worry is not totally bad and negative. There are positive aspects of worry. For example, worries may be a motivator and a jump starter in your life to get you started on doing something urgently or abandoning something because you are worried about the possible consequences or outcome of no action or poor decision. On the other hand, worry can have serious negative effects on one’s life. Worries can trigger physical ailments like ulcer or cancer or headache etc. Someone once said that <strong>“People get ulcers not so much from what they eat as from what eats them.” </strong>Worry is a silent and consistent and determined consumer of its victims. It paralyzes and in most cases hinders us from moving forward to our desired destinations. Worries also, in many cases, prevent us from maximizing our potential. We all have potential of doing or becoming anything, but evil or a failure, if we live godly life. The Scripture says in <strong>Philippians 4:13</strong> that <strong>“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”</strong> The seed of greatness and victory and blessings is hidden in all of us. That seed needs a chance to grow to its’ maximum potential for our good and for the generation to come. You and I are here because our parents allowed themselves to be stretched so they could allow the seeds in them to reach maximum potential-that resulted in you and me. Worry could have hindered or even threatened your existence. But our parents overcome some worries so we could become.\r\n\r\nWhat about you? Are you ready to stop worrying and start living? Are you ready to birth something or someone or an idea or relationship that could change your life in a positive way, very significantly or permanently? Are you ready to put all your trust in God? Did you know that He loves and cares about you so much He has taken out insurance and assurance to cover your past, present and future needs? Whatever you have lost, you can recover; what you have need of now, can be provided, and whatever might be presenting future challenge or problem will equally be resolved to your favor. How do I know? Because it is stated in your “personal assurance policy” the Bible <strong>Philippians 4:19, </strong>“<strong>But my God shall supply all my needs according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus</strong>” (3 John 2). <strong>Psalms 23: 1, 6 </strong>says “<strong>The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want (meaning I shall lack nothing necessary for living”) ...Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever”</strong>. How wonderful are these assurances that God is in charge and He cares and will ensure that nothing goes wrong in our lives if we choose to put our total trust and confidence in Him as our provider, keeper and way maker. Stop worrying, therefore, and start living. God bless you. Boaz Olang"

              "<strong>Hosea 4:6, “My people are destroyed for of lack of knowledge (in other words because of ignorance): Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee….”</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat you don’t know can destroy you or deprive you of what is rightfully yours. Ignorance has no defense, someone once said.\r\n\r\nToday, I would like to expose you to some fundamental biblical knowledge (truth) to meditate on that will help you understand and know your true self (<strong>person). Knowing who you are and whose you are is the key to your rightful position and possessions</strong> in the kingdom of God. Your life cannOt be meaningful, happy, satisfying and complete in this world without you fully understanding, from the Bible’s point of view, what God has done for you; what position God has put you and; what possessions you are entitled to as a child of God. God’s children have rights, privileges, favors, and blessings that are not available to everybody.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Who are you in the Kingdom of God</strong>? What is your relationship with God? If you don’t have a relationship with God, you don’t have a right to any of his blessings.\r\n\r\nIf you are born again, then you are a child of God. You have been empowered to be a bon-fide, legitimate child of God. God’s blood is running in your veins and any spiritual DNA test will reveal that you have a relationship with Christ. The Bible confirms that.\r\n\r\n“<strong>He came to his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave the power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God”, (John 1:11-13</strong>)\r\n\r\n<strong>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord and Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead….”</strong> (<strong>1Peter 1:3</strong>) The new relationship is a favor, privilege, blessing and honor that God has extended to all of us who were ones nothing but sinners destined for hell. For all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory (<strong>Romans 3:23</strong>).\r\n\r\nBut he has chosen you and translated you from servant-hood to sonship. Jesus said to his disciples whom he had empowered to become children of God just like you and I, “…<strong>Hence forth I call you not servants; for the servant does not know what his Lord does;…Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained YOU</strong> ….” (<strong>John 15:15-16</strong>)\r\n\r\nRise up today; think, walk, talk, act and live like a true child of God. Forget about your temporary misery, problems, challenges or lack. You have everything in Christ. Let not the lies of Satan confuse you. Stand and declare what is written. Praise God and rejoice over your new relationship with Him. Amen! God bless you<strong>. Blessings Boaz </strong>"

              "<strong>Ruth 3:8 reads, “In the middle of the night something startled the man, and he turned and discovered a woman lying at his feet.” And now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow townsmen know that you are a virtuous women.”</strong>\r\n\r\nBoaz, who the Scriptures says was a relative of Naomi’s on her husband's side, from the clan of Elimelech, was a man of wealth spoke these powerful, encouraging and defining words of the life of this one women named Ruth. Ruth had been told by Naomi to wash and put on her best clothes although it is unlikely that an impoverished Ruth would have had best clothes; the Hebrew [word] means only a \"garment.\" Her outer clothing was not defined by wealth by any means. This is going to be an important issue which we will see in a moment.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAfter instructing her not to fear, what did he focus on about Ruth? He focused on her character, her reputation. He said for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a virtuous women. How did everyone know this about her? This was quite a reputation to hold. Not just a few people close to Ruth had this testimony of her, but all in the town. Now we don’t know how many lived in the town of Bethlehem at that time, but we do know that her character NOT her clothing called attention to her. Why is that important? This is important to know because her character represented her heart while her clothing represented her outer appearance.\r\n\r\nRemember when God was approving of David and disapproving of Saul. <strong>1Samuel 16:7</strong> reads, <strong>“But the LORD said to Samuel, \"Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.” (1Samuel 16:7)</strong> We as human beings are easily impressed--and therefore often deceived--by what our eyes tell us, while God looks at the \"heart.\" God sees everything within us. Ruth would surely have answered the question that <strong>Proverbs 31:10</strong> poses when it asks, “A wife of virtue who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.” A beautiful woman by (her outward appearance) is easy to find. But a virtuous women is worth, is priced, or valued FAR MORE THAN RUBIES. The more rare a stone is the more precious it becomes. A woman of such high caliber is worth FAR MORE than any precious stone, diamond, gold, silver. Paul mentions in <strong>1 Corinthians 3:11, “If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones…</strong>, since valuable metals and precious stones were used to adorn ancient temples (<strong>Revelation 21:18-21</strong>), to portray that a life built with Christ as the foundation is like a life built by things that matter and are costly. Ruth’s life was built by things that really mattered, godly character, and everyone saw that godliness in her. The outer shell will fade away with age. Everything on a woman that perhaps is firm right now, will sag and become wrinkled one day. If all a woman possess was her outer beauty when that is gone, what will she have left?\r\n\r\nIt is believed that Ruth was in fact a beautiful women outwardly as <strong>Ruth 2:5</strong> tells us,” Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, \"Whose young woman is that?,\" suggesting a beauty and an attraction toward her. But in the end when they married yes her outward beauty played a part, but it is her inner beauty that kept this man desiring to marry her. (<strong>Ruth 4:13</strong>). Ruth would become mother to Obed, father of Jesse, father of David. Wow, what a godly heritage!\r\n\r\n<strong>Application: Perhaps you know some women of such character, but are they know by so many for their character. If you are a woman, yes, keep your beauty outwardly, but let God develop that inward beauty or keep that inward beauty if it is already present in you. When you stand before the Lord, the outward shell that caused the eyes of the opposite sex to start will be gone, and only your character will stand before God.</strong>"

              "The word \"holiness\" carries with it some unwanted baggage, thanks to \"religion.\" In the East, to be a holy man means to sit naked with your legs crossed, and having folks give you money in return for your blessing. Some holy men sit on poles for twenty years (Pillar Saints). Others stay off poles but they stay away from any contact with a sinful world, in a holier-than-thou legalism. Others live in monasteries, and have a vow of silence. Much of the Church doesn't live on poles or have a holier than thou attitude.<!--more-->They do however live in a monastery - one without walls. They, too, have a vow of silence. Few have physical contact with the world. Their association with humanity is strictly confined to the Church. Fellowship is what they have on Wednesday nights, Sunday mornings and Sunday nights. The are salt among salt, light among light.\r\n\r\nTrue holiness is the opposite of the above. <strong>It does mean that we cut ourselves off from the sin, but not from the sinners</strong>. <strong>True holiness is to be like Jesus - \"separate from sin\" and yet He was accused of being a \"friend of sinners.\" </strong>The Scriptures admonish us with these thought-provoking words: <strong>\"I wrote to you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world. But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat\", (1Corinthians 5:9-10). </strong>Can you see what the Bible is saying? If we separate ourselves from sinners, we won't be able to reach them with the gospel of salvation. The only ones we are told to separate ourselves from are hypocrites. Look at these wonderful words from George MacLeod of Scotland: <strong>\"</strong><em>I simply argue that the cross should be raised at the center of the marketplace as well as on the steeple of the church. I am recovering the claim that Jesus was not crucified in a cathedral between two candles, but on a cross between two thieves; on the town's garbage heap; at a crossroad, so cosmopolitan they had to write His title in Hebrew and Latin and Greek . . . at the kind of a place where cynics talk smut, and thieves curse, and soldiers gamble. Because that is where He died. And that is what He died for. And that is what He died about. That is where church-men ought to be and what church-men ought to be about.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThere is nothing \"spiritual\" about being holy. It just means a separation from sin. God is holy - He is sinless, and we too are called to be holy: \"<strong>But as He who has called you is holy, so you be holy in all manner of conversation\" (1Peter 1:15) See Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 15:4. See also Romans 6:19, 22; Ephesians 1:4; Titus 1:8; 1Peter 1:15.</strong>\r\n\r\nIt's as simple as this - <strong>God has given us an umbrella in the Savior to shelter us from the rain of His wrath</strong>. <strong>God has given the covering, and we are told to stay under that covering of holiness</strong>. How may we best do that? We do this by reading God's Word daily and by the cultivation of a tender conscience. By having an obedient heart, and by living in the fear of God.\r\n\r\nThe next time you try to witness to someone you know isn't right with God, and he suddenly says, <em>\"Oh, I've been born again. I know the Lord</em>,\" ask him if he is \"<em>living in holiness</em>.\" More than likely he will say that he is. Then call his bluff. Ask him to define \"holiness.\" As he is straining his brain to come up with a definition, say, The Bible says, <strong>\"Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord\" </strong>This means that we should be separated from sin and the world and then ask him if he thinks he's a good person. More than likely he will, so take the time to take him through the Moral Law. Blessings Pastor Phil."

              "<strong>Psalms 73:17, \"Until I went into the sanctuary of God, then I understood their end.\" </strong>\r\n\r\nThis beautiful Psalm (<strong>Psalm 73</strong>) was written by Asaph who was one of the worship leaders in the house of God (probably at the time of king David.)..it starts with a complaint and grief Asaph expresses over his wonderful faith in God...He looks around at the conditions of the world and sees the wicked progressing, and the sinners living happily and this brings depression in his life...he questions himself and his faith in God<strong>...\"Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence for all day long I have been plagued and chastened every morning\". Psalm 73:13-14</strong>....<!--more-->Do we ever go through situations where we may feel all this Christian stuff is useless...I can live without it...and progress in my life...yes we all do have such feelings when we look around in the world...if Asaph who was a worship leader can have such thoughts why can't we have such negative thoughts..?...but then the latter part of this wonderful Psalm is very beautiful...vs 17 is the turning point....and this can change our thoughts too..Asaph carried his burden to the Lord in prayer and then he knew the end of all such people who do not follow the Lord<strong>...\"Surely you set them in slippery places, you cast them down to destruction, Oh how they are brought to desolation as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors...\", Psalm 73:vs 18-19</strong>...and this is a fact....\r\n\r\nWe can enjoy a lot in our life but the fact is as Billy Graham says<strong> \"True happiness comes not by doing what we like to do but by doing what we are expected to do\"....</strong>God our creator expects us to be holy ......no one in the history would have ever lavished and enjoyed as King Solomon in the Bible...even though the Lord blessed him with great wisdom, he forgot the Lord and lavished in the worldly pleasures, and what was the end his kingdom was divided and his end was miserable.. Solomon himself says in <strong>Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 \"Now all has been heard, here is the conclusion of the matter, fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man, for God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing whether it is good or evil</strong>.\"...He enjoyed at his best but at the end he lamented for all his deeds.\r\n\r\nWe can find peace and true joy only in the presence of the Lord as Asaph did...\"<strong>For it is good for me to draw near to God. I have put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all your works\", Psalm 73:28</strong> ..The Bible also encourages us to believe in the Lord<strong>..\" Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD. There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off. \", Proverbs 23:17-18</strong>...also it tells us the end of sinners<strong>..\" Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of the wicked, for the evil man has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out\", Proverbs 24:19-20</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalms 1</strong> gives us a wonderful distinction between a person who follows the Lord and one who does not follow the Lord<strong>...\"Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. \", Psalm 1:1-3...</strong>and also it wonderfully tells the end of the wicked people <strong>\"Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. \" </strong>\r\n\r\nSo it is always wonderful to serve the Lord and follow Him and at the end of day we will never regret of our decision of following the Lord ....in depression we can get an answer when we go into the presence of the Lord in prayer as Asaph did...He will reveal Himself to us and fill us with the joy that surpasses all understanding.... for the Bible says <strong> \" In the presence of the Lord there is fullness there is fullness of Joy and in His right hand there are pleasures forevermore\" Psalm 16:11.</strong>"

              "<strong>Proverbs 12:12, \"...the root of the righteous yields fruit\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5957\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThere are about 269 verses in the bible that talks about fruit. Fruits have always been known as the result of what was done before. If you plant an orange tree, your aim is to get orange fruits when the time is right and so is any other tree that you plant expecting fruits. In the garden of Eden, God had planted trees and they had fruits on them. Adam and Eve were told of the trees they could eat fruits from and the one they could not eat from. God did not just tell them not to eat from it but also gave them the reasons why.<!--more--> There is something about the fruits because they are the outcome, the result of one’s labor. I believe that the fruit is a result of what is happening behind the closed doors, behind the curtains, that which is not seen. If I plant a tree hoping to get fruits, I want to be sure that it's planted on the right soil, the ground is prepared and that it will have its roots down deep in the soil. As I continue to work around the tree, it will begin to grow and spread its leaves. However beautiful or big the tree might look, I will not be satisfied until I see the fruits.\r\n\r\nI am amazed at how some people can call themselves Christians and when you look at their lifestyle, you can't see any Godly fruits. Too many leaves without any fruit and my first thought, are they planted by His river? how is their roots<strong>, Psalm 1:3, \"He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper</strong>\". You get planted by the river of the living water, your roots will go deeper and deeper as the water provides the nutrients the tree needs that it might bring fruits.\r\n\r\nYou bear the right fruits, God will prosper you in all that you do. Jesus one time was walking by and saw a tree that should have been bearing fruits, it looked healthily and nice but it was lacking the reason for its existence. When Jesus did not find any fruit on it, He cursed it and the tree dried up. God is interested in us bearing fruit because it shows who we are connected to. <strong>John 15:2, \"Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes it away</strong>\". The well spring of righteousness flows from Christ, the Living Water. A believer who has the root of righteousness will \"<strong>bear fruits worthy of repentance\" Matthew 3:8</strong>, this fruit is an evidence of growth, it tells you more about the condition of the soil and the roots.\r\n\r\n<strong>Proverbs 11:30, \"The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, And he who wins souls is wise</strong>\". People ought to enjoy the fruits from your tree, I remember when God called me into ministry, He showed me that first He would transplant me from a soil I was used to to one I was not. He showed me that my leaves would wither and dry and I would look like I will not make it but that will the beginning of His work in me. The echo of truth revealed that once He was done with me, He would use me for His glory, I needed growth. This was 18 years ago which has come to pass why? the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, you give life when you give out your godly fruits. You have the fruit of salvation, are you sharing it with someone? The bible says \"<strong>he who wins souls is wise\".</strong>\r\n\r\nA believer who continues to bear fruits God will give them grace and strength to bear fruit even in the old age<strong>, Psalm 92:14, \"They shall still bear fruit in old age; They shall be fresh and flourishing</strong>\". <em>“Lord help us lay before you the first fruit of our increase, we want tobear the fruit of the Spirit. We want to have the evidence of ourgrowth because Your word says in </em><strong><em>Mathew 7:16, \"You will know them bytheir fruits</em></strong><em>\".</em> Let people see your fruits and look for fruits in other people's lives. Have a fruitful day, Evans"

              "<strong>Revelation 3:18, “I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see”</strong>\r\n\r\nBy secular standards, true wealth is considered to be the accumulated gain one has horded to themselves. How sad though, that such a mindset has swept up the church, to the degree that many of today’s big name TV preachers tell the deceived masses that monetary gain is God’ s plan for them, and the surest sign of his blessing. Falsehood and lies I say. Look to our Lord, he had nowhere to lay His head, are we greater than Him? Here the inspired apostle pens the words of the glorified Christ, true counsel from Jesus’ heart. Here He gives us three things of value, three things that will truly enrich the life that is earnestly seeking after God. These are worth more than all this worlds riches combined.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n1.) He counsels us to buy from Him gold, refined in the fire. This gold is the true, intimate knowledge of God known by all who would abandon themselves and seek Him in truth, true spiritual wealth, for the one who knows God is truly rich, not in the ways of this world which is passing away, but in eternal ways, those which shall last for eternity. The refining is the burning away of every desire but Him, all of our self-seeking, all of our asking of Him to gain for ourselves, instead of out of a humble desire and love for God.\r\n\r\n2.) Next He counsels us to buy from Him white garments. Here is the true proof of a Christian, a holy heart and life. These are the pure garments of holiness, unspotted from the world, that every Christian is to be clothed with, for it is commanded of our God (1<strong>Peter 1:15-16</strong>) and it is required to enter Heaven’s gates, for without holiness we shall not see the Lord (<strong>Hebrews 12:14</strong>). We must be clothed in the wedding garments. The life of a Christian is marked by ongoing faith and obedience, for He that is truly born of God does not sin (has no sin as an option) (<strong>1John 5:18</strong>). The life of sin has been abandoned, we now pursue a life of holiness.\r\n\r\n3.) Lastly He counsels us to buy form Him eye salve, that we may see, true spiritual illumination, that we may see our helpless state, and that we may bow our knee humbly before His majesty, in reverence and awe, surrendering our lives wholly to Him. We are either completely His, born of His spirit and dead to ourselves, or we are still under the sway of the evil one. We mustn’t let human reason and philosophy draw us away from the truth of what God’s word says.\r\n\r\nNow you may ask, how is it that I buy these precious gems of the Christian life, how do I obtain what it is Jesus is telling me to purchase? The price is our lives, our desires, our wills. Renouncing the world and ourselves, and offering our lives as a living sacrifice to God Almighty, that He might do with us as He pleases. Our wills must be as His will, and He alone must be our desire. We must be willing to sell all to follow Him( <strong>Matthew 19:21).</strong> Then we will truly know Him, divine intimacy with the Lord of glory, Christ reining in our hearts, now and for all eternity.\r\n\r\nIn the love and truth of Christ, and for His glory alone, blessings Brother Ben"

              "<strong>Psalm 19:7, \"The law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Forsaking the use of Law in evangelism has made the Church think that apologetics are our great weapon in the battle for the salvation of the world</strong>. One could make a convincing case for that thought in what we call \"<strong>the age of enlightenment</strong>,\" when issues such as evolution and atheism have made these times unique in history. <strong>However, arguments come from the sinner's intellect</strong>. The ungodly mind is like a brick wall. It has been built to keep God out. It is at enmity with Him. It refuses to bow to the Law of God--\"<strong>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be\" (Romans 8:7). </strong>The human mind lays up arguments against God, so if you stay in that area you can expect a vicious battle. It is the mind that the Bible sites as the place of hostility--\"<strong>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has He reconciled\" (Colossians 1:21, italics added</strong>).<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThis wall of antagonism is hard and immovable, so make it a habit of going around it. Learn to speak directly to the conscience. This is good news. It means that we can be effective in our Christian witness without having to learn how to pronounce \"Australopithecus afarensis\" or define the fossil record, or know the age of the earth. When you address the conscience, these things become non-issues. It is that part of human nature that isn't an enemy of God. The conscience is God's ally. <strong>It doesn't speak against the Law of God; it speaks for it. </strong>It is the work of the Law written on their heart. <strong>It \"[bears] witness\" (Romans 2:15). It testifies for God</strong>. It is the trustworthy witness who points out the guilty party in the courtroom. It's mouth presents evidence of the Law's transgression. It is because of what it does that we should make room for it to speak as quickly as we can. If we want to win our case we must bring out our star witness and put it on the stand to give it voice.\r\n\r\nWe want to stop the mouth of the criminal, and that's what the lawful use of the Law does (see <strong>Romans 3:19</strong>). It condemns the guilty and drives him to give up his defense, so that he will be forced to look solely to the judge for mercy. <strong>It is simply a matter of moving from the intellect to the conscience </strong>(amazing as it sounds, although many have heard much about Jesus, the Cross, sin, and salvation, most have never heard the true gospel). Our mandate is to preach the Gospel to every creature (<strong>Mark 16:15</strong>), and it is the Gospel that is the \"<strong>power of God unto salvation\" (Romans 1:16</strong>). Once the Law is manifest the usual rational arguments that so often cloud the issue become irrelevant.\r\n\r\nKirk Cameron shared the teaching on the use of the Law one morning at a large church in Ohio. A few days later they received an email which shows <strong>the power of the Law to prepare the heart for the Gospel</strong>: \"<em>I just heard you speak this morning...I'm a Catholic...have been all my life...I can't even begin to tell you how much your message affected me...I've been quite speechless all day long, which if you knew me, you'd know that I'm rarely quiet. It's been a good quiet because I am so humbled all of a sudden. I want to 'take the ball and run with it', as you put it. However, I'm confused. You see, I've never been hit that hard in any Catholic service I've ever attended. How do you minister to Catholics? I can tell you that most of them don't want to hear anything unless it's from a priest. I could be wrong and hope that I am...but I'm full of questions on what to do next... Every one needs to hear what I heard this morning. I'm just so full of.....well, I don't even know how to describe it. My life has been changed since this morning. I can't thank you enough</em>”. This passage has been pulled from the book Revival's Golden Key by Ray Comfort with Kirk Cameron, an excellent book on evangelism.\r\n\r\nWe have come to appreciate the use of law in our witnessing, time and time again, we have sinner's mouth get stopped from justifying themselves. <strong>Galatians 3:24, \"Therefore the law was our school master to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith</strong>\".

              "<strong>Romans 5:1-5, “1 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us”</strong>\r\n\r\nOften when we hear teachings on faith, we think of faith as a means of expectation and it is, however there is more to faith than that. Rarely do we hear teachers, pastors tackle “Sustaining Faith or Enduring Faith”. We minimize or devalue sustaining faith because it may not promise new things, it holds in place what can easily be broken and lost. It maintains it and sustains it for long even unto the end.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nPaul in this chapter begins with justification by faith, the state in which those who have repented and trusted in Christ alone for their eternal salvation are declared not guilty. This faith makes believers peaceable with God through Jesus Christ. Through this faith we also have access into this grace in which we stand. This grace (unmerited favor) is sustained by/through faith in every stage of a Christian life. This grace through faith produces joy because of the hope it reveals. <strong>It is the hope that sees the end result despite of the current status.</strong>\r\n\r\nA believer who knows his end results works his ways backwards. To explain this point, think of an athlete looking forward to the finish line, his mind is not consumed with the present. He may think of it, but he is not consumed, entangled, or held by it. The thought of the finish lines gives him the ability to endure knowing that what he has to face cannot be compared to what awaits him. He has faith that the hindrances are temporal. With this truth, “<strong>3 …we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint…,” why? “…because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us”</strong>\r\n\r\nFaith that sustains gives assurance that the prayers offered to God are not in vain. God hears and He is concerned about what we all go through, however God is in the business of forming and filling. He forms first that He may fill. The forming process is hard that is why we need sustaining faith that guides us through tribulation as it produces endurance that builds character revealing hope that develops such a greater faith. <strong>Hebrews 5:7-8</strong>, paints that clear picture, “<strong>7 During the days of Jesus’ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. 8 Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered 9 and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him”, NIV. </strong>We can see that even Jesus did not escape Romans 5.\r\nI have seen this enduring faith sustain us during these years dealing with infertility. I have seen it sustain my brother by accident has currently been confined to a wheelchair. I have seen this faith sustain a friend who lost her husband recently.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as we are saved by faith, we must be sustained by faith, be purified by it until the end for in this grace through faith we STAND.

              "<p>One day, as an artist was down on his knees pounding with chisel and mallet at the base of his sculpture, a preacher approached and said, \"I wish I could deal such changing blows to the hearts of men.\" The sculptor looked up at him, and with a steadfast gaze replied, \"Maybe you could if you worked like me…down on your knees.\"</p><p> </p><p>Jesus never taught His disciples to preach. Instead, He taught them to pray. EM Bounds said, “All ability to talk to men is measure by the ability with which a preacher can talk to God (about) men.” These were the leaders who would spread the message He died for through preaching and teaching, yet Jesus taught them more about praying than He did about public speaking. Prayer was the decisive factor in spreading the gospel; prayer was the primary ministry they were called to; prayer was the guarantee they would succeed.</p><p> </p><p>Charles Spurgeon once cried, \"We need red-hot, white-hot men who glow with intense heat; whom you cannot approach without feeling that your heart is getting warmer; who burn their way in all positions straight on to the desired work; men like thunderbolts flung from Jehovah's hand, crashing through every opposing thing, till they have reached the target aimed at; men impelled by Omnipotence.\" Such a fervent condition can only be obtained through prayer. It cannot be learned in school, although school is good. It cannot be gotten by books, although reading is good. Prayer is what soaks a preacher’s soul in the burden of God and empowers him to ignite others.</p><p> </p><p>In Acts 4:13, the religious leaders marveled at the apostles. They knew these men were “uneducated and untrained,” and yet “they marveled…and realized they had been with Jesus.” And more, they saw “the man who had been healed standing with them (and) could say nothing against it.” Peter and John had no silver and they had no gold. They had no earthly resources or human ability to rely on. All they had was what had been obtained in prayer: Holy Ghost unction. With that, they healed a cripple man, confounded the religious elite and ushered in a revival that would turn the world upside down.</p><p> </p><p>Today, however, we have plenty of silver and gold. Today, we have the most intelligent and intellectual preachers that seminaries can produce—but how many of them have truly been with Jesus. How many can persevere in prayer long enough to make any lasting difference in a culture that is rapidly going to hell.</p><p> </p><p>Without prayer, we may be able to attract a crowd but we'll never convert them into disciples.  Without prayer, we may be able to build large churches with with attractive programs, but there will be no encounter with the presence of God that melts hardened hearts, transform lives and produce men and women who are on fire for God ready to ignite the world for Jesus Christ.</p>"

              "<strong>Genesis 39:1-23, \"And his master saw that the Lord was with him and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that Lord made all he did to prosper in his hand</span>.\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/images.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-6255 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/images.jpg\" alt=\"images\" width=\"246\" height=\"205\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nWhat would you do if what you always dreamed for wasn't coming to pass?  instead of things getting better, you got  further and further away from it. Joseph is a good example, he had a dream at the age of 17 and his dream was not that one day he would fail but that one day he will be great and that his family and many people would bow to him. Talk to any teenagers today and hear all their dreams and desires of success. You must have had dreams at that age too. Joseph had a good dream but he was naive, boastful and insensitive towards his brothers. He did not even realize that the dream was not about him but a picture of Christ. In his case, a lot of character building was needed before God fulfilled all that He planned.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Genesis 39:1, \"Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an office of Pharaoh... brought him from Ishmaelites who had taken him down there</strong>\". He was brought to Egypt as a slave, bowing to someone else. What happened to the dream in which people would be bowing to him? It's not surprising that some people become careless when things are not going as they planned and expected. They misuse what they have, they envy others, they treat the position they have casually, doing a poor job because that is not where they wanted to land. Sitting down and being lazy was not Joseph’s position, he was not where he desired to be but yet he was still faithful, hardworking, honest, efficient, effective, responsible and initiative in all he did. The bible says in <strong>vs. 2, \"The Lord was with Joseph, and he was successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian\"</strong>. You don’t hear a voice from heaven telling him how to live but you see the effects of how he lived because God was with him and gave him wisdom. <strong>Proverbs 2:6-8</strong> reads, “<strong>For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding; He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk uprightly; He guards the paths of justice, And preserves the way of His saints”. </strong>A number wait for a voice from heaven before they do things, however how come we don’t apply the same way when it comes to putting food on the table or roofs over our heads. We go out in the light of God’s word to look for jobs, and we trust His guidance and when we get the jobs, we work hard. That is wisdom, the wisdom of God, seeking to do good while not leaning on our own understanding, <strong>Proverbs 3:5</strong>.\r\n\r\nJoseph had every opportunity to complain yet he chose to channel those opportunities to enlarge his character by serving faithfully, <strong>Philippians 2:14, \"Do all things without complaining and disputing</strong>\". It's like Joseph saying, <em>\"I am not where I desire to be and I don't know if I will get there or not, one thing I know, I have responsibilities to my master and I will do it faithfully, do well and make my master proud</em>\". I don't believe the Lord told him what to do, he just saw an opportunity to serve and the Lord blessed him for being initiative. Later he was made overseer of the entire house of Potiphar, things were beginning to be better, he was good at what he is doing and the Lord was trully blessing the house. And then he lost his position because Potiphar's wife. Once beaten and thrown in prison, someone would think he would stop being the man of character, but even in prison, he served, he was initiative and responsible. This allowed him to have favor with the keeper of prison and once again he was made in charge. He outshined them all.\r\n\r\nJoseph allowed people to see the Lord in him by working hard, being responsible and being a man who was initiative. Whatever he did, the Lord made it prosper and so is with us today. You may not be where you want to be in career, relationship, job wise, position but you can still be all you can for God right where you are. <strong>Colossians 3:17</strong> <strong>“And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him”,.. 23 And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men.”</strong>\r\n\r\nDo not sit and wait for the Lord to bring you to your destiny when He has allowed you to be in a place for such as time as this to grow your character before He can enlarge you. You need to incorporate the word “Initiative” which means doing good things without being told but this begins with wisdom you can ask the Lord for. Do the best you can with all you have and the Lord will bless and prosper you in all you do. Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>1Kings 18:1-45, “17 Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, “Is that you, O troubler of Israel?” 18 And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and have followed the Baals.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6106\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" /></a></strong>Whenever you are dealing with happenings, we need to get to the starting point, the root. Without understanding the starting point, finger pointing can easily be done. In our day, people are finger pointing politicians, mother nature, religious leaders, young people, Hollywood etc. In the midst of finger pointing, we try to deal with the symptoms ignoring to address the bigger issue lying underneath those symptoms.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nElijah had proclaimed a time of draught in Israel in <strong>1Kings 17.</strong> The first question to ask is, why would a man of God proclaim a draught? It was because of the sins of the Israelites. Ahab’s father Omri was a wicked king reliving the evil ways of Jeroboam. When Ahab became the next king, he took the wickedness of his father and Jeroboam to a greater level. As Matthew Henry better highlights it, “<em>Ahab did evil above all that reigned before him, and did it with a particular enmity both against Jehovah and Israel. He was not satisfied with breaking the second commandment by image-worship, he broke the first by worshipping other gods: making light of lesser sins makes way for greater. Marriages with daring offenders also imbolden in wickedness, and hurry men on to the greatest excesses. One of Ahab's subjects, following the example of his presumption, ventured to build Jericho. Like Achan, he meddled with the accursed thing; turned that to his own use, which was devoted to God's honor: he began to build, in defiance of the curse well devoted to God's honor: he began to build, in defiance of the curse well known in Israel; but none ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered” </em>Ahab was trouble with capital T. <strong>1Kings 16:33,” And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him”.</strong>\r\n\r\nNow that we know who he was, can you imagine what he must have told his people about the draught? Of course the draught was a symptom to something bigger lying beneath the draught to be addressed. Not according to Ahab, he considered himself the good king, the trouble maker was none other than Elijah the prophet of God. He (Ahab) was the one fighting for the people, leading them to worship, parading himself as to what he was not. Despite his thoughts of himself, Obadiah his servant knew better. He hid the righteous from being massacred by Jezebel,  Ahab’s wife who was as wicked as he was, if not to a greater level. Obadiah knew Elijah was the true man of God, when he saw him, he recognized Elijah as his lord and even bowed himself before him. Not with Ahab, he was righteous in his own eyes.\r\n\r\n<strong>1Kings 18:1-45, “17 Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, “Is that you, O troubler of Israel?” 18 And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and have followed the Baals.” </strong>Is it not ironic that Ahab was the first to accuse Elijah of being the trouble maker? Well Elijah did not spare him but revealed to him that he was the trouble maker and why he considered him that way.\r\n\r\nThere is an assault on the word of God through movies, feminism, same sex marriages, ways to build marriages, raise kids etc. Apostle Paul is accused of being a trouble maker in addressing biblical headship, marriages etc. The church is considred trouble maker (hate speech) when speaking against certain sins. In summary, those who expose the lies of the enemy will be considered trouble makers. Those who expose the sin in the world the reason for many of the calamities we face will be considered trouble makers. While Elijah proclaimed a draught that affected the land, he was a prophet sent to restore Israel to God and the draught was part of that purging process in preparation for restoration. And we see that after this meeting with Ahab, he challenges him to prove the true God before ending the draught.\r\n\r\nOne may guess how people stand affected to God, by observing how they stand affected to his people and ministers. It has been the lot of the best and most useful men, like Elijah, to be called and counted the troublers of the land. Ahab thought to awe him into submission, but the prophet boldly and un disguisedly told the king that the national calamity was traceable chiefly to his own and his family's patronage and practice of idolatry. While he pointed a finger at Elijah, three of his fingers pointed at him.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to look at the symptoms and blame someone else. Can we be honest with ourselves and look deeper past the symptoms and see what the true heart of the issue are and repent to God and be restored? <strong>Proverbs 28:13, “He who covers his sins will not prosper, But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.” </strong>God is not the trouble maker, we are and only in humility and repentance can we be restored.

We would much rather complain about the way things are than make the sacrifice to change it, but character requires sacrifice. Those of us who know the Lord are called to make that sacrifice; we are called to live on a higher plane. Christians, above any other group, should be known as persons of character.\r\n\r\nThe references to character in the Bible indicate it’s something to be sought after. The Apostle Paul points out the unique relationship between suffering, perseverance, and character. The suffering he’s referring to are the trials and difficulties experienced by believers. He’s assuming, of course, that those who are persecuted would faithfully and courageously endure their persecutions; that they would not break under pressure and deny their faith in Christ.\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognize the difference between perseverance and character. Perseverance is something we do, but character is something we have… or don’t have. Character is all about who we are and what we’re made of. Paul’s conclusion is that those who persevere through trials are men and women of character. Their character is made evident by their response to what is happening to them. This definition of character presupposes two things.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>First, there is an Absolute Standard by which to define right and wrong.</em></strong> People of character don’t make up the rules as they go along. They have already agreed upon the rules beforehand. When faced with any situation, they don’t ask, “What’s right for me?” Instead, they ask, “What’s right?” People of character believe in an Absolute Standard of right and wrong that overshadows the entire human race, one to which all people are held accountable. According to the Bible, God is that Standard. He determines what is right and wrong. He has already set limits on human behavior. His code of conduct never changes or shifts with a particular culture or time period.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>The second thing character presupposes is the ability and willingness to obey.</em></strong> Agreeing with the rules of the game is one thing, but playing by the rules is something else entirely. How many of us break the law every day? Men and women of character have not only agreed to God’s code of conduct, but they also live for it.\r\n\r\nWhereas achievement and fulfillment are the chief pursuits for many in this world, it’s different for men and women of character. They’re not necessarily opposed to achieving certain goals, but the difference is in their priorities. They are not against personal fulfillment, but for them, obedience takes priority over achievement. Self-control takes precedent over self-fulfillment. It is all a matter of priorities.\r\n\r\nAre you willing to make character a priority? I have never met anyone who is against character, yet few people make it their priority. Men and woman are often quick to compromise their character if that is what it takes to reach the next step in whatever ladder they choose to climb. For many people, what they can do on the outside is not nearly as important as who they <em>are</em> on the inside.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>To be persons of character, we must submit ourselves to God’s code of conduct.</em> </strong>We must agree with Him that His ways are right – whether we understand or not. We must have the attitude that says, “Lord, before You even tell me what the right thing to do in my particular situation is, I already believe You are right.” <em>Then, we must</em> <em>follow through and actually do what God says. </em>People of character do what is right simply because it is right. It is right because God says it is right.\r\n\r\nI’d like you to try an experiment with me: think about all the places you could go to improve your outer appearance. Most stores are geared toward making us look or feel better. We’re bombarded from every direction by products designed to improve our looks and health. Just pick up any magazine and flip through the advertisements, or watch any commercial on TV.\r\n\r\nNow, think for a moment about how many places are geared toward developing character. This list is significantly shorter than the first. Other than church, we don’t have much to choose from. There was a time when we could have put school on that list, but that’s not necessarily true anymore.\r\n\r\nClearly, we live in a world that is totally committed to the outer person and neglects the inner person. Yet, the social problems in this nation, the ones commentators and politicians are constantly complaining about, are not rooted in our appearance. Most of our problems stem from a lack of character among our leaders and citizens. Our biggest deficit in this nation is not a budget deficit or unemployment, but a lack of character.\r\n\r\nIf we don’t have a plan for developing our character, we simply will not. We will fall in line with everyone else. The only difference is believers will go to heaven when they die and unbelievers will not. My point is this: none of us drift into character. It takes effort; it takes a plan. Even as Christians, we’re prone to allow the cares of this world to choke out any time for working on the part of us that is most crucial to our genuine happiness and success – our character.\r\n\r\nCharacter is to relationships what oil is to an engine. If we took apart the engine of a new car, we would find that each part is made to work perfectly with all the other parts of the engine. They were made for each other. Yet, if you run that engine without oil, it will eventually destroy all the other parts around it. The fact the parts are perfectly suited for each other is not enough. When there is a deficit in character, we pay for it in our relationships. It does not matter how perfectly suited we are for each other. If we don’t have character, there is going to be friction.\r\n\r\n<strong>A Plan for Developing Character:</strong>\r\n\r\nPart of my plan for developing my character involves a list of several traits I want to be known for. I rehearse my list mentally throughout the day. I meditate on Scripture that deals with these things. I pray every day that God would work on my character to the point where these characteristics will shape my public reputation. I want to be known as a man of godly character.\r\n\r\nPraying to God for help developing my character is one thing, but when I get specific, that’s when I really begin to see a change. I think through the kind of person I want to be (not what I want to accomplish, but what God and others perceive me as being in my heart). Then, I work the list. I look for practical ways to work the qualities into my life.\r\n\r\nYou will be amazed at how your personal plan unfolds. You may change your list from time to time. That’s fine. But keep it going. That way, you will see your progress and you will stay involved in the process.<em> </em>\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Back-Basics-Guide-Christian-Living-ebook/dp/B00KKTTB7E/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415666778&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=joe+quatrone+jr\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3390\" src=\"http://magnifyhisword.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/cover-2.jpg\" alt=\"COVER 2\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" data-originalSrc=\"https://joequatronejr.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/cover-2.jpg?w=200\" data-rehosted=\"1\"></a>Did you like this article?

Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To Him be honor and might forever. Amen.\r\n\r\nTimothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith.</blockquote>\r\nWhile caring for the needs of his people, Timothy needed to care for himself as well. “But you” indicates a contrast between Timothy and the false teachers. They were men of the world, but he was a “man of God.” This special designation was also given to Moses (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut.+33%3A1&amp;version=NIV\">Deut. 33:1</a>), Samuel (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Sam.+9%3A6&amp;version=NIV\">1 Sam. 9:6</a>), Elijah (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+17%3A18&amp;version=NIV\">1 Kings 17:18</a>), and David (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Neh.+12%3A24&amp;version=NIV\">Neh. 12:24</a>); so Timothy was in good company.\r\n\r\nPaul gave four admonitions to Timothy that, if obeyed, would assure him success in his ministry and a continued testimony as “a man of God.”\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Flee (</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+tim+6%3A11&amp;version=NIV\"><strong><em>v. 11a</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> There are times when running away is a mark of cowardice. “Should such a man as I flee?” asked Nehemiah (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Neh.+6%3A11&amp;version=NIV\">Neh. 6:11</a>). But there are other times when fleeing is a mark of wisdom and a means of victory. Joseph fled when he was tempted by his master’s wife (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.+39%3A12&amp;version=NIV\">Gen. 39:12</a>) and David fled when King Saul tried to kill him (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Sam.+19%3A10&amp;version=NIV\">1 Sam. 19:10</a>). The word “flee” that Paul uses here does not refer to literal running, but to Timothy’s <em>separating himself</em> from the sins of the false teachers.\r\n\r\nNot all unity is good and not all division is bad. There are times when a servant of God should take a stand against false doctrine and godless practices, and separate himself from them. He must be sure, however, that he acts on the basis of biblical conviction and not because of a personal prejudice or carnal agenda.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Pursue (</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+tim+6%3A11&amp;version=NIV\"><strong><em>v. 11b</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> Separation without positive growth becomes isolation. We must cultivate these graces of the Spirit (“righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness”) in our lives or else we will be known only for what we oppose rather than for what we propose.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Fight (</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+tim+6%3A12-16&amp;version=NIV\"><strong><em>vv. 12–16</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> The verb means “keep on fighting!” It is a word from which we get our English word <em>agonize</em>, and it applies both to athletes and to soldiers. It describes a person straining and giving his best to win the prize or win the battle. Near the end of his own life, Paul wrote, “I have fought the good fight” (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Tim.+4%3A7&amp;version=NIV\">2 Tim. 4:7</a>).\r\n\r\nThis “fight,” however, is not between believers; it is between a person of God and the enemy around him. He is fighting to defend the faith, that body of truth deposited with the church (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A20&amp;version=NIV\">1 Tim. 6:20</a>). Like Nehemiah, Christians today need to have a trowel in one hand for building and a sword in the other hand for battling (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Neh.+4%3A17&amp;version=NIV\">Neh. 4:17</a>). It is sad when some Christians spend so much time fighting the enemy that they have no time to do their work and build the church. On the other hand, if we do not stand guard and oppose the enemy, what we have built could be taken from us.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that encourages us in the battle? We have “eternal life” and need to take hold of it and let it work in our experience. We have been called by God and this assures us of victory. We have made our public profession of faith in Christ and others in the church stand with us.\r\n\r\nAnother encouragement in our battle is the witness of Jesus Christ our Savior. He “witnessed a good confession” before Pontius Pilate and did not relent before the enemy. He knew God the Father was with Him and watching over Him, and He would be raised from the dead. It is “God who makes all things alive,” who is caring for us, so we need not fear. Timothy’s natural timidity might want to make him shrink from the battle. But all he had to do was remember Jesus Christ and His bold confession, and this would encourage him.\r\n\r\nPaul gave Timothy military orders: “I charge you” (also <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+tim+1%3A3&amp;version=NIV\">1:3</a>). He was to guard the commandment and obey it. Why? Because one day the Commander would appear and he would have to report on his assignment! The only way he could be ready would be to obey the orders “without spot or blame.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a sinful human to approach the holy God. It is only through Jesus Christ that we can be accepted into His glorious presence. Why did Paul write so much about the person and glory of God? Probably as a warning against the “emperor cult” that existed in the Roman Empire. It was customary to acknowledge regularly, “Caesar is Lord!” Of course, Christians would say, “Jesus Christ is Lord!” Only God has “honor and power everlasting.” If Timothy was going to fight the good fight of faith, he had to decide that Jesus Christ <em>alone</em> was worthy of worship and complete devotion.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Take Hold (</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+tim+6%3A20-21&amp;version=NIV\"><strong><em>vv. 20–21</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> God had committed the truth to Paul (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+1%3A11&amp;version=NIV\">1 Tim. 1:11</a>) and Paul had committed it to Timothy. It was Timothy’s responsibility to guard the deposit and then pass it along to others who would, in turn, continue to pass it on (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Tim.+2%3A2&amp;version=NIV\">2 Tim. 2:2</a>). This is God’s way of protecting the truth and spreading it around the world. We are stewards of the doctrines of the faith and God expects us to be faithful in sharing His Good News.\r\n\r\nWhy should Timothy avoid the teachings of those who claimed to have special knowledge from God (the Gnostics)? Because some who got involved with them “wandered from the faith.” Not only will wrong motives (a desire for money) cause a person to wander from the faith (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A10&amp;version=NIV\">1 Tim. 6:10</a>), but so will wrong teachings. These lies work their way into a person’s mind and heart gradually, and before he realizes it, he is wandering off the path of truth.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Rich (</strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A17%E2%80%9319&amp;version=NIV\"><strong>1 Tim. 6:17–19</strong></a><strong>)</strong>\r\n<blockquote>Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. In this way, they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.</blockquote>\r\nPaul had already written about the danger of the love of money, but he added a special “charge” for Timothy to give to the rich. We may not think this charge applies to us, but it does. After all, our standard of living today would certainly make us “rich” in the eyes of Timothy’s congregation!\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Be humble (</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A17&amp;version=NIV\"><strong><em>v. 17a</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> If wealth makes a person proud, then he understands neither himself nor his wealth. “But remember the Lord your God for it is He who gives you the ability to produce wealth” (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut.+8%3A18&amp;version=NIV\">Deut. 8:18</a>). We are not owners; we are stewards. If we have wealth, it is by the goodness of God and not because of any special merits on our part. The possessing of material wealth ought to humble a person and cause him to glorify God, not himself.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to be “rich in the world” and be poor in the next. It is also possible to be poor in this world and rich in the next. Jesus talked about both (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16%3A19%E2%80%9331&amp;version=NIV\">Luke 16:19–31</a>). But a believer can be rich in this world and also rich in the next if he uses what he has to honor God (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+6%3A19%E2%80%9334&amp;version=NIV\">Matt. 6:19–34</a>). In fact, a person who is poor in this world can use even his limited means to glorify God and discover great reward in the next world.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Trust God, not wealth (</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A17&amp;version=NIV\"><strong><em>v. 17b</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> The rich farmer in our Lord’s parable (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+12%3A13%E2%80%9321&amp;version=NIV\">Luke 12:13–21</a>) thought his wealth meant security, when really it was an evidence of insecurity. He was not really trusting God. Riches are uncertain, not only in their value (which changes constantly), but also in their durability. Thieves can steal wealth, investments can drop in value, and the ravages of time can ruin cars and houses. If God gives us wealth, we should trust Him, the Giver, and not the gifts.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Enjoy what God gives you (</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A17&amp;version=NIV\"><strong><em>v. 17c</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> Yes, the word <em>enjoy</em> is in the Bible! In fact, one of the recurring themes in the book of Ecclesiastes is, “Enjoy the blessings of life now because life will end one day” (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+2%3A24&amp;version=NIV\">Ecc. 2:24</a>; <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3%3A12%E2%80%9315&amp;version=NIV\">3:12–15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3%3A22&amp;version=NIV\">22</a>; <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+5%3A18%E2%80%9320&amp;version=NIV\">5:18–20</a>; <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+9%3A7%E2%80%9310&amp;version=NIV\">9:7–10</a>; <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+11%3A9%E2%80%9310&amp;version=NIV\">11:9–10</a>). This is not sinful “hedonism,” living for the pleasures of life. It is simply enjoying all God gives us for His glory.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Employ what God gives you (</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim.+6%3A18-19&amp;version=NIV\"><strong><em>vv. 18–19</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em>.</strong> We should use our wealth to do good to others; we should share; we should put our money to work. When we do, we enrich ourselves spiritually and make investments for the future (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16%3A1%E2%80%9313&amp;version=NIV\">Luke 16:1–13</a>). Riches can lure a person into a make-believe world of shallow pleasure, but riches <em>plus God’s will</em> can introduce a person to life that is real and ministry that is lasting.\r\n\r\nPaul’s final sentence was not for Timothy alone because the pronoun is plural: “Grace be with all of you.” Paul had the entire church in mind when he wrote this letter, not just Timothy. As the pastor and leader of the church, Timothy needed to heed the word of the apostle; but all of his church members had a responsibility to hear and obey as well.\r\n\r\nAnd so do we today.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/stand-firm.gif\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3462\" src=\"http://magnifyhisword.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/stand-firm.gif\" alt=\"Stand Firm\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\" data-originalSrc=\"https://joequatronejr.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/stand-firm.gif?w=300\" data-rehosted=\"1\"></a>To Think About and Discuss</strong>\r\n\r\n1. In what practical ways do we “take hold of … eternal life”? How will it affect our attitude and order our priorities?\r\n\r\n2.

              "<strong>Leviticus 17:11, &quot;For the life of the flesh is in the blood...&quot;</strong>\n\nI for one believe in a Christians’ growth, I am always quick to tell whether I am growing or stagnant. It bothers me when I am stagnant and that drives me to look for opportunities to grow in Christ even more. A couple of things help me grow, prayers, teaching the word, evangelizing etc.<!--more-->\n\nIn <strong>John 15:5</strong>, Jesus said “<strong>I AM the vine, you <em>are</em> the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing”.</strong> He is always the vine, then question is, are we abiding/remaining that we may bear fruit? The bible does not say that you shall produce fruits, it says “<strong>you shall bear fruit</strong>” which I could say “carry”. <strong>If you can withstand abiding, you don't even have to struggle to bear fruits, they will flow because you are abiding</strong>.\n\nThere is something about a biding we can learn, a better picture that could make this point clear is,<strong> John 19:34, &quot;But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out&quot;. </strong>In my reading about the life of Christ, not at any given moment do I hear that He bled until the crucifixion hour got closer. As He was praying in the final hours, He sweat blood. We then see blood again when they whipped Him, and then forced a crown of thorn on His head. The final was when they nailed Him on the cross and thereafter a Roman soldier pierced Him on His side.\n\nIf you have a cut, the first thing you do or they do for you is stop the cut from bleeding by all means for there have been people who have bled to death. Jesus on the other hand was bleeding from being beaten with a whip, from the crown of thorn forced onto His head, bleeding after being nailed on the cross and bleeding from being pierced on His side. My speculation, the more He bled His precious blood, the more He was losing His strength and being that He was also emotionally exhausted, physically, mentally carrying all the weight of sin of everyman on His back, He still could not die by any means of bleeding until His hour had come on the cross. <strong>It's very clear to us that the life of the flesh is in the blood. </strong>For one to live, he or she has to have blood flowing in them. <strong>Jesus became what He was not that we might become what we were not.</strong>\n\nWith that said, the blood that was shed on the cross was for us lost souls bought with the highest price, His blood. When the Roman soldier pierced Him, out of His side came water and blood for lost and not only that, I believe the piercing on his side is a picture of away being prepared for us to abide in Him. This way was opened for us to be grafted (connected) in to Him for eternity. We can now live, grow, bear fruit, stand, overcome because we are tied (abiding) in Him for without Him we can do nothing. He lost His blood that we may have a blood transfusion, <strong>He replaced our blood with His heavy duty blood</strong>, <strong>the precious blood of the Lamb, the blood that speaks louder than Abel's blood, the blood that never ceases to lose its power. </strong>As a song goes, &quot;<strong>There is power, wonder working power in the blood&quot;. </strong>We have established the fact that the life of the flesh is in the blood, will now talk about bleeding believers.

              "<strong>Leviticus 17:11, &quot;For the life of the flesh is in the blood...&quot;</strong>\n\nWe looked at the bleeding Savior who chose to bleed for the sake of mankind and today we will look at the bleeding believer.\n\n<strong>John 15:7, &quot;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you&quot;. </strong>One of the most tragic thing that can happen to humans is to have a cut, a wound and bleed to death. <!--more-->\nThere is something about the blood circulating in human system that has to be protected by all means. We give out blood for the saving of other patients lives. The bible indicates clearly that the life of the flesh is in the blood and the life of the gospel is in the blood, and the life of every believer is in the blood and so we need to take the blood issue seriously.\n\nIf you go back to <strong>John 15:5, &quot;I am the Vine and you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without me you can do nothing&quot;. </strong>If the blood is to continue to circulate for us to stay alive and well, we have to be connected to the source of life which is Jesus Christ. <strong>John 14:6, &quot;Jesus said to him, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me&quot;. </strong>The only way we can get to the Father is by being connected to the Son. I think many of us struggle to distinguish between who the Vine is and who the branches are. I'm not surprised for I have seen people reverse the order and they acted as though they were the Vine and Jesus was the branch. By this I mean that everything someone did, they thought they were doing the Lord a favor when in the actual sense, He is doing us a favor.\n\nListen to this, the bleeding believer is one who decides to be disconnected from the true Vine. For example, if you cut someone's hand, that hand will die and rot but the entire body will still live though in pain. <strong>John 15:4, &quot;... As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the Vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me&quot;. </strong>You detach yourself from the Lord you will bleed to death meaning spiritually die. If you detach a hand from the body yes it will still look like it still has life and kicking but give it some time while it’s loosing blood and you will see it die. We must stay abiding in the Vine every day. No moving forward without abiding on the Vine. To be honest, it's not easy staying attached to the Vine. You cannot have the fruit of the Spirit recorded in the bible (love, patience, kindness, meekness, long suffering etc.) without being connected to the Vine. Don't you understand that <strong>Christ in you the hope of glory</strong>? without Him we can do absolutely nothing.\n\nThe bleeding believer cannot retain anything for they are bleeding daily. You pour strength into them, tomorrow they are weak again; you encourage them today, tomorrow you find them discouraged; you tell them you love them, they don't feel loved enough; you speak destiny in their lives, they see themselves as failures, why? because everything you pour into their lives bleeds out. In as much as someone might encourage and strengthen you as long as you are bleeding, you will never retain for long. If you are the one to lift up a bleeding believer, if you see them the next day and the day after come to you with the same issue, they must be bleeding.\n\nWith God where there is a problem, He has provided a way out. Ask yourself the first question, are you detaching yourself from the True Vine? you could be attached to a vine but not the true one and in the process of being detached from the wrong one, you will bleed. The good news is, you can be grafted onto the True Vine. Ask yourself why you cannot hold that which is poured into you, is it because of sin?, wounded by someone?, offended, broken?. Bind up the bleeding wounds, purpose in your heart to stop the bleeding by abiding in Him. <strong>Phil 2:12, &quot;...work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&quot;. </strong>No one can work your salvation for you. You have to do it yourself, you have to desire to live and do everything by all means to stop yourself from bleeding to death and let someone come and help you bind up the wounds. Remember the woman with the issue of blood, she was bleeding too and she purposed in her heart to work out her own salvation by looking for and to Jesus, speaking to herself these words &quot;<strong>If I may but touch the hem of His garment, I know I will be made whole&quot;</strong>. And the moment she touched His garment, she was grafted to the True Vine and her bleeding stopped. God will send people to pour more into you but make sure you are abiding in Him the True Vine.\n\nI will stop here for the day, one last piece on part three tomorrow, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Leviticus 17:11, \"For the life of the flesh is in the blood...\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>John 15:7, \"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you\". </strong>Yesterday we talked about the bleeding believer who needs to abide in the vine, today I want us to concentrate on \"<strong>If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you\"</strong> It's good to abide which in other translations use the word “remain”, we also need to allow the Words of the Lord to abide (remain) in us. <!--more-->\nThe reason why the word needs to remain in us is because that is blood to sustain and fuel us to move everyday in Him. Check how John reveals to us how the Word is connected to the Lord <strong>John 1:1-5, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it\"</strong>. He was and is the Word, and in Him was life and according to <strong>Leviticus 17:11, \"For the life of the flesh is in the blood...\", </strong>His Word is life and blood to us.\r\n\r\nCheck how He came to us in <strong>John 1:14, \"And the Word became flesh (blood) and dwelt among us\". </strong>When He broke the bread with His disciples at the last supper, He said eat this bread which represents my body broken for you and the bread is also known as the Word of God. He also said drink this wine which represents the blood of the Lamb shed on the cross of Calvary. Thank God that His blood can now flow in our streams because we are abiding and we can live because He lives. We are not connected to a dead Vine but a living Vine for He is life. The more we know the Word, the more we know Him. The more we can live according to His Words, the more we are imitating the Life of Christ. His words abide in you, His words would steer you in the right direction and you will not even work hard to bear fruit, they will come because you are abiding. The reason the moon shines is because it draws its light and strength from the Sun. We as believers draw our light for the Sun (Son) Jesus and we become the moon that will shine in the middle of darkness., <strong>Matthew 5:16, \"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven\". You will not bear fruits (shine) unless you abide in Him and His words abide in you</strong>. We try so hard to produce fruits while in actuality we needed to abide and His Blood and Word would help us grow.\r\n\r\nI want us to understand that the Word can speak on it's own. Someone said the Word of God does not need an attorney or witnesses, it is able to defend itself anywhere at any time. The Word is powerful and cannot be changed or altered. When we have no voice and at times cannot defend ourselves, the Word of God will stand for sure. The Word will speak in us, for us and at the same time the Word will speak out of us. The moment that the Word leaves us, it does not loose the power and strength but we who have lost it will. <strong>Genesis 4:10, \"... the voice of thy brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground\". </strong>When Cain slew Abel, Abel died but his blood cried out to God from the ground when it could not speak from the body anymore, now in <strong>Hebrews 12:24 says, \"And Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Able\". </strong>I would rather have the Blood and the Word speak through and in me than from somewhere. My prayer for you is that you continue to abide in the True Vine and His Word will abide. We can be encouraged in this discouraging world. Let the blood of Jesus that speaks louder than Abel's circulate in our systems, our lives depend on Him for without Him, WE ARE NOTHING. <strong>Let's move from being BLEEDING BELIEVERS to BLENDING BELIEVERS</strong>. Blending believers will seize the opportunity to blend in the Lord."

              "<strong>Luke 18:10-14,&quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: `God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.' &quot;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.' &quot;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;</strong>\n\nGod loves parties I know that is hard to believe!. God loves to celebrate with His heavenly hosts. But what is it that causes heaven to throw a party? Well let’s look at the prayer of the tax collector. <!--more-->\nHe was right there with the Pharisee in the Temple. This man was on a mission to meet with God. And in the Temple he probably heard the Pharisee put him down, mock him, and compare the Pharisee’s good deeds with the unrighteous deeds of the tax-collector, their hearts were different. The tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven. Why did this man distance himself, and not even lift his head? You may have heard people say things like, &quot;If I go to church the building will fall down, or God will strike me with lightning&quot; This is a jokingly, superstitious expression, but yet it carries with it the connotation (implication) that I can’t be in the presence of God, I am not good enough. And anyone who thinks that they are not good enough is 100% correct. <strong>We are not good enough for God</strong>. This is where the Pharisee went wrong, but the tax-collector went right. Look at the repentant attitude and godly sorrow of the tax collector. It says that he &quot;<strong>beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&quot; </strong>This seven word prayer was received more than the thirty-three word prayer of the Pharisee! Why, because God is looking for an honest heart, not a self- righteous one.\n\nIn Luke 15 Jesus spoke of lost things. He told three parables which are common earthly situations told as a story to explain transcendent heavenly truths. Jesus often swung his listeners from the natural to the spiritual. And in these three parables He speaks about a lost sheep, a lost coin, and a lost son. The shepherd left the ninety-nine sheep to go after the one, the woman swept her whole house to find that precious coin, and the father of the prodigal son ran to his son when he saw him coming home from squandering his wealth in wild living. In each situation when the lost thing was found, what was the result? The shepherd, the woman, and the father ALL had the same response, they threw a party! Verse 6 says of the shepherd, &quot;<strong>And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home</strong>” Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, `<strong>Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep</strong>.' Verse 9 reads of the woman, “<strong>And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, `Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin</strong>.' And verse 23 states of the prodigal son, <strong>“Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate</strong>” <strong>This was all over the lost things being found</strong>. But here is the bigger picture. Oh yes there was a party going on down below, but it could not compare with the party going on up above in heaven. Jesus said in <strong>Luke 15:7, &quot;I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent</strong>. And again in <strong>Luke 15:10 &quot;In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&quot; </strong>\n\nWe all know what it’s like to lose something for a time, search diligently and the finally to find it. If you are not a Christian then measure your life against the 10 Commandments seeing if your broke them one by one, and then repent of your sin, receive His forgiveness, and live for God, being faithful in prayer, Bible reading and obedience. If you are a Christian then you need to be telling people about the truth of Christ. Has heaven ever thrown a party because you lead someone to Christ, or is heaven disappointed because you have been a party popper, not sharing your faith in Christ with non-believers? Who are you actively sharing the gospel with, and praying that heaven has a party in God’s honor. You share, God saves and He gets all the credit and heaven rejoices over Him who has saved a lost soul. Think about it, and obey the Lord. Blessings Pastor Phil"

At one time it would seem, they were to only provide for the family, and be strong and rugged individuals.  Women were to be at home and submissive to their husbands.  Now society seems to want to reverse the roles and identities of the two genders, and desires men to be more feminine, and women to be more masculine with the ungodly women\u2019s liberation movement.  In order to look at this issue through the lens of truth, one cannot look through the ever changing winds of this confused society, but rather to the unchanging truth of God\u2019s Word.  With that said look at the final instructions Paul wrote to the Corinthian church in his first letter to them. <\/p>\n<p>When looking at the Church in Corinth, \u201cEven by the pagan standards of its own culture, Corinth became so morally corrupt that its very name became synonymous with debauchery and moral depravity. To \u201cCorinthianize\u201d came to represent gross immorality and drunken debauchery.\u201d[1]  In Corinth there were men involved with incest (5:1), and the moral depravity was rancid.  Paul gives five commands to the Church which includes:  be alert (watchful), firm, mature, strong, and loving.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Be watchful<\/span>:  Why would Paul instruct them to be watchful and furthermore, watchful of what?  Paul used the word <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">gregoreo<\/span>, which means to stay awake, to be in continuous readiness and alertness to learn\u2014\u2018to be alert, to be watchful, to be vigilant.  If you recall the watchmen on the wall in Ezekiel, the watchmen were supposed to exemplify the tenants of the previous definition and warn the people of an enemy attack so they could be prepared for battle and thus save their lives.  However, if the watchman was asleep or failed to do his duty God would hold the watchman accountable for the blood of His people.  How do men stay alert, by staying in prayer and in the Word of God.  The Psalmist gives instruction to young men in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 119:9-11, \u201cHow can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word. 10 With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments! 11I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Men cannot be confused on their responsibilities.  Men will spend hours watching sports games on television, at the stadiums for these events, but where are the men of God that will say like Paul  I count all things as loss as compared to the treasure of Christ.  Do you watch so you can keep your life pure?  Do you look to God\u2019s Word for strength and direction on how to stay alert?  Do you memorize Scripture and quote the Word of God when you are tempted with lust, pride, and envy just as Jesus did (Luke 4, Matt 4)?  An average movie is about 2 hours long, and in that amount of time one can read the entire book of John.  Yet men make excuse after excuse as to not having time to read their Bibles.  Men make time for that which is important to them.  Be watchful!  Be like Job who said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c I have treasured the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">words<\/span> of His mouth More than my necessary <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">food<\/span>,&#8221; (Job 23:12).<\/span>\u201d  Put your Bible before your belly or to say in the vernacular no read no feed! <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Stand firm in the faith<\/span>:  Continuous holding ground, or hold ground and keep holding ground.  Paul again writes from jail, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cPut on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil\u201d Eph 6:11<\/span>.   Men in war must stand their post, fight the battle, and stand against the enemy.  Sir, do you stand firm in the faith of Christ?  Men get into God\u2019s Word daily, consistently and obey what you read.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Act like men<\/span>:  (Gk. <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">andrizomai<\/span>) is a frequent command in the Septuagint and is used in contexts encouraging people (esp. soldiers) to act with courage and strength in obedience to the Lord and with confidence in His power (<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">see Deut. 31:6\u20137, 23; Josh. 1:6\u20137, 9; 10:25; 1 Chron. 28:20; Ps. 27:14<\/span>).  One might say, MAN UP!  Men often choose movies where the man risks his life for a cause greater than himself.  Men, risk your life, living dangerously for Christ counting your life as worth nothing compared to living for Him.  Paul penned these words from JAIL, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord<\/span> (Phil 3:8).  Sir I ask you, is your heart set more on who is going to win the a national sports events or that you exemplify Christ in your life.  You must treasure Christ above all things in your life.  If someone were to ask you what the greatest treasure in your life is, would your answer be \u201cCHRIST\u201d?  Would those closest to you say that of you?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Let all you do be done in love<\/span>:  Love is HARD WORK!  The American concept of love is totally backwards, and has more to do with emotions alone than true biblical love.  Look at what Jesus said in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">John 15:13, \u201cGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends\u201d (KJV)<\/span>.  Men would you lay your life down for your wife, your children, your Lord?  Become more like Christ by digging in to the Word of God.  Read and study God\u2019s Word, and apply it to your life.  If you are too busy to spend time with God then He is not your Lord and if so read <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Matthew 7:21 \u2013 23<\/span>.  Love the Lord, love your family, love the lost (your enemies) that they might come to Christ.  Preach the Gospel and never be ashamed of it (Rom. 1:16), stand on it, and stand your ground.  I ask, if not now, when and if not here, where?  <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.

Let me hopefully finish with another message for us and our young people here.<\/p>\n<p>River Jordan though dirty is a learning ground for faith. The Jordan is where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the Son of God and Lamb of God. In biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several miracles, this was where the Israelites crossed dry land under Joshua (Joshua 3:15-17). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as &#8220;a witness&#8221; between them and the other tribes (Joshua 22:10, 22:26). The Jordan was crossed by Elijah and Elisha on dry ground (2 Kings 2:8, 2:14). Elisha performed two other miracles at the Jordan: he healed Naaman by having him bathe in its waters, and he made the ax head of one of the &#8220;children of the prophets&#8221; float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water (2 Kings 5:14; 6:6).<\/p>\n<p>The mention of the river Jordan here is a reminder to us that it takes God to do the impossible for those who have faith. We ought to teach our young people not to lose sight of trust in God at all times. The sons of sons trusted God through Elisha. You even notice in 2Kings 4:1, a certain widow who was a wife of one of the sons of the prophets seeking help from the God of Elisha, showing trust in God. And 2Kings 4:38-41 when there was famine in the land, Elisha tells them to prepare a pot of stew. There was something wrong with the soup and they turned to Elisha. Each of the miracles, he used something available but the trust was not on what he used but in God. Jesus used a boy\u2019s lunch to feed the multitude.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2kings 6:6, \u201cSo the man of God said, \u201cWhere did it fall?\u201d And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there; and he made the iron float The young man did not lose sight of where the ax head fell\u201d.<\/span> Let\u2019s teach our young people to remember where they have failed, this is not to make them miserable but learning from those experiences and trusting God to bring them through. Elisha did not yell at him or even question him, all he did was ask where the ax head fell. And when he was shown, he did not start looking for the ax head in other words leaning on his own understanding or even asking others to look with him, he presented it to the Lord first doing his part \u201ccutting off a stick\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s show our young people to cast their sticks (prayers) where the borrowed ax head has fallen. God takes delight in his people calling on him. What a joy to see a young person who has learnt the power of prayer and is not depending on the power of suggestions. Praying for small and big things, praying for knowledge, wisdom, purity, parents, unity, to be godly children, praying for their future careers, future spouses, etc knowing their trust is not in their parents but God and God uses the parents as one of the means to be a blessing to them.<\/p>\n<p>When Elisha threw the stick, the iron did float. It\u2019s not the stick that caused the iron to float and it\u2019s not our prayers that cause things to happen, it\u2019s the means by which God has chosen to hear His children while they recognize it\u2019s His doing. Whosoever wills may call.<\/p>\n<p>Elisha teaches us that sometimes the Lord would require something of us to accomplish what he has planned. He may require what is at our disposal. He has given us many things and while we use what is available, he will provide what is not available. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cIt\u2019s not by might, nor by power but by the spirit of the Lord\u201d<\/span>. We are learning and teaching our young people that we are not depending on our own strength, that what we accomplish is not the source of our strength but the means by which God is at work in us. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Philippians 2:13, \u201cfor it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Are your young people trusting in you for things or have you taught them taught to trust in the Lord demonstrating it in prayer?. Do they look to you as the source or the means by which God provides for them. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 3:5, \u201cTrust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; 6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths\u201d, Psalm 118:8, \u201cIt is better to trust in the LORD, than to put confidence in man\u201d, Psalm 20:7, \u201cSome trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God\u201d, Psalm 46:1, \u201cGod is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble\u201d, Psalm 127: 1, \u201cUnless the LORD builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, The watchman stays awake in vain<\/span>\u201d, what is the message to us and our young people?

Go up, you baldhead!\u201d<\/span>, these were teenagers who were old enough to discern right from wrong. They were of the age of accountability. And by saying \u201cgo up, go up\u201d, they may have watched from a distance as Elijah was taken and they made fun of Elisha to follow him. The repetition shows their heartiness and earnestness, that it was no sudden slip of their tongue, but a scoff proceeding from a rooted impiety and hatred of God and his prophets. These were young people who had no fear of God in them which is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10).<\/p>\n<p>So what did Elisha do, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 24, &#8220;So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the LORD. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths<\/span>\u201d wow, that sounds severe and sounds like Elisha abused the power given to him. Let\u2019s analyze this, he cursed them in the name of the Lord. This was a fulfillment in my judgment of the commandment <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Exodus 20:12, \u201cHonor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you<\/span>\u201d. This is the only commandment  with a promise but if you read it carefully, you also discover that it has also a threat. These young people came from idolatrous city; their parents had not trained them in the fear of the Lord for they did not fear the Lord themselves. While we think it\u2019s harsh, God demonstrated righteous judgment. This is why we must teach our young people the fear of the Lord by first never treating God casually among other things, setting the example, teaching  reverence which is crucial.<\/p>\n<p>Listen to Matthew Henry, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cLet parents, that would have comfort in their children, train them up well, and do their utmost betimes to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in their hearts; for, as bishop Hall says, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">&#8220;In vain do we look for good from those children whose education we have neglected; and in vain do we grieve for those miscarriages which our care might have prevented.&#8221;<\/span><\/span><br style=\"font-style:italic;\" \/><br \/>Jesus also rebuked the Scribes and the Pharisees (Matthew 15) who had transgressed the commandments of God because of their traditions. They were more concerned questioning Jesus about His disciples eating bread without washing their hands. You know what the Lord said to them? Matthew <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">15:3 \u201cHe answered and said to them, \u201cWhy do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">4 For God commanded, saying, \u2018Honor your father and your mother\u2019; and, \u2018He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.\u2019 5 But you say, \u2018Whoever says to his father or mother, \u201cWhatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God\u201d\u2014 6 then he need not honor his father or mother.\u2019 Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition<\/span>. 7 Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: 8 \u2018 These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me. 9 And in vain they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.\u201d<\/span> What a slap in the face. These people brought curses upon themselves and their children because traded what they needed to do to embrace traditions hence neglecting to teach their young people what was important, \u201chonor your father and mother\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason I believe, no young person can say they truly honor and serve God if they do not honor their parents. Parents should teach this commandment to their young people if they want God\u2019s blessings and favor on their children and reverse the threat and curses that are brought about when the 5th commandment is broken. This will bring about contentment, courage, courtesy, friendliness, generosity, honesty, humility, kindness, obedience, orderliness, thankfulness, wisdom etc.<\/p>\n<p>What commandments have we transgressed because of traditions therefore have exposed our young people to curses? If they have no fear and honor for you as their parents, how will they fear and honor God? Are you demonstrating the same to them by how they see you fear and honor your earthly parents and leaders? May we with God\u2019s help pass the mantle of love and honor to them.

While I\u2019m fine with children\u2019s church and youth ministry, I believe the greatest impact in your young people is made when they sit with you, watch you worship, watch you pray, watch you treat your spouse, watch you read, watch you work, why is this important? Because <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">young people learn more from your lifestyle than your words<\/span>. Young people want to know their parents are real and not perfect; they tend to want to imitate their parents. Parents ought to set the tone of a young person\u2019s spiritual life. How you live as a parent leads them to ask questions why you do what you do in order to learn. I also believe that by the presence of your young people, they will help you grow deeper and deeper in the things of God. Think of it this way, if you have an assignment to teach a class, would not that drive you to prepare by studying, doing research, learning a head of time? This is part of learning by teaching and being all God wants you to be before His children He has given you as talents to care for. It\u2019s the parents primary job to disciple their young people.<\/p>\n<p>To go back to Elisha and the sons of the prophets we ask, what primarily drew these young men to Elisha? First let\u2019s see how they came to know about Elisha, in 2Kings 2, God was about to take Elijah to heaven. Elijah was doing final missions visiting different places and each place you hear about the sons of the prophets. I would speculate that Elijah\u2019s journeys were to meet the sons of the prophets who he may have been a father figure to and bid them farewell. As the Lord sent him to each place, he tells Elisha to stay behind and each time Elisha says, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you<\/span>!\u201d God sent Elijah to Bethel, Jericho, and to Jordan. All these 3 places there were the sons of the prophets. Also to note about the sons of the prophets, it had been revealed to them that God would take away Elijah and they became concerned for Elisha for you hear them ask him this, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?\u201d  So he answered, \u201cYes, I know; keep silent!\u201d, <\/span><\/p>\n<p>At Jericho, 50 of the sons of the prophet followed them from a distance and they witnessed the miracle Elijah performed, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2kings 2:8, \u201cElijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground. \u201c. While they continued to walk that when Elijah asked Elisha what he would do for him before he was taken away.  Vs. 10, \u201c\u2026Elisha said, \u201cPlease let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.<\/span>\u201d You have to remember the sons of the prophets are taking notes, watching Elijah pass the mantle to his servant Elisha to continue Elijah\u2019s legacy.<\/p>\n<p>Then out of nowhere the chariots come and take Elijah away and you hear Elisha cry out. Though he was a servant and later a prophet, Elijah was a father to him too<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> vs. 12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried out, \u201cMy father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!\u201d So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces. 13 He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. 14 Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, \u201cWhere is the LORD God of Elijah?\u201d And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2Kings 2:15, \u201cNow when the sons of the prophets who <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">were<\/span> from Jericho saw him, they said, \u201c<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha<\/span>.\u201d And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him\u201d, amen, amen, amen.<\/span> They recognized that this was now their father figure and they treated him with respect, they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him; in reverence of him as their master, in the room of Elijah.<\/p>\n<p>The sons of the prophets saw his service to Elijah; they saw his faith in God, tenacity spirit in him. One man was faithful to God by serving His prophet and when God took His prophet away, this one man Elisha wanted to be an extension of what God had started in Elijah and the sons of the prophets recognized that. What do you want your young people to identify you with the most? I hope your faith.<\/p>\n<p>The bible says in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 20, 7\u201d The righteous man walks in his integrity; His children are blessed after him\u201d<\/span>, he sets the tone, his children pick up his mantle when they are of age and keep running with it. I recall more of what I saw in my dad than what he said. His faith in God, his prayer life, his worship style, his love for my mom, his sacrifice to the family set the tone in my life and the rest of his children. My mom\u2019s prayer, sacrifice, love, submission to dad, handling big family sometimes when dad was not home are things I witnessed. They shaped me. Again young people learn more from your lifestyle than your words.<\/p>\n<p>We say we need prayers in schools, are we praying at home to show our young people how important it is? We say the Ten Commandments should remain in schools, do we even know them ourselves and are teaching them to our young people?. We say leave \u201cunder God\u201d in our pledge of allegiance, but do we live as though we are under God, walking by faith?&#8230; What impacted the sons of the prophets\u2019 were Elisha\u2019s faith, reverence and honor for Elijah. The rest of his teachings, leadership, miracles lied on the foundation of his faith and choosing to take a harder task. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Joshua 24:15, \u201c\u2026 as for me and my house<\/span>, we will serve the LORD.\u201d To continue.

They have a mission to expand their dwelling place. They know it will take hard work and we see them to put to work what they are learning from their seasoned leader Elisha. That he was a man of great condescension and compassion; he went with the sons of the prophets to the woods, when they desired his company. Let no man, especially no minister, think himself too great to stoop to do good, but be tender to all. Good parents, leaders lead by example, many learn by observing.<\/p>\n<p>Vs. 5 &#8220;But as one was cutting down a tree, the iron ax head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, &#8220;Alas, master! For it was borrowed.&#8221;,  as the work continued, one of the sons of the prophets reported that the head of the ax he borrowed had fallen into the water only to be left with the handle. His cry was for different reason which shows maturity in his part I believe Elisha would have been proud of. 1. It grieved him to lose his ax, because he could do no more work and keep up with everyone, 2. It was a borrowed ax, his aim was to take good care of it and take it back to the owner, 3. There was no cover up in his part concerning the borrowed ax, 4. There was no shifting of blame to the owner by saying he did not make the ax head strong on the handle. 5. He was poor, and not able to pay for it, which, being of an honest disposition, gave him distress<\/p>\n<p>In teaching our young people hard work, we ought to teach them to be as careful of that which is borrowed as of that which is our own, that it receives no damage, because we must love our neighbor as ourselves and do as we would be done by.  This is about being responsible, entrusted with something valuable and also taking responsibility when things are not right. Today, people want to find someone or something to blame for all the wrong and we see that passed down to our young people. <\/p>\n<p>This also wasn&#8217;t just about losing another man&#8217;s property, it was also learning to honor the man whose property was borrowed. When we were growing up, we were taught at home and in school that elders were to be respected not only for what they have but who they are. Elders could send young people or tell them to do something, or tell them to stop doing something and you would not hear a young person say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do what you tell me because you are not my parent&#8221;, is that not common today? In our day we would do what an elder said as long as in our conscience we knew it was the right thing to do. Today, some parents defend their young people even when they know their young people are wrong, showing a young person that it&#8217;s ok to get away with wrong. Some are not taught to obey their elders. If it takes a family and the community to raise a child and I would expect the same respect the young people give their parents would be the same respect they would give their elders in the community, in schools, in work places etc.<\/p>\n<p>Who is going to dictate how we raise our young people? Society? In our lawless generation, it will take parents, leaders with God fearing values, having a history of how they were raised and if they value how they were raised, they would pass to their young people what they received. This will prepare them to be good husbands, good wives if they ever get married, teach them hard work, honor etc. We lay the foundation, we teach, we trust God for wisdom and grace to raise His young people. God holds us responsible how we raise them, ask Eli the priest and Samuel the prophet in the bible. Though they were great men, they did not pass what they learnt to their sons and God held them responsible. What will you do with the talents (young people) God has given you? Pass Down To Your Young People What Made You. Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2 Kings 6:4 So he went with them.

Elisha being a prophet of God had students he mentored echoing the mentorship he received from Elijah. Elisha was humble and hard worker from the beginning, he was in the family business and also known as the prophet that washed Elijah&#8217;s hands, cooked his meals and more. He followed Elijah everywhere as a humble servant even to the point where when Elijah is taken away, he requests for double portion of his spirit (anointing) upon him (2Kings 2:9), in other words a double portion of responsibilities by the working of God&#8217;s power in his life. He was going to continue Elijah&#8217;s legacy even to a greater dimension. We all ought, both ministers and people, to set before us the example of our predecessors, to labor after their spirit, and to be earnest with God for that grace which carried them through their work and enabled them to finish well. <\/p>\n<p>Now the sons of the prophet having seen the miracles and knowing God was with him chose to be under his leadership. It appears that the number grew and instead of sending others back home, they chose to build and expand their dwelling place.<\/p>\n<p>The sons of the prophets were very diligent, humble and hardworking as their master the prophet. They show discernment in vs. 1 when they said, &#8220;See now, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us&#8221;. We also see humility and submission on their part; they seek Elisha&#8217;s permission as their leader to act on a solution to their good problem, vs. 2. &#8220;Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell&#8221;. We then take note of their request for Elisha to go with them, vs. 3. 3 Then one said, &#8220;Please consent to go with your servants.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;I will go.&#8221; 4 So he went with them&#8221;. Good disciples desire to be always under good discipline. They don&#8217;t take for granted the office of a prophet leave alone abuse the powers. Instead of asking Elisha to call things into existence, they seek to go to work together, willing to take pains. <\/p>\n<p>Why is this passage important? It&#8217;s because we have a generation of young people not taught the reward of hard work. Things have been handed to them easily hence many have no idea what it means to enjoy the fruit of their labor, or even maintain what they are given. This quote appears frequently on the Internet and is often attributed to Dr. Adrian Rogers from 1984 in a larger series titled God&#8217;s Way to Health, Wealth and Wisdom. It also appears as a passage in Dr. Rogers&#8217; 1996 work Ten Secrets for a Successful Family complaining that &#8220;by and large our young people do not know either the importance or the value of honest labor, You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the industrious out of it. You don&#8217;t multiply wealth by dividing it. Government cannot give anything to anybody that it doesn&#8217;t first take from somebody else. Whenever somebody receives something without working for it, somebody else has to work for it without receiving. The worst thing that can happen to a nation is for half of the people to get the idea they don&#8217;t have to work because somebody else will work for them, and the other half to get the idea that it does no good to work because they don&#8217;t get to enjoy the fruits of their labor&#8221;. <\/p>\n<p>Parents, leaders have the responsibility to pass down to their children, students what they received. There are parents who say, &#8220;I will give my children the material things I never received&#8221;, sounds good but not until you ponder on how if you as a parent had everything you needed, you would have not worked hard. Sometimes the things we are trying to keep our young people away from are the things they need the most, it is what prepares them for life. One of the things I value today is the hard work teaching I received when I was young from both my parents and my grandmother.

Most don\u2019t want to be in the same place forever so they hunger for change, for growth, for move. In my own life, I want I don\u2019t want to see my life getting stagnant and I hope you are too. For whatever reason, we easily miss seeing things being manifested in our lives only to hear them mentioned by someone else. Perhaps the reason could be, we dwell so much on what we want to see and we miss what He wants us to see. He therefore uses someone else to point it out. Has anyone ever come to you and told you of something good in your life that you either did not know about it or did not see it? In the process of learning these things, you wonder how the Lord can show someone else something He is doing in your life without you knowing.<\/p>\n<p>2Kings 7 introduces us to four men, I love their story. I\u2019ve shared from this passage many times and will continue because of the richness of its message to us. Four men, leprous, outcast, no signs of hope for healing, living at the entrance of the gate. Weak, no relationships, no destiny, no dreams etc. What do you do or say when all that was going well all of a sudden get crumbled because of a new development. I believe that before they had leprosy, they had good families, dreams, desires, visions and the like but with the new development, what else to live for? Ever heard an experience that shook everything you believed in, stood for and desired to accomplish?<\/p>\n<p>Listen to their reasoning, vs. 3, &#8220;&#8230;and they said to one another, &#8220;Why are we sitting here until we die&#8221;. This is what I call the God given ability to reason to change location. I have been in some situations where I waited for the Lord to say a word and He did not, all He needed for me to do was initiate a move having been guided by His word and He would take over. When David faced  Goliath, it was his move and God honored it for His glory and so was Peter when he saw Jesus at a distance and desired to walk on water. He asked the Lord to command him to come to Him on water. To go back to these four lepers, they knew their condition but they understood that they were not condemned to die of starvation while there was a great famine in Samaria. Their move did not mean that everything was going to be well but it meant changing location, doing something different. If they stayed, they would die anyway, if they moved there was a possibility of either dying in the hands of the enemy after surrendering or being made slaves and get food.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 5, &#8220;And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians (enemy); and when they came to the outskirts of the Syrian camp, to their surprise no one was there. vs. 6, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">for the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and noise of horses, &#8230; the great army so they said to another, &#8220;Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings &#8230;. to attack us, vs.<\/span> 7, &#8220;Therefore they rose (Syrians) and fled at twilight&#8221;<\/span>, This is the core of the message today, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">The Lord magnified the sound of the feet of four weak, sick men that they sounded like a mighty army. When something is magnified, it does not change its size or looks<\/span>, it just allows the person looking at it to see it bigger than its usual size. Watch this, the four men&#8217;s condition did not change, when they chose to move, God allowed someone else to hear them coming as an army because He had magnified them.<\/p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m I saying, there are moves when you make, even when your condition does not change, God will still magnify you in the presence of other people. They will see something unique about you in your circumstance that you may not see and speak of it. The four men got to the camp and found no enemies but found good stuff. What they may have not realized was how God had magnified the sound of their feet. I am not a risk taker for sure, but I tend to initiate many things in line with God&#8217;s word and many times He has blessed them. Don&#8217;t wait till you&#8217;ve got it in place to move, it&#8217;s in the process of moving that He magnifies you for His glory. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James 4:10, \u201cHumble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up\u201d<\/span>  Blessings Ev.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Kings 7:1-20, &#8220;And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?&#8221; We all want to see things happening in our lives.

One could make a convincing case for that thought in what we call &#8220;the age of enlightenment,&#8221; when issues such as evolution and atheism have made these times unique in history. However, arguments come from the sinner&#8217;s intellect. The ungodly mind is like a brick wall. It has been built to keep God out. It is at enmity with Him. It refuses to bow to the Law of God&#8211;&#8220;Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be&#8221; (Romans 8:7). The human mind lays up arguments against God, so if you stay in that area you can expect a vicious battle. It is the mind that the Bible sites as the place of hostility&#8211;&#8220;And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has He reconciled&#8221; (Colossians 1:21, italics added). This wall of antagonism is hard and immovable, so make it a habit of going around it. Learn to speak directly to the conscience. This is good news. It means that we can be effective in our Christian witness without having to learn how to pronounce &#8220;Australopithecus afarensis&#8221; or define the fossil record, or know the age of the earth. When you address the conscience, these things become non-issues. It is that part of human nature that isn&#8217;t an enemy of God. The conscience is God&#8217;s ally. It doesn&#8217;t speak against the Law of God; it speaks for it. It is the work of the Law written on their heart. It &#8220;[bears] witness&#8221; (Romans 2:15). It testifies for God. It is the trustworthy witness who points out the guilty party in the courtroom. It&#8217;s mouth presents evidence of the Law&#8217;s transgression. It is because of what it does that we should make room for it to speak as quickly as we can. If we want to win our case we must bring out our star witness and put it on the stand to give it voice.<\/p>\n<p>We want to stop the mouth of the criminal, and that&#8217;s what the lawful use of the Law does (see Romans 3:19). It condemns the guilty and drives him to give up his defense, so that he will be forced to look solely to the judge for mercy. It is simply a matter of moving from the intellect to the conscience (amazing as it sounds, although many have heard much about Jesus, the Cross, sin, and salvation, most have never heard the true gospel). Our mandate is to preach the Gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15), and it is the Gospel that is the &#8220;power of God unto salvation&#8221; (Romans 1:16). Once the Law is manifest the usual rational arguments that so often cloud the issue become irrelevant.<\/p>\n<p>Kirk Cameron shared the teaching on the use of the Law one morning at a large church in Ohio. A few days later we received an email which shows the power of the Law to prepare the heart for the Gospel: &#8220;I just heard you speak this morning&#8230;I&#8217;m a Catholic&#8230;have been all my life&#8230;I can&#8217;t even begin to tell you how much your message affected me&#8230;I&#8217;ve been quite speechless all day long, which if you knew me, you&#8217;d know that I&#8217;m rarely quiet. It&#8217;s been a good quiet because I am so humbled all of a sudden. I want to &#8216;take the ball and run with it&#8217;, as you put it. However, I&#8217;m confused. You see, I&#8217;ve never been hit that hard in any Catholic service I&#8217;ve ever attended. How do you minister to Catholics? I can tell you that most of them don&#8217;t want to hear anything unless it&#8217;s from a priest. I could be wrong and hope that I am&#8230;but I&#8217;m full of questions on what to do next&#8230; Every one needs to hear what I heard this morning. I&#8217;m just so full of&#8230;..well, I don&#8217;t even know how to describe it. My life has been changed since this morning. I can&#8217;t thank you enough. This passage has been pulled from the book Revival&#8217;s Golden Key by Ray Comfort with Kirk Cameron, an excellent book on evangelism.<\/p>\n<p>We have come to appreciate the use of law in our witnessing, time and time again, we have sinner&#8217;s mouth get stopped from justifying themselves. Galatians 3:24, &#8220;Therefore the law was our school master to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith&#8221;. To put this into practice, you need the power of the Holy Ghost only brought about by being a prayerful person. You can know what to do and how to do it, but without the power, the valley of dry bones will remain dead and dry. When we pray, God takes His word we speak, opens the heart and the eyes of the hearer of the gospel, takes a way the heart of stone and gives them a heart of flesh. He gives them repentance and He gives them faith. Therefore, you cannot evangelize and not pray; and you cannot pray and not evangelize. They work hand in hand, they depend on each other.

Am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221;  And He said, &#8220;What have you done? The voice of your brother&#8217;s blood cries out to Me from the ground.\u201d  (Gen 4:10)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Do you have a brother or sister? The one thing that makes a brother or sister is having the same father or mother.  However, being a brother is different from being a brother\u2019s keeper.  To be a brother requires no effort because it\u2019s based on biology, but being a keeper speaks of a choice, care, responsibility, and a measure of ownership.  God placed Abel as a keeper of sheep, and Cain as a tiller (keeper) of the soil.  God gave both brothers the same opportunity of on the job training.  In the Garden prior to his son\u2019s responsibilities, Adam worked the ground and dealt with the animals.  Now his sons would share in that duty, outside the Garden of course because of Adam\u2019s sin.  Adam failed to be a keeper of Eve.  When the Serpent attacked her, he stood by and did nothing.  When God questioned Adam, he blamed Eve for his fall.  Now one of Adam\u2019s offspring would follow in Adam\u2019s footsteps by failing to be a keeper and worse off, because Cain would become his brother\u2019s killer.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that Cain priorities were misaligned.  Remember that God disrespected Cain\u2019s offering, but respected Abel\u2019s with pleasure.  If there is one thing men want is respect for their work.  However God wasn\u2019t creating a \u201cfeel good\u201d atmosphere, but demanding a do good one that results in the feel good because of obeying and pleasing God.  God is to be first (first commandment), and his Kingdom sought after first (Matt. 6:33).  If our priorities are misaligned with God\u2019s will, our lives are out of order.  If one was upset seeing a toilet out of order, how much more does God hate when our lives are out of order?  However when our priorities are in order we will love God and our neighbor by being our brother\u2019s keeper. Are you a brother\u2019s keeper or a brother\u2019s killer?<\/p>\n<p>Keepers bear one another\u2019s burdens (Gal. 6:2), killers fail to carry and pile on more burdens.  Keepers pray for one another (1 Thes. 5:24; James 5:16), killers gossip and complain about one another.  Keepers challenge, encourage, and inspire, while killers criticize, discourage, and exasperates others.  Keepers help, killers hinder.  Keepers forgive, killers hold grudges (Col. 3;13).  Keepers follow God\u2019s design for marriage and family; killers take their marching orders from the world for marriage and family.  Keepers love while killers hate.  Keepers encourage one\u2019s ideas; killers put a wet blanket on them and spew all the reasons why the idea \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cBy faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead (Heb 11:4).\u201d  I believe his blood cries out saying be a keeper not a killer.

Hannah and Peninnah are married to Elkanah. Peninnah had children while Hannah was barren. Peninnah took advantage of Hannah\u2019s barrenness and provoked her for Hannah was loved more than her yet she had been blessed with fruit of the womb. It was expected that the wife who had children especially boys would be loved and respected.<\/p>\n<p>God gives us diversified gifts and <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">when we talk about gifts, they are not things worked for or earned, but things bestowed to one. <\/span>Some have been blessed with looks, energy to do massive works, have the ability to love the unlovable, can teach, good listeners, good encouragers, wisdom to name a few. All these are gifts and not everyone around us them all. The gift I have may not be the gift you have but all these gifts tie and bring us together to glorify God. We ought to celebrate diversified gifts from the Lord. In this story, instead of each celebrating each other\u2019s gifts, Peninnah was provoking Hannah the wrong way, while Hannah is troubled by what she does not possess. In the midst of all these, God had grand opportunity to raise the un expected for His glory.<\/p>\n<p>You may be mad at Peninnah for doing such horrible things but I would pause and thank God for her. She may be a rough stone but she is significant. Your rivals put you in a better place to call on God even more. Hannah prayed more because she had a rival, She spent much time before God because of her rival. She maximized her faith, learnt how to pray effectively and learnt how to praise God more through her rival. When Joseph met his brothers after terrible things that happened in his life and finally God elevated him, he said, &#8220;you meant it for evil but God made it for good&#8221;. We know of how God remembered Hannah and blessed her with a prophet who anointed the first king of Israel and did great things. Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Peninnah did not provoke her? how about Leah who provoked Rachel day and night, she provoked her until God saw how she was being treated and opened her womb to bring forth Joseph. Have you wondered what would have happened if Joseph was not born, sold into Egypt and becomes the no. 2 man in Egypt and later saving the entire Israel?<\/p>\n<p>I thank God for my rivals who provoke me by their words and some by their actions. They have caused me to believe there is more that God wants to do, they have taught me more on faith, praying by faith, praying effectively and looking to God. Whatever they are doing is working for my good. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:28, &#8220;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them that are called according to His purpose&#8221;.<\/span> All things (good things, bad things), they all work together for our good but mark the last part of it, it only works for those who are called according to His purpose. Someone&#8217;s hate and anger could be your point of blessing. Someone&#8217;s backbiting could be the means God would raise you up for all they are doing is working for your good. It doesn&#8217;t just work for anyone but to those who are called. I believe that after the episode of Hannah, Rachel, and Joseph, they must have thought,\u201d we are glad we had revivals, yes it was painful but we have grown, God turned things around for His glory\u201d. Psalm 119:71, &#8220;It&#8217;s good for me to have been afflicted, that I might learn your statutes&#8221;, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 34:19, &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord shall deliver him out of them all<\/span>. You might not like your rivals but guess what, they are your best friends for they will shape you into the image of Christ and what a blessing to know that someone pushed you to the next level with all their hate and anger. They actually made away for you to be used of God, helped you produce greater things the Lord always wanted to do in your life. If anything, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">your rival only awakened you to a greater destiny, take the hint!!<\/span> Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Samuel 1:7, &#8220;So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, that she (Peninnah) provoked her&#8221; To understand Samuel\u2019s story, you have to go back to how it all started.

The bible says that \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">His mercies are new every morning<\/span>\u201d. He does not give us yesterday&#8217;s mercies. He knows what we need today and that&#8217;s why He tells us not to worry about tomorrow in Matt 6. If He can be trusted to take care of us today, He can be trusted to take care of us tomorrow. He is our source and our provider, all He desires is that we stay connected.<\/p>\n<p>Let me use computers as an example in putting this message together. If you bought a computer, it will not function effectively until some software programs are loaded in it. It\u2019s not designed to work without software programs. Each software, starting with Windows, to Microsoft office and other vital software come in handy when what you are doing will need such kind of software to do your work effectively. Without proper software, you cannot accomplish much even if you are skilled and knew your way around. For database, Access will be loaded; for Math and spreadsheet, Excel will come in handy; for letter writing and spell check, Word will be needed and so on and so forth. God does the same with us daily, He looks knows what kind of software  we need for each day and He loads us with them to function effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Note how the verse above begins, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Blessed be the Lord our God<\/span>\u201d, which actually means that He is a blessed God who has every kind of software (blessings, good things) we could ever need for this day and always. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 103:2, \u201cBless the Lord of my soul and forget not His benefits<\/span>\u201d. A number of Christians do not know that God has benefits He wants to bestow upon His children and so they don&#8217;t believe asking God for them will work. They believe salvation is the end, Psalm 103 tells us salvation comes with benefits package. When you apply for a job, you care to know if there are benefits that come with the job package. So even with us Christians, there are benefits that come with salvation; all we need to do is know what they are. We don\u2019t get saved for benefits but while we are serving Him He loads us, lavish us with them. As you read Psalms 103:3 and verses that follows, you see that forgiveness, healing, redemption from destruction, crowned with loving kindness, tender mercies, mouths satisfied with good things, renewal of our youths, execution of righteousness etc are some of the benefits (software programs) we need to function effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t you ever forget that the Lord daily loads us with benefits. If you need the software for peace today, He will load you with it. Software for grace, healing, comfort, encouragement, understanding, love, joy, favor, desires, money, whatever it is, He will load you with them as His child. Therefore reboot your computer, get in tune with Him. He will take out the corrupted files; delete temp files (baggage) that slow you down. He will check for viruses (fear, doubt, anger, frustrations etc) that cripple you and hinder the software (good things from Him) from working effectively in your life. And let Him begin the process of loading you with His benefits. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 46:10, Be still and know that I am God, Psalm 23:1, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, Psalm 23:6, surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, Psalm 37:23, the good steps of a righteous man are ordered by the Lord. Load me Lord today and always.

There are times when spiritually we blossom and there are times when we are dry. There are times when everything we touch turns to gold and there are times when nothing is going right. I don&#8217;t know of anyone who has been in one season forever. The good thing about going through different seasons, you learn to survive and adapt with much or with little.

The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working]&#8221; (Amplified)<\/span><br style=\"font-weight:bold;\" \/><br \/>One of the things that hinder our prayers from reaching our heavenly Father is un forgiveness. Either we&#8217;ve not confessed our sins to the Father that He may forgive us or we have not forgiven someone else who has wronged us or both. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">It&#8217;s not that the prayers reach the Father and then He doesn&#8217;t act on it, No, it\u2019s because un forgiveness blocks the prayers from reaching the Father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible to be offended, Jesus said in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Luke 17:1, &#8220;It is impossible that no offenses should come&#8221; (NKV)&#8221;<\/span>, we are human, we are prone to mistakes and offenses. With that in mind, I hope that I will not offend or be offended but know in the back of my mind it is possible and may happen. The question is, how do I deal with it when it comes. In my own life, I have placed my confidence in no man because I know men can fail. It&#8217;s now easier for me to forgive, after all, God in Christ Jesus has forgiven me for wronging Him over and over again. Why should I have something against my brother? Why would I want to hinder my prayers from reaching the Father, because of un-forgiveness? My flesh would want to give them a dose of their own medicine, revenge, make them feel the way I have felt, get even. The only thing un-forgiveness does for me is rob me of freedom I need. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">When offended and cannot forgive, the un-forgiveness steals such a great strength out of you and leaves you powerless. This means the un-forgiveness has controlling power over you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>James says, confess it, deal with your un-forgiveness then take it a step further pray for the one you have forgiven. Now this is hard but I believe the key release to your blessings depends on whether you can release and pray for the one you are releasing. Didn&#8217;t Jesus forgive us and sits right now at the right hand of God the Father praying for us? This is the process of healing, the more you pray for them, the more the power of un forgiveness releases you. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working]<\/span>&#8220;. If un-forgiveness has stolen your power, how else can you pray with power? Joseph was put to a test where he needed to forgive his bothers. It was not easy if you read Genesis but he did, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;\">the power of forgiveness was in his hand.<\/span> He took the offense and looked at it differently saying, &#8220;though you meant it for evil, God turned something good out of it&#8221; (paraphrased). <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:28, &#8220;And we know that ALL (not some) things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose&#8221;<\/span>. In the light of His word, I can get illuminations in understanding that everything that happens in my life, good or bad works for my good because I love Him. If I&#8217;m offended, it works for my good only if I look and deal with it the way the Lord would have me. It can push me forward or backwards depending on my attitude. If I forgive, how easy my simple prayer to God can be powerful and avail much. The message today is simple, the power of forgiveness in in your hands, let it lock or release you according to the way you use it.

However, it is necessary and correct delivery, and reception of it is desirable. Typically, there are three ways to face confrontation: respond, react or avoid it. In most cases, the most preferred choice of many is avoidance. That is, not willing to face up to confrontation. This is because confrontation, of any kind, is most likely to touch on something in us or about us that we fear to face or talk about because a weakness, fault, mistake, negligence, sin, etc. in us may be exposed and\/or discussed, with a view to correct, instruct, rebuke, admonish or punish us.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever been confronted? Your friend or spouse or boss or parents or co-worker or an elder or any authority or somebody you don\u2019t even know says to you \u201cyou blew it!\u201d How do you feel when confronted? Embarrassed, perhaps? Defensive? Guilty? Surprised? Angry, at yourself and\/or at the person who confronts you?<\/p>\n<p>Why do we typically react negatively instead of responding positively to confrontation? There could be many reasons, but here are four possible reasons: First, none of us enjoys having his weaknesses or shortcomings exposed or put under spotlight. Salt added to the wound of ego or pride, ignorance or foolishness hurts. And we hate anything that hurts. Second, sometimes confrontation is painful because the spirit of the other person is haughty and insensitive. Their approach may hurt or their words may pierce through our hearts like a dagger or spear. In such cases, we tend to react by staging, sometimes, a head-to-head and nose-to-nose exchange, and that can be explosive and hurt badly. Third, sometimes the person does not have his facts straight, and his accusation may be unfair, unrealistic, malicious, or presumptuous. And forth, sometimes we think that the problem or issue is solely our own and we are not willing to open up to the possibility that we can be wrong and need correction.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what the reason may be for confrontation, we need to respond positively and not defensively. Worse, we should not avoid confrontation all together. That is the godly way. Many a times we may be wrong or mislead or confused and may need confrontation from someone who can shed some light, give advice or correct us. The Bible encourages believers to admonish and to receive admonition. Simply put, it encourages believers to confront one another, in love, speaking the truth with a view to correct, advise, warn, instruct or counsel. The word \u2018<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">admonish<\/span>\u2019 carries the meaning of <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201csetting the mind or heart right<\/span>\u201d-to redirect a person toward a correct behavior, attitude, action or approach to a problem or situation.<\/p>\n<p>Paul, writing to the Christians in Thessalonica, urged them to receive \u2018admonition\u2019 from those elders who were laboring among them:<br \/><br style=\"font-weight:bold;\" \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c\u2026And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and ADMONISH you: And to esteem them very highly in love for their work\u2019s sake. And be at peace among yourselves. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them who are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. Rejoice evermore\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:12-16).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So confrontation is appropriate and should be encouraged, given and accepted within the body of believers. Next time you are confronted or confronting, don\u2019t be negative and selfish. You may miss the will of God and your opportunity to bless or to be blessed. Meditate on these for liberation and progression in faith. Blessings, Boaz<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Confrontation is not desirable.

In my case I would have thought, a prophet has spoken, it&#8217;s a message from God, this is it, let me pack my bags and wait for my time to go but for him he wasn&#8217;t ready to go easily, he still needed a bigger hand in his situation. A hand that was able to reverse the sentence. It wasn&#8217;t a hand that &#8220;would&#8221; but a hand that was &#8220;able&#8221;, big difference. &#8220;Would&#8221; means you know the definitely what He will do, &#8220;Able&#8221; means, you know He can and the outcome is in His hands.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Matthew 7:7, \u201cAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent? <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!\u201d,<\/span><\/span><br \/><br style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\" \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">When we cry out to God, heaven goes in motion while hell goes in chaos<\/span>. It\u2019s like a telegram sent to the throne room of God, and God goes to work with His angels because He has promised to fulfill His word. Prayer changes how heaven responds, it moves things on top of the list of the agendas. Hezekiah&#8217;s prayer was like a telegram so was Daniel&#8217;s prayer and an answer was released immediately because Prayer changes things. Do you believe that your prayers to God could change a situation? Do you call on Him first as a priority or call on Him as the last option? To add the most important part in all this, prayer does more than change things, prayer changes us.

Then we will be prepared for whatever the day brings. I&#8217;m talking about rest this morning, a struggle to many including myself. There is no one who understands rest like God and we see this being recorded in the book of <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 2:1-3, &#8220;Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">He rested on the seventh day<\/span> &#8230; , <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Then God blessed the seventh day and satisfied if, because in it He rested<\/span>&#8230;&#8221; <\/span>Rest is very important in one&#8217;s life and should never be taken lightly.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the most godly thing we can do for ourselves is go to sleep. Forget about what happened today and what you could have done better, take a break from what you dealt with today and shut everything out and get yourself in a position of rest. Think of this, applying emergency brakes to a fast moving car will bring the wheels to rest but the car body will still be in motion, that is enough to cause a car flip. I would say that applying the brakes gradually will not only bring the wheels at rest but also the body at the same time. Worrying about what hasn&#8217;t happened or what could happen will rob you of peace and rest you desperately need. The mind needs rest, so is the body and the heart too. Troubled water never settles because of troubling winds but we thank God, He is the quiet still water soothing our souls to sleep.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus comes in later and reminds His people what rest is all about, rest from the burdens of sins.. We know that there can be no true rest outside Christ and the reason is simple, if you are going to rest, you going to have to give up on what is stopping you from resting. In this case, Jesus has offered to take off our hands what we are holding on to that in turn we might have the true rest in Him. He says, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Come to Me<\/span>&#8221; which is an action word meaning move from where you are to where He is, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">All you who labor (weary) and are heavy laden (burdened)<\/span>&#8221; this is the reason why you and I need to move, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And I will give you rest<\/span>&#8221; then end result if we do what He ask of us. The main reason for this rest is rest from the burden of sin but has also benefits to the rest in our bodies. If you\u2019ve received rest from your burden of sin, ask for rest for your weary body.<\/p>\n<p>I do believe that you could rest even when working for you are not dealing with things by yourself. Mathew 11:29, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me<\/span>&#8220;, Though the text has a unique meaning, I could take a principle and apply it in this was, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">take my advice, allow me to help you, let me give you directions and strategies and learn all these things I am teaching you<\/span>&#8220;. The bible says that, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The joy of the Lord is my strength&#8221; Nehemiah 8:10<\/span>, and His strength will sustain you, you have a chance to come to Him for rest and energy again. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">For I am gentle, and lowly (humble) of heart, and you will find rest for your souls<\/span>&#8220;. I love the way He says it, you could rest your body and not rest your mind but the Lord is giving the total package, He will not scream at you and He will not even put you down all He wants to do is give you the rest you need. Hide you under the shadow of His wings like a chicken that covers her chicks. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mathew 11:30, &#8220;For My yoke is easy and My burden is light<\/span>&#8220;. The yoke put on the oxen is used to keep them focused, moving in the same direction but with a purpose and it&#8217;s heavy. The Lord is saying, I will take the yoke you are used to and I will give you mine which is easy, I will guide you, I will be on your side and the burden I have for you is very light cause I am carrying yours which is heavy. Who can resist such an offer?<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the words of the carpenter, promising rest, is so compelling because of our endless desire and quest to rest. Do you want rest? Do you know where to find rest? The Father rested and sanctified it, the Son called and offered it, will you choose to receive it? If you want to bring under control a fast paced life style, you must eliminate the unnecessary and concentrate on the necessary by wanting to be where God wants you to be. My soul is at rest, my mind is renewed, there is no greater joy than Him being present.

He told him &#8220;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat; but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.&#8221; We all know that Peter denied the Lord three times that very night. In verse 34, we read that Jesus told Peter, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I say to you, Peter, the cock will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.<\/span>&#8221; Does God allow failure? Does He permit it? Is there a purpose in failure? Or is failure something that has no purpose at all in God&#8217;s perfect will and something that God cannot use to further his purposes!<\/p>\n<p>When we read this passage, we see that God did not prevent Peter from denying Him. Why didn&#8217;t Jesus say &#8220;Simon I have prayed for you that you will not deny Me even once.&#8221; Why did the Lord pray only that Peter&#8217;s faith may not fail, even if Peter himself fell?? Isn&#8217;t it interesting that the Lord did not pray that Peter might not fall? Some of us would like the Lord to pray for us that we might never fall. We would like the Lord to say to us &#8220;My son, my daughter, I have prayed for you that you will never fall and never fail.&#8221; But interestingly enough, our Lord doesn&#8217;t pray such a prayer for us. What did Jesus pray for Simon? That when Satan tempted him, his faith would not fail. He didn&#8217;t pray that Peter should not fall in temptation, but that when he did fall, his faith in God&#8217;s perfect love would not fail him &#8211; so that even when Peter reached the bottom of the pit of failure, he would confess, &#8220;God still loves me&#8221;. That is faith &#8211; and that is the confession we must always have on our lips and in our hearts &#8211; no matter how low we may have sunk or fallen &#8211; that God still loves us, JUST AS WE ARE. That was the confession of the prodigal son. When he had reached so low that he could not go any lower, he still believed that his father loved him. I can&#8217;t imagine anyone reaching any lower than the prodigal son had reached &#8211; eating what the pigs ate. That boy was at rock-bottom. But when he reached rock-bottom, he remembered one thing: That his father still loved him. Otherwise he would never have returned home.  Supposing he&#8217;d heard that his father had died and that his elder brother was now running the house, do you think he would have come back home? No. He knew what his elder brother was like. And knowing that, he would never have come back.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s hope for all who&#8217;ve failed thoroughly, who&#8217;ve made a mess of their lives, and who&#8217;ve reached rock bottom. From there the Lord can pick you up and take you to the heights of glory. His prayer for us is that our faith in God&#8217;s love should not fail at any time. When you hit rock bottom, remember one thing that God still loves you, no matter where you are, or how low you have fallen. May your faith in God&#8217;s love not fail in that hour.<\/p>\n<p>It was with a purpose that God allowed Peter to fail. That purpose was to sift Peter. What Satan really wanted was to destroy Peter altogether, but God would not allow him to do that. God does not allow us to be tested or tried beyond our ability. So Satan was allowed to sift Peter. As a result of his failure, Peter was cleansed of a whole lot of chaff in his life.  That is the real purpose with which God allows us to fail too. Isn&#8217;t it a good thing for the chaff to be removed from our lives? Certainly. When a farmer harvests the wheat, he has to sift it before he can use it. Only then will the chaff be removed from it.<\/p>\n<p>The Lord uses Satan to remove the chaff from our lives. Amazingly enough, God accomplishes this purpose by allowing us to fail repeatedly!! God used Satan to fulfill that purpose in Peter and He will use Satan to fulfill that purpose in our lives too. There&#8217;s a lot of chaff in all of us &#8211; the chaff of pride, self-confidence and self-righteousness. And God uses Satan to make us fail repeatedly, in order to remove that chaff from us completely. Whether the Lord is succeeding in fulfilling this purpose in your life or not, you alone know. But if the chaff is being removed, you will be humbler and less self-righteous. You won&#8217;t look down on others who fail. You won&#8217;t consider yourself better than anyone else. As I said, God permits Satan to remove the chaff from us, by allowing us to fail repeatedly. So don&#8217;t get discouraged if you fail. You are still in God&#8217;s hand. There is a glorious purpose that&#8217;s being fulfilled through your repeated failures. But your faith in God&#8217;s love for you must not fail at such times.<\/p>\n<p>That was what Jesus prayed for Peter and what He&#8217;s praying for us today. He&#8217;s not praying that we may never fail, but He&#8217;s praying that when we do reach rock-bottom, our confidence in God&#8217;s love will still be unshaken. Only through many experiences of failure do we finally reach a &#8220;zero point&#8221;, where we&#8217;re truly broken. It was when Peter reached that point, that he had a second &#8220;conversion&#8221; (Lk.22:32 &#8211; KJV). He turned around. The proof that Jesus&#8217; prayer for Peter was answered is seen in the fact that when Peter hit rock-bottom, he turned around. He didn&#8217;t just lie down there discouraged. He didn&#8217;t lose his faith. He got up. God had let him go on a long leash. But when Peter reached the end of that rope, God pulled him back. It&#8217;s a wonderful thing to be a child of God. When God lays hold of us, He puts a rope around us to protect us. There&#8217;s a lot of slack in that rope, and you may slip up and fall many thousands of times and even drift away from the Lord. But one day, you&#8217;ll reach the end of that rope. And then God will pull you right back to Him. Of course, you can decide at that point, to cut off the rope and run away. Or you can choose to be broken by God&#8217;s kindness and mourn and return to Him. That&#8217;s what Peter did. He wept and turned back to the Lord. But Judas Iscariot didn&#8217;t do that. He cut away the rope &#8211; in rebellion against God&#8217;s authority over his life &#8211; and was eternally lost. But I trust you&#8217;ll do what Peter did. Jesus then told Peter, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">When you turn back and are strong once again, strengthen your brothers <\/span>&#8220;. It is only when we are broken that we can be strong enough to strengthen others. It was only when Peter was weak and broken, that he became really strong &#8211; so strong that he was able to strengthen his brothers and sisters. We could say that Peter&#8217;s preparation for Spirit-filled service came through his experience of failure. If he had been filled with the Holy Spirit, without this experience of failure, he would have stood up on the day of Pentecost as a proud man, as a man who had never failed, who could look down despisingly at the poor lost sinners in front of him. And God would have become his enemy, for God resists the proud!!

Holiness is the very essence and nature of God. It is the description of who He is. Time and time again, both in the Old and New Testaments, God is proclaimed as holy, both by men and angels, all of His creation declares His holiness. Here, God speaks through the anointed word of Peter, declaring a truth that is as pertinent in the New testament as it was in the Old Testament, we are to be holy, for He is holy. This is what God demands of His people. This is not an option, just as sin is not an option. We are to forsake sin, and to be holy, partakers of the very divine nature of God.<\/p>\n<p>It is my opinion that holiness is the most ignored teaching in scripture. What was once the common condition of a Christian has now been relegated to nothing more than a passing thought. But look deeper now. Who does Jesus say will see God? The pure in heart ( Matthew 5:8). What does Hebrews tell us, that without holiness, no one shall see the Lord ( Hebrews 12:14). What has become an afterthought in modern \u201cChristendom\u201d has always been the central focus of Christianity, a pure and holy heart. Think of it. Would an earthly king be made to dwell in the midst of filthiness, not at all. They are secured the finest of everything, comforts of life we can\u2019t even imagine. Yet we expect the King of Glory to come and live within a filthy heart, filled with idolatry, pride, anger, and all other sorts. <\/p>\n<p>God sent His Son to make us holy, to cleanse us of our inner corruption, that He may reign within us in glorious beauty and splendor. Does He deserve any less? So the question is, am I holy as He is holy? Or am I in love with the world, am I to fascinated with sport and entertainment, the devil\u2019s best friends, to even give God the time of day? Is my heart truly the holy habitation of God? Does my heart belong fully to Him? Is Jesus the central focus of my life, the center of my affections, or do I give Him fifteen minutes a few times a week? When you fell in love with your spouse, remember how much time you spent with them. You couldn\u2019t wait to see them each day. Do you feel that way about Jesus? God is a jealous God, He desires all of us, and He desires holiness. Seek for Him until you find Him friends, till He fills every part of your life.<\/p>\n<p>That our hearts may be stirred, Blessings Brother Ben<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,I Peter 1:16- Because it is written, \u201cBe ye holy, for I am holy.\u201d Good morning.

Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses (Proverbs 27:5-6)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Have you ever been in a situation where someone you know has sinned and you felt you needed to confront them on it?  Perhaps right now you are thinking not me, I\u2019m no better than they are, I sin too, and I don\u2019t want someone confronting me, that won\u2019t help matters.  The area of accountability, confrontation, confession, and church discipline is an area that is very weak in today\u2019s church.  Why, perhaps because we live in such a rebellious society nowadays.  A rebellious son refusing to mend his ways in the OT was stoned to death.  God wants holy people, and holy people cannot live like the world who feels that ultimately they will answer to know one.  Remember at the Last Supper Jesus secretly confronted Judas with His statement about dipping bread, but Judas\u2019 return was as an enemy (in the Garden of Gethsemane) that gave kisses, the kiss of selfishness and death.  <\/p>\n<p>Look at the following two accounts of confrontation in the Scriptures. <\/p>\n<p>In John 4 we see how Jesus confronts a non-believer over their sin. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">John 4:16, \u201cHe told her, &#8220;Go, call your husband and come back.&#8221;  17, &#8220;I have no husband,&#8221; she replied.  Jesus said to her, &#8220;You are right when you say you have no husband. 18The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.&#8221;<\/span>  Jesus used God\u2019s law (the 7th commandment) in his confrontation to bring conviction.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus confronted her sin, by asking her to call her husband.  After her confession, Jesus pressed the issue of her sin further.  Now before anyone can say that it\u2019s God\u2019s job to confront sin, what do we do with this passage <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">from 2 Samuel 12:1-7? \u201cThe LORD sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, &#8220;There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor. The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him. &#8220;Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.&#8221;  David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, &#8220;As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die! He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.&#8221; Then Nathan said to David, &#8220;You are the man!&#8230;\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sinners and Saints are both confronted.  God desires sinners to be confronted over their  sin to be convicted and be converted to Christ, and for saints to be confronted and convicted over their sin because they are converted and represent God Himself who is sinless.  Now pray for wisdom in both instances, but when the Lord directs you, obey quickly, if not that person may ruin their lives, or die in their sin.  Remember \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The wages of sin is death<\/span>.\u201d   <\/p>\n<p>The Scriptures give us a model of how to confront someone. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201cIf your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that `every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.&#8217; If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector<\/span> (Matt. 18:15-17).  Our job is to confront, the Holy Spirit\u2019s job is to convict.<\/p>\n<p>Application:  Is there someone that comes to mind to confront.  Pray for wisdom, but obey the Lord, you may save their life.  But do so in a spirit of humility seeking to win them over, not to hang manipulation over their head.

And they said one to another, \u2018Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures (Luke 24:31 \u2013 32)?\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>What makes you burn inside and really come alive?  What is that sporting event that you shout for your team?  I can reference all the Yankee fans here in NYC that screams when the Yankees play and beat their rivals the Boston Red Sox.  Would you come alive if you got that raise at work, or as lawyer won that case or perhaps you were a salesperson and made a big sale?  Hiking, swimming, hobbies, computers, dating someone, etc\u2026 are some various things that bring life to people.  Perhaps the thing that make you burn with enthusiasm and life was not on the list, but you know what that thing is that makes your heart race.  In this passage the thing that made hearts burn, and really come alive was the words that Jesus spoke.   <\/p>\n<p>This is the passage of Scripture occurs between the resurrection and the ascension, in the 40-day span of time that Jesus has been raised from the dead, but not yet ascended to the right hand of the Father.  The women go to visit the tomb that Jesus had been placed in and they find it vacant.  They run and tell the disciples and Peter\u2019s feet couldn\u2019t move fast enough to get to the tomb and discover the truth of the women\u2019s news.  And they made their way back to where the rest of the disciples were reminiscing along the way as to their hearts burning while Jesus talked with them by the way (on the road) and when He opened the Scriptures to them.  These had a zeal for the very words of Christ.  I asked what makes you come alive; now let me ask you, do the Scriptures make you come alive?  Is there a burn in your heart as God speaks to you through them, as you discover something new in that passage you\u2019ve read many times before, and if not why not?  The early Christians are not really so different from us.  At one time it was tax collecting for Matthew, bringing in the big catch for the fisherman, and healing that last patient for Luke, that made these men burn with life.  But now, I believe that those temporal things were superseded by the life of God\u2019s word, as their hearts burned at one time for the temporal, now they burned for the spiritual.  Jesus said, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work<\/span>,\u201d Because it was Jesus\u2019 sustenance.   Where is God\u2019s will found, but in His word.  Christian, where is your burning heart for God\u2019s Word?  If reading these devotions, and Sunday morning church, or mid-week Bible study is all your time in God\u2019s word, then it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re not reading for yourself, only being spoon fed by others.  I believe it was Charles Spurgeon who said, \u201cSome of you have so much dust on your Bible that you could write the word damnation with your finger.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Think about it, the hearts of the disciples burned for His word so much that we have four gospels to tell of the things they had seen and heard as reliable eyewitnesses of Jesus.  <\/p>\n<p>Why is there testimony not the testimony of believers today?  I too get excited about some temporal things, but it does not compare with my excitement over spiritual things.  Think of Jeremiah who said \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones<\/span>, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay<\/span>.\u201d  He tried to keep from preaching God\u2019s word but like trying to throw gasoline on a forest fire, the flames in his heart blazed out and he had to preach what was in him, because he couldn\u2019t put a lid on it!  God was the consuming fire with Moses on Mt. Sinai, \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">For <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">our God is a consuming fire<\/span> and a jealous God Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear<\/span>&#8220;<\/span> (see Duet 4:24, Heb 12:28-29).\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application<\/span>:  Are you consumed?  Does your heart burn like Jeremiah, like the early church?  Is your Bible your daily bread that you are enthused about?

Joseph is a good example, he had a dream at the age of 17 and his dream was not that one day he would fail but that one day he will be great and that his family and many people would bow to him. Talk to any teenagers today and hear all their dreams and desires of success. You must have had dreams at that age too. Joseph has a good dream but he is naive, boastful and insensitive towards his brothers. There is a lot of character to build before he comes to his dream. He does not even have an idea if it will come to pass.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 39:1, &#8220;Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an office of Pharaoh&#8230; brought him from Ishmaelites who had taken him down there<\/span>&#8220;. He is brought to Egypt as a slave, bowing to someone else. What happened to the dream to which people were bowing to him? It&#8217;s not surprising that some people become careless when things are not going as they planned and expected. They begin to misuse what they have, they treat the position they have casually, doing a poor job because that is not where they wanted to land. Sitting down being lazy, what did Joseph do?, he wasn&#8217;t where he desired to be but yet he was still faithful, hardworking, honest, efficient, effective, responsible and initiative in all he did. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 2, &#8220;The Lord was with Joseph, and he was successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian<\/span>&#8220;. I would expect that if the Lord was with him, he had a chance to complain, murmur, have bitterness and anger towards the Lord. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">He had every opportunity to complain yet he chose to channel those opportunities to enlarge his character by serving faithfully<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Philippians 2:14, &#8220;Do all things without complaining and disputing<\/span>&#8220;. It&#8217;s like Joseph saying, &#8220;I am not where I desire to be and I don&#8217;t know whether I will get there or not, one thing I know, I have responsibilities to my master and I will do it faithfully, do well and make my master proud&#8221;.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> I don&#8217;t believe the Lord told him what to do, he just saw an opportunity to serve and the Lord blessed him for being initiative<\/span>. Later he was made overseer of the entire house of Potiphar, things were beginning to better, he was good at what he is doing and the Lord was really blessing the house. And then he loses his position because Potiphar&#8217;s wife wanted him to sleep with her. Once beaten and thrown in prison, someone would think he would stop being the man of character, but even in prison, he served, he was initiative and responsible. This allowed him to have favor with the keeper of prison and once again he was made in charge.<\/p>\n<p>Joseph allowed people to see the Lord in him by working hard, being responsible and being a man who was initiative. Whatever he did, the Lord made it prosper and so is with us today. You may not be where you want to be in career, relationship, job wise, position but you can still be all you can for God right where you are. Don&#8217;t sit and wait for the Lord to bring you to your destiny when He has allowed you to be in a place that will tailor you to your destiny. Initiative is <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">doing good things without being told, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">do the best you can with all you have and the Lord will bless and prosper you in all you do<\/span><\/span>.

Song of Songs 8:6<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The lover speaks passionately of her desire toward the one whom she is deeply committed to.  The lover desires to be set as a seal which would have shown sole possession.  An engraved stone or metal seal was a mark of ownership in the ancient world. Possession of another&#8217;s seal indicated mutual access and possession. The lover desired to be as a seal on his arm for all to see, and on his heart as the most intimate place in his life.    She desired to be distinctly his, for no one else.   Exclusivity was her chief desire toward him, as is recited in wedding vows, \u201cforsaking all others, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, in good times and hard times, till death separates\u201d. She yearns for their mutual possession of each other to be as lasting as life itself.<\/p>\n<p>How can love be as strong as death?  Love is about living, togetherness, partnership, joy, friendship, while death is about dying, aloneness, loss of friendship, pain, grief, and sadness.  There is a strong gut level heart pounding emotion when it comes to both love and death.  I can remember crying tears of sadness at the death of loved ones, while tears of joy on the day my wife and I became one flesh in Holy matrimony.  Even the physiology of our makeup shows the power of love and death.  Tears of sadness have one substance which is present at the loss of love, while tears of joy during the passion of loving and being loved have another substance which is present even though they are both tears and are both wet.  <\/p>\n<p>Many have killed for love.  I think of the classic play Romeo and Juliet where love was as strong as death.  Romeo upon being convinced that his love Juliet was dead, killed himself for he could not bear to live without her. The most glorious display of love being as strong as death is displayed perfectly at the crucifixion, where God\u2019s love was expressed in death.  \u201cBut God <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">commends His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\u201d  Ephesian 5:25, \u201cHusbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.<\/span>  Christ\u2019s love for His bride (the church) caused him to jump in front of a bullet for her.   1 Cor 15:22 \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.<\/span><br style=\"font-weight:bold;\" \/><br \/>Proverbs 6:34-35 refers to the rage of a man because of jealousy rising up within him upon discovering the man who committed adultery with his wife, \u201c\u2026when he takes revenge. He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse the bribe, however great it is.  The revenge he desires will most likely be the other man\u2019s death.  The emotion of his love toward his wife after this, though she be alive he feels the deep sting of death struck to his heart. <\/p>\n<p>Even though it was \u201cour decision\u201d in the Garden to \u201ccheat\u201d on God with another, He hates the devil for his deception upon humanity because the devil corrupted our purity and left the stain of sin through \u201cspiritual adultery.\u201d  Because God was jealous for our hearts to be pure again with the stain of sin removed He sent the only cleaning agent to do the job, Himself, His Son Jesus. Duet. 6:24 read \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God<\/span>.  \u201c\u2026jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.\u201d It would be better to die than to experience the failure of love that produces jealousy. Love&#8217;s demands are all consuming.  SS 8:7 says \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away<\/span>.\u201d  External forces cannot quench or drown it. Its value is greater than all the possessions one might ever possess. <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application<\/span>:  Do you love your wife, your children, your friends, the body of Christ and your God that way?  Make sure to keep the most important relationships alive and vibrant.  For when death separates you from them only your love for them will remain.  Pray for them and spend time with them.  If they are unsaved share your heart with them of the truth that you desire to see them with you in glory (heaven).

Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, vs. 36 As it is written &#8220;For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We concluded our devotion with this thought, &#8220;Persuasion is not for hurried people but people who want to know more and live connected regardless\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Two things to bring to us from Romans 8 concerning the question asked by Paul about who shall separate us, the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">natural<\/span> and the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">supernatural<\/span>. Looking at verse 35&amp;36, you can see that he is referring to the natural (tribulation, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, and sword) and then he concludes it by saying that for His sake we are killed all day long. I would take this to mean, in the process of dying to self and crucifying the flesh, we face these things that have separated many from His love but we are compelled to love Him because He loved us first. We know that <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">His love is better than life<\/span> and in turn we are telling Him that our love for Him is better than whatever thing we go through therefore we would rather suffer and die to these things than loose our love for Him.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:37, &#8220;Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us&#8221;<\/span>. We need to understand that even though we have made a choice to love Him in spite of, these things we are dealing with will still be painful but we are reminded that we are more than conquerors. Being more than a conqueror is conquering what God has already conquered. He has conquered for us because He loves us and we have refused to be separated because we love Him. With this understanding, Paul goes far ahead to say, the natural will not separate him and so is the supernatural. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:35&amp;36, &#8220;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, vs. 36 As it is written &#8220;For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter<\/span>&#8221; These two verses addresses what we face in the natural, then the next verse addresses what we face in the supernatural, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:38, &#8220;For <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I am persuaded<\/span> that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come vs. 39, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord<\/span>&#8221; yet in all these we are more than conqueror both in the natural and the supernatural because of Him.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at it closely, I can see a love reciprocated, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 5:8, &#8220;But God demonstrated His love, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us<\/span>&#8220;, then Paul responds to this love by saying, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<\/span>&#8221; then the Lord assists him overcome because He loves him and Paul concludes, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I am persuaded that the natural and the supernatural will not stop me from His love<\/span>,&#8221;. Listen to what Paul says again in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2Timothy 1:12, &#8220;For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not a shamed, for I know whom I have believed and am <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">persuaded<\/span> that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day<\/span>&#8220;. Read Paul&#8217;s story and you will discover that everything he mentioned he experienced but none of them separated him from His love and it&#8217;s all because He was persuaded in every minute in his life that Christ sure loved him. If you are facing some of the challenges mentioned above and doubting Christ\u2019s love for you, look to the cross where He demonstrated His own love by dying for you. This should be your point of encouragement to believe that He knows where you are and where you are going. You have to be persuaded that you are in His will and be a conqueror in every state be it natural or supernatural even when you don\u2019t see it or feel it. <\/p>\n<p>Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,Romans 8:35&amp;36, &#8220;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

To prove it, read about Moses, Elisha, David, Paul, Gideon, Samuel, Eli and many in the bible that encountered with God. We need to get saved because tomorrow is promised to no one and patience is going to be needed in this journey. Patience is accompanied by endurance. Paul writes in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 12:2, &#8220;Run this race with <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">patience<\/span> looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith<\/span>&#8220;. He was persuaded that God was not in a hurry to do things for He is such a Master craftsman working on what He has started step by step. If you watch a potter working with clay you will see that he is not in hurry to finish working on whatever he is working on until it looks perfect. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Be patient with God for He is not in a hurry<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>If there is any man who counted the cost for living for Christ, it was Paul. Remember that Paul did not physically walk with Jesus like the other disciples. He was not there when Jesus started His ministry, when He chose His disciples, when He taught the people, healed and provided for them. Paul was not there when He was transfigured, not even when they took Him, whipped Him and later nailed Him on the cross. Paul was not there when they buried Him and then came back to life on the third day. And Paul was not there when He ascended to the heavens, the truth of the matter is, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Paul is and will be there when He calls the justified<\/span>. This started when he encountered with the truth while he was on his way to Damascus to persecute Christians. What he experienced that day persuaded him of the truth and with the calling, he purposed in his heart to live and serve Christ. This is a man who counted the cost yet he wasn&#8217;t there like the rest of the disciples to see Him face to face.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:35&amp;36, &#8220;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword<\/span>. A man who is not in a hurry to leave will be conformed to the image of Christ. Think of the life of  Paul, many times he was beaten, stoned and  left for dead, he survived shipwrecks, imprisoned, made fun of, ridiculed but he had been persuaded that he was on the right track. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Have you ever asked yourself that question?. The &#8220;who&#8221; here is not just referring to people but situations too. It&#8217;s like saying I have made up my mind to stay on this road come rain or sunshine, come hell or high water, I am going to stick with this road. It has hills and valleys, pot holes, what shall separate me from this love that I have attained? This means that what I am dealing with cannot be compared to the love that He has bestowed upon me. If you are on death row and your time has come to be executed and someone appears from nowhere and says, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Let me be executed in your place<\/span>&#8220;. Your question to him might be, \u201cwhy are doing this?\u201d, and if he responded by saying,  \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">because I love you<\/span>,\u201d  wouldn\u2019t that change everything in your life?<\/p>\n<p>Paul is now writing to us and asking us, what shall make us take an exit? shall it be all those things he has written of among others? In countries like China there are many  people dying for their faith, the love of Christ compels them to stand. And this is because they are persuaded\/ convinced that Jesus Christ is the only way and that He is love. The word persuaded means  to take time to learn and experience it, patience is the word for it. Persuaded is  to induce to believe by appealing to reason or understanding. God has persuaded us in His word that He loves us, he demonstrated by sacrificing His son on the cross for us, He has persuaded us that He can be trusted and continues to. Persuasion is not for hurried people, it\u2019s for  people who want to know more and live connected regardless of what happens, God\u2019s word continues to convince them.

My reply to her was that it&#8217;s good to have baby food, but there comes a time when we have to have strong meat, that is part of our growth and maturity. Imagine if we don\u2019t start preparing children for the things of life, how will they make it when they come? If you prepared them, though it might be hard from the beginning, they may not like you now but eventually appreciate it. If someone is sick, the medicine they need to cure them might not taste or feel good but it\u2019s effective. So some of the devotions may not taste sweet but God is using them to cure us and grow us and prepare us for the things to come. Life is not fair but God is good. Praise His name<br \/><br style=\"font-weight:bold;\" \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:31, &#8220;What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">who can be against us<\/span>?<\/span>. This is the end result that should always ring in our mind and heart as believers. Look at where Paul puts the verse at 31, and then follows with hard truths in verse 35.<\/p>\n<p>You will agree with me about living in the fast food restaurant age. By this I mean we want everything either ready or can be ready in a short time. We are in a hurry and can&#8217;t wait to make the next move, if we can get rid of patience we would. The mentality is its either my way or no way, or like burger king puts it, \u201chave it your way\u201d. Sad enough, this goes even with relationships and marriages, people are in a hurry to be in relationships and also in a hurry to be in marriage. We love convenient things even if it asks for more. We are in a hurry to get the new appliances to work without reading the instructions, in a hurry to sign a contract, get a promotion, and even in a hurry to be used of God. The same drive we had before we got saved we find that it\u2019s still very present even after we get saved. Things are not happening fast as they should or as they were anticipated. Someone received a word from the Lord that He was going to do something but they can&#8217;t wait to see the Lord do it, constantly checking, being anxious as though the Lord forgot His word. Kids are in a hurry to grow and can&#8217;t wait to be adults.  We are all guilty at some point of being in a hurry to do something or be in something. The problem of being in a hurry is that many times it does more damage than good. Hurrying does not allow you to look before you leap to see if that is the path you want to follow and if you are ready to take it no matter the cost. The Bible says, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">He who is going to build must first count the cost<\/span>&#8221; and this is not the case in our time. Easy get in, easy get out. This works so well with many marriages today, the Hollywood style. There are a lot of exits on the highway in our days so that if we don&#8217;t like it anymore, hey we don&#8217;t have to struggle to work on it, just take the next exit.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing that does damage apart from hurrying is the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">order of the affection<\/span> for instance; someone is interested more on what someone else has rather than what they have. The problem with this is that things can easily come and go whereas, people and values last. I have seen people leave because what they based their relationship on was no more. Another order reversed, the bible puts emphasis on <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Soul, Spirit, and Body<\/span>, man has changed the order to <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">body, soul, and spirit<\/span>. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">God is the lover of my soul.<\/span> It doesn&#8217;t matter what I look like, God loves my soul first. Today body gets the first priority and we know the body is always in a hurry. I believe the order of the affection has a way of affecting us in this life and we need to be very careful not to put emphasis on the wrong thing. Having set up the ground for sharing, let\u2019s now get into the word tomorrow. I will continue, blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 8:35&amp;36, &#8220;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, vs. 36 As it is written &#8220;For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter&#8221; A while back a lady [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2230","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-zY","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2230","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=2230"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2230\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2231,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2230\/revisions\/2231"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=2230"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=2230"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=2230"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":2228,"date":"2011-05-17T18:18:00","date_gmt":"2011-05-17T12:48:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2011\/05\/17\/david-and-jonathan-a-covenant-relationship-by-samm-tippet\/"},"modified":"2011-05-18T05:20:01","modified_gmt":"2011-05-17T23:50:01","slug":"david-and-jonathan-a-covenant-relationship-by-samm-tippet","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2011\/05\/17\/david-and-jonathan-a-covenant-relationship-by-samm-tippet\/","title":{"rendered":"David and Jonathan &#8211; a covenant relationship, by Samm&nbsp;Tippet"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>It was a moment that I&#8217;ll never forget. Thousands of others have gone through the same experience. Yet, every time I watch someone go through this important moment of life, goose bumps cover my arms. The meaning of this great event is the glue that holds society together. No nation can forget the deep meaning of this experience and survive for long. It&#8217;s foundational to any culture.<\/p>\n<p>So, what is this great moment? It&#8217;s that moment when a man and woman make vows to love and cherish each other for the rest of their lives. They enter into a covenant relationship in which they are committed to one another until death parts them. We call it the wedding ceremony. It&#8217;s the public commitment of the deepest of human relationships. It&#8217;s when a man and a woman &#8220;cut a covenant&#8221; with one another. This relationship is so deep that Paul compared it to the relationship of Christ to the church.<\/p>\n<p>Often in ancient times, groups of people entered into covenant relationships. Sometimes these relationships were between two warring factions. Other times, the lives of two people just seemed to be knitted together. The latter was the experience of David and Jonathan. God seemed to knit their hearts together after David killed the giant, Goliath.<\/p>\n<p>The Bible describes clearly what happened with David and Jonathan. It says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself. And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt&#8221; (1 Sam. 18:1, 3, 4 NIV).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Young David found someone who was more than just a friend in Jonathan. This relationship was one of the most profound friendships described in the Bible. There were several characteristics of this covenant relationship which can be a model for strong healthy friendships today. First, they became one in spirit. It&#8217;s not often that God just knits two hearts together. If a person has one relationship in life like that, then he is fortunate. David and Jonathan were knit together and &#8220;one in spirit.&#8221; God gave me a friend like that many years ago. He was killed in an automobile accident about 17 years ago, but I&#8217;ve never gotten over the impact he had on my life.<\/p>\n<p>When the ancients entered into a covenant, they often exchanged a piece of clothing and a piece of armor. This happened in David and Jonathan&#8217;s covenant. The clothing represented the material possessions that they had. Jonathan was saying to David, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">All of my possessions are now available to you.<\/span>&#8221; The sword represented the exchange of power. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Jonathan was saying that all of the power available to him as Saul&#8217;s son was now available to David.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This covenant relationship between David and Jonathan is the clearest Old Testament picture of the covenant relationship that we have with Christ. He has said to us, &#8220;All that I possess is now yours. All of my power belongs to you.&#8221; We have an incredible inheritance because of the covenant that Christ made with us. The Lord&#8217;s Supper is a reminder of that covenant. Every time we participate in that great symbolic event, we need to remember the covenant that we have with Him. We have entered into the deepest of relationships known to man. He has given us an incredible inheritance.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s one last aspect of the covenant between David and Jonathan that is very important to us. When two ancient people cut a covenant, it was until death. The only way that they could get out of the covenant was through death. Jesus cut a covenant with us. He was faithful until death. We, too, must be faithful until death. Once we&#8217;ve entered the covenant, there&#8217;s no turning back. We have all of His riches in the heavenly places, but we also have the responsibility to follow Him all the way until death.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Application:<\/span> David and Jonathan&#8217;s covenant relationship teaches us a lot about life &#8211; and a lot about death.

Not by grace alone, nor by faith alone, but these working together to bring the soul into harmony with God. It is only through the shed blood of Jesus that we can be saved, He alone is the author of salvation. No man can earn this, no amount of good can cleanse us, only the precious blood of Jesus. God has prepared for all mankind the means of salvation.<\/p>\n<p>But what of faith? This is our part, and the part often most ignored. We receive by His grace the ability to believe, but the act of faith whereby we trust in Jesus for salvation is ours. God does not forcibly save anyone, nor does He keep us against our will, He allows us a free will, for He desires  a people that truly love Him, and obey Him out of this love. In the Greek language, the word faith throughout the NT depicts an ongoing action, present tense word. We do not one time put our faith in Jesus, but we daily live by faith, pursuing a holy life, forsaking all sin, enabled continually by His grace. This does not just happen automatically, it is a daily walk by faith, for the just shall live by faith. God alone saves, He alone sanctifies, but we must take the initiative, we must be diligent to maintain our part.<\/p>\n<p>We must daily work out our salvation with fear and trembling, all the while knowing it is God who works in us. God will not do for us what He has commanded us to do, He will not force us to walk in His ways, nor will He overlook our sin, but He will give us the ability we need to overcome sin as we yield our lives to Him. We cannot neglect our responsibility, neglecting to care for our physical body results in death the same way neglecting the spiritual responsibilities  results in spiritual death and backsliding. If you hear His voice, harden not your hearts, for God is truly desiring to do a work in each of our lives, he desires that we would be holy as He is holy, that Christ would be formed within us, His very righteousness, not merely imputed to us, but imparted within us, this is the ongoing work of salvation in our lives as we remain in Christ.

It\u2019s easy to say your sufficiency comes from Christ but how you talk and act may suggest different. To be clear on what sufficient or sufficiency is, we have to further break it down to simply mean, adequate or enough to meet a purpose.  Is Christ adequate and enough or do we look to other places?<\/p>\n<p>At the beginning of this chapter, even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labor. Yet they understand that it\u2019s not by their own strength or ability they were able to do it but by the power of God in them because they have considered Him sufficient to accomplish His work through them.<\/p>\n<p>God\u2019s word is sufficient ,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> 2 Peter 1:2, \u201cGrace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, 3 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue<\/span>, 4 by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust<\/span>\u201d<\/span> and for this reason, Christ and His word does not become secondary but primary issue. We don\u2019t look to the world and it\u2019s philosophies to define us and how we do things, but we look to Christ and His revealed word to live by and do His work. As Paul Washer in one of his message once said, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cOver the last several decades there has been a mighty battle with regard to the inspiration of Scripture.  But there is only one problem. When you come to believe as a people that the Bible is inspired you have only fought half the battle because the question is not merely is the Bible inspired, is it inerrant. The major question following that that must be answered: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;\">Is the Bible sufficient<\/span> or do we have to bring in every so called social science and cultural study in order to know how to run a church? That is a major question\u201d.<\/span>  Many are turning away from the sufficiency of the scripture to embrace the worlds\u2019 experts on how to grow a church, do evangelism, teach on marriages, raise children. Most Christian bookstores are filled with self-help books little pointing it\u2019s readers to study the word of God. They don\u2019t deny that the Bible is inspired or inherent, they just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">sufficient<\/span> to address the issues that affect them and would rather turn to experts with more degrees than a thermometer. Don\u2019t get me wrong, God may use them and has done, but we believe they are instruments in God\u2019s hand and not the source and the outcome of things.<\/p>\n<p>Praying effectively, preaching, living, etc. is not about ABILITY, it\u2019s about AVAILABILITY. It\u2019s like a guitar which has no ability to tune itself and play on its own. The dead guitar comes alive when it\u2019s placed in the hands of a skillful player who knows how best to play it. He tunes it and makes his own sweet music filled with harmony in the air because it\u2019s in the right hands. The music is therefore not credited to the guitar but to the one who plays it. That is the same with us, when we avail ourselves, the Holy Spirit takes us, tunes us by God\u2019s word and plays His own tune of prayer, preaching, living how best He wants us to and Christ is exalted while God the Father is glorified. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2Corinthians 4:7, \u201c7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us\u201d<\/span>. We sound better because our sufficiency is from God and the credit goes back to Him.<\/p>\n<p>Confidence toward God is solid and real, as looking to Him for the strength needed now, and also for the reward of grace to be given hereafter. Any teacher, books, experts who are not turning us to the sufficiency of the scripture robs us.

Years back there was a cartoon always on TV called the transformers. My brothers loved waking up early Saturday morning to watch it and later practice what they watched. They would see these cartoons would transform themselves into something extraordinary, supernatural, and powerful in certain times. This transformation allowed them to fight more powerful enemies. Transformation was the process of developing them from something they were (small) into something they were not (Big),<\/span><br style=\"font-weight:bold;\" \/><br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1John 3:2, \u201c\u2026Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. The verse talks about how we shall be like Him when He appears meaning we shall be transformed into His image that we may see things as He sees them, treat people like He does, be holy as He is and the like. That is the ultimate goal to be glorified by Him, but we are not there yet. We are being transformed day by day as we yield to Him. He continues to say in John 15:15&amp;16, \u201c Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My name, He may give it you\u201d. We\u2019ve passed servants of sin, still servants but in a different level or in some other word slaves to sin to be in the level of being called friends. A friend is always let inside, he is shown around, he is cared for, loved, respected and knows the secrets. Our zeal and drive now is not to please man or self anymore but God. When we understand who we are, what we are destined to be, we are transformed to be what Creator wants us to be. All the transformation begins in the mind as Paul tells the Romans, \u201c\u2026but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind\u2026. Paul understood that if the mind can be transformed, the entire body and destiny could be changed. The bible says that as a man thinks in his heart so is he. Think defeat, you will be programmed towards defeat. Think failure and you\u2019ve opened doors to failure. Think victory, you seek faith increase, 1John 5:4, &#8220;He that is born of God overcomes the world, this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith&#8221;.  If you can begin to call those things which are not as though they were and begin to allow yourself to go through the process of transformation, you are in the right track my friend. I shall be what the Lord said I will be in spite of who I am today, for who I am today is not my end but my beginning. I\u2019m not designed to remain in the same place forever, I am a transformer!!!<\/span><br style=\"font-weight:bold;\" \/><br \/>I pray that you will begin to think about what you have read, prove them to be true, adjust your life and get in line for your life is in God\u2019s hand. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">People may change the label on the package but they can never change its content.

He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. 5 It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.&#8221;<\/span> Hannah makes her vow in prayer to the Lord, and Eli the priest confirms the answer from the Lord, that indeed God had heard her prayer, and she would have a son. This word from the Lord lifted her spirit and she was no longer sad. God&#8217;s Word met her right where she was. He met her sadness with joy, hopelessness with hope, and barrenness with a child. Her son is born, to become the prophet Samuel who would later anoint King David to the throne of Israel. Hannah&#8217;s prayer was desperate, selfless, and committed.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1. Desperate prayer<\/span>. Hannah was in a time of desperation. Much more can be said of women in those days bearing children, but this was her heart\u2019s desire and she brought it to God. Where do you bring your deepest hearts desires, your dreams, your vision? Do you bring them to the Lord, or elsewhere?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2. Selfless prayer.<\/span> Hannah&#8217;s prayer was answered, and &#8220;unto her a child was given.&#8221; However she promised God that she would give Him to the Lord all the days of Samuel\u2019s life. The very child she was desperate for, she was willing to give him back to the Lord as a gift. Are you selfish in your prayers, or selfless? Jesus prayed, &#8220;not my will be yours be done.&#8221; Before we can pray <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Thy Kingdom come [thy will be done],&#8221; we must be willing to pray &#8220;my kingdom go [my will be gone] ALAN REDPATH.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">3. Committed prayer<\/span>. Hannah did not delay in fulfilling her vow to the Lord. Hannah brought Samuel to Eli the priest and he was offered up to the Lord saying, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. 27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: 28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD.&#8221;<\/span> When God answers your prayer in a vow do your keep your end of the vow?<\/p>\n<p>Are you desperate for the Lord? Is your prayer selfless and are you committed to serve Him with that which He gives you, whether things or people. Give to the Lord that which He has given you.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,1Samuel 1:10 &#8220;In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD. 1Sa 1:11 And she made a vow, saying, &#8220;O LORD Almighty , if you will only look upon your servant&#8217;s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2220","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-zO","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2220","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=2220"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2220\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2221,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2220\/revisions\/2221"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=2220"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=2220"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=2220"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":2218,"date":"2011-05-06T19:45:00","date_gmt":"2011-05-06T14:15:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2011\/05\/06\/blessing-our-mothers-2\/"},"modified":"2011-05-06T22:11:47","modified_gmt":"2011-05-06T16:41:47","slug":"blessing-our-mothers-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2011\/05\/06\/blessing-our-mothers-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Blessing Our Mothers"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, <br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 30:11, &#8220;11 There is a generation that curses its father, And does not bless its mother..&#8221; .<\/span><br style=\"font-weight:bold;\" \/>Everyone has a story to tell about their mother and everyone will agree that our mothers have played key roles in our upbringing and we ought to thank  and bless them. In this era regardless of age, many have despised their  parents, rarely sitting down to think about how God through their  mothers have played huge part in their upbringing. Yes they were not  perfect but they gave it all. While I share on mothers, I\u2019m not  dismissing the roles of dads in our lives, I just want to concentrate on mothers on mother\u2019s day. Let\u2019s see some of the mothers in the bible.<br \/>Moses&#8217; mother Jochebed hid him when there was a decree in Egypt that all new  male born were to be killed. Jochebed had a sense that God had a plan  for her son and with that wisdom she hid her son in a place where he  could be found and not harmed. God used Moses later mightily. Hannah  prayed for a son when no one else could understand the longing and the  desire of her heart. She knew her desires could only be met by God, so  year after year she prayed. Finally she prayed a prayer that caused God  to step into her situation and bless her. Her prayer was that God would  bless her with a son and she would give him back to God. She asked for a son, God gave her a prophet. God used him mightily. How can we forget  Elizabeth the mother of John the Baptist, who was born to her in her old age, John became the voice in the wilderness preparing the way for the  Lord. God used him mightily. Mary the mother of Jesus, a young woman yet pregnant with destiny. She was willing to take a stand to do what she  was not qualified to do, raising up the Son of God. There are other  mothers in the bible worth mentioning, Eunice the mother of Timothy,  Samson&#8217;s mother, Isaac&#8217;s mother, Joseph&#8217;s mother and many more. God  entrusted these mothers with these children and you can see that each of them raised their children in the fear and the knowledge of God,  advising, protecting, praying for them in advance, dedicating them back  to God and standing by them through thick and thin. Raising these  children was not an easy task and so was raising each of us <br \/>I believe these men learnt to bless their mothers. Solomon took seriously the lessons on how to deal with parents, check out the book of  Proverbs. His take on a virtuous woman, Proverbs 31:28, &#8220;Her children rise up and call her blessed; &#8230; &#8221; 29&#8243;Many daughters have done well, But you excel them all.&#8221; <br \/>Just in America, over 40 million babies have been aborted since abortion was legalized in 1973, thank God your mom and mine did not abort us. They  may have never known how we would turn out yet they trusted God to raise us up in spite of. What dads could not provide because of the way they  are wired, mothers did. Those days dad had to be a way to work and  provide for the family, mothers took the responsibility of instilling  what dads had taught. I have deep honor and gratitude for my mom and I  bless her. She may have not been perfect but she gave it all. I wish I  was in a position to do everything for her to make her comfortable. Do  you know that many have aborted the leaders of tomorrow, thank God these women in the bible did not abort.<br \/>How does this apply to us today, many times children forget the sacrifices  their mothers have made for them over the years. Some even concentrate  on what their mothers should have done better. It started long time ago  and that is why Proverbs 30:11, &#8220;there is a generation that does not bless their mother&#8221;. Blessings are powerful and our mother\u2019s honor is in us blessing them. I don\u2019t  need to wait for mother\u2019s day to bless mom. You might say your mother  does not deserve it, it&#8217;s not all about deserving, it\u2019s about honoring  God by blessing your mother by prayers, support, encouragement, time,  living a life pleasing to God due to how she raised you, doing things  that will not shame her, not causing her to worry and panic in this time of her life. She has done the sacrifice, let her now sit and enjoy the  fruits of her labor. Happy mother\u2019s day.

One time I got off work and went home thinking of how I could use a cup of tea. Upon reaching home, I made some tea, I found a dish of sugar or what I thought was sugar. Being confident it was sugar, I scooped two spoons full into the tea, stirred it up and made the first sip, what a taste. That was not sugar but salt, I missed my precious tea but understood the power of the salt<br \/>Salt is a colorless or white crystalline solid, chiefly sodium chloride, used extensively in ground or granulated form as food seasoning and preservative. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It&#8217;s an element that gives flavor.<\/span> This is its primary function.<br \/>There is something about salt that we need to understand because it shows us what Jesus meant when He said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;You are the salt of the earth&#8221;<\/span>. I read somewhere that there are 14,000 uses of salt. Let&#8217;s look at some of the things salt does. A pinch of salt will make food tasty whereas in comparison you will need a lot more than a pinch to make sugar taste in your tea. Salt is not made out of something like sugar, salt mostly is found around the lakes, oceans, or streams. Salt is used to melt ice, as a preservative, used to treat wounds, creates thirst, and stops colors from fading on clothes . Also salt causes water to boil faster, it can be used to peel boiling eggs faster, greasy pans can be cleaned using salt etc.<br \/>We have been made in a way that we can add flavor because we are salty. Everyone has a chance to do something, you can melt a hard heart, you can preserve by your salty words, you can treat wounds, you can create thirst for righteousness, you can stop precious things from fading away, you can clean using your words, and by all means you can be a salt that the Lord will use to restore someone. Remember that a pinch of salt can go a long way. You don&#8217;t have to be an expert, scientist, doctor, or a professional to salt someone else, all you got to do is remember what Jesus has called you SALT and know where you get your salt from.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mathew 5:13, &#8220;&#8230; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men&#8221;,<\/span> I don\u2019t know how salt can lose it\u2019s saltiness but it is possible. You lose your saltiness when you disconnect yourself from the stream of water where salt is found. We are to be like a tree planted by the river bearing our fruit (salt) in our season. Who wants to use salt that has no flavor? And who will want to use salt that is not effective? When it\u2019s good for nothing, it\u2019s thrown away.<br \/>Check your personal life, do you consider yourself to be salt? If you are, are you salting the people around you in every way the salt can be used? Are you stretched to the maximum in the sense that you are fully utilizing your saltiness to affect your surrounding? To be salt is not reserved for some people, this is for all believers who are connected to the living stream. Salt through prayers, encouragements, assisting, spending time with someone and more. Salt in the salt shaker is not effective, it\u2019s only effective when used for the purpose it was gathered. Are you in a salt shaker? Ask the Lord to use you for the reason He created you.<br \/>Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,Mathew 5:13, &#8220;You are salt of earth&#8230;&#8221;Once in a while I appreciate a cup of hot tea late in the afternoon on a cold day after a long day\u2019s work.

Many today fail to see the exceeding sinfulness of mankind, we categorize sin in a way that makes us feel better about ourselves for not doing anything \u201cthat bad.\u201d But here both Jesus and Jeremiah point to a deeper problem, the heart of men and women, the epicenter of human life. Here, at the core of our being, is where sin is birthed. We cannot reform ourselves to deal with this sin within, this is what the Pharisees tried to do. They were fooled to think that religious observance could make their hearts clean, but they were wrong. Others might coddle your despair by telling you that God\u2019s grace covers over these things, they don\u2019t need to be dealt with for God does not see them, yet I Samuel 16:7 tells us that the Lord looks at the heart. This only breeds false hope, leaving people in their sin, but I tell you today Christ came to fully deliver us from sin, not to leave us in it.<br \/>This sin within must be dealt with, it must be mortified, crucified, killed, utterly removed from us, but how? There must be a cleansing, a deep purification, which reaches to the depths of our wicked hearts. Justification does not do this, for this only brings us into right standing with God, there must be a deeper work. Peter tells of this work in Acts 15:8-9, when he testifies of the Day of Pentecost, not about tongues, but of the purifying work of the Holy Spirit, who had purified their hearts by faith. And remember, the 120 were all justified believers, living in obedience to God, but Jesus told them to tarry, to wait for the promise of the Father, till they were endued with power from on high. He told them to seek a deeper work of grace, the fullness of God poured out in their hearts.<\/p>\n<p>This is the crying need of the church today brothers and sisters, we need power, but first we need purity. We need hearts that have been purified by the baptismal fire of the Holy Spirit. The heart must be cleansed, the very nature of sin destroyed, that we might truly love the Lord with all of our heart, giving ourselves to Him in complete surrender, presenting our lives as living sacrifices. This is the whole of the gospel, the full work of Christ upon the cross, where Jesus now lives and reigns within us, our lives are brought into harmony with Him. I Thessalonians 4:3 tells us that the will of God is our sanctification, our holiness, wrought by the baptism with the Holy Spirit.

The wood would be carried to the place of sacrifice. Isaac was laid on the place that he would be slain by the father, and the piecing object (a knife in this account) was going to be thrust into Abraham\u2019s son by the father. In this midst of all of this Isaac would ask a poignant and crucial question. \u201cLook, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\u201d And Abraham said, \u201cMy son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering (7-8).\u201d Abraham believed that if he killed his most precious treasure, his son, that God would raise him from the dead. The writer of Hebrew in chapter 11 magnifies this reality:<span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><\/span><b><sup>17<\/sup><\/b><b>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, <sup>18<\/sup> of whom it was said, \u201cIn Isaac your seed shall be called,\u201d <sup>19<\/sup> concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense (7 \u2013 19).<\/b>The day came on Friday when God Himself would choose His chosen Lamb and would offer Him up as a sacrifice, a substitute for sinner and He would pour out his perfect wrath on Christ, the innocent substitute.MacArthur shares again, <i>\u201cI<span style=\"color:#333333;\">t is Thursday night of Passover week. Passover begins with this Thursday night, followed with seven days of the unleavened bread feast which also commemorated the exodus out of Egypt. Millennia have gone by, waiting for an adequate sacrifice. Millennia have gone by with people\u2019s hearts hoping and hoping and hoping but never being satisfied that a true and final sacrifice had come. But one more day, a few more hours on Friday at exactly the hours of slaughter between three and six when all the Passover lambs had to be killed, the Lamb of God would die in that same period of time\u201d.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><\/span><br \/><span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);\">The parallels between the requirements of the Torah for the choosing of a Lamb and the details of Christ\u2019s Passion Week are amazing when realized. R.C. Shares in his article <i>Meeting Jesus at an Old Testament Feast<\/i>, \u201c<b><i>The Torah required selected lambs to be put on display for four days (Exodus 12:3 \u2013 6) to verify that they were without blemish. Jesus followed the triumphal entry, presented Himself in the temple for that exact period, for that exact perfect. He submitted Himself testing by the Pharisees, Herodians, Sadducees, and scribes<\/i><\/b> (Mark 12:3)\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);\">You may make an assumption that there were those in cahoots that took Christ\u2019s life from Him. Yet one thing is sure it was not the Jewish leaders that took his life ultimately though they wanted him killed for His allegedly blasphemy, their jealousy, and their rage as he upset their economic standings (recall His flipping the tables over in the outer court of the Temple). The Romans were the only ones that could administer the death penalty, but it was not the Romans that actually killed the Savior. No, none of these groups took His life, but rather He freely laid it down as he proclaimed because Pilate. He willingly had His life out of obedience to God the Father, and to glorify the Father, as God the Son would in agreement with the Father be slain for the Glory of God. Christ knew that He would die, by what means, and when, and orchestrated everything to lead to His own death. MacArthur states, \u201c<b><i>The cross loomed in front of him every day of his conscious life. <\/i><\/b>He would die on the Passover day in the middle of the afternoon on a Friday in A.D. 30 in the month of Nissan on the fourteenth day as God\u2019s Passover Lamb. He would die at the very same hour Passover lambs by the tens of thousands were being slaughtered. He knew every detail about His coming death.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);\">Christ was a Prophet and message, priest and sacrifice, and King and the glory with full authority. The sacrifice had to be offered by a priest, but Christ was both the Priest after the order of Melchizedek, and he was the sacrifice simultaneously.Who was Christ thinking about on the cross? There is a song that states concerning the crucifixion, \u201c<i>and you thought of me above all\u201d <\/i>Christ the Son was thinking about the glory of God the Father above all, as can be realized in all His statements made while on the cross. <i>Father forgive them they know not what they do, Father why has thou forsaken Me, Father into your hands I commit my spirit<\/i>.\u201d Christ lived under the Law and was the only one that kept the Law, unlike you and I that are Law breakers (transgressors of His Ten Commandments). God Commands all men [humanity] everywhere to repent and put their trust in Christ [the same way one would trust in a parachute when jumping out of a plane]. Why, because He will judge the world in righteousness, and if you stand before the Lord in your own righteousness you will perish on the Day of Judgment. However, if you stand in the righteousness of Christ you will be judged as innocent on that Day.God treats Christ as if He lived our wretched sinful lives, and treats only those in Christ, as if they lived the life of Christ (perfect, clean and glorifying God before His face). All will die and stand before the Lord. Is Christ your greatest and most prized treasure, and would those closest to you concede that He is?. Would your parents, spouse, closest friends, co-workers, boss, etc\u2026 say that Christ is the most important thing (relationship) in your life? If they wouldn\u2019t there is probably good reason for that (He\u2019s not).<\/span><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:right;line-height:normal;\" align=\"right\"><span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);\">In closing realize that you will hear one of two things on<br \/>Judgment Day, \u201cWell done good and faithful servant, or I NEVER knew you depart<br \/>from me you work iniquity.

Following the Passover Lamb, no food was to be eaten, but this would be the tradition in which Jesus would follow. Many call the new meal that Jesus instituted, the Last Supper, however this would not be accurate to say, but rather this would be the Last Passover meal. Even though nothing was to be eaten after the lamb was eaten, Christ lifts up the bread and first gave thanks at the end of the meal; then He proceeded to break it and disperse it among His eleven remaining disciples. He proclaimed, \u201c<b>Take, eat; this is my body.\u201d<\/b> Was the bread literally his body or a symbol or representation of His body? Remember Jesus ministered in a Jewish culture and therefore the language metaphorical language he used was a typical Hebraism. It represented his body similar to the words of Luke 8:11 where Jesus says that the seed is the Word of God, and therefore \u201c\u2026no Eucharistic miracle of transubstantiation was implied, nor could the disciples have missed the symbolic intent of His statement, for His actual body\u2014yet unbroken\u2014was before their very eyes (John MacArthur).\u201d In the book of John, John records many \u201cI Am statements\u201d that Jesus made to represent Himself which are as follows: <br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:tahoma;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">\u201cI am the light of the world (8:12).\u201d; \u201cI am the door of the sheep (10:7, 9)\u201d; \u201cI am the good shepherd (10:11, 14)\u201d; I am the resurrection and the life (11:25)\u201d; \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. (14:6)\u201d; \u201cI am the true vine (15:1)\u201d. However imagine if when we turned on the light we thought it to be Christ, or how about walking through a door, seeing a vine, etc\u2026. He was not literal about his body which was right in front of the disciples, and saying that he was holding Himself up in His hands and breaking himself, and then they would eat him, but rather that he would be broken in his flesh on the cross. The distinction must be made that his flesh was broken, because for one to say that he was broken could imply that his whole body was broken and this would include even his bones which Scripture records would not, and were not broken. He lifted the cup and proclaimed, <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:tahoma;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, \u201c<b>Drink from it, all of you. <sup>28<\/sup> For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. <sup>29<\/sup> But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father\u2019s kingdom (Matt 26:27\u201329).\u201d<\/b> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:tahoma;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Let me back up for just a minute to \u201c\u2026the Passover which had looked forward to the sacrifice of Christ; He transformed the seder into an altogether different ceremony, which looks back in remembrance at His atoning death.<sup> <a name=\"12f9c295c02f5f67__ftnref1\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/mail.google.com\/mail\/?ui=2&amp;view=bsp&amp;ver=ohhl4rw8mbn4#12f9c295c02f5f67__ftn1\" title=\"\"><span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;color:blue;\">[1]<\/span><\/span><span><\/span><\/a><\/sup><span><\/span>\u201d The whole meal and all the events leading up to it was about Christ Himself. In Exodus (a type of the world) God was to deliver His people from slavery. In the New Testament God delivered His people from their slavery of sin from the world. God commanded that a Lamb was to be slaughtered and it\u2019s blood applied to the door post and the lintel of the door frame which would indicate to the death angel to Passover the homes that had applied the blood, and spare the children instead of killing them. This was not what happened with the Egyptians however, the first born in each house hold was killed by the plague that was brought by the death angel of God. What do we learn from this? John MacArthur shares the following: <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:tahoma;\"><i><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a simple principle that comes through in that and it is this, to be delivered from judgment requires death. That\u2019s the first thing to think about. To be delivered from judgment requires death. Second, critical, that death can be the death of a substitute. That death can be the death of a substitute. God was saying, \u201cI will spare you, I will deliver you from this judgment if there is the death of an innocent substitute.\u201d The message of the Passover is God delivers through the death of an innocent substitute. From then on, all sacrifices and this is not the first sacrifice, but from then on all sacrifices were clearly indications that God delivers from judgment by the death of a substitute. But the animal sacrifices weren\u2019t that substitute. No person was ever delivered from divine judgment of any animal. The repeated sacrifice of animals was simply a continual symbol of the fact that God does deliver by the death of an innocent substitute but no animal was ever satisfactory to God and so the sacrifices went on and on and on and on by the millions. And the people waited for a sacrifice that would be satisfactory to God which all those unsatisfactory sacrifices pointed.\u201d In summary in the Old Testament God was pacified as it were, but in the death of His Son He was satisfied once and for all, never to be repeated again. If one were to repeat it as was done with the Passover lamb would be to render the sacrifice of Christ useless. This is what the writer of Hebrews in chapter 10 was explaining throughout the entire chapter when he wrote<\/span><\/i><span>, <b>\u201cFor it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins (10:4). \u201cBy that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for al<\/b>l (10:10).\u201d To continue, blessings Evangelist Phil<\/span><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;font-family:tahoma;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">  <\/p>\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" \/>  <\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;font-family:tahoma;\"><a name=\"12f9c295c02f5f67__ftn1\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/mail.google.com\/mail\/?ui=2&amp;view=bsp&amp;ver=ohhl4rw8mbn4#12f9c295c02f5f67__ftnref1\" title=\"\"><span><sup><span style=\"color:blue;\">[1]<\/span><\/sup><\/span><span><\/span><\/a><span><\/span><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"> MacArthur, J.

Jesus and His disciples reclined at the table in the Babylonian custom of free men (Christ in the Passover).&nbsp; Even though they all positioned themselves as free men, one was bound captive by Satan himself.&nbsp; \u201cIt was during the ceremony of dipping the second sop into the bitter herbs that Jesus said, \u201cOne of you SHALL BETRAY ME (Matt. 26:21).\u201d&nbsp; Now each of the disciples became exceedingly sorrowful during this Passover Celebration, and began to ask him, \u2018Lord, is it I (v.22)\u2019\u201d, rather than suspect the trusted treasurer of treason, Judas.&nbsp; Jesus responds to their question by saying, \u201c\u2026He it is to whom I shall give a sop (John 13:20).\u201d&nbsp; Why didn\u2019t John stop Judas or why did Jesus not stop him?&nbsp; It must be remembered that the statement could have been taken to mean any one of them as they all took part of the sop.&nbsp; However, interestingly enough Judas probably received the sop first to show him \u201chonor\u201d in a mocking way as he was the true&nbsp; betrayer of Christ openly.&nbsp; Ironic, I think not! However all of these things were quickly unraveling before the disciples.&nbsp; They did not have a script, nor the benefit seeing through hindsight of 2,000 years of church history to glean from. <br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">\u201cThe Son of Man indeed foes just as it is written of Him, but woe (cursed) to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!&nbsp; It would have been good if he had not been born (Matt 26:24).\u201d Wow, the Creator of Life just stated it would have been BETTER is JUDAS were NEVER even BORN!&nbsp; The author of Life is certainly justified in speaking these things about His creation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">\u201cThen Judas who was betraying Him answered and said, \u2018Rabbi, is it I?

<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">It was during the Passover time that Jews came from all over to flood into Jerusalem to commemorate the Passover.&nbsp; This was in remembrance of the period of history when the Lord took His people Israel out of bondage from the Land of Egypt.&nbsp; After nine plagues which bombarded the Egyptians by the Hand of their enemy, Yahweh (God), Moses proclaimed that a tenth would come and plague the land.&nbsp; This plague would be none other than the death of the first born sons of the Egyptians.&nbsp; If you recall this is what the Pharaoh did when Moses was a child to try and kill the sons of Israel to keep them from multiplying and outnumbering the Egyptians.&nbsp; It would seem that this was satanically inspired to attempt kill Moses who would grow to become the deliverer of Israel.&nbsp; However, God used Moses\u2019 mother Jochebed to thwart those plans.&nbsp; When Moses announced the tenth plague was coming, Israel didn\u2019t need \u201cplagues for dummies,\u201d they knew nine plague warning were accompanied by nine plagues, and therefore Moses words would be followed by the plague he proclaimed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fathers of Israel were instructed to kill a male lamb, without blemish and to strike the blood on the two posts and on the upper door post of the houses.&nbsp; Why was this so?&nbsp; God said, \u201cFor I will pass through the land of Egypt\u2026and will smite all the firstborn\u2026And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses,\u2026and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you (Exodus 12:3 \u2013 7, 12 \u2013 13).&nbsp; Hence the lives of Israel\u2019s children would be saved, and the lives of the Egyptian\u2019s firstborn males would be lost because they were not protected by the blood, but were in fact enemies of God and His people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Now let us travel ahead to the night the disciples were gathered together to commemorate the Passover with Christ.&nbsp; There were two major events would take place at the house were they gathered for the Passover, one was foot washing, and the second was the meals.&nbsp; <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;\"><b><u><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">The Washing (John 13)<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Jesus would remove his outer garments and take up a towel \u201c\u2026taking the form of a bondservant (Phil 2)\u2026\u201d,and would wash each of the feet of his disciples.&nbsp; He began to wash them one by one, however \u201c\u2026the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas to betray him (13:2).&nbsp; Jesus then arrived at Peter who initially refused the foot washing by the Master saying, \u201cYou shall never wash my feet.\u201d&nbsp; Christ replies, If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.\u201d&nbsp; Peter responds to Him saying, \u201cLord not my feet only, but also my hands and my head (8\u20139)!\u201d&nbsp; Jesus answers by saying, \u201c\u2026he who bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean but NOT all of you.\u201d&nbsp; Who was Christ referring to when he made this statement among his twelve, which one was NOT clean among them?&nbsp; Hopefully it is blatantly obvious that Judas had his feet washed by Christ outwardly just as the others had received, but he was not bathed inwardly as it states in Jeremiah 17:9: \u201cThe heart <i>is<\/i> deceitful above all <i>things,<\/i> And desperately wicked; Who can know it? <sup>0<\/sup>I, the <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Lord<\/span>, search the heart, <i>I<\/i> test the mind, Even to give every man according to his ways, According to the fruit of his doings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Christ served each one of his disciples and modeled how to serve, however Judas was not serving Christ but rather in the midst of betraying Him!&nbsp; Perhaps Judas not Peter should have been the one to refuse the foot washing.&nbsp; However a betrayers heart instead of a servants heart is what resided within the life of Judas, as he sought his true god, 30 pieces of silver.&nbsp; Jesus summoned up His foot washing lesson when he instructed them saying, \u201cIf I them being your LORD [Lit. <b>YAHWEH] <\/b>and<b> <\/b>Teacher haved, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet.

This is a picture of apostate Christians who never genuinely believed and will be taken away in judgment (v. 6; Matt. 7:16; Eph. 2:10); the transforming life of Christ has never pulsated within them (8:31, 32; cf. Matt. 13:18\u201323; 24:12; Heb. 3:14\u201319; 6:4\u20138; 10:27\u201331; 1 John 2:19; 2 John 9).\u201d&nbsp; The unfruitful branch Christ is speaking of is none other than Judas!&nbsp; There are many false converts (Judas\u2019) that sit among the people of God, they may look like branches, but God is the fruit inspector and when He looks at them He sees them in truth, and unless they repent and put their faith in Christ, will cut them off and see that they are burned (end up in Hell)!&nbsp; Does this sound like God is a mean cruel and judgmental God to you?&nbsp; God is certainly judgmental (He is the perfect Just Judge of the universe) but He is certainly kind, so kind as to save His people from their sin&nbsp; Hence upon removing the dead branches, he also prunes His children, which are bearing fruit, so they might bear more fruit for His glory.&nbsp; The purpose for bearing fruit is that God is glorified, and true disciples will bear fruit because the power and life is in the vine and will flow through to the branches.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Thirdly, what does God use to both punish the unfruitful and prune the fruitful? <\/b>&nbsp;He uses a Blade which is His Word (Heb 4:12; 2 Tim 3:16), the Handle of His Sword is the affliction and persecution He allows to come upon His children to make them more Christ like (Mark 4, Matt. 13; 2 Tim 3:12), and he uses His Church to spur one another (Heb 10:24-25, Prov. 27:17; Gal 2:11).&nbsp; He uses His pure unadulterated Word to condemn, punish and cut off the ungodly (Exo. 20; Rom 7, Gal 3:24, John 3:10-21).&nbsp; Yes this is a picture of judgment.&nbsp; In contrasting Peter verse Judas both that were chosen by Christ, one can see that Peter denied Christ, and Judas betrayed Him.&nbsp; Christ pruned Peter (Luke 22:31-34; John 21:15-17) and condemned Judas (Mark 14:17-21).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:verdana;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">The branches give nothing to the vine, but by it\u2019s fruit it glorifies the vine.&nbsp; What must a branch do to produce fruit, it must ABIDE!&nbsp; The relationship in Christ must be cultivated; it must stay dependent upon Christ, and must stand in total reliance upon Christ for apart for Christ His children can do nothing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family:verdana;\"><b><u>Application (based on 2 Tim 3:16):&nbsp; If you are connected to Christ, how has your abiding been lately?&nbsp; <\/u><\/b><\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;font-family:verdana;\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Teaching.

We are called throughout scripture  to die to ourselves, to die to self, and to give ourselves entirely unto Jesus. This is the life of holiness, the life of devotion, the life of a true disciple, to reckon ourselves dead indeed to sin, dead to  ourselves, and alive to God alone. We see Jesus walking down the Via  Delorosa, the way of suffering, and He is calling us to follow Him, for  in order for there to truly be new life, there must be first a death. We must die to ourselves if we are truly to be made alive in Christ. He  calls us to bear our cross daily, but where do we think we are heading?  Where did our Savior head? If we are following His example, we are also  going to our death. The cross is not an ornament to wear around our  necks, it is for us to die upon, just as Jesus did.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10pt;\"> <b>In Romans 6:5, Paul tells us that IF we want to be united with Him in the  likeness of His resurrection, we must first be united with Him in His  death<\/b>. We must die, first to sin, then to ourselves each day, more  and more, until we cease to exist, and only Christ lives within us, we  are now hidden in Him. We must die moment by moment, crying out along  with Jesus, Not my will, but Thy will be done, until Jesus is all that  remains. He desires to cleanse us to the uttermost, to fill every aspect of our lives, and if we will let go of our lives, O how He will fill  each life. But it takes the moment by moment death, until we are indeed  dead. A man may be dying for some time, but when he is dead he is dead,  and in that moment God fills that life. <\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10pt;\">This is His desire and will for each life, that we would die to ourselves,  that He might sanctify us wholly. Sanctification is the result of this  death of self, it is the act of His grace whereby a man is made holy,  not by growth, but by an instantaneous work of God within the heart. It  is the effect of the life laid upon the cross, the further work of God\u2019s grace within the heart. Trust in Jesus, and entrust your life  completely to Him. He asks nothing less than full devotion, and He truly deserves nothing less than that. Forsake sin, forsake yourself, this  Resurrection Sunday, as the world celebrates rabbits and eggs and all  the things thought up to distract them from the true meaning of the day, may we each truly experience God deep within our souls, and may we  truly give Him our hearts.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:10pt;\">May the Lamb that was slain receive the reward of His suffering,a<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In His love and truth, Brother Benjamen<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Colossians 3:3- For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

Everyone dreams of becoming something, or having success or loving someone and or marrying that someone or going somewhere or achieving some goals etc. These are some of the dreams and desires which, when fulfilled, add excitement, joy and happiness in our lives. God, our Heavenly Father wants us to joyous, successful and happy. However, most of the time, we don\u2019t actualize these. We often face unpredictable challenges, traps and even danger that in some cases kill our dreams and us.<br \/><br style=\"font-weight:bold;\" \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">We have an enemy whose mission is to steal, kill and destroy (John 10:10)<\/span>. He does not care who we are or where we are. He will make every attempt to kill us. He schemes plans everyday to track us down to either stop us from being what God meant for us to be or kill us. But, the good news is, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cwe are safe with God, even in the valley of the shadow of death\u2026we shall fear no evil because God is with us.\u201d (Psalms 23) He also will guide our way.<\/span> At times, He will change our plans or routes that we intended to take. For instance, He may let you go to a career you never wanted or marry someone you never thought you could marry or lead you to a town or city you never wanted to live in. He may at times instruct you to move from somewhere or out of a relationship with someone you feel you love for or care about. But whatever He does or instruct you to do, His intention is always good. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">He will only change your plans that may not fit in with His will for you. He will also change routes if He sees danger a head on the way you are going<\/span>. He will instruct or warn you not to do something or head another way. It is important, therefore, for us the children of God to be flexible and willing to change route or our plans when God tells us to. How then can we know His will? Well His will is His word. Listen to the word. Listen to good counsel. Listen to yourself and, align what you are listening to the word. If you obey, you may save yourself from future pain, failure or hardship or death. Don\u2019t insist on your ways always. Don\u2019t have the mentality most people have \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">my way or no way.<\/span>\u201d Don\u2019t compromise to please people or pride yourself to death. And don\u2019t think that you are very \u201cmature\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d and that you can make it alone. None of us is, we all need God\u2019s leading because he, alone, knows the way that we take.<\/p>\n<p>Job said \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">He knows the way that I take, after He has tried me, I shall come forth like gold\u201d (Job 23:10)<\/span>. Do you believe that God knows the way or road or path that you need to follow into your future dreams? Do you believe that God has a good plan for you to give you your expectation (Jeremiah 29:11)? If you believe God and all His promises, then let go of yourself and let God change your plans and lead you to any path He may choose whether you understand it or not. Heed to his warnings and you shall live and stay out of a lot of troubles and traps of Satan.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t, you may miss or lose something. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Samson lost his divine power, eyes and finally died tragically, because he didn\u2019t heed God\u2019s and his parent&#8217;s warning and advise not to love and marry Philistine women;<\/li>\n<li>Saul lost his kingship career, was rejected by God and died in battle, a tragic death<\/li>\n<li>Many children of Israelites died in the wilderness because they ignored God\u2019s instruction, and his servant Moses\u2019 leadership: If you heed God\u2019s warnings, and follow, His instructions, be willing to change route yourself or let Him do so at will, you will avoid a lot of, if not all, obstacles in life including premature death or evil Satan may bring your way and mine. For example: <\/li>\n<li>The Wise men, who announced the good news of Jesus\u2019 birth, went back to their country through a different route. God warned them not to go to Herod.

These virtues are Faith and Patience. Today, I would like to emphasize again the virtue of faith, in addition to determination, and courage, as necessary tools for tearing down the roof tops of any obstacle that may stand in the way, between you and Jesus, hindering you from receiving your desired miracle.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever been excited about something you had been promised and were expecting? I mean some things you really would love to have or see and then all over sudden, something happens and you couldn\u2019t have it or see it?. That usually triggers disappointment that can degenerate into discouragement and serious depression. Is there anything that can be done before getting that far? That depends on what choices and decisions you make. You can let obstacles get over your roof and tear you down or you can chose to climb over the rooftops of your obstacles, tear them down, and zoom right into the presence of Christ for your miracle. \u201c\u2026 I have set before you this day life and death, blessings and cursing, chose life\u2026\u201d(Deut.30-30).<\/p>\n<p>There are four people the Bible talks about in the Gospel of Mark 2, who could not allow anything to stop them from reaching Jesus so they could fulfill a promise they had given to a paralytic man they had picked from the street where he was begging. These four men had faith in Jesus. They believed that Jesus could heal the paralytic and set him free so he could move on with a normal and productive happy life. They told the paralytic about Jesus and the man liked the idea. So, they trekked down the dusty road, and finally reached the house where Jesus was teaching and preaching the kingdom of God. When they arrived, the house was full to capacity and the crowd could not allow them to pass through to Jesus. What did they do? They made a faith decision, no obstacle was going to stop them from seeing Jesus. They climbed the rooftop, tore the roof, tied the paralytic man\u2019s bed with a rope and lowered him as fast as they could right in front of Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>When Jesus saw their faith, he said, \u201cSon, your sins are forgiven you.\u201d Note what he saw-their faith. That made him stop what He was doing to give the men who had faith what they badly needed-the restoration of the paralytic\u2019s health and extension of his life. He saw and honored their faith. He didn\u2019t even bother to ask them who they were and where they had come from or why they had committed a property damage crime. He didn\u2019t yell at them for disturbing his meeting and changing His program. He gave them what they came for and claimed by faith and by all means.<\/p>\n<p>The decisions taken by the four men and the paralytic exhibits faith, courage and determination, without which they could not have gone passed the crowed to Jesus. If we also want to see Jesus, and bring all our cares to Him, we must make up our mind that we will climb over the rooftops of anything, including: doubts, fear, ignorance, pride, confusion, disappointment, poverty or wealth, laziness, lies, un-forgiveness, bitterness, racism, religion, traditions, etc. And tear them down and lower ourselves in God\u2019s presence. Then, we will receive whatever we have need of according to His will. The Bible says that if we humble ourselves under the mighty hands of God, He will lift us up in due season. That won\u2019t happen if we are not decided, determined, and courageous enough to take drastic steps of faith for overcoming any obstacle we may face in life.

This you will do six days, and you shall  compass the city seven times\u2026\u201d <\/u>Joshua 6:2-3, 5.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We shared on <b><u>Plowing through the obstacles<\/u><\/b>, this morning he will be sharing on <b><u>Going Round the obstacles<\/u><\/b> as we continue to learn how to overcome life obstacles.<\/p>\n<p>Our main text, from the Bible, is found in the book of Joshua 6: 1-27. I  recommend that you read the whole chapter, after work, quietly and  meditate on it. God will reveal more great things to you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">First, let me say that in life, there are obstacles that will not be easily  plowed through or problems that will be solved quickly or instantly. But they can be solved and will be resolved, if the right strategy or  approach is used. In most cases, a great deal of spiritual weapons and  personal qualities or virtues are necessary for overcoming deeply  rooted, and tough to move, change or plow through. One of these virtues  that anybody hopping to go the long haul with an obstacle is: <b>Patience<\/b>. Let me repeat it: Patieeeeeeeence! Someone once said, <b>\u201cPatience is a tree whose roots are bitter, but its fruits are sweet.\u201d <\/b>It is also said that, <b>\u201cPatience it the Queen of virtues.\u201d <\/b>When this queen is joined together with,<b> \u201cFaith\u201d, king of virtues<\/b>, there is no obstacle or problem or difficulty or circumstance that can  stand on their way. Everything bows before them, and departs with great  regrets, sorrow and disappointment. They turn <b>disappointment into appointment<\/b> with God for achievement of your dreams and arrival at your destiny. In order to develop these virtues, you must get accustomed to doing three  things consistently:<b> 1.) You must trust God, 2.) You must communicate (prayer) with God, 1.) You must listen to God, mostly, through His  word-the Bible. <\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In our today\u2019s text, Joshua, who was leading the Israelites to their  conquest faced an impossible obstacle- Jericho City. They could not move ahead without passing through Jericho. The wall of Jericho was very  high and firm. The foundation of the wall was carefully and strongly  laid, reinforced such that the children of Israel could not, whatsoever, enter to attack and destroy and loot the good stuff that was locked in  there. Can you imagine the frustration of Joshua and the Israelites? <\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you have faced some things that just blocked you so that no matter what you did or didn\u2019t do, you couldn\u2019t move on or make progress or have  breakthrough, then you may empathize with these children of God.  Remember, I didn\u2019t say \u201csympathize.\u201d (Personally I don\u2019t like that word  that much. Sympathy is one of those commodities I don\u2019t consume that  much and I don\u2019t enjoy very much the company of people who offer me  sympathy for whatever reason). Anyway, that is beside the point. <\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anyway, how did Joshua and his people overcome the wall of Jericho? The Bible  says that God gave them a strategy. He told them to gather together and  quietly go round the city seven times for seven days. And on the seventh day, they would shout with a big shout, blowing their trumpets. And  when they did that, the scripture says \u201c \u2026<b>, the people shouted\u2026and it came to pass, when the people heard, and the people shouted with a great shout, <u>that the wall fell flat, so that the people went up into the city\u2026and the took the city<\/u>.\u201d (vs.20). <\/b>Amen!<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What a simple, stupid, senseless, childish and irrational strategy God gave  Joshua. How could he and his troop, as intelligent and sensible as all  of them were, believe what God said? Well, they didn\u2019t care whether it  made sense or not, they just acted it and got the result. Sometimes God  will say things to you that don\u2019t make sense. <b>Victory from God is won by faith not by understanding or working hard or by use of powerful things or even people<\/b>. <b>The just shall live by faith\u2026not by works<\/b>. Today many of you are probably facing obstacles that you have tried to  overcome for a long time but you have not been able. Listen to God and  start going round the obstacle. You may have to do that continuously for a long time. May be seven hours, or seven days, or weeks or months or  even years. Don\u2019t give up. Each time you go round it, you are weakening  the walls of your obstacles. They will soon fall down, never again to be seen. Have a blessed going around your wall day!!!

They are not the only ones, nor are they the super strategies for overcoming all of life\u2019s obstacles we face daily. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">But they are good and godly, and are time tested, as the Bible will prove and as some of us will confirm from our testimonies and past experiences and victories God have given us. I will begin today by examining the first strategy or approach:<\/span><br \/><br style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\" \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Plowing Through The Obstacle,<\/span> When faced with an obstacle, small or big, our common reaction is usually a response or a reaction. Reaction seems to be the option most of us prefer because, I guess, it is cheap since no much thought or consideration or concentration or efforts are necessary. For instance, if you are facing a disappointment as an obstacle, you can simply deal with it by deciding to give up or quit or cry afoul or curse. Worse, you can choose to sink and drown in the deep ocean of depression, where hopelessness and frustration are manifested in large quantity free of charge. Now that\u2019s very dangerous, because most people don\u2019t get out of that sea senile or at, worse, a live. You know that. Don\u2019t you? Try not to be a statistic. Don\u2019t go there.<\/p>\n<p>But what about \u201cresponse\u201d to an obstacle? I mean in a positive manner that is likely to produce the best and most desirable and victorious result? That may demand a lot more than any reactions I have already mentioned. It may mean making a conscious decision, however risky or painful or hard or challenging the obstacle may be, that you are going to \u201cplow\u201d right through it. Your choices and decisions determine the outcome. Your dependence on God for help guarantees the victory, which is usually accompanied by a lot of joy and celebrations. Listen to what the Psalmist wrote: <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">\u201cWeeping may endure for a night, but Joy comes in the morning (Psalms 30:5).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There is a morning that always comes for those who decide to go through their obstacle, even when they are weeping so hard. They know that the weeping is just but for a night. Don&#8217;t let Satan lie to you that your obstacle is unique and special, just newly invented and that you do not have the ability and capacity to overcome it. Our God is able. His specialty is deliverance. His presence alone, even without doing anything or saying anything, melts any obstacle or problem. He is also a good road constructor. He makes ways where roads never existed and no Engineer could ever imagine a road could be constructed.  Come with me to the Bank of the Red Sea and see how He did that to Moses and the children of Israel, when they faced the impossible to \u201cplow\u201d through -The Red Sea.  Read Exodus 14, and see what God can do. It records one of the most spectacular and incredible miracle of victory over and a gigantic and life threatening obstacle. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The first thing God said to the Israelites was \u201cstand still\u201d and see my \u201c salvation which I am going to show you today.\u201d<\/span> In other words, don\u2019t panic or be scared. I am with you and I am in control of the situation. The reality was they were scared to death, because Pharaoh&#8217;s soldiers were behind them ready to kill them or recapture them and take them the back to slavery and the Red Sea was in front of them. Now, look, these guys were in a\u201d fix\u201d. But God was not scared! <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Anytime you face an obstacle, stand still. You will see God\u2019s hand and power melting your problems, fears, doubts, and all those things that are frustrating you and causing pain and at the same time stopping you from reaching your maximum potential God intended for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The second thing God did was \u201cHe told Moses to stretch his rod over the Red Sea, and divide the sea.\u201d<\/span> A dry way opened up right before their eyes and they were commanded to walk through it to the other side. Wow! What a miracle! <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">You see, God gave Moses an idea and a plan for overcoming the impossible. He acted on them and they worked. You too need a plan and an idea from God for overcoming. You can thrive on God\u2019s ideas, thoughts, plans and wisdom. <\/span>Seek them from His word. You will never overcome successfully on your own, no matter how much you try. If you don\u2019t want to drown and die, then you must decide to dedicate yourself to God and depend on Him absolutely without &#8220;if&#8221; or &#8220;but&#8221;, or maybe etc. If you want to sing today and have a happy celebration, then make a decision to go through any of your present or future obstacles with God. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Use what you have to make what you need happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>After the Israelites plowed through their obstacle, they sang a song of praise and worship to God. Praise and worship are inevitable, when facing obstacles, and after victory is won. <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">\u201cThen sang Moses and the children of Israel unto the Lord this song, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously\u2026\u201d Exodus 15:1<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Read the rest of the song for yourself. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">You really need to read, later on if you can\u2019t now these two chapters from Bible<\/span>. With open heart and willingness to learn, hear from God, and adopt the lessons or strategies revealed, your life will never be the same again.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Let us pray:<\/span> Our father in Heaven, we thank you for being there for us when we don\u2019t know what to do. We ask you to help us face our obstacles with courage and trust in your power, for victory and deliverance, whenever we face an obstacle. In Jesus name.

We all face them every day. The obstacles hinder us from being where we are supposed to be or want to be. Overcoming obstacles of any kind is not easy, especially when you are trying on your own. Naturally, as human beings, we have limited power, strength, knowledge, abilities, and many other resources that can and should be used to overcome obstacles.<\/p>\n<p>There are many ways and approaches that have been advanced by professionals, philosophers, or even lay people throughout all generations for dealing with obstacles in life. To some extent, some people have overcome great obstacles in their personal life using their own ways, methods, or even tactics and strategies. Many have also failed and some have even died without experiencing any breakthroughs with their life\u2019s obstacles. And even today, there are countless peoples who are trapped and have been stopped from moving any further because they face insurmountable obstacles that they cannot go through or past. Such people need help! I HAPPEN TO BE AMONG THOSE THAT NEED HELP. Do you?<\/p>\n<p>WELL, I do not know what your answer to that question is; I also do not know what your situation is either. But I do know that if you are like all of us, living here on earth, where there are countless problems and challenges that people face every day, then you need help. And help is available!<\/p>\n<p>There is an enemy- a common enemy of mankind who is busy building obstacles: gates, walls etc to stop you and I from experiencing the victorious and abundant life God meant for all of us. We are all God\u2019s creation. We were created, formed and made by God for a purpose greater than ourselves, and with unlimited potential to become anything He wanted us to be. But mankind lost it through wrong choice. Choosing to be independent, and live a life of self without God. This deviation from God\u2019s plan is one reason we have problems, difficulties and obstacles we cannot overcome on our own. It is also the reason why we are cached and limited and powerless, so that we cannot live victorious lives.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to share with you some insights and strategies that you can use as a Christian to help you overcome any obstacle you may be facing right now or in the future. Here are some Seven Strategies for Overcoming Obstacles.<\/p>\n<p>1.    Plow Through the obstacle:<br \/>2.    Go round it:<br \/>3.    Climb over it:<br \/>4.    Change the route:<br \/>5.    Re-position yourself:<br \/>6.    Review the situation:<br \/>7.    Break the obstacle in pieces and deal with the pieces one by one.<\/p>\n<p>To continue, Have a great day.

God is working on us helping us to climb  from glory to glory<\/p>\n<p>In Romans 5:1 tells us \u201cTherefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God&#8221;, this verse opens the door for us to be saved, the beginning of growth as we move (grow). This is justification which God does for us and none of us has a part in our justification by faith. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve passed an exam we did not sit for and could not pass on our own. Because we are justified, we have peace with God meaning the war God had with us through our wicked mind has been settled by Christ on the cross.<\/p>\n<p>Vs. 2, \u201cThrough whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.  Grace is what we don\u2019t deserve, God\u2019s unmerited favor. When you understand that you are favored, you rejoice, as you know that this isn\u2019t the end but the beginning and so your faith is elevated for you know who is holding your life.<\/p>\n<p>These two verses about sanctification is where we struggle to embrace, Vs. 3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. \u201cif we rejoice and glory in favor, we need to remember that we can also rejoice and glory in tribulation. I know not of a great tool to grow one than the school master of tribulations. It\u2019s through it that people pray more, it\u2019s an agent of purification, if channeled properly helps you see God in ways you could never imagine or think. David in Psalm 119:71 tells us how beneficial tribulations are, \u201cIt is good for me that I have been afflicted, That I may learn Your statutes\u201d. Affliction, tribulation of any kind acts as a wholesome discipline in leading the pious more highly to value the truth and promises of God<\/p>\n<p>When we glory in tribulation, we understand that tribulations are just for a season and joy is eternal. Tribulation (hardships) tailors one into patience (perseverance), as patience is not something that is taught in a classroom setting, it mastered and learnt in the sea of life. Patience builds experience (character). Having gone through hardships and patience, you become wise and experienced in giving advice, counsel, make wise decision as to where to run to for help, and what paths not to take. Character produces Hope and hope does not a shame. It\u2019s in tribulation that a saint should hold on to Christ tight and hope for the life to come.  God knows how to take us through the process of life that He may make us be like Jesus, people of character, people who can be at peace during tough times while the world is in chaos. All this work is to make us bear fruit, more fruit and much fruit. The gardener has to prune, dig around the tree, and remove the weeds that hinder that tree from bearing fruits. And if the tree is bearing fruit&#8217;s, he still works on it to bear more and much. There are certain tough things the Lord has allowed in our lives to teach us patience in our work places, friends, family, and as we go through them our character is being enlarged. We learn to love the unloving, we learn to forgive and even pray for those who despitefully use us, we learn to put ourselves in someone else shoes to feel their pain. I thank God that He moves me from stage to stage with His hands upon my life. Even in the midst of tribulations, I know that it\u2019s working for His purpose and I\u2019m learning things I could not learn in any other way, bearing fruit, more fruit and much fruit. The more He moves me, the more he grows me in  Him.

I watched it closely as I was driving and realized it was losing power. Breaking sound from the exhaust system made it more clear and I wondered what was wrong with my car. Later I took it to a garage where they found the car needed tune up. The plugs were not firing properly and my fueling system was out of place. The car was still performing but not with power.<\/p>\n<p>Wondering why I&#8217;m talking to you about my car? You may be feeling tired, worn out, spent, finished, exhausted.  And your current state is affecting your life for you cannot function effectively like you should. Yes you are functioning but not with power. Just like my car, it was still performing but not with power simply because it did not have strength it needed. Everyone needs strength to make it up the mountain, strength to fight the enemy, strength to accomplish a task. When there is no strength we become vulnerable and less effective. God has His garage (if I may use this term) where we can go and be restored and strengthened again. I was told my plugs were not firing properly let&#8217;s look at this in the Spiritual realm, your prayer life plug is weak, reading the word plug is weak too, witnessing plug is weak and reaching others plug is weak so what happens, you find it hard to perform your duties at work, home, ministry because your plugs are not firing enough strength to your life.<\/p>\n<p>2Cor 12:9, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee, my strength is made perfect in weakness&#8221; We need to understand that God&#8217;s grace is more than enough. Grace is given and not earned. We are told that it\u2019s more than enough for them that are His. Can you imagine receiving grace and new mercies everyday and yet it never runs out? The bible says &#8220;My strength is made perfect in weakness&#8221;. I love this line for it reminds me that His strength is completely made perfect in my weakness in other words, it was already there, fits like a glove regardless of what happened when I lost my strength. When you come to His shop, He will boost your strength into perfection even in your weakness. Psalm 46:1, &#8220;God is my refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&#8221;, The strength in our lives is God Himself so many times when we feel weak and tired in the Spirit, we need to check again to see who is in control of our strength.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 73:26, &#8220;My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion forever&#8221;, We can&#8217;t put our confidence in the flesh, the psalmist tells us the flesh and the heart fails but God is the strength of our heart. Thank God for His strength, you may have a lot to do and should be complaining and murmuring, you should be looking gloomy and you should be mean to people who hand you more work but because you know the Lord is the strength of your heart, you will draw strength from Him and give your job, ministry, home 110% for your hope and strength is built on nothing less than Jesus. Everyone will expect you to be overwhelmed and sink but you will sail on top of what other people are sinking in for God is tuning you up, taking off the old plugs clogged with dirt, cleaning the fuel system and making it clear that your strength may be back. You still have more mountains to climb, more valleys to go through, more work to do. You still need to clock more miles than men ever expected for God has given you His strength<\/p>\n<p>Caleb in the Old Testament was 80 years old but he felt like 40 for he says the same strength he had when he was 40 is the same strength he had when he was 80. \u201cI can do all things, survive all things, deal with all things, face all things through Christ who strengthens me Phi 4:13. Psalm 18:1-3, &#8220;I will love thee Oh Lord, my strength, the Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my strength: my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my High Tower. I will call upon the name of the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies&#8221;. Isaiah 26:1, &#8220;Trust in the Lord forever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>God is interested in seeing us get strong and perform His duties. We know for sure we cannot by ourselves that&#8217;s why in Him we live and move and have our beings. Every day we will be strong because He makes us strong but we always need to go to His garage (prayer room, His word) for tune up for the race ahead. Now my car went through restoration to a position in which it was not when I bought it, watch this, my car was not made bigger having been tuned up, it was made better. The Lord will not bring us a secretary or greater machines and the like to do greater things, He will equip us to be better in any place He plants us. Be unique in all that you do for God&#8217;s strength is unique. Feeling weak and tired, take a few minutes and walk to His throne for tune up and expect to be made better and not bigger.

And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? And the captain of the LORD&#8217;S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On the night of Israel&#8217;s attack on Jericho, Joshua personally surveyed the area surrounding the city, inspecting the fortress walls. As the military leader of Israel Joshua, was strategizing by examining up the situation set before him.  The words &#8220;he looked up&#8221; convey that Joshua was surprised. &#8220;A man&#8221; is what Joshua thought he was seeing, but subsequent events reveal that it was no ordinary man. The man&#8217;s &#8220;drawn sword&#8221; was symbolic of God&#8217;s participation in the coming battle. When he saw the man standing there ready for combat it provoked Joshua to inquire whether he was friend or foe. Joshua needed to find out whose side this man was on, could he be trusted; would he help or hinder Joshua\u2019s military operation?  These were important questions that he needed answers for. <\/p>\n<p>The stranger&#8217;s response put everything in proper perspective. God is the sovereign leader. It is never a question whether God is on our side but whether we are on God&#8217;s side. This is a perspective to take into each of our situation.  Don\u2019t try to fit God in your will, but pray &#8220;Thy will be done&#8221; and in doing so &#8220;My will be gone.&#8221; The stranger came as &#8220;captain of the host of the LORD &#8220;; Joshua therefore was to be subservient to him. <\/p>\n<p>Though he does not reappear in the story of the Conquest, the stranger was a heavenly being who fought behind the scenes in the spiritual realm. His presence showed a sign that the Lord was the real military leader of the Conquest. Many identify this person as the angel of the Lord, while others cannot distinguish him from the Lord himself (as in Exod 3:2-4:17; Judg 6:11-23) this captain of the host was the leader of the army (host) of heaven.  He didn\u2019t say that he was a captain, but THE CAPTAIN!  I don\u2019t know about you but that sounds to me like the words of my Jesus. Why do I say this because the name of Jesus is significant, as the Grecized (Greek) form of &#8220;Joshua&#8221; is &#8220;Jesus.\u201d Joshua was perhaps in charge, militarily of the army of Israel, but the Captain of the host was leader of the entire angelic host. Stay with me now.  This reminds me of what Jesus said in Matt. 25:53 in the context of Jesus talking about power when Peter cut off the ear of the soldier. Jesus then makes the statement &#8220;Do you not think that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?  A full Roman legion was six thousand men, and Jesus perhaps was conveying that he could call to? His assistance perhaps one legion for Jesus and one for each of the eleven disciples if He so chose to. But Jesus was fighting a spiritual battle not a physical one. This was more than the eyes of faith seeing help as in 2 Kings 6:17 but the knowledge that help was available, yet He refused to use it, unlike perhaps most of us would have done, because He was laying His life down for final victory (John 10:18).<\/p>\n<p>Though &#8220;Joshua fell facedown,&#8221; we cannot be sure that he realized he was in the presence of a supernatural being. In that culture persons would prostrate themselves before anyone in authority. Moreover, when Joshua said &#8220;Lord,&#8221; he used the Hebrew word &#8216;Adoni  which was used to address human beings. He did not use the divine name &#8220;Yahweh,&#8221; which is translated &#8220;LORD&#8221; in English, written with small capitals.  This encounter was not to impart commands but to inspire Joshua with humility and reverence and to instill in him the confidence that God was with him and He was really in control of the battle. So many times we try to be the captain of the battle, and yet we cannot just sit on our hands, but the real captain is Jesus, The Captain of the hosts. <\/p>\n<p>Application:  Do you seek to be in the presence of the Captain, or are you trying to fight life\u2019s battles with your own physical power.  Remember spiritual battles cannot be won by physical means.

You may have something about that you don&#8217;t like. If God was to give you a chance to design who you would like to be, most likely you will have a completely different picture of the new you. Every time you look in the mirror, is there a part of you, you wished you could change? Humans tend to concentrate more on what they don&#8217;t have or what someone else has that they forget to appreciate what they have. We at times feel that we have nothing to offer and there is nothing in our lives that other people can admire and therefore we belittle ourselves because of what we think. Psalm 139:14, &#8220;I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are thy works; and my soul knoweth right well&#8221;. You and I are skillfully, wonderfully and uniquely designed to fit in this world. You are not in this world by accident. The Porter took time to make you in an image that no one else in the world is like you. There may be people who look and sound like you but there is absolutely no one like you. In other words, you have no competition; no one can beat you being you. The design on your thumb is unique no one in the world has the same design as yours. You are unique, with unique qualities, unique design.<\/p>\n<p>We are told in Genesis about Rachel and Leah, blood sisters married to one man. Both women are from the same womb but are very different. They are unique in their looks, personality, age wise and many more things. The husband appreciates each of them differently. I want us to understand that we can belong to God but be very different. The difference is what brings about our individuality and uniqueness that we ourselves can appreciate God for. Leah is the hated one, she is not as pretty as Rachel, she does not get all the attention she desires but on the other hand, she has been blessed with the fruit of the womb, she is the oldest and that entitles her to get the first service, she has children who can attend to her and she is respected because of the fruits of her womb. When you talk about Rachel, she is the young one therefore she is served last, remember Jacob worked seven years for Rachel but ended up with Leah and therefore Rachel had to wait for 14 years before her dream was fulfilled. She has not been favored to have children and with that she is not getting the same respect as Leah. She doesn&#8217;t have children to send, to call her own and be proud of. Looking at what she doesn&#8217;t have, I see on the other hand she is beautiful, she is loved more than Leah, she is given the best gifts, she gets the best attention from her husband and yet with all these she is not happy. I saw this with Hannah and Penninah. And because of what Rachel saw in Leah, she envied her, jealousy cropped in and began to cripple her. I don&#8217;t know what to say but I think the same must have happened to Leah therefore she tried to have more children to try and cover up the pain inside of her rejection.<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to agree with me on this but I would say that it is very hard to be happy for someone when you think that what they have should have been with you instead. I also believe that it is very hard to fully appreciate the good things in someone&#8217;s life when you don&#8217;t see what has been invested in you. Concentrating so much on what someone else has and neglecting to see what you have will always have a tendency of crippling you down stealing contentment in your life. Rachel could have looked at the different areas that she had been favored and say, &#8220;Even if I don&#8217;t have this and that, God has favored me in other areas where Leah lacks&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What is my point? Very simple, look at how God designed you to know that you are unique and have no competition. As you might admire what someone else has, remember that they could be admiring what you have that you&#8217;ve already dismissed. Understanding what you have will make you appreciate the gifting and the uniqueness in you that in turn someone else\u2019s gifting and uniqueness will not be a threat to you but rather you will rejoice with them over the blessings from the Lord. Instead of envying them and being jealous, pray that God will bless them even more.  As you bless them, ask the Lord to bless you too<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 30:1, &#8220;&#8230;Give me a child, or else I die&#8221;. What a tragedy to look to someone to perfect you instead of going back to the One who made you. Rachel made a big mistake by thinking that it might have been Jacob&#8217;s fault that she wasn&#8217;t having children and this was Jacob\u2019s response, &#8220;Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?\u201d Suppose she blessed Leah and looked to God for her help, I believe God would have remembered her early fruits of her own womb.

Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.\u201d (Matt 9:37-38)<\/p>\n<p>It was truly an embarrassing moment when I drove down a one-way street the wrong way. Somehow I failed to see the sign, and therefore the oncoming traffic served as a clear and visible sign that I was heading in the wrong direction, and that I needed to flow with the traffic not against it. Perhaps you\u2019ve not had an experience like this in the natural, but it seems that some believers manifest going the wrong way when it comes to \u201cdriving\u201d their prayers up a one-way street against the flow of God\u2019s will. Many are praying for revival, instead of praying in line with God\u2019s will.<\/p>\n<p>In this passage Jesus is looking out among the multitude of people, and compassion begins to well up within Him for they harassed, helpless, confused, aimless, like sheep without a Shepherd. Furthermore they were bullied, oppressed; and in the face of such problems, they are &#8220;helpless,&#8221; unable to rescue themselves or escape their tormentors. This scene that Jesus looked at broke His heart, as He was burdened for these people.  The crux of the problem wasn\u2019t the condition of the shepherd-less sheep, but the scarcity of laborers. Even sheep that have a shepherd have problems, but they have a shepherd present to help them deal with their problems. Christians have the Shepherd in their lives, but the unsaved are like sheep without a Shepherd to save their soul on Judgment Day from Hell.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus\u2019 focus was on the harvest as His metaphor then changed from sheep farming to harvest (v. 37), as Jesus sought to awaken similar compassion in His disciples. He wanted their eyes to see what he saw, for their hearts to feel what he felt, and for their minds to come to the conclusion that His mind came to. Jesus called for a prayer rally on this issue. He wanted harmony on this prayer point (Mt. 18:20), hence all praying for this. This prayer issue needs the resolve of the persistent widow (Luke 8), showing us that we should pray and never give up, especially praying for what Christ told us to pray for. The judge in that story was reluctant to answer the widows persistent request, but God doesn\u2019t deal with us in this manner, but delights to hear His bride, His chosen ones, His body, His church cry day and night unto Him (Luke 18:7).  People are God\u2019s love language.  How does the church get a heart for the lost, and God\u2019s will (heart) for laborers?<\/p>\n<p>Who do you know that isn\u2019t saved, family member, friend, co-worker, etc\u2026.  Now imagine them in the Lake of Fire for all eternity. To think of their fate should cause your heart to feel what Jesus felt looking at those people.  He knew that He was the Divine Shepherd they needed and without Him they would perish on the Day of Judgment. Laborers would need to go to them for the crop will be plentiful; many people will be ready to be &#8220;reaped&#8221; into the kingdom. Luke (10:3) writes of this account but adds that Jesus said, \u201cGo! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.\u201d He told them not only to pray, but also to GO thus beginning to answer the very prayer they were to pray. \u201cWe all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.\u201d A.W. Pink said, \u201cIt is true that [many] are praying for worldwide revival.  But it would be more timely, and more scriptural, for prayer to be made to the Lord of the harvest, that He would raise up and trust forth laborers who would fearlessly and faithfully preach those truths which are calculated to bring about a revival.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Application:  Look at the shepherd-less (the unsaved) both those you know and the stranger and see them through Christ\u2019s eyes.  By compassion PRAY and GO, they need you NOW!

It has been said to be a gift by many, but yet God left if off the list. To me the very essence of evangelism in one word would be the word love. Why the word love, because love is from God.  1 John 4:7 reads, \u201cDear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.\u201d We are to love one another, which is the very thing that attracted many in times past to Christianity. I believe it was St. Augustine that said of Christians \u201cOh, how they love one another,\u201d which was instrumental in bringing him to know Christ. John shows us that the world needs to see us genuinely loving each other as the body of Christ. However, like Emeril, Jesus took it up a notch saying, \u201cYou have heard that it has been said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;\u2026\u201d (Matt 5).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We are to love our enemies, and who are they? Ultimately our enemies are the same as God\u2019s enemies which are unbelievers. Isn\u2019t that a bit harsh, to call all non-believers our enemies? Romans 2:5 says, \u201cBut because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God\u2019s wrath, when His righteous judgment will be revealed. God \u201cwill give to each person according to what he has done.\u201d If we love them will we not have compassion on them because we don\u2019t want to see them consumed by God\u2019s great wrath? <\/p>\n<p>Paul reminds us \u201cFor as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon all (Romans 11:30-32).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Many may run to Ephesians 4:11 which speaks of God giving some to be \u201c\u2026evangelists.\u201d However this speaks of a ministry leader in a role to equip the saints, for the work of the ministry, evangelism (soul winning in our context), for the edifying of the body of Christ:  \u201cOften Christians pass off their responsibility to reach out to the lost by saying that it\u2019s not their \u201cgifting.\u201d However, there is no such thing as the \u201cgift of evangelism.\u201d That\u2019s like saying, \u201cHe has the gift of feeding starving children.\u201d It is not a gift. Rather, he has love enough to take food to the hungry.

Lastly, but equally important is the application of the blood covering to the &#8220;big toes of their right feet,&#8221; so that the sanctified walk of the priests would be examples to the people.  What priest walked here on earth in perfect righteousness? Hebrews tells us, \u201cSuch a high priest [Jesus] meets our need\u2014one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens (7:26). A priest offers sacrifice on behalf of the people, and Jesus offered His very life to be the sacrifice as well. The many former OT priests died, \u2018But this man [Jesus] because He continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood\u2026 \u201cWho needs not daily, as those high priests to offer sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people\u2019s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself (5:10; 7:24,27).\u201d Jesus didn\u2019t only offer the sacrifice as the priest, He was the sacrifice once and for all which is why he said, \u201cIt is finished on the cross.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Jesus walked in righteousness as a priest proclaiming that He Himself came for this very purpose as He said, \u201cFor the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.\u201d If we are to walk in righteousness the blood of Christ needs to be applied to our big toe and the rest of our foot because God tells us, \u201cHow beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!\u201d If we truly walk in righteousness our feet will be carrying us to preach the good news.\u201d  \u201cBut now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference\u2026\u201d The Law and the prophets walked in righteousness to bring spoken testimony and point to Christ. Only faith in Christ can bring about God\u2019s righteousness. The Law doesn\u2019t make us righteous, it doesn\u2019t help us, and rather it leaves us helpless with the need to throw ourselves at the feet of the Savior.  After now being born again by the Holy Spirit, and realizing that \u201c\u2026you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God\u20261 Peter 2:9, we need to present our lives as living sacrifices to reach the lost for Christ. The lost need desperately to have the blood of the Savior applied to their sins to be redeemed from the curse of the Law of sin and death. God has left that mission to you and me to do.  \u201cWe are therefore Christ\u2019s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us (2 Cor. 5:20).\u201d  \u201cTo them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Col 1:27).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Application: Do you have the blood of Christ applied to your toe, and are your feet mobilized to go seek and save the lost. Are your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace (Eph 6:15)? If you want to be used by God then move those feet that God gave you for Him and His glory. \u201cSatan prefers 1,000,000 choir members or pew-warmers to one Christian who is prepared to obey the command to preach the Gospel (Ray Comfort)\u201d  Many believers have their feet stuck it seems when it\u2019s time for obeying our mission to seek and save the lost because of all the excuses and a lack of zeal and urgency. To bring common ground many have said \u201che puts his pants on one leg at a time. However there is one group, they put their pants on two legs at a time.  Firefighters live with a sense of urgency, because they must respond to the alarm that they must GO or people will die.  How much more truthful can that reality be for the Christians.

Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet\u2026  (Exodus 29:19-20)<\/p>\n<p>First we examined this verse and how the blood was applied to the ear lobe of the high priest Aaron and his sons. Second the blood was applied to the thumb on their right hand. What was so significant about that?, we\u2019ll I\u2019m glad you were pondering.  Remember Peter wrote, \u201cBut you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God\u20261 Peter 2:9). The priests were spiritual leaders and therefore performed priestly duties. As the ear was the organ that hears the Word of God, the thumbs were the organs by which the mediatorial work was to be performed on behalf of the people. There was certainly a right and a wrong way to serve God and God\u2019s people. In Leviticus 10 we read of how two of Aarons four sons Nadab and Abihu, profaned the sanctuary with strange fire and actually died before the Lord (vv.1-3). Judgment was very harsh for these two men, but no more so than it was for Ananias and Sapphira when the Christian church was just beginning (Acts 5). One needs to remember that \u201cto whom more is given, more is required\u201d; and Aaron and the congregation needed to know that God was real and that the priests were not playing a religious game. <\/p>\n<p>Peter reminds us that as Christians we are all priests.  And in light of that, Paul instructs us, \u201cTherefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God\u2019s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God\u2014this is your spiritual act of worship.\u201d I\u2019ve always loved this verse, but there is a deep challenge within its words. A dead sacrifice can\u2019t move, but a living sacrifice can crawl off the altar when God asks us to do something that our flesh rises up against. We are to give our lives to the Lord on the \u201caltar of sacrifice\u201d in simplest terms, by actively serving Him in ministry through the local church. We are to serve the Lord out of pure motives, and not out of selfish ambitions or vain conceit. This is why Paul tells us \u201cExamine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith\u2026, as he did for himself (1 Cor. 9:27). There are so many believers that have so many gifts that God has invested in their lives. However each one needs to find, what I would call ministry SHAPE.  This is in an acronym for Spiritual Gifts, Heart (passion), Abilities (natural), Personality, and Experiences.  As Evans shared before in his message about \u201cDoing everything does not equal effectiveness\u201d, ministers need others to help them do the ministry. As a matter of fact Ephesians 4:11-12 reads \u201cIt was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare (equip) God\u2019s people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up.\u201d The ministry leaders are gifts to the local church, but the real ministers are to be the congregation. The ministry leader can\u2019t do it all, they are there primarily to train others to do the work of the ministry. <\/p>\n<p>Have you had the blood of Christ applied to your thumbs and found your ministry SHAPE yet? If so are you active or is ministry a spectator event for you? Can you imagine if every Christian had the biblical imperative, I was saved to serve? I can envision churches, and ministries exploding for the Lord, because He\u2019s the One that gets the credit (glory). \u201cDo not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you.\u201d 1 Timothy 4:14. The talents He\u2019s invested in our lives, He expects a return on, Are we being wicked lazy servants talked about in (Matthew 25)?<\/p>\n<p>Application: Ask a mature believer or perhaps a ministry leader to help you find your place in ministry, and serve God in that ministry.

He was a spiritual leader, and therefore both he and his sons went through a priestly ritual of being consecrated by blood.  They were to have blood applied to three of their extremities which were:  the lobe of the priest\u2019s right ear, the right thumb, and the right big toe.  Peter says, \u201cBut you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God\u20261 Peter 2:9)<\/p>\n<p>The priest\u2019s ear had blood applied to it which is the organ that hears the word of God and they were to hear only the Word of the Lord.  A spiritual leader needs to know what God is saying to them to minister unto God on behalf of the people.  Many Christians desire to spiritual leaders, but are too busy listening to all the other voices speaking in their ear.  Carmen says in His song, Not ashamed, \u201cThere\u2019s many voices in the wind, but only one that saves the soul from sin\u2026\u201d  From the media, to celebrities, to preachers, everyone wants you to listen to them.  Even Evans and I want you to hear the Word of God that He speaks through us for you in the daily devotional ministry.  However as a spiritual leader you need to make sure that you are hearing His voice to direct your life, your family, your community, and your ministry, because nothing compares to His Word to direct you.<\/p>\n<p>Recall the account in Matt 3 whereby Jesus gets baptized by John. The Lord speaks out of heaven these words, \u201cThis is my Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased.\u201d  If there was a way to encourage Jesus or warm His heart, His Father certainly did that with His few yet powerful words.  Yet just THREE verses later in Matt 4, we see another voice speaking to Jesus, Satan himself.  As a matter of fact he speaks to Jesus in three instances, and in all three instances Jesus hit the devil with the Word of God as He repeatedly stated to the devil the words, \u201cIt is written.\u201d  The enemy was relentless in trying to drown out the voice of the God the Father in the ear of His Son Jesus, but the Word of God was hidden in His heart (Psalm 119:9,11).  <\/p>\n<p>Aaron and His sons needed to have their ear tuned to God\u2019s voice. In this day and age if you are a spiritual leader, or desire to be one, then you must learn how to block out the \u201cother voices\u201d that attempt to fill your ears with ungodly temptations, and nonsense.  In Greek mythology the Siren\u2019s were beautiful half-woman, half-birdlike creatures who sang such sweet songs that listeners forgot everything and died of hunger. The Sirens were sisters who lured sailors to their death by their irresistible song causing sailors to crash upon the reefs when they try to reach the Sirens. Among those tempted were Jason on the Argo and Odysseus. Odysseus escaped from them by filling his crew&#8217;s ears with wax while he tied himself to the ship&#8217;s mast. The Argonauts were saved by Orpheus&#8217; music. The Argonauts were saved by listening to a sweeter melody, and what is sweeter than hearing the voice of our Father as the enemy tries to lead us to crash our lives upon the rocks of this world through his deceptive music.  Moses sang, \u201cThe LORD is my strength and my song\u2026.\u201d  Is God\u2019s Word that precious to you?

(Psalm 8:2)<\/p>\n<p>Sometime back on a Father\u2019s Day, I had the wonderful opportunity to see both of my dads.  Since I\u2019ve blessed by a beautiful wife, I have gained another father as well, and he has gained a son.  When I saw my biological dad we were with my sister-in-laws side of the family as well. One little girl was there named Naomi (which means pleasant or sweet) , and her mom was also present to see her dad, but this little girl\u2019s dad was not present for he left this world because of cancer, and was celebrating Father\u2019s Day with our Heavenly Father.  I suppose this little girl was very sad without her dad present, and then I noticed a dog that looked sickly and bloated.  When I asked what was wrong with the dog I was told it had cancer and only a month to live.  I thought wow this girl has loved her dad and he died, she loves her dog, and it will soon die, and I found out two other family members of hers died to cancer as well.  This could produce a very bitter and angry child toward the things of God.  However one of the most amazing things I have ever seen took place as I walked into the living room where I found this 7 year old playing her guitar singing praises to Jesus.  She wrote her own songs as she blessed everyone listening as she played, \u201cHeal me before I go,\u201d and \u201cWe all fall down,\u201d and \u201cJesus I love you so much.\u201d  I wish I could show you a video tape of this wonderful experience.  I can picture Jesus calling all the saints over, Naomi\u2019s dad, and Father God too and saying \u201cDo you hear what this child is singing?&#8221; They that are listening have read, but now they see, \u2018from the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise.\u2019\u201d  Naomi\u2019s names fits her well as her praise was both peasant and sweet to the ears of Heaven.  I cannot begin to describe the testimony I saw in this girl who understands pain, loss, suffering, and death.  Her mom shared that this little girl by the things she says brings conviction at times even to her.  No wonder Jesus said, &#8220;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&#8221; When He had placed His hands on them, He went on from there Matt 19:14-15.\u201d  Jesus surely places His almighty hand on children today.  Having at some point been a Children\u2019s Pastor for four years, I have seen God\u2019s hand on the lives of many kids.  I have seen them praise Him in tears and reverence.<\/p>\n<p>Creation seems to be silenced by the praise of children. Regardless of how the wicked assert themselves, they cannot outdo the evidence of God&#8217;s glory on earth and in heaven. It is all around us (see Rom 1:20).  The sound of children is concrete evidence of God&#8217;s fortress on earth. The sound of opposition is silenced by the babbling and chatter of children. What a contrast! What a King!<\/p>\n<p>In the verse above the children&#8217;s &#8220;Hosannas&#8221; are not being directed to God but to the Son of David, the Messiah. Jesus is therefore not only acknowledging His Messiahship but justifying the praise of the children by applying to Himself a passage of Scripture applicable only to God.  He ordained praise from children, and even though Jesus\u2019 enemies said He was not the Messiah, the children could not be silenced from crying out the truth! <\/p>\n<p>Application:  See the good gifts in the lives of children, teach them the ways of God, and allow them to be the blessing that they can be, and hinder them not from coming to Jesus and expressing themselves to Him.

You can\u2019t be both.<\/p>\n<p>Christian life is a lot like running a race or playing a game. It requires discipline, training, caching, determination and sheer hard work. There is a goal to be reached and reward to be won at the end of the race for those who win the race.<\/p>\n<p>Just as the goal of any team or individual playing a game or running a race is to win in order to receive a crown, trophy or a reward, so should be the goal of a Christian. We are called to run our race diligently here on earth so we can live victorious life and finally receive the crown that Jesus our master and chief coach has prepared for those who will win the race. There is a wonderful party planned in heaven for the winners. That is why you and I must run and fight persistently against all odds and ends, obstacles, limitations and intimidations of the devil. In our race, the enemy of our soul and a body is the Satan. He has marshaled his fallen demons to resist us on the way so we can give up and accept defeat. Well, the choice to win or be defeated is yours. God has equipped us and trained us as His children for winning. The Bible says that when you train a child in the right way to, to live and run the right way, he shall not forget when he is old (Proverbs 22:6)<\/p>\n<p>God is never a looser. His children should never be losers either. If they chose to follow in the footsteps of the Father and do what the Father teaches and has always done to win they too must win. Satan\u2019s main occupation is to defeat the believers. He can only do that if we let him. If we rise up and run tough, he has no chance of winning championship.<\/p>\n<p>Run to win. Only winners can celebrate victory. Joy is in the camp of winners. Happiness, jubilation, excitement, relaxation and relief, and expectation can only be found with the winners. Losers are gloomy, sad, disappointed, frustrated, and hopeless, in some cases.<\/p>\n<p> I remember back in 2004 NBA how Detroit Pistons won the NBA championship, beating the Lakers. Now this was unexpected. The winning team was being referred to as underdog which stood no chance of winning. But they won. What a celebration of the victory! I watched them shout, scream, jump, hug each other and kiss their trophy. Now that is the spirit of a winner and a winning team. What about you and your team? Are you winning or losing? If you are not excited, thrilled, joyous, celebrating, optimistic and happy with your life today regardless of what happens to you, you are losing the game to the devil. Rise up and play tough. Listen to the coach-the Holy Ghost. Even Jesus depended on His father and the disciples to win. You too must support and seek the support and help of other team members. You can\u2019t win a lone. Don\u2019t forget the supporters and funs who are also eager to see you win. That is why they are encouraging and cheering you to run hard and not give up.  Today, meditate on the words Paul wrote about the Christian race:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll those who compete in a race use self-control so they can win a crown. That crown is an earthly thing that lasts only a short time, but our crown will never be destroyed. So, I do not run without a goal. I fight like a boxer who is hitting something-not just the air. I treat my body hard and make it my slave so that I myself will not be disqualified after I have preached to others (1 Corinthians 9:25-27). Let us run to win!

My husband and I have been blessed to have opened our home for fellowship that my church started so that people can fellowship together in small settings. One Thursday my husband brought up a very interesting question that left me thinking. Jesus performed a lot of miracles, He was the Son of God, He could just speak and whatever He wanted came into being so why did He need to pray? Have you ever thought about this? There are so many examples in the Bible that shows Jesus prayed e.g. at the garden of Gethsemane, Matthew 26:36-38 \u201cThen Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane and He said to them, \u201cSit here while I go over there and pray.\u201d He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with Him, and He began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then He said to them, \u201cMy soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.\u201d NIV and we know the story, they didn\u2019t keep watch, they slept while Jesus prayed. What I\u2019m I trying to say here? if the Son of God knew that He needed to pray because He was overwhelmed, people were against Him, His own disciple He picked was going to betray Him, how much more should we as mortal human beings dive in prayers faithfully every day, without fail, and without slumber? Doesn\u2019t that blow your mind? He would have just stood there and said bring it on Judas, I can take it, but no He prayed. It\u2019s heart breaking when I see prayers being put at the back burners of believers\u2019 lives, they only want to come to God crying and pleading when they are in trouble or a friend or relative is in trouble but other than that they never spend time with God just to worship him, tell Him how good He has been, thank Him for all the blessings in your life, praise His name, give Him glory, seek His Kingdom first. How much more do we need to revel&#8211;to take great pleasure in, delight in, make merry, and or indulge&#8211;in God\u2019s presence?<\/p>\n<p>Point number two, Jesus came down on this earth as God\/Man so that at the appointed time He would take my place, your place on the cross for our sins so that we will not have to take that place for ourselves. He was ridiculed, mocked, spat on, beaten, they stuck a crown of thorns on His head (how painful that must have been), and nailed him on the cross so that we might be saved. He could have easily avoided all that, He could have made Himself not feel the pain and probably just go through the motions, He could have saved Himself just like the chief priests, teachers of the law, elders, and even one of the thieves that was crucified next to Him mocked Him to save Himself if He was the Son of God. He could have easily done so but He didn\u2019t. Have you ever wondered what would have been your fate if He didn\u2019t take your place on the cross? How much more should we revere that fact? How much more should it drive us to our knees, knowing that we are filthy rugs before God but He loved and loves us so much that He sent His only son to die on the cross for us? Every time I think about it, it gives me chills because I don\u2019t deserve it but He did it for me anyways and because of that I can come to Him just the way I am and He will receive me. But coming just the way I am does not mean not changing, it means whatever I or you have done in the past or are doing he is a forgiving God. Just like in John 8:1-11, he forgave that woman who was brought to Him by the teachers of the law and the Pharisees and after hearing what they had to say about this woman at the end of it all He told them in vs. 7 \u201c\u2026\u2026.If anyone of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her\u201d NIV. And of course the only one who was without sin was Jesus and what did He tell her? If no one condemned you neither do I so vs. 11\u2026\u2026.\u201dGo now and leave your life of sin\u201d NIV.

Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains\u2026 (Mt. 24:7-8).\u201d<\/p>\n<p> Recently an earthquake hit Japan which added Tsunami tragedy.  How should the church respond to such a tragedy?  First Jesus tells us that we should not be alarmed.  This does not mean that we shouldn\u2019t care, pray, weep with those who weep, or send relief to the people affected by this horrific event.  Jesus instructs us not to be alarmed because these things are a sign of the times.  Even though we don\u2019t desire these things to take place, we are reminded that these things are part of biblical prophecy, and can rest assure that our God is in control, in the midst of these times. We can\u2019t explain such an event of this nature without looking to God.  The Bible tells us that God cursed the earth because of Adam\u2019s transgression. Weeds are a curse. So is disease. Sin and suffering cannot be separated. The Scriptures inform us that we live in a fallen creation. In the beginning, God created man perfect, and he lived in a perfect world without suffering. It was heaven on earth. When sin came into the world, death and misery came with it.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, Jesus spoke these things as &#8220;the beginning of birth pains&#8221; (Matt 24:4-8; Mark 13:8). Not only men, but the whole creation groans with &#8220;the pains of childbirth&#8221; anticipating the revelation of the sons of God at the revelation of the Son (Rom 8:18-22).  Christians look forward and we\u201d\u2026wait for the blessed hope-the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.\u201d  If you\u2019ve given birth, then you understand the feeling of birth pains.  Yet think for a moment at the full picture.  God brings two people together in marriage.  Sometime later they desire children and so through love the wife becomes pregnant.  There is much excitement as the parents look forward to the birth of the child.  However during the delivery there is great pain involved, until the baby comes, and once again there is joy unspeakable as God\u2019s gift is seen in the birth.  Jesus has called those that have repented and put their trust in Him, His children.  However, we live in a time of the birth pains.<\/p>\n<p>Thirdly, because of the birth pain it caused us to look forward to the coming of Christ.  Luke 12:37 says, \u201cBlessed are those servants, whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that He shall gird Himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.\u201d  In a moment in the twinkling of an eye He\u2019ll return.  No one was ready for the unexpected Tsunami that took the lives of thousands.  But, we are commanded to have an expectant attitude for Christ\u2019s return, and it too will be sudden!  Those who understand Scripture eagerly await a new heaven and a new earth &#8220;wherein dwells righteous-ness.&#8221; In that coming Kingdom there will be no more pain, suffering, disease, or death. We are told that \u201cno eye has ever seen, nor has any ear heard, neither has any man\u2019s mind ever imagined the wonderful things that God has in store for those who love Him (1 Corinthians 2:9).\u201d  What an encouragement to us as Christians.    <\/p>\n<p>Application:  What are we to do now, just around twiddling our thumbs and wait, no way?  Be holy (1 Thes. 3:13); be zealous for the Lord anticipating His return; be confident (Eph. 6:12, Rev. 20:10); be an encouragement (1 Thes. 4:16-18); and be mobilized telling others of His imminent return. The Scripture tells us, \u201cAnd this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come (Mt. 24:14).\u201d  Are you living godly?  If you or one of your loved ones are suddenly swept away by the cold hand of death, are you ready, and are they to stand before the Lord?

The question that always arises is, are we justified by grace through faith ALONE or are we justified by works; or  justified by both? To answer these questions we look at Rahab\u2019s story and how Hebrews and James address faith and works in light of her story.<\/p>\n<p>Rahab the harlot hid two spies in her house sent by Joshua to spy their land Jericho (Joshua 2). In the early chapter, you find that the two spies come in and she hides them. While the king looked for them in her house even questioning her, she lies to the king that they came but have left to which they pursue them. Later she releases them to go their way but before then in vs. 8, she says, \u201cI know that the LORD has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of you. 10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. 11 And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath. 12 Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my father\u2019s house, and give me a true token, 13 and spare my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The bible talks about her works first vs. 1-7, then we read about her faith in vs. 8-13.Now that we\u2019ve seen her works and her faith, the question to ask would be, which is which? What was she justified for? The writer of Hebrews tells us that \u201cBy faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace\u201d, Hebrews 11:31 and then we read in James 2: 24, \u201cYou see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. 25 Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way? Sounds like a contradiction doesn\u2019t it? Hebrews says she is justified by faith apart from works but  James seems to say that she is justified by works.<\/p>\n<p>There is no contradiction here; there is a harmony we need to identify. Hebrews talks about justification by faith, James then comes along and shows us that a person justified by faith will evidence their faith by works. In other words, a justifying faith cannot be without works. It\u2019s faith that is producing works, not the other way around.  This is why it\u2019s not Faith PLUS works or faith AND works. It\u2019s faith THAT works or faith AT work, a great difference. Yes Rahab hid the spies but that is not what she is justified by, it\u2019s her faith in the God of the Israelites evidenced by her works when she shows kindness to the spies.<\/p>\n<p>If she was justified by works, then she has something to boast of, Romans 3:27,\u201dWhere is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith. 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Rahab&#8217;s conduct proved her faith to be living, or having power; it showed that she believed with her heart, not merely by an assent of the understanding. Rahab the harlot, who was proved by her works that she was justified by a true faith<\/p>\n<p>This is very crucial to salvation, why? Because of Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201c8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast\u201d. This is where true Christianity is different from other religions that teach you must earn your way, you must work to be saved, and you must pay your dues. True salvation and only salvation requires receiving Christ by grace through faith apart from works. He has given it freely as a gift. A gift you don\u2019t work for or earn, you receive it as offered. Then when you have truly been saved, the genuine of your faith will be evidenced by works. So you don\u2019t do works to be saved, you do works because you are saved.<\/p>\n<p>Are you trusting in your good works to be used to justify (save) you? Or are you trusting in your good works and faith to save you? If any of these applies to you, then you cannot be justified. But if you come to God in repentance and faith, you will be justified through His finished work on the cross. Romans 5:1, \u201cTherefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d. And if you are not justified by faith, you are not at peace with God. That means you are at war, an enemy of God through wicked works (Colossians 1:21). See what camp you are in today move to the right camp if you haven\u2019t already.

He struck down two of Moab&#8217;s best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian&#8217;s hand and killed him with his own spear. Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men. He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.<\/p>\n<p>Benaiah was a valiant fighter, and certainly excelled greatly in his duty.  He performed GREAT exploits, as they are listed.  He took on fierce opponents, a lion, and even with only having a club, disarmed an Egyptian warrior and killed the man with his own spear.  He became as famous as the three mighty men, held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but not included among the Three, even though David promoted him by placing him in charge of his bodyguard.  What did the Three do that Benaiah didn\u2019t do?  Well let\u2019s look at their story.<\/p>\n<p>David longed for water and said, &#8220;Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!&#8221; So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD. &#8220;Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?&#8221; And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.2 Sam 23:15-17<\/p>\n<p>David was the King that had a desire, water.  He didn\u2019t give a command, he didn\u2019t make his request part of his men\u2019s job description, and he didn\u2019t have an expectation that these three men should take up the task of his \u201ccraving\u201d for water from Bethlehem.  King David was in the line of Jesus Christ as reads in Matt 1:1 \u201cA record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham:\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Three mighty men<\/p>\n<p>Out of loyal to David these men went well beyond \u201cthe call of duty.\u201d  They were brave and courageous with only three of them breaking through the host of the Philistine army after their twelve mile journey to get there.  These men had to break through enemy lines, the Philistine garrison (outpost) in Bethlehem, retrieved the water, and brought it back to David.  These men were not commissioned to do this task.  They sacrificed their very lives not to gain clout or merit, not to be in the Israeli hall of fame, and not even to advance the victory for their army.  Note, these men had one thing on their minds, to bring some water for their king!  Why, because this is what would please the King.  With loyalty and honor they risked their lives, \u201ccounting their lives worth nothing,\u201d just to please the King to which they longed to do, even putting themselves in \u201cdeath\u2019s way,\u201d.   Haggai 1:8 reads, \u201cGo up into the mountains and bring down timber and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,&#8221; says the LORD\u201d.  God is our King and desires me to please Him!<\/p>\n<p>While Benaiah certainly excelled in his duty, and was promoted as such, the Three went above and beyond the call of duty just to please their King.<\/p>\n<p>Application:  Are you excelling for God, or are you going above and beyond your call of duty?  What is your call of duty you ask?  \u201cHe has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God\u201d (Mic 6:8). Be that loyal husband, devoted father, committed ministry leader.

Writer of books, those seeking elections, those who work on projects associate themselves with people who believe in them to endorse them and their products. They write forwards for their books, do commercials for them. They don\u2019t just pick anyone to endorse them, they pick people who are known, reputable, have credentials etc.<\/p>\n<p>In this verse, we meet Demas. You may have heard his name or hearing it for the first time. Here we find Apostle Paul writing to his son in the faith final thoughts while hoping to see him shortly. In this writing, he brings Timothy up to date on the spiritual condition, activities and whereabouts of certain men and women who either helped or harmed his ministry.<\/p>\n<p>We have to start by knowing who Demas was and how his life is applicable in our generation. Demas had been one of Paul\u2019s close associates along with Luke and Epaphras. He had ministered alongside of Paul on many occasions but it appears that as time went by, something in him began to change. While Paul gave updates and seal of approval on everyone, he says, \u201c2Timothy 4: 9 \u201cBe diligent to come to me quickly; 10 for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica\u201d, Demas though little is known of him, he is a presentation of many in our today\u2019s Christianity<\/p>\n<p>A question that arises at this moment is, was Demas a believer or a false convert. He forsook and left Paul to embrace the present world. It is not said that Demas had ceased to be a Christian publicly renouncing the Lord; but it was not in his heart to bear the cross with the apostle. I think he loved comfort, he loved the easy going life, could have also loved money.  He loved what following Christ did for him as long as he did not have to suffer for Christ. He started well but then changed course. He began to be influenced,  shaped, and drawn to the world. This is how Lot ended up in Sodom. He started by pitching his tent facing Sodom and before long he was living in Sodom.<\/p>\n<p>If you hooked up with Paul, you had better buckle up for a bumpy ride for he faced things like persecution, shipwreck, imprisonment etc. Demas may have not counted the cost of genuine commitment of following Christ. Today we would call it easy believing, exactly what is being preached by many out here. Preaching that promises heaven on earth, preaching that does not talk about bearing the cross, putting the hand on the plow and not looking back. Preaching that says come to Christ without your life being changed. Churches that appeal to men rather than God by creating worldly atmosphere, using worldly gimmicks and techniques to draw people in. Turning away from the power of prayer and the power of the God through the gospel to power of suggestion and before long, Demases are created who may be out of Egypt but Egypt is not completely out of them.<\/p>\n<p>We therefore must examine ourselves as to whether we are being drawn back to the world, maybe not by the people of the world but by those who name the name of Christ and are using His name to cause people to drift. Paul in 2Corinthians 13: 5 writes \u201cExamine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?\u2014unless indeed you are disqualified. 6 But I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified\u201d. He is not talking about what someone did at the point of salvation but what someone is doing now. What we are doing now will determine what happened on that day we became believers. Lamentations 3:40, \u201cLet us search out and examine our ways, And turn back to the LORD; 41 Let us lift our hearts and hands To God in heaven\u201d, Isaiah 8:19, \u201cAnd when they say to you, \u201cSeek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter,\u201d should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living?<\/p>\n<p>If we are to stay on course, we must consider our ways. We must examine ourselves to be sure we are not drifting back. We must be careful who we allow to speak into our lives especially preachers if we are to make it till the end. No one wants to come this far only to wreck their faith because of what they allowed in their lives. One preacher cried out to God saying, \u201cLord don\u2019t let me wreck my ship (life) as I\u2019m getting closer to the harbor\u201d. What became of Demas, there is a great indication in Colossian 4:14 that Demas was restored. Are you a Demas today who needs to be restored? Consider your ways, examine yourself and see if you be in the faith.

For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And you are complete in Him&#8221; (Colossians 2:6,8,9a)<\/p>\n<p>The title of this devotion almost doesn&#8217;t make sense.  How can you have Christianity without Christ.  That is like having the sun without light.  Yet listen to the words of General William Booth Founder Salvation Army as he stated &#8220;The chief danger of the 20th century will be&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;Religion without the Holy Spirit; Christianity without Christ; Salvation without regeneration<\/p>\n<p>Forgiveness without Repentance; Politics without God; and Heaven without Hell.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p> Does this not sound like our nation and world today?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As we first received the Lord Jesus, so we continue to walk in the Lord Jesus. Receiving Christ is the Gate, but walking in Him as we have received Him is the Path. The Gate is an event, while the Path is a process. The Gate is for entering, while the Path is for walking.\u201d Chip Brogden. Why do we need to make sure that Christ is kept in Christianity, see the following reasons.<\/p>\n<p>We are called by God Himself to have a love relationship with Christ! Deuteronomy 6:4-5 says, &#8220;Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God the Lord is one!  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mankind has fallen into sin by breaking God\u2019s Law and out of relationship with God. Romans 3:10-11 says, &#8220;There is none righteous, no, not one; There is none who understands; There is none who seeks after God.  They have all turned aside; They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Many Christians have moved from an intimate love relationship with God to a platonic relationship.  (no intimacy)  A relationship based upon intellect and lacking in love. Matthew 24:3;12 &#8220;Jesus said that at the \u2018end of the age\u2019 that lawlessness will abound, and the love of many will grow cold&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The church of Ephesus was rebuked for losing their love and blinded to the truth of their spiritual own condition.  They were sick and didn\u2019t know it. In Revelation 2:4 Jesus said, &#8220;Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.  Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and remove your lamp stand from its place-unless you repent&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The 21st century church needs to take warning and guard against becoming a \u201cloveless\u201d church.  We must be careful that we don\u2019t live a \u201cChrist-less Christianity\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Application:  If God had a meter of how much you loved Him based on John 14:21 how well do you feel that you will do?<\/p>\n<p>Blessings, Pastor Phil and Pastor Dave<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.

Abominable sin is now called an \u201calternative lifestyle\u201d, and the big name preachers are busy getting rich. Who will go for Us, God asks, whom shall I send? What will we each respond?

I pray we will embrace the cross, allowing it to change us from the inside out, I pray we will burn within our hearts with a desire to live for Jesus, to be conformed into His image each day. I pray we will see the Heavenly vision. Jesus gives us a blessed promise in Matthew 5:6, please hear this, \u201c Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.\u201d Hallelujah, what a glorious promise to all who would abandon their lives and seek Him by faith. But to be filled, we must first be emptied, we must pour out our lives before Him in prayer, hungering for righteousness. Friends, this is the only way, for there is great deception coming over our land. The laws are changing, the gospel is no longer being preached, the church is not representing God any longer. Abominable sin is now called an \u201calternative lifestyle\u201d, and the big name preachers are busy getting rich. Who will go for Us, God asks, whom shall I send? What will we each respond? Jesus asked His disciples the same thing in John 6:67-68. Many of His followers had just left because they were unwilling, and He asks the twelve, \u201cDo you also want to go away?\u201d Peter replies, \u201cLord to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life\u201d Amen, He has the words of eternal life. Do not listen to the popular message all around you, shut it all out, hear the voice of God, hunger and thirst for Him, be filled.<\/p>\n<p>In His love always, and in His service, blessings Brother Ben<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Matthew 23:37- \u201cO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!

In other words, his faith in God. Vs24 says, \u201cBy faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, 25 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin\u201d, What age was this, the age of awareness, the age of accountability. He may have begun to evaluate things, realizing that something was not right with the setup; a glamorous life (not putting God first), idolatry. Based on what he was taught, he was able to distinguish right from wrong. To make this point clear, let\u2019s read what Paul tells Timothy a young man who was his son in faith, 2 Timothy 3:15, \u201c..and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus\u201d. What he was taught did not save him; it prepared him for the Savior. It instructed him to the One who would save him. Here we see that the instructions Moses received made him wise unto salvation.<\/p>\n<p>There are parents who encourage and even push their children to be successful in life but minimally or neglect to instruct their children on the things of God which is crucial to make them wise for salvation. With this I mean, they would rather have their children succeed academically, financially etc but do very little to instill Godly values in their lives that they would one day come under conviction and abandon Egypt and it\u2019s pride and embrace Christ. They can be successful and they should but their call to follow Christ is priority. Everything else centers on that call. When they become of age, they become accountable for the life they live and for that reason; their faith in God is what will save them not their parent\u2019s faith. I see parents whose children are saved and serving the Lord beam.<\/p>\n<p>Paul pursued things in life but upon his conversion his primary desires changed, he later says Philippians 3: 7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you have to realize, Moses was partly raised in a palace as prince only to be used in the dessert as a shepherd. We tend to expect that someone would start in the desert and make it to the palace, not with Moses. He had a call in his life, he separated himself for that call.<\/p>\n<p>The writer of Hebrews adds this line vs. 26 \u201cesteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward\u201d. To quote B. W. Johnson&#8217;s Bible Commentary, \u201cAny reproach endured through faith in the promises of which Christ was the center and sum, was called the reproach of Christ. This reproach, though men might shrink from it, was really of more value permanently than the treasures of Egypt, because he looked forward to the recompense, the heavenly blessings. 27. By faith he forsook Egypt. The Exodus was all an achievement of faith. It was faith that made Moses disdain the king&#8217;s wrath. He endured, as seeing him who is invisible. The unseen God was present with him by faith and his support gave strength to endure all\u201d, For the sake of the call may we have faith for our children to be saved, teach them Holy Scriptures, teach them priorities and when they become of age, they will be candidates for grace. We pray and hope they turn to Christ by faith, trust and live for Him.

Moses was born at a time Pharaoh was determined to kill newborn boys born to the Israelites. And Hebrews 11: 23, says \u201cBy faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king\u2019s command\u201d. When Moses was born, his parents Amram and Jochebed by faith saw something unique about him and entrusted him in the hands of the Lord in the midst of his life being in danger. This was not Moses\u2019 faith but his parent\u2019s faith that would influence him down the road. They hid him three months, when they could no longer, they set him in a basket around the enemies\u2019 territory trusting God to take care of him.  This reminds us of the Son of God who when He was born, his life as an infant was already a threat to Herod for He was a king. Could it be possible that Pharaoh already sensed that there would be a deliverer to be born the reason he killed young boys? Perhaps.<\/p>\n<p>This is a picture of the threat the enemy senses when a child is born in a Christian family and the parents dedicate him\/her to the Lord for his service.  By all means, his mission to destroy that life is from the start. For this reason, parents ought to be diligent in protecting their children by God\u2019s given wisdom and strength but at the same time and most importantly, entrust them in the hands of the Lord to keep them through the dangers of life by prayers.<\/p>\n<p>The first faith was the faith of his parents for him. The next faith would be his personal faith in God. Every child that becomes of age of understanding must have faith in God for themselves to be saved and not live on the parent\u2019s faith. And this is a duty each parent must instill in their children on how to personally have faith in God (salvation). Moses was discovered by Pharaoh\u2019s daughter but raised by Moses\u2019 mother at the suggestion of Miriam his sister. There is no indication that Pharaoh\u2019s daughter knew that Jochebed was Moses\u2019 mother. I can imagine that as Moses was being raised by his mother and father mostly likely not knowing that these were his real parents. He was taught what was right, taught about the God of the Israelites, how to please Him, hope for the future deliverance, faithfulness, self-denial, sacrificial living, hard work, fighting for your brothers etc, Proverbs 22: 6, \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not depart from it\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The mission was to raise him to be a prince in Pharaoh\u2019s kingdom, his parents raised him different. The task ahead of the parents is huge and scary. Can God who has given the parents the children be entrusted with them while living in the Egypt of this world. Having faith in God for their children, trusting God to give them wisdom, courage, ability to provide for their children while raising them for the sake of the call till they become of age to make that decision for themselves?

And he went out, not knowing where he was going\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The journey of faith is simply taking God at His word even when it does not make sense. Its awaiting God\u2019s timing without doubting His love. It\u2019s pushing a rock you\u2019ve been asked to push knowing you could never move it but taking comfort that a bigger hand will move it so you push anyway. And here we find the faith of Abraham, the friend of God, and father of the faithful with a series of events and times that required taking God at His word.<\/p>\n<p>This journey of faith begins with Abraham flowing to Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Abraham&#8217;s faith is celebrated for his obedience to the divine call, quitting the country where he was, and going where he knew not. Leaving a land he knew his way around, surrounded by people he knew to anew land he knows no one but trusting God to lead him. This was an effectual call, by which he was converted from the idolatry of his father&#8217;s house, Gen. 12:1. This call was renewed after his father&#8217;s death.<\/p>\n<p>Hebrews 11:8. Highlights Sarah&#8217;s faith which lay in receiving strength through it to conceive, bear, and bring forth a child when past age, which was, founded upon the faithfulness of a promising God; hence from Abraham, by her, through promised son Isaac sprung a large posterity, like the stars of the sky, and the sand on the sea shore.<\/p>\n<p>Going back to Abraham, he was told to leave his land to a land God would show him. By God\u2019s promise at an old age, he received a son Isaac again taking God at His word. Not only that, by faith he was willing to sacrifice his son at God\u2019s command knowing that God would raise his son. Some of the things he had to deal with were pretty hard to receive but He did. Even some of the promises given to him, he would not live to see but he embraced them by faith. Sojourning in the promised land, as in a strange one, in which Isaac and Jacob dwelt with him in tents. Looking by faith for the heavenly city built by the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>What do we learn from Abraham, the father of faith? Faith can lay hold of blessings at a great distance, can make them present, can love them and rejoice in them, though strangers; as saints, whose home is heaven; as pilgrims, travelling toward their home.<\/p>\n<p>God calls his people to an inheritance: by his effectual call he makes them children, and so heirs.  This inheritance is not immediately possessed by them; they must wait some time for it: but the promise is sure, and shall have its seasonable accomplishment.  Also to mention something profound, the faith of parents often procures blessings for their posterity. Have faith in God, have faith in God for your children. Take God at His word, go where He sends you, birth what He has promised in His time, duplicate your faith in others especially you immediate love ones if you have kids, be faithful till the end.

Noah was a preacher of righteousness 2Peter 2:5, Genesis 6:5, says \u201c&#8230;the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually\u201d. This is one of the strongest and clearest statements about man\u2019s sinful nature, sin beginning in the thought-life. The people of Noah\u2019s day were exceedingly wicked inside out, and right in the midst, we are told about Noah\u2019s righteousness Gen 6:8, \u201cBut Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Because he was righteous, the Lord set His grace to preserve his life, family and those who would listen to his prophetic message. He was to build an ark in God\u2019s way as a means of salvation. Noah was a mighty good ship builder, however his main occupation wasn&#8217;t ship building, it was preaching. If you read his account, you discover he was a terrible failure as a preacher by today\u2019s standards. His wife and three children and their wives are all he had. 7 converts in 120 years of preaching, you wouldn&#8217;t call that particularly effective in our day as people think. Yet he is honored because of his obedience and faithfulness to complete a task that seamed foolish and untimely by faith. Gen 6:22, \u201cthus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did\u201d. It had not rained so why would anyone listen to him? He was ridiculed, made fun of but still for 120 years he preached faithfully never changing the message. Matthew 24:38, \u201cFor as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark\u201d. The people in Noah\u2019s day are the same we see today and we as the Noah\u2019s of today must heed to the warning and warn others too.<\/p>\n<p>What do we learn from Noah, a man of faith? We are to do God\u2019s work God\u2019s way. We are to preach the full counsel of God (sin, law, righteousness, holiness, judgment, repentance, and hell) faithfully to our loved ones and those we come in contact with even when it appears there are no signs. Noah&#8217;s faith influenced his practice; it moved him to prepare an ark. We are called to be co-laborers with God in reaching lost wicked souls destined to hell when His wrath is poured on them on judgment day. I know in our generation there are people even believers who don\u2019t believe in God\u2019s wrath that leads people to hell. They say if God is love, how can he send anyone to hell? God is love; He loves righteousness and must punish sin. A good judge must serve justice, if he turns a blind eye to a crime, he is corrupt himself.<\/p>\n<p>The bad news of our depravity highlights the good news of the gospel the reason we ALL must preach. Paul Washer says, \u201cThe cross is magnificent when it&#8217;s painted in the back drop of our depravity` When you refuse to teach on the radical depravity of men it is an impossibility that you bring glory to God, his Christ and his cross because the cross of Jesus Christ and the glory thereof is most magnified when it is placed in front of the backdrop of our depravity. .., we are afraid to tell men of their wickedness and they can never love God because of it..\u201d This is why we must do God\u2019s work, God\u2019s way if men are to make it safely to the ark of salvation. Yes there will be rejection, but they are not rejecting us, they are rejecting God. Also when we share the gospel, it\u2019s a win win situation whether it\u2019s received or not.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household\u201d.  Noah walked with the Lord and worked with and for the Lord. May we heed to the warning moved by godly fear and prepare the ark for the saving of our households and many because we are destined to do God\u2019s work, God\u2019s way in obedience by faith.

They attest to the value of living by faith. They compose \u201cA cloud of witnesses\u2026\u201d, Hebrews 21:1 who give powerful testimony to the Hebrews that they should come to faith in God\u2019s truth in Christ.<\/p>\n<p>Who qualifies to be a saint? Is it a believer who has been dead for a long long time? No, a saint is anyone who has repented and trusted Christ alone for their eternal salvation, and it\u2019s evidenced with their daily living. Enoch was one of the old saints in the beginning. It\u2019s interesting that in Genesis 5, as Adam\u2019s genealogy is recorded, very little is told of each person. You read of their names, how long they lived, who they begat. In vs. 21, we are told the same about Enoch, however, the writer pauses to talk a little bit more about Enoch. The bible says in vs. 22, \u201c\u2026, Enoch walked with God three hundred years\u2026\u201d. Twice in the same chapter it\u2019s stressed that he walked with God. He is the first saint who never tasted death, vs. 24, \u201cAnd Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him\u201d to continue his walk in heaven with God. We are then told of this hall a famer in Hebrews 11:5, that \u201c\u2026for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God\u201d. What a testimony.<\/p>\n<p>How did he please God, Hebrews 11:6,  tells us \u201cBut without faith it is IMPOSSIBLE to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him\u201d, He had faith and that faith propelled him to be a seeker of God, for that reason God rewarded him, gave him eternal life. To walk with God, he had intimate relationship, he pursued after God, and he lived for one purpose, the glory of God, making His name great in this world. And because of his walk with God, he did not see death, he was translated. This is so with saints of today, Jesus said, \u201cAnd whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die\u201d, John 11:26. To know God, to please God is to be in His word, to feed on the bread of life and live eternally, John 6:51, \u201cI am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Enoch had the evidence of it in his own conscience, and the Spirit of God witnessed with his spirit. Those who by faith walk with God in a sinful world are pleasing to him, and he will give them marks of his favor, and put honor upon them. 1 Corinthians 15:22, \u201cFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive\u201d, Romans 6:11, \u201cLikewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>How is your walk with the Lord today? Is it on and off? Here is a man for 300 years, not 300days, or 300 months, 300 years walked with God (pleased God) with his lifestyle (word, thought and deeds), this is the testimony he left with us.

Based on the style, vocabulary, the message some have suggested that it could have been Paul among others, but many would disagree. Regardless of who wrote it even though God is the Author of all the books, I\u2019m amazed by the in depth richness of this book. Take Hebrews 11 for example it tells us of real ordinary people with real faith. If you read the background of these people, you learn that the Bible does not hide the scars of our heroes. What you also learn, though is that the Bible highlights their scars, it does not dwell on it. It dwells on their faith in God which is crucial.<\/p>\n<p>In talking about the heroes of faith, the writer of Hebrews by passes Adam and Eve and begins with Abel. Abel, one of the first saints, and the first martyr for religion, of all the sons of Adam, one who lived by faith, and died for it, and therefore a fit pattern for the Hebrews to imitate. Observe this; the writer highlights Abel\u2019s faith though we have very little account about him in Genesis 4 and later in the NT. The conversation the Lord had with Cain after He rejected his sacrifice suggests that God had given Abel and Cain very clear instructions of what to do. Only Abel followed through what was required of them. Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice, the firstlings of his flock, implying both a confession of what his own sins deserved, and a desire of sharing in the great atonement. He offered in obedience by faith, giving the Lord what He required, a sacrifice God would receive by causing fire to fall on it, which would then rise in smoke as a sweet essence, a fragrance, aroma the Lord would smell. It was also a picture of the Lamb of God who would be slain for sinful mankind and give life to those who repent and have faith in Him.<\/p>\n<p>What legacy did he leave\u201d \u2026 and through it he being dead still speaks\u201d, good men die, and some of them die a violent death, as did Abel, yet he speaks in the Scriptures. He is the first one to teach us that a man is justified by faith alone apart from works. It\u2019s not the sacrifice that he is commended for, it\u2019s his obedient faith. His faith was evidenced by works. Through the faith he left a testimony to all succeeding generations that a person comes to God by faith to receive righteousness.<\/p>\n<p>What do we learn from Abel? Let me draw from Matthew Henry\u2019s commentary, \u201c (1.) Witness that he was righteous, a justified, sanctified, and accepted person; this, very probably, was attested by fire from heaven, kindling and consuming his sacrifice. (2.) God gave witness to the righteousness of his person, by testifying his acceptance of his gifts. When the fire consumed the offering, it was a sign that the mercy of God accepted the offerer for the sake of the great sacrifice. (3.) By it he, being dead, yet speaks. He had the honor to leave behind him an instructive speaking case; and what does it speak to us? What should we learn from it? [1.] That fallen man has leave to go in to worship God, with hope of acceptance. [2.] That, if our persons and offerings be accepted, it must be through faith in the Messiah. [3.] That acceptance with God is a peculiar and distinguishing favor. [4.] That those who obtain this favor from God must expect the envy and malice of the world. [5.] That God will not suffer the injuries done to his people to remain unpunished, nor their sufferings unrewarded. These are very good and useful instructions, and yet the blood of sprinkling speaketh better things than that of Abel. [6.] That God would not suffer Abel&#8217;s faith to die with him, but would raise up others, who should obtain like precious faith; and so he did in a little time; for in the next verse we read\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself, what will be written of you when you leave this world? What legacy, what testimony will you leave behind? Would you still speak while you are gone? Besides that, if we were to ask everyone around you about what is precious to you, would they say Jesus primarily? The One whom you love you talk about a lot everywhere. And what we leave behind, we loved the Lord, we lived by faith, and we testified of it.

And the Lord said to him, &#8220;You are old, advanced in years, and there remains very much land yet to be possessed&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>To sum up life in one word, I would say life is &#8220;INTERESTING&#8221;. Life is full of series of emotions. It\u2019s full of surprises and can be complicated if made complicated. Some people are fed up with life and they don&#8217;t see a reason to live anymore. We know of people who either tried suicide and those who have succeeded (lost life). Hopelessness drives many to think suicide. You may have never thought of it but besides you, where you work, where you hang out, someone has thought of committing suicide or has tried but failed. Children that are aborted are lives taken away before time and it&#8217;s because of the way it\u2019s looked at, a life affecting another life. Life is full of ups and downs, it&#8217;s like roller coasters, at times it moves so fast down the hill, at times it climbs the hill slower; at times it puts you upside down, at times everything spins leaving you with so much to deal with. You grow up full of dreams and desires but as you face the real life, all those dreams and desires are put to test. Life is also a series of choices we make.<\/p>\n<p>What is life? It is the time when someone exists or functions. We can tell that a person who has life is living and kicking. As long as God gives us breath, we have an opportunity to live life to the fullest for His glory. Life deals with time and time waits for no man. Yes life will be up and down, quitting may be our next option but God requires us to live to the fullest with Him on our side. He created each of us for a purpose and His plan is to fulfill that purpose in this life. Joshua lived a life full of battles, from the beginning the Lord had made a promise to him of His presence to Joshua through his life. In Joshua 12, you find that Joshua fought many battles with God\u2019s help overcoming every strong battle that stood in his way. Now he is old and stricken but God says\u201d\u2026 there remains very much land yet to be possessed\u201d. He lived his life to the fullest overcoming every battle that was before him. Every battle they fought, they won ready to face another one until he was old. He and many more left a legacy of life lived to the fullest with God.<\/p>\n<p>Many people in the bible lived their lives to the fullest, people like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Noah, David, Naomi to mention a few. They had their battles to fight but they refused to terminate their lives before time. They understood they were created for a reason, to live life to the fullest. When you and I know why we were created, we will live the way God had planned, our prayer and cry to the Lord is &#8220;Help us to live this life&#8221;. Looking back at how you survived school, being mocked, coming from  bad neighborhoods, disappointments, heartaches, brokenness, going without etc, these should serve as a reference that you are a survivor. If you survived them, what has made you think that this too shall not pass?. I look back at my life and see what I have survived cannot be compared to what I face now. You may be outnumbered by what you have to face and deal with, but the same God who started your life knew enough pressure you could handle in this life therefore trusted you with it knowing that it would not destroy you as long as He is in control. In the long run looking back, I can see why the battle had to be present.<\/p>\n<p>As long as the body has life even in the worse conditions, the doctors try their best to save it. The person could be bleeding to death and many could be losing hope but they will still try everything that they can to bring that life back because it has a purpose. A purpose to be accepted, loved, give the same to other people. It&#8217;s your life surrounded by people affected by it. For those who remember I believe in 1987 when a little girl Jessica in Texas fell into an open well. She was alive in that well and there were experts who brought all their equipment to help save that life. For about 58 hours the work was on, the situation looked tougher and tougher as the little girl was trapped in that well. They had microphone lowered into the well to assist in hearing her, they created a devises to communicate with her, encourage her, sang her favorite songs, gave her hope while in the well meanwhile, they continued to struggled to find ways to rescue her. Volunteers who went down the well to dig, came back up exhausted, fainting in need of medical attention but couldn&#8217;t give up for there was a life to be saved, a life that needed to live to the fullest. What a celebration it was that after those many hours, the girl was rescued. Though life is tough, life is precious and with God on your side, you can look at it differently as an opportunity to live for God. &#8220;Because He lives, I can face tomorrow; Because He lives, all fears are gone; Because I know, that He owns the future, and LIFE IS WORTH A LIVING, just because He lives&#8221;. Before He takes me home, I have a life to live. Blessings Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Joshua 13:1, &#8220;Now Joshua was old, advanced in years.

For even sinners love those who love them. 33 And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. 34 And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much back. 35 But love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and evil. 36 Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful\u201d Have a blessed weekend, Blessings Ev!!!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Kings 6:8-23, &#8220;And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them&#8221; As we conclude, we see that Elisha who was being pursued had God blind his enemies and instead of taking advantage of the situation to revenge, he chose to be different.

If someone was pursuing you then all of a sudden something happens to them, they will stop pursuing you and begin to worry or attend to what had just happened to them. Here we see men who were pursuing Elisha and because they became blind, their priorities changed, they needed to be led by someone. Elisha prayed his servant\u2019s eyes would open and then he prayed that the Syrians eyes would be made blind.<\/p>\n<p>vs. 19, &#8220;Now Elisha said to them, &#8220;This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek&#8221;. But he led them to Samaria&#8221;. Very interesting if you think about it. The army knew of no man except Elisha and his servant were the only ones present with them. They knew who Elisha was the reason they came down from the mountain to capture him but their condition changed, the eyes they could see by was gone. All blind, helpless and confused seeking help and Elisha offers to bring them to the one they were seeking, the one who happens to be offering them help. Once again I believe Elisha saw beyond the natural to see that these men were misguided men who needed help and direction. Maybe no one had ever showed them kindness, love and acceptance, maybe where they came from they were trained to hate but here is an enemy who first brings them to a place where they discover they can do nothing of themselves and then offers to help them. We meet many people who at times are tough to deal with, some are family members maybe because of their attitude, character and the like and they became our enemies in one way or another. Seeing beyond the present can cause us to see that they are actually not enemies but misguided people looking for acceptance, affirmation, encouragements and love. I would rather not fight them but pray that God would blind their eyes from seeing the bad things they want to see in me and reach to that place where they become helpless and need someone to show them the way, kindness and love. Love covers multitude of sins the bible tells us. This where we ought to be different, Christ is with us and in us.<\/p>\n<p>vs. 21, &#8220;Now when the King of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, &#8220;My father, shall I kill them? shall I kill them?.. Finally Elisha led these men to Samaria to meet the king of Israel and like anyone who has an enemy and has a chance to destroy his enemy, revenge comes to mind. You have a chance to gossip, be mean, do evil and desire something worse to happen to who you would call your enemy, but you choose not to. Ever had those days when you had a chance to destroy your enemies and you came under conviction to drop your charges against them? The bible says love your enemies and that is true but at the same time we got to know the enemy we can love and the devil is not one of them to love. Vs. 22 So Elisha told the king not kill them, I can imagine what was going through this king\u2019s mind. I would imagine his disappointment but then suggesting, something like this, &#8220;well if we can&#8217;t kill them, we will make them our slaves or we will make them pay for having troubled us; how about making them suffer until they wished they were dead&#8221;. Matt 5:44, &#8220;But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you&#8221;. What a word!!!!!!<\/p>\n<p>Is it easy to forgive and love your enemies? NO but it\u2019s a key to release. Elisha at his disposal could have destroyed these men. After all they came to capture him to destroy him. Instead of rending evil for evil, he chose to do something out of the ordinary I will share as the final piece tomorrow. God with us enables us to see what we were blind to see and deal with people in ways our natural sense would not allow.

As they journeyed by boat, \u201c\u2026a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. 38 But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow\u201d Mark 4:37<\/p>\n<p>Like Elisha, Jesus knew that the moment they began crossing to the other side there was going to be a great windstorm. And knowing life threatening experience awaiting them, He went down at the bottom of the boat and  fell fast asleep. In the midst of the storm beating the boat and the water beginning to fill the boat, He was very comfortable in the storm. Instead of the disciples being encouraged by the presence of the creator (Jesus) in the boat, they panicked and became hysterical.<\/p>\n<p>Something to ponder on, how would you have dealt with the same situation? You have the storm beating and filling the boat with water while Jesus is in the boat? Would you have been like the disciples? Here are some of the things if they had thought about would have made them comfortable in the storm. 1. Jesus (God with us) was present in the boat, which alone should have been comfort to make them comfortable. 2. Did they think Jesus could drown? He was (is) God.  3. Did they think the wind had power over Him? But no, they went to find Jesus where He was a sleep and launched a complaint saying Mark 4:38, \u201c\u2026\u201cTeacher, do You not care that we are perishing?\u201d. In the midst of the storm they felt left alone hopeless and helpless with the assumption that Jesus did not care. Jesus cared that\u2019s why He was present right in the midst of the storm with them. HIS PRESENCE ALONE WAS ENOUGH WITHOUT HIS ACTS.   When they woke Him up from the sleep, He dealt with the situation. He said, \u201cPeace, be still\u201d.  The storm was not defeated when He spoke, it was defeated the moment He was present in the boat with them.<\/p>\n<p>This should be an encouragement to us that when Jesus is in this boat (US), we can never sink and drown simply because He cannot drown. I know for myself when the windstorm comes the first thing is panic then try to find ways to calm the storm instead of calming my nerves and encouraging myself that Jesus is present in this boat. What a comfort we have that Jesus is ever present even the times we feel we are facing storms suggesting His absence. He has said that He will never leave us, nor forsake us, what a promise. Greater is He that lives in us than he that is in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Coming back to Elisha dealing with his servant vs. 16 &#8220;And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them&#8221;. See how God works, He revealed to Elisha the army backing them up but He did not reveal the same to Syria the enemy. I believe that revealing to Elisha the army that was with them was to show him that God\u2019s army (God) is ever present, He reveals and shows Himself so strong to those who trust in Him. God is with us and God is in control, we ask in His name, He acts according to His will, to continue, Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Kings 6:8-23, &#8220;And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them&#8221; To strengthen yesterday\u2019s message, let me add in Mark 4 from vs. 35, Jesus had been teaching on parables, He then told His disciples to cross with Him to the other side.

He knows how to battle His enemies in the battlefield. He does not fight according to men&#8217;s ways but His. There are days He battles for us and there are days He equips and teaches us to battle. Many times we may not be prepared for the battle but He is, we may be caught unaware, He is always aware. Psalm 46:1, &#8220;&#8230;He is a very PRESENT help in trouble&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Elisha in our text was a prophet of God and not a warrior. I\u2019m not sure if he even knew how to use an arrow but he was feared of men in every land. In our text we see him as a prophet in Israel but during a time Syria and Israel were at war. What made a difference in Israel is that God was on their side and that made Syria fear Israel greatly. Now I understand why Moses would not go anywhere without the presence of God, Exodus 33:14. God had made a covenant with Israel that He would fight and defend them. He would go before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire. Everywhere they went, they concurred lands because God was with them. Can you imagine everywhere you go and everything that you deal with, your enemies become subject to you simply because the presence of God is upon you? I believe that I can go anywhere, be anyone God wants me to be and survive anything as long as His presence goes with me for without Him, I can do nothing, John 15:5.<\/p>\n<p>We completely trust and submit to God\u2019s sovereign will for His presence to accompany us everywhere we go; He is Lord of our lives. The bible says in Psalm 37:23, &#8220;The good steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord.&#8221; How can one order our steps and direct our paths if He is not with us? We constantly need to seek His presence that we may overcome, Proverbs 3:5, &#8221; Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; 6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. 7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and depart from evil. 8 It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones. &#8220;..<\/p>\n<p>Moses could only deliver the children of Israel because the presence of God was with him. He was not a warrior, he did not have an army, all he had was a rod of a shepherd and the Lord. That is all God needed  to deliver the Israelites from their enemies. If you are ever going to do the impossible, it will happen because the Lord is with you..

God has been good, I testify of His faithfulness every single day. I thank God for the opportunity to minister to people all over the world through this means of communication. Something that started with no great vision God has turned it around to be bigger than what I would have imagined or thought. To Him be the glory. Waiting on God then preparing devotion has been work but I praise God because it\u2019s been a tool for my personal growth as I believe it has been to you. I go back to many messages done in the past and they refresh me again, giving me the strength I need in tough times.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been blessed reading your testimonies as you received devotions, how they have impacted your lives. I\u2019ve been blessed to have others come long side of me to minister to you, my best friend Pastor Phil who came on board the second year of this ministry, my Dad who has been a tremendous blessing, my dear wife who has been a great support, sharing and editing the devotions, Bro. Ben who has been a blessing to you too I believe and a challenge in my life concerning walking in holiness, he has such a passion to serve the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>May the Lord continue to grow us all as He speaks to us through His word.<\/p>\n<p>You are welcome to share how the devotion ministry as impacted your life.

Through His work upon the cross, as Colossians 1:19-22 states, we are reconciled unto God, for the purpose that He may present us holy, blameless, and above reproach in His sight. Friends, we are in many ways being sold a shortened gospel these days, we are aiming far below the mark. Matthew 1:21 tells us Jesus came to save us from our sins, to deliver us from sin, not so that we can return to it when we want, but so that we can go throughout our days living in victory through faith in His ever cleansing blood. I John 2:1-2 speaks the same language, stating that he writes these things that we may not sin, clearly stating it is possible to live without sin. He goes on further to say that IF we sin, we have an Advocate with the Father. It does not say when, it says if, which does not describe a definite time, but clearing the way that if we do slip we have an Advocate.<\/p>\n<p>Today many boast that they sin everyday, they don\u2019t even blush. This is highly unscriptural. When one truly comes to Christ, they are new creations, the old things have passed away, all is made new(II Corinthians 5:17). If we are still living the same life, what is new? Galatians 5:24, we are told that those who are Christ\u2019s, those who are saved by grace through faith, truly born again, have crucified the flesh. Romans 6:11, we are told to reckon(consider) ourselves dead to sin, as well as numerous other places.<\/p>\n<p>God is calling to those who have ears to hear, He is longing to pour Himself into our lives, to burst through the darkness to shine the magnificent light of His divine truth into our hearts, but we must be willing. He is seeking a bride, one clothed in spotless garments of holiness, one wholly devoted to Him, dead to themselves, but alive to God. He desires to give us victory over sin through faith, but we must let go, presenting ourselves to Him as living sacrifices, hiding His word deep within our hearts, allowing it to change us into His image, embracing the fullness of His redemptive work upon the cross, not so we can boast, God forbid, but so that He can receive glory from our lives. This life is not about us, it is about God receiving glory through His victorious, sinless church, clothed in holiness and righteousness. I pray this will bless your hearts and challenge each as I am challenged, to seek daily a deeper walk with God, to seek His fullness in our lives, not in material things, but in true spiritual wealth, the knowledge of the Holy One.<\/p>\n<p>Grace and truth be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, blessings Brother Ben<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning my dear friends, Psalm 119:11- Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against you.

If you are going to expect a miracle from God, don&#8217;t be surprised if He does it in a way you never imagined. He is a God of surprises therefore you have to know HIS WAYS to know when He is moving. The bible says in Psalm 103:7, &#8220;He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel&#8221;. Many only rejoice in the acts of God and that is okay but knowing His acts limits you to understanding how He does things. Moses was not frustrated when God was not acting, He knew God&#8217;s ways to know how and when God would move. When you know God&#8217;s ways, even if He does not act, you can see why He hasn&#8217;t acted and you can see what He is doing in your life as he prepares you for the miracle. The Potter can only make a jar because He has something to put in it. How will a broken leaking jar hold anything poured into it? If your jar is leaking, if He was to pour that miracle in you, it will definitely leak out. That was the problem with the Israelites, they were leaking vessels always needing an act of God for them to know God was with them and when it leaked out, they cried some more. Are we not like that many times praying for miracles when our jars are leaking?. I would rather know His ways than His acts.<\/p>\n<p>Elijah has just prayed calling on heaven and instantly God answered him by fire in vs. 38. What an instant miracle, God answering by fire what He had prayed. I have had those moments when I prayed and instantly God granted my request. Then moving to vs. 41, Elijah operates by faith, he tells king Ahab, &#8220;Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain&#8221;. Was there a great sound of rain? I don&#8217;t think so because as you read, Elijah sent his servant to go up and look toward the sea. Six times he was sent to check and six times he tells Elijah there is nothing. Thinking of this servant, he had seen Elijah call fire from heaven and it fell immediately, how come another miracle is taking forever to be manifested. I believe the servant must have gotten tired and frustrated running back and forth. Meanwhile, Elijah was cool, calm and collected because He knew the ways of God. He understands that God is in control and though it has not happened as he has prophesied, he can visualize in the spirit and embrace it. With that he is not getting frustrated, he is patient. When God promises, I don&#8217;t want to concentrate much on the timing for the promise to be fulfilled, I want to embrace the fact that He has promised. And according to His ways, &#8220;He is not a man that He should lie&#8221;. Learning His ways will cause you to keep checking, keep praying, keep knocking, and keep seeking because He has shown you what He wants to do in your life.<\/p>\n<p>1Kings 18:44, &#8220;Then it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, \u201cThere is a cloud, as small as a man\u2019s hand, rising out of the sea!\u201d. Elijah sent his servant for the seventh time and finally he saw a small cloud as a man&#8217;s hand, rising out of the sea. The miracle of fire happened instantly and big, the next miracle required patience and when it was revealed, it  appeared very small. Can you imagine the servant thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been running back and forth for something this small&#8221;? Do you realize that there are times we dismiss miracles God is performing in our lives because they look small? We expected something big and all that appeared was a small cloud as a man&#8217;s hand. What we failed to understand was that, abundance tends to start small. The reason the bible says, &#8220;do not despise the days of humble (miracles) beginnings. Knowing God&#8217;s ways will teach you to see miracles begin even in small scales. The miracle life of a baby begins long before he or she is born. In conclusion, knowing God&#8217;s ways will help you live a fulfilled life knowing miracles can be instantly or could take long (days, weeks, months, years). If He has conceived the promise in your spirit, be sure he will birth it in His time, don\u2019t abort.

And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything. 24 And he looked up and said, \u201cI see men like trees, walking.\u201d 25 Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a scary thing to have the blind leading where a pair of eyes is needed to lead. If you knew of a pilot who is about to fly a plane was blind or a driver of a car, you would be very hesitant to board that plane or get into that car. There is something special about the eyes none of us would want to take for granted. Over 570 times, the word eye(s) has been referenced in the bible.<\/p>\n<p>The definition of eyes in a dictionary is that its is an organ of vision. It\u2019s the window to our souls. Two things I find fascinating, is that the brain that can never be full (out of memory) and the eyes can never be considered to have seen enough so as not to receive anymore.<\/p>\n<p>We now come to Mark where Jesus meets this blind man brought to Him. If you read Mark\u2019s writing, he is fond of using the word \u201cimmediately\u201d. In other words, every miracle Jesus did, you hear Mark saying immediately something happened. And here we see the only gradual miracle done by the Lord I\u2019ve come across to demonstrate something.<\/p>\n<p>First He leads the man by the hand out of the town away from people of unbelief. The most important in my judgment as I read this passage, He wanted alone time with this man plus only those who believed Him, (His disciples). Then He does something we would consider unusual, spat in the man\u2019s eyes then touched it. Then Jesus asks him if he sees anything, his reply, \u201cI see men like trees\u201d, then He touched his eyes again and he was restored.<\/p>\n<p>Christ showed in what method those commonly are healed by his grace, which by nature are spiritually blind. At first, their knowledge is confused; but, like the light of the morning, it shines more and more to the perfect day, and then they see all things clearly.<\/p>\n<p>I see Five things that are related to this blind man\u2019s eyes being opened. 1. The leading of the Master 2. The demonstration of God\u2019s power to make His name great among people, 3. To cause a man who had heard of Him but never had the privilege of seeing Him see Him 4. To bring about a point that its Christ gradually opens the eyes of those seeking Him to see clearly what they could not see on their own, 5. To meet a physical need for the one who needed it and believed that only one could make it happen.<\/p>\n<p>John Gill, \u201cChrist&#8217;s taking the blind man by the hand, and leading him out or the town, and spitting on his eyes, and putting his hands upon him, and then asking him if he saw ought, are emblematical of what he does in spiritual conversion, when he turns men from darkness to light: he takes them by the hand, which expresses his condescension, grace, and mercy, and becomes their guide and leader; and a better, and safer guide they cannot have; he brings them by a way they know not, and leads them in paths they had not known before; makes darkness light before them, and crooked things straight, and does not forsake them: he takes them apart, and separates them from the rest of the world; he calls them out from thence to go with him, teaching them, that, when enlightened by him, they should have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, and the workers of them; for what communion has light with darkness? his putting spittle upon his eyes, may signify the means of grace, the eye salve of the word, which, when attended with a divine power, enlightens the eyes; and which power may be represented here by Christ&#8217;s putting his hands upon the man; for the Gospel, without the power of Christ, Is insufficient to produce such an effect; but when it is accompanied with that, it always succeeds\u201d, blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Mark 8:22-26, \u201cThen He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him. 23 So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town.

God did not create man on day one, I will let you figure why. Emphasis has to be put also in the right order. Some people think we are BODY, SOUL and SPIRIT, the word of God emphases, SPIRIT, SOUL and BODY. We can see such a great order. Body becomes last because it is temporal. Where you put much emphasis matters a lot.<\/p>\n<p>Proverbs 31:30, &#8220;Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised&#8221;. Fearing God is the definition of our existence, it\u2019s the foundation by which the rest of the characteristics that makes a person begins. Charm, beauty, dignity, character can all be traced back to this firm foundation. Anytime this introduction is wrong, it has a tendency to affect every other thing on the way. It&#8217;s from this introduction that we all learn our rightful positions and the order of things. This is what I call the vertical relationship, the mirror by which you will reflect in someone&#8217;s life what you have learned from the Master of our destiny. A man who understands that Jesus Christ sacrificed His life&#8217;s blood for the church will likewise love his wife sacrificially and passionately. He will honor, respect, protect, love and cherish her as much as he does his own body. He will not harm her or demean her in anyway. It&#8217;s in the atmosphere of love and security that a godly wife willingly submits herself to the protective arms of her husband. Can you see the order?. Christ first loved the church and the church in response to that love submitted to Him.  Missing one step means missing the whole process.<\/p>\n<p>Proverbs 31:25, &#8220;Strength and honor are her clothing; &#8220;. It&#8217;s vital to know what makes you who you are. You ask yourself, is it your looks or character that people value?. For the woman talked about here in proverbs, her greatest clothing are not her charm and beauty but strength and honor. I&#8217;m no way saying that beauty is left out, it&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s been put in its rightful place and all that is more cultivated on is her character. She is praised for her strength and honor, strength because God is her strength and the joy of the Lord is her strength, and honor, because her husband honors her. Her sense of worth depends on her strength from God (vertical relationship) and her honor from her husband (Horizontal relationship). Husbands ought to HONOR their wives. Honor is high respect or esteemed, as that shown for a special merit, it&#8217;s also recognition. Material gifts may play part but I believe the greatest gift is &#8220;honor&#8221; for it lasts. This is what brings her confidence, feeling of appreciation, loved unconditionally, feeling valued, feeling secure etc. These becomes her clothing, what she is proud of. When she is strengthened, she has greater ability to maintain a moral position firmly. Some cultures do not promote honoring women but the bibles puts women in a higher place. With the husbands honoring their wives, they can be the means by which God could take their wives far. At times you need someone who to strengthen your faith during those times you don&#8217;t have faith to go far, to believe in your God given potentials to go further than you thought. When you stand on the shoulder of the one who believes in you, you can see further than what you see by yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding the order of things and applying them in  their rightful places can open doors for greater things. Let us learn how to as the key to unlock the greatest blessings by setting things right. Husbands love and honor your wives. Remember, order creates harmony.

When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.<\/p>\n<p>I can remember very clearly what my prayer life was like when I first became a Christian.  My prayers in the beginning were all about one subject, and one person alone, and God was neither that subject nor that person.  Who was this person that I prayed for, well myself of course.  The Apostle Paul mentioned that when he was a child he did childish things, he talked, thought, and reasoned like a child.  Well I prayed like a child.  When one thinks of growth in the natural sense it makes sense.  When babies cry at 2 am who are they concerned about?  They certainly are not concerned about mommy or daddy who has to wake up and care for the child.  No, the cry is all about the child.<\/p>\n<p>When I used to pray, all my prayer requests were centered on me. So what did God do, He answered them.   The very first time I prayed I can remember saying out loud, even though I was alone, \u201cLet me try this prayer thing.\u201d  I had looked in the shed for a half an hour for my bike chain and couldn\u2019t find it.  So I got on my knees, no one was around, and I prayed, \u201cGod I believe you see all things, and you see where my bike chain is, please direct my eyes to it.\u201d  As soon as I opened my eyes, it was hanging on the wall right in front of my eyes.  \u201cIt worked, God answered my prayer, I said.  I said \u201cthank you God,\u201d and left.  Oh, that was just a coincidence, you may be thinking.  Well things like that began to happen often to me, mostly when I lost something.  Even though I was new born babe in Christ (1 Pt. 2:2), God honored my prayers so I would learn to trust Him in prayer.  Ones prayer life has to have a beginning, and often it\u2019s a baby beginning. <\/p>\n<p>As the Lord was slowly building me up in prayer, He was also building me up in faith, trusting Him.  Mt. 18:2-4 reads, \u201cHe called a little child and had him stand among them. 3 And he said: \u201cI tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d  God loves the faith that we have as newborn children of God first trusting in His ability to answer prayers.  God starts us here, because He is helping us to gain confidence in Him.  John wrote \u201cI write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of His name (1 Jn.2:12).\u201d  God desires at some point that we begin to look outward in our prayer and focus on others, we ought to at some point begin to grow up in our prayer life, just like in the natural we grow from children to adults.<\/p>\n<p>The writer of Hebrews writes in this context seemingly in frustration \u201cby this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God\u2019s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! 13 Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. 14 But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil (Heb. 5) There is a time to grow up, and become mature in prayer.  Paul said there was a time when he became a man and put childish things behind him.  I no longer pray like a child, and I have prayed and see God do miraculous things, life changing things, in myself and others, but my relationship with Him had to deepen which in turn caused my prayer to deepen.  I too had to put childish things behind me, not just focused on myself, but on others, and more than anything on my relationship with Him, just talking to and hearing from my heavenly Father.<\/p>\n<p>Application:  Read about prayer in God\u2019s Word, and may you too grow in your prayer life.

And the power of the Lord was present to heal them\u201d<\/p>\n<p>No prayer requests hits my mailbox like the request for physical for healing. The prevalent one is healing over cancer. How many are running to faith healers hoping for a healing touch if they have the right faith. While I would discredit many of the so called faith healers, I am a firm believer of physical healing. I believe God still heals today. I have seen healing take place in my family. My brother had something in his stomach a few years ago the doctors could not detect so as to provide right cure and so was my mom and we prayed and trusted God for their healing and in His mercies, He heard our cry. My dad battled stomach ulcers for years, and God miraculously healed him.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asking if you have enough faith to pray and believe God for the healing you need or for a loved one to be healed. If you had faith from God to be saved, you have faith from God to be healed. That is all the faith you need. \u201cThe Bible teaches that Jesus Christ is \u2018the same yesterday, and today, and forever,\u2019 (Hebrews 13:8). The Lord Himself said, \u2018I am the Lord, I change not,\u2019 (Malachi 3:6). All God\u2019s promises are limitless answers to prayer.  \u2018WHAT THINGS SOEVER ye desire\u2019 or \u2018if ye shall ask ANYTHING in My name,\u2019 show that miracles will last as long as God\u2019s promises are true, whenever people are given faith to trust Him for miracles.<\/p>\n<p>In countless instances since the Bible was written, God has worked miracles; and these miracles have been witnessed by the best men and women of the centuries, who have given their witness that they know God still answers prayer, even miraculously. Healings still happen because the power of God has never ceased. It\u2019s not gone cold or put out. It\u2019s still burning changing lives and healing the sick. It\u2019s in seeking God\u2019s kingdom first that these other things such as healing are added to us. They are not added because we seek His kingdom, it\u2019s while we are seeking His kingdom first that He does add them. We put our focus on Him. Healing is a byproduct not the prime product otherwise we will be out of focus.<\/p>\n<p>While Jesus was teaching  (what ought to be prime), in Luke 5, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by who had come to watch. These were the same type of people who opposed Jesus\u2019 ministry. They were always looking to take fault with Him, discredit His miracles, seeking ways to trap Him but in the midst of all the opposition, arguments, all reasoning, their unbelief \u201cThe Power of the Lord was present to heal them\u201d. Who are them but those whom He had given faith because they were open. Faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God.<\/p>\n<p>He is Jehovah Rapha meaning our healer. He can heal instantly, gradually, through the doctors etc, He gets the credit. He is the one in control of how we get the healing according to His power that works within us. Can He not be trusted to do the healing? Watch this leprous man who met with Jesus right after He was done preaching on the mount in Matthew 8: 2,\u201cAnd behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, \u201cLord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.\u201d 3 Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d Immediately his leprosy was cleansed\u201d.  Notice that he did not say \u201cif you can\u201d, he knew Jesus could, that is faith. The outcome was in His hands \u201cLord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.\u201d And the Lord say, \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d  The Lord is willing, trust Him today, call on Him. There is no special power someone else has that you don\u2019t have. This man did not look for a faith healer; he went straight to Christ, called on Him for his healing. So was Bartimaeus in Mark 10:46, cried out to Jesus, the woman with the issue of who reached out and touched him in Luke 8. These people had one thing in common, desperation and who to call on. Yes we can have people pray with us but if your faith is based on how many people or who can pray for you, then I remind you again to know \u201cthe exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power\u201d,  Ephesians 1:19, Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 5:17, \u201cNow it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem.

I shared that We need the power of the Holy Ghost to keep us humble and empower us to do His work.<\/p>\n<p>Now we come to the book of Acts and we see Peter full of the Holy Ghost and power living and demonstrating the exceeding greatness of God\u2019s power in himself as a follower of Jesus Christ. He is aware of the fact that \u201c\u2026we have this treasure (gospel power) in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:7 and he knows that if anything is to happen, it will be done by God through Christ by the power of the Holy Ghost for His glory through unworthy life. We will see how that unfolds.<\/p>\n<p> Peter and John among others had been going to the temple to pray many times. And we are told in vs. 2, \u201cAnd a certain man lame from his mother\u2019s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered the temple\u201d. I don\u2019t believe this was the first time they saw him, perhaps they had also given him alms before. It\u2019s not recorded if anyone ever invited him into the temple even willing to assist him.<\/p>\n<p>Though he was lame from birth, people had given him temporal things, things to fill his own life but no one ever gave him what he desperately needed, to be made whole. silver and gold is what he asked for but he desperately needed was not natural but supernatural. Natural is what men produces, supernatural is what God produces. Natural is what people did, brought him to at the gate of the temple, gave him alms<\/p>\n<p>We are no different, we&#8217;ve given the world everything (alms) but Jesus. we give advice, we give assistance, we lend, we offer to bring our loved ones and friends food, do their laundry, fix their cars, clean their drive way, give people a ride, assist them at work etc but we\u2019ve failed many times to give them Jesus. This is like giving alms and nothing else.<\/p>\n<p>The lame man vs. 3, \u201c&#8230;seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms. 4 And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, \u201cLook at us.\u201d 5 So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. 6 Then Peter said, \u201cSilver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.\u201d   Peter said look on us and expected alms only to hear something different. Instead of silver and gold which he had none, he gave him Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>In the name of Jesus Christ. Christ worked his miracles in no one&#8217;s name. The power was his own, but with the apostles all things were done in Christ&#8217;s name, and the power ascribed to him. Though Peter was full of the Holy Ghost, he proclaimed the name of Christ because the Holy Ghost was sent to glorify Christ. He empowers us to do God\u2019s work of glorifying Christ. Also Peter does not tell him to rise and walk alone, he adds the most important name In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth to show the exceeding greatness of His power to make one whole.<\/p>\n<p>If we would attempt to do good, the purpose of healing men&#8217;s souls must be on top of our list. We must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him.

And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. 8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus\u2019 knees, saying, \u201cDepart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I find it humbling some men in the bible who encountered our Holy God, seen Him in His power, majesty, glory, splendor did not leave them excited to talk about it but rather left them humble,  broken and overwhelmed by the presence of the Almighty God. His presence revealed things in their lives leaving them feeling unworthy of such awesome presence yet desired.<\/p>\n<p>Today I hear people who claim to have been to heaven writing books, appearing in talk shows, invited to talk about their experiences in heaven which raises enough red flags. In listening to Justin Peters of \u201cA call for discernment\u201d ministry talking about Paul who went to heaven (2Corinthians 12), shares how Paul first felt unworthy to have had such an experience, Paul even referred to himself in the third person to prevent him from boasting. If you read his encounter, he\u2019s comes back humbled and even in his humility, he was still given a thorn in the flesh to humble him even more and could not talk about what he saw in heaven.<\/p>\n<p>Now think of Peter in Luke 5, multitude drew close to listen to Jesus preach. At this time, Peter had not received his calling, he was a fisherman in business. In this story, the professional fishermen had caught nothing the previous night. At this point they had gone away washing their nets nursing disappointment. Jesus seeing Peter\u2019s boat asked him to push it a little into the water so as to use it as a pulpit. Upon finishing preaching, He told Peter to launch into the deep vs. 5 But Simon answered and said to Him, \u201cMaster, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.\u201d 6 And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God (Romans 10:17), Peter heard the word that day and took Jesus at His word. He did as he was instructed and got the greatest catch his life. This is to show the power of God in the presence of the unworthy of it. It also shows the presence of the One who holds all the power that makes a difference. But did this demonstration make Peter excited and gave him something to talk about? contrary, vs. 8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus\u2019 knees, saying, \u201cDepart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!\u201d. He was amazed at the greatness of the miracle wrought, and struck with the sense of the power of Christ, put forth therein; and with the greatness of His majesty so near him; and as conscious to himself of his own vileness and unworthiness to be in his presence. In his unworthiness, Christ gave him what he did not deserve, grace.<\/p>\n<p>In his state, Christ called him to do what he could not do on his own power but under His power, become fishers of men. For what he had seen, he knew that if anything was going to happen, it was going to happen because Christ in His power would work something extraordinary in the life of a man who counted himself unworthy. These are the people who are candidates for grace and these are the people Christ fills with Himself and lives His own life through them demonstrating His miracle power. And this is how when we preach Christ, sinners would be struck by the power of Christ bringing them to their knees as they see their unworthiness before a holy and just God and with one cry say, \u201cwhat must I do to be saved\u201d<\/p>\n<p>How I desire for God to so work in us to bring about that sense of Awe that reminders us of our unworthy as He demonstrates His power. And with His call in our lives, people would tremble at the presence of the power of Christ in us. That those who have mocked Christ, his children, His work will tremble before a just and holy God and repent of their sins, \u201cfor it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure\u201d, Philippians 2: 13, We need the power of the Holy Ghost to keep us humble and empower us to do His work.

This was confirmed by my pastor\u2019s preaching this Sunday as he addressed among other things the power of the Holy Ghost. It\u2019s sad when we see people mock God and His power. His power is being abused by many false teachers and true but sad, many genuine believers have distanced themselves from this power because of the abuse by others. Then there are those who are afraid of it.<\/p>\n<p> It was in 1940\u2019s in Sudan Africa while witnessing to a Muslim that Paris Reidhead (one of favorite preachers) was left puzzled about God\u2019s power when a Muslim he had been witnessing to for weeks asked him a tough question, \u201cWhat can your living Jesus do today that our dead Mohammed can\u2019t?\u201d. For five long years Reidhead\u2019s Mohammedan friend\u2019s question had been as a sword behind him driving him to the Bible to read, study, search, and believe, there lies the power of God. There lies the need for the power not for programs and man\u2019s fulfilement but for demonstration to the world. I believe the preaching the word still lies the power to salvation but I also believe demonstration of God\u2019s power in other areas (healing, provisions etc) are great testimonies to His ability and silences the mouths of mockers. This makes us Christians different from other religions.<\/p>\n<p>Paul\u2019s epistle to the Ephesians opens with greetings and prayer for them as he heard of their faith in Christ. One of his prayer to God for them was that they would know \u201cwhat is the exceeding greatness of His power to toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power\u201d. He knew of their faith, he prayed for them to desire and know the greater power of God in a believer that would serve God\u2019s purpose for His glory. \u201cThe Excellency of faith is declared by the effects, because the mighty power of God is set forth and shown in them. It happens as the hunger for God is a desire activated by the power of God by faith\u201d<\/p>\n<p>From John Gill\u2019s exposition, \u201cThis power is that which is exerted in the implantation of faith, and in the continuance of it, and in the finishing of that work. This is a great power, an exceeding great one, a super eminent one; which is attended with energy and efficacy, and is irresistible and insuperable. The greatness of this power as displayed in the work of conversion and faith appears, if it be considered what the work itself is called, a creation, a resurrection from the dead, a regeneration, and a transformation of the man into another man, which must needs require almighty power; as well as what is then done, some things are removed. Satan is dispossessed, the stony heart is taken away, the enmity is slain, the old man is put down from His throne, and put off with His deeds; and there are some things wrought. Christ is formed in the soul, His grace is implanted, His image is stamped on, a new heart is given, and principles of light and life, of grace and holiness are put. The understanding is enlightened, the will is subdued, the affections are set on other objects, and the mind and conscience are cleansed and purified; and the means of this are the ministers, and ministry of the word, which are weak, foolish, and contemptible, in the eyes of men; to which may be added, the opposition made both from within and from without, from a sinful heart, a tempting devil, and an ensnaring, reproaching, and persecuting world: so that this work of faith cannot be ascribed to anything short of the exceeding greatness of divine power; and which is seen in supporting faith when it is wrought, under great discouragements; in delivering believers out of divers temptations; in assisting them to discharge their duty, and in their final perseverance: and to increase the idea of this power it is added\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to the working of His mighty power, or &#8220;according to the energy of the might of His power&#8221;: the strength of His power, in all the mighty energy of it, is exerted towards and upon believers; and which they should know, own, and acknowledge, to the glory of the grace of God: and this is in proportion, and agreeably to that power. \u201cWhat can your living Jesus do today that our dead Mohammed can\u2019t?\u201d, He gives power to the unworthy to serve His purpose to reach Mohammedian\u2019s and others like him<\/p>\n<p>Do you truly know this power? Are you shying away and distancing yourself from it? You and I need this power. Let\u2019s make this our prayer earnestly as Paul gave it to the Ephesians, it is very important.

If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all men liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Nearly everyone struggles with patience. The more I walk with the Lord the more I learn that God is not in a hurry. Read about delivering the Israelites, raising David, Joseph, Paul, Abraham etc. and you will see this trend with God. If God was not patient with us, we would all be gone in an instant.<\/p>\n<p>Patience is awaiting God&#8217;s timing without doubting His love and ability to do something. Patience is not caught or taught in classrooms, it\u2019s learnt and mastered in the sea of life. I struggled with this for years but then by God\u2019s grace I began to master it as life itself taught me how to live it; I\u2019m still learning. People can be patient if they know how long it will take and what it will take, but can we be patient if we have no clue as to when and how?  You can tell the impatience by what is coming out of people\u2019s mouths, Luke 6:45, &#8220;&#8230;of the abundance of the heart, the mouth does speak&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The text given tells us to let patience have it&#8217;s perfect work, you cannot hurry patience or dictate it, by itself it can do what needs to be done. The bible says that patience is one of the fruits of the spirit and so if you are lacking patience in your life, you are missing one of the most important fruit. Patience brings about good when allowed to perform a surgery. It will do its own tests, discover the weakness and allow certain things to come our way to make us wait longer and the more we wait the more our attitude is adjusted. Patient people are never frustrated when things don&#8217;t go right.  They are not fast to draw conclusions.<\/p>\n<p>Patience will perfect and complete you lacking nothing only if you allow it to do so. For example, when you are in a plane and it\u2019s about to land, they normally announce that they are about to land strap yourself, and roughly about how long it will take to land. The passengers begin to prep themselves for landing.  Sometimes the pilot may announce a delay for reasons like weather, planes taking off or other things that bring about delays. You should see some people&#8217;s faces when they announce delays some complain, murmur etc. Does this sound familiar? Some may ask if the plane has enough gas to stay in the air (on hold) and the truth, the planes project such delays and grace themselves with gas to put them on hold position<\/p>\n<p>I want us to know that if God puts us on hold position, He has filled us with enough gas to keep us in hold position. The landing is not denied, only delayed for our own good. No need to be frustrated because you don&#8217;t have what you requested, your patience is required for safe landing. Walking with Christ requires patience, Hebrews 12:1&amp;2 &#8220;&#8230;let us run with patience the race set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the perfector of our faith&#8221;. This goes even for calling into ministry, as you wait patiently for His time you will have learnt more patience even to deal with people when the door for ministry opens. I was led into ministry 5years after I got called to follow Him. It was not easy to wait but I had enough  gas to put me on hold position and when I landed, my runway had been cleared. I am still allowing patience to do it&#8217;s perfect work in me.<\/p>\n<p>Now if you lack wisdom on how to be patient, ask the Lord who gives to all men wisdom liberally and without approach, and it will be given to you. You pray for patience you are asking for something you don&#8217;t know for in the next few hours, you will hit the heaviest traffic that will test your patience, that friend, workmate or boss will really test your patience. Don&#8217;t crush your plane simply because you were not allowed to land the time when you wanted to, know that God will equip you with enough to PUT YOU ON HOLD POSITION.

I don&#8217;t know how many times I have talked about trusting in God to lead and then felt like I was by myself or I did not see how things were going to come out in the long run. If you&#8217;ve noticed, the Lord tells us things but He never explains Himself.<\/p>\n<p>When God called the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, the plan was to bring them to the promise land. When the Lord begins to do something, He already has an end result for it and so when He begins to do it; it&#8217;s not for Him to try and see if it would work but for Him to finish what He began. We could start with Him and then give up but He will not. Now we see Him bring His people through the dessert ultimately that He may bring them to the land He promised then all of a sudden there are obstacles,\/barriers\/ partitions\/ walls\/ valleys just to mention a few. God did not tell them what it will take to bring them there meaning the process. Thank God that He does not always tell us the process but the purpose for if some of us knew the process, we would give up before we even go far. David was promised that He would be the next king, God did not tell him that He would have to wait 17years, being wanted dead by Saul and face many challenges. Joseph receives a dream and he is not told that for his dream to be accomplished, he will have to be thrown into the pit, sold to Egypt, be thrown in jail and then receive it. If these two guys ever knew the process, I bet they would have thought twice about what they desired.<\/p>\n<p>While in the dessert, the children of Israel are brought by Mount Sinai and they camped there many days. The Lord may bring you through the desert but He will not leave you in the dessert. That&#8217;s why we always need to be reminded that we are nomadic people. If we stop somewhere, it will be just for a season and not forever. One preacher said that, &#8220;never build permanent decisions on temporary circumstances&#8221; As nomadic people, we are always packed up so that we can pass over. If my friends are looking for me where I was yesterday, they will not find me for I am moving on. I may cry for a while, be broken, fall but I am not going to be down forever so don&#8217;t look for me down there. It&#8217;s easy to settle at a place where you don&#8217;t fight anymore, the same case with the Israelites, peacefully sitting by the mountain; then God says, &#8220;You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward&#8221; meaning it&#8217;s time to make a stand and move forward. Yes I brought you to this mountain but this was part of the process to get you ready for the promise land. I know how I struggle with this at times because I tend to be too territorial when I know for sure that God was just using something as a bridge. He will bring me to certain places just to rest and then move me to the next level. He wants me to go northward as there is something about Northwards, it&#8217;s in His plan. Going forward would mean fighting our way through, as you read down in the same chapter, you see how they begun to fight many enemies before they possessed. They were not told that they would fight but that was part of the process.<\/p>\n<p>Lord I don&#8217;t know where I am at this point but I know that I need to move forward, some of the things I ever trusted you with Lord, you want to accomplish them in me. Lord speak a word that will cause me to take a stand and move northwards and may you accomplish what you have started in me. I know how territorial I can be and how this causes my faith to be dormant but when I know that I am still on the move, I will trust you to take me to the next place (level) for Your glory. It will be tough when you know that what you have accomplished is not the end but the middle as that was part of His process to accomplish His purpose. Maybe His process is to build you up in ministry, singing, intercession, strong in the word, walking with Him. If He promised, sure enough He will accomplish it but the question is? CAN YOU STAND THE PROCESS?

Here it goes Ev<\/p>\n<p>Ezekiel 34:16&#8243;I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up the broken and strengthen what was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong, and feed them in judgment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the above text, Jesus is portrayed as a True Shepherd, who would seek the lost, bring back that was driven away, bind up the broken and heal the sick. A cute little girl, holding a blue bag entered my compartment during my long train journey and sat bang opposite me; later I found that she was a mentally challenged girl. The bag contained delicious snacks for her train journey, she proudly announced to everyone that her dad bought it for her and was all praises for her father; but envied her brother and seemed to hold a grudge against her mother; probably because her brother looked tall, fair and was normal. My heart went out for her and I was looking for a chance to speak with the girl, but she rudely replied my questions and refused to even look at me. I determined my heart to win her warmth; slowly I offered to help her to hang her snack bag &#8211; her treasure &#8211; on the hook. She refused and held her bag even more closer to her, I did not give up, though! I kept flashing my best smile across to her. After several hours of struggle on my side, she started warming up towards me. At last, she trusted me with her treasure bag! Wow! That was a golden win! The next couple of hours was just &#8216;aunty, aunty and aunty&#8217;; the family were surprised to see her get so close with me. Now, I just had half hour left to share Jesus with her, I prayed for an opportunity; suddenly I was left alone with her! I went and sat next to her, held her hand, caressed her cheek and shared my testimony of miraculous healing I received from Jesus. She listened to me patiently. Before leaving her, I touched her cheek and said good bye. She smiled but did not answer. Her brother helped me with my luggage and said &#8216;bye aunty.&#8217; Those two words spoke volumes to me: thank you for your compassion and love, thank you for taking your time and speaking with my sister who is mocked, rejected and abandoned.&#8217; He will bind up the broken! His eye is on the sparrow!<\/p>\n<p>Dear friend, do you hold bitter feelings of rejection, and pain like this little kid today? Do you have a treasure bag that you refuse to hand it over to God? Why not trust Him with your life today? Never look for love outside Jesus, do you get me? None can offer the love that only Jesus can offer you today. My son has such tremendous trust in me that he would just dump all his little treasures &#8211; a plastic dinosaur, a pencil stub, a tiny seashell, a marble, a torn kite &#8211; on my study table. He would say, &#8216;keep it safely until I ask you.&#8217; Imagine! Likewise, why not have child-like faith in God and handover our treasures to Him?<\/p>\n<p>What is the treasure bag that you are holding today? It can be a dream project, a vision for your future, a business project or it may be your future and marriage plans; whatever..hand them over to God and watch Him guide you wonderfully step by step.<\/p>\n<p>Hand over your pain and rejection to Him as well, unload them at His feet. I receive many emails everyday of people being betrayed by friends, husbands, wives and girlfriends; turn your eyes upon Jesus today! I repeat turn!<\/p>\n<p>Did you know His love is so colossal and incomparable that we may not be able to comprehend the width, length, depth and height of His divine love?

Scott Peck wrote a famous book, The Road Less Traveled, and Jesus said that there were two roads as well, the wide way and the narrow way.  The narrow way is the road, or course, less traveled which is why Jesus said few find it (Matthew 7). <\/p>\n<p>The Apostle Paul it seemed always lived his life on a mission.  If you recall his life before his conversion, when his name was Saul, his mission was to kill Christians (Acts 9, 22).  When Paul was converted Jesus spoke to Ananias saying about Paul, \u201c\ufeffFor I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name\u2019s sake (Acts 9:16).\u201d  Although Paul would face suffering on the course that he was on, for Jesus, he refused to be deterred.  In the above verses, there were some well-meaning believers that tried to persuade Paul not to go up to Jerusalem for fear that Paul would be killed.  Paul however would not be persuaded, or taken off course.  What kept Paul to stay the course?    <\/p>\n<p>1. Paul\u2019s eyes were fixed.  Hebrews 12:2 reads, \u201cLet us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\u201d (NIV)  Paul kept his eyes on Jesus and he knew that Jesus would keep His eyes on Paul.  If Jesus calls you then He will keep you.  Are your eyes fixed on Jesus as you make your daily decisions?  What decision are trying to make, and is Jesus\u2019 will even a factor in the process? <\/p>\n<p>2. Paul did not swerve Proverb 4:27 \u201cDo not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.\u201d  It\u2019s easy to be deterred when your eyes are not fixed on Christ.  One doesn\u2019t intend to go off course; usually one slowly drifts away from the course.  What causes you to swerve left or right?  What are the obstacles?  Have you identified your \u201ccourse \u2013 deterrents?\u201d Laziness?  Time\/business?  Wrong or unbalanced priorities?  If your lazy, stop; too busy, change it; priorities wrong, alter them.  Stop swerving! <\/p>\n<p>3. Paul was ready to die.  \u201cI protest by your\ufeff\ufeff rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily (1 Cor. 15:31).\u201d  Paul was even ready if need be to die for Jesus.  Now I don\u2019t want to die, however, Paul died to his selfishness, his agenda, his course, and embraced Jesus\u2019 course for his life.  Do you die daily to these things?  At the end of Paul\u2019s life he was able to say these words, which we should all hope to be able to say, \u201cI have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith (2 Tim 4:7).\u201d  Will you be able to say that one day, will I? Will you STAY THE COURSE!<\/p>\n<p>Dear Father, guide me to stay the course. Father help me to identify my course-deterrents. Help me to resist the temptations that enter my life, that push me off of Your will and plan for me. Lord, help me slow down and spend more quality time with You.

The bible says that every land they passed through, they won the battle for God was with them. With God with you, you can win battles you couldn&#8217;t win by yourself. No wonder in one of the chapters Moses tells God, &#8220;If Your presence is not going with us, do not move us from this place&#8221;, and in Isaiah 26:4 we are told, &#8221; Trust in the LORD forever,<\/p>\n<p>For in YAH, the LORD, is everlasting strength&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Exodus 17:9, &#8220;And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: tomorrow and I will stand on top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand&#8221;. It&#8217;s good to have a leader who is hearing from God and who knows what to do when situations arises. Here we see Moses delegating responsibilities as a leader to Joshua who will be driving force on the offensive side and Moses will go up the hill to be on the defensive side. In our lives we have our Joshua the word of God as our offensive weapon in the battle ground, Hebrews 4:12, &#8220;The word of the Lord is living and powerful, sharper than double edged sword&#8230;&#8221;. On the other hand Moses is the faith (defensive) weapon standing up on the hill believing God for a breakthrough. Moses goes up the hill with Aaron and Hur, the people who later ministered to him as he was up the hill.<\/p>\n<p>Exodus 17:11, &#8220;And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed&#8221;. As long as Moses faith stood still, Israel was winning but the moment his hands went down, Israel was losing. Moses hands got tired at one point, Exodus 17:12, &#8220;But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up His hands, the one on one side, and the other on the other side, and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun&#8221;. In as much as Moses could raise his hands, there came a time when his hands got tired and he felt like bringing them down. The moment that his hands started coming down, Israel was losing but thanks be to God for Aaron and Hur who I could say were the type of grace and strength to help him keep his hands up for Israel to win, 2Corinnthians 12:9, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, my strength is made perfect in weakness&#8221;. Aaron and Hur were there at the right time to minister to Moses. We can keep our hands up with the help of God&#8217;s grace and God&#8217;s strength. We can have our offensive troops on the fore front and we can have faith on the defensive side and with God&#8217;s grace and strength, we can keep the faith lifted up that we may win our battles. The Lord gave the Israelites victory for there was a man lifting up his hands all the time.<\/p>\n<p>Are you tired of lifting your hand? call on grace and strength from above to help you make it, the Lord says, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee, My strength is made perfect in weakness!!

Walking with Christ is not easy for there is a price to be paid. You&#8217;ve heard me say that salvation is free but living for Christ and being anointed will cost you. Jesus tells us to die to self, pick up our cross and follow Him. The cross is not that easy to carry, and the journey is not easy but knowing that He is there to guide and lead us gives us the confidence to believe that we will make it.<\/p>\n<p>The children of Israel led out of the land of Egypt to be brought to the land of Canaan, a land known to be flowing with milk and honey. They are not flown into the land, but they are led through the wilderness that they may be brought to the land. The wilderness becomes a training ground for them for this is where their faith is tried, this is where they are faced with challenges and now they have to decide who to look to for help, this is also the place where they constantly remind their leaders of where they came from. As many complained through this journey, there are those who feared the Lord and were willing to trust Him through the journey. In Exodus 17:1, the word says that the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin and pitched in Rephidim. The Israelites were nomadic people always on the move. They would walk and when they got tired, they would pitch a tent and rest for a while. I&#8217;m amazed that as many complained and always compared their situation to that of Egypt, none left to go back to Egypt and I believe the reason could be they would never make it far back without God. Remember that they had walked many years without their clothes getting old and their shoes were not wearing out. They had been blessed all through, they did not see it because they did not put it into consideration that they were favored. It&#8217;s very easy to dismiss the truth about how God has blessed you and it could be because you were waiting for a certain blessing that hasn&#8217;t materialize yet but if you look again in your life, you will come to realize that God has done so much that you cannot tell it all. <\/p>\n<p>Someone wrote a song and said, &#8220;Count your blessings one by one&#8221;, &#8220;He has done so much for me that I cannot tell it all&#8221;. Go places, watch other countries on TV where people are going without and you will understand that you and I have been cared for, blessed beyond what we could imagine or think. When the Israelites needed food, God provided; when they cried for water, God provided; when they faced an enemy, God fought for them. God went before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire. They had God in everything they needed but they still complained.

But David strengthened (encouraged) himself in the LORD his God<\/p>\n<p>David and his men one day went to the battle field leaving all their families and possessions behind. Not long after they left did Amalekites invade Ziklag, a place David was situated. They burnt where they camped, took all their possessions and all their family members. Can you imagine what was going through their minds?. First they went to the battle ground, nothing happened. Coming back to their families who were not there. 1Samuel 30:4 says, &#8220;David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep&#8221;, don&#8217;t know about you but I would weep too. It was okay to weep but for how long? They were all in these together, they went to the battle field together, came back together, lost the same things, wept together. The only thing they did not do together is accept the after math. The people wanted to stone David because they were disappointed in him. &#8220;If he was a good leader&#8221;, I suppose they imagined, &#8220;he could have left some men behind to guard the camp instead of taking all the soldiers&#8221;. They could have also thought, &#8220;If he is a leader, is the battle more important to him than his family?&#8221;. Disappointed with a leader because of a weakness or a failure.<\/p>\n<p> David amazes me, he as a leader distressed over what he has lost, then pressure is put on him by those he is leading, what could he do? He had his shock absorbers on, 1Samuel 30:6, &#8220;&#8230;But David strengthened (encouraged) himself in the LORD his God&#8221;. If he was going to bounce back, he had to encourage himself when no one else could. You have to be your best encourager, the one that lays a foundation. Let the rest help you build the wall.  All the people who could stand with him were against him for they were disappointed in him and ready to get rid of him but he understood that God was not like everyone else. He took that disappointment and created appointment out of it. When I read about David, his shock absorbers always came about through reflection on what God had done in his life before. Through that he could trust God with what was to come however bad it looked like. Revelation 12:11, &#8220;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the words of their testimony&#8221;. When he encouraged himself in the Lord, he took the time to encourage those who were disappointed in him. Proverbs 3:5, &#8220;Trust in the Lord with all your heart&#8230;&#8221;, this was David&#8217;s trust in God even in a tough situation.<\/p>\n<p> 1Samuel 30:8, &#8220;So David inquired of the LORD, saying, &#8220;Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them?&#8221; And He answered him, &#8220;Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.&#8221; Once again I see a disappointment being used to create an appointment. This is where the last part of Proverbs 3:6 comes in place, &#8220;&#8230;In all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths&#8221;. Because of His trust in the Lord, he sought for the Lord&#8217;s direction in the matter and God directed his paths as to what to do. The only reason David could put Proverbs 3:5&amp;6 into practice was because he had learned to apply his shock absorbers to steady him to bounce back on the right track after weeping over what he lost. &#8220;Blessed are they that bounce, for they shall come back&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>God receives all the glory &#8217;cause disappointments are only temporary setbacks as &#8220;THIS TOO SHALL PASS&#8221;. &#8220;And it came to pass\u2026&#8221;, it did not come to stay. One more time, let your shock absorbers work for you then trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths.

What is the greatest and most reliable source of your help? Today, as you are reading this devotion, is there any need you have which you would wish someone met? Have you struggled on your own to see that need met? Have you sought the help of others? How about the help of God? Beginning with yourself to others and God, who would you rather trust and put your confidence in? Finding the answer to this last question is the key to finding the true and most reliable source, solution, and satisfaction when you have need.  There are four ways you may deal with any problem:<\/p>\n<p>1.   Try to solve it yourself;<br \/>2.   Seek the help of others;<br \/>3.   Give the problem to God to solve and last,<br \/>4.

God delights in meeting the needs of his children. That is why Jesus Christ is seated on the right hand of God, as our chief high priest, interceding for us daily. He is there waiting for any call from anyone of His children with need so He can satisfy the need. He may not do it the way we want and at the time we want, but He will meet our need and solve our problems. All He requires for us to do is &#8220;call&#8221; and &#8220;come&#8221;: &#8220;Call unto me and I will answer you. I will do unto you great and mighty things&#8221; Jeremiah 33:3, &#8220;Come boldly unto the throne of grace, that you may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need&#8221; Hebrews 4:16. Call, come and trust, in faith!<\/p>\n<p>Like Apollo 13 crew who were on their way to the moon but encountered problems midair, which forced them to change their mission goal from that of landing in the moon to landing safely on earth, we too do encounter needs or problems which forces us to change course and seek help for safety and satisfaction. For Apollo 13 crew, when the recognized that they had problems which they could not solve by themselves, they immediately called for help from NASSA in HOUSTON, TEXAS. The unforgettable announcement of their problem and need for help is a very favorable quote of mine. When they called, they simply and clearly stated they had a problem:, &#8220;HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM&#8221; That call and admission of their inability to solve their problems is what led to the support team at the NASSA headquarters to work selflessly and relentlessly to save the lives of the astronauts. And they did. Christians too, can and should direct their request, when in need or having any small or serious problems, to the throne of God in heaven. That is where we can be helped. Call heaven today and say: &#8220;HEAVEN, I HAVE A PROBLEM&#8221; You will be amazed at how our high priest, Jesus Christ will respond to your situation. There is no impossible or hopeless situation He does not have an answer for. He specializes in impossibilities. He wants to meet all your needs according to his riches in glory&#8230; (Philippians 4:19). Know who you are and who He is and be alive in Him.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are a live.\u201d Author Unknown, Circa 1900 Relax, re-treat, refocus, and let God recycle and refine all your problems today. God bless you.

Here it is, Ev<\/p>\n<p> To God, That&#8217;s Easy: Frequently when one requests prayer, listing his ills, no matter how serious they are, may we delightedly exclaim, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s easy!&#8221;  &#8220;That&#8217;s easy for God&#8221;. In our personal lives, storms sometimes come that can shake us, and they have the potential to either train or destroy us. Often in such situations we allow the witness of our senses to become more powerful than Jesus, who has all authority. (see Matt. 28:18)<\/p>\n<p> The early disciples made the same mistake.  In one instance while they were crossing over, a storm arose.  Jesus was in the boat with them, but He was asleep.  They became terrified, certain they would die in the storm, and woke Jesus up (see Matt. 8:23-25) Jesus spoke and calmed the storm.  But He also reprimanded the disciples for their lack of faith (v.26), implying that if they had recognized His true power, they wouldn&#8217;t have feared.  After all, He was with them in the storm. <\/p>\n<p>When you are in the storm, it is often easier to hear the sound of the wind and see the waves of your circumstance than to stay focused on Jesus and the promises recorded in His word.  But we are called to &#8220;fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen&#8221;  For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal&#8221; (II Cor. 4:18) The Word of God tells us that &#8220;faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God&#8221; (Rom.10:17). When I&#8217;m facing a difficulty, a challenge that is not necessarily an obstacle.  At first it seems impossible, then it is difficult, then it is done!  Declare it:  Nothing shall be impossible to God in my life!<\/p>\n<p> You can&#8217;t deny what your senses tell you, but you can keep it in perspective. The storm is temporary!  What God has promised you is true, and it will be manifest in the natural as you stand in faith declaring the Word of God over your circumstance until faith becomes sight. Every difficulty is under the name of Jesus Christ.  When you hear reports that threaten to bring fear to your heart, respond with the Word of God that declare His point of view and realize, that whatever you are facing, to Him, &#8220;That&#8217;s easy!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p> Please do not feel that I am under emphasizing the severity of these particular storms, but this week pray in faith, believing that all things are not only possible, but easy for God.  Bring Him your greatest challenges and trust Him to meet every need.  (see II Cor. 6:1-10).  All that He is, He is for you! For as long as Jesus lives, there is hope; and we know He lives forever to make intercession for us.  It is as always a privilege to pray for you.<\/p>\n<p>In His love always, blessings Marti<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Let me share with you a devotion I received a while back by Marti, I hope it be an encouragement to you today.

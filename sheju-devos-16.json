But, for the life of me, I cannot recall the entire menu for a single one of those meals. But I do know this.. They all nourished me and gave me the strength I needed to do my work.

So many of us want good marriages and it scares us to death when we think of &#8220;what if it does not work as we expected it&#8221;. I would say I have heard more negativity about marriages than good and makes me wonder then I stop and look at the thriving marriages and I ask myself, what is their secret?. The more I wonder, the more I research, the more I want to learn, the more I want to exercise. Some things I have learned already is that, lovely marriage requires ACTION and ATTENTION. I discover that one the deadliest disease that kills marriages is withdrawal, lack of acceptance.<\/p>\n<p>Think of this, &#8220;the feelings of love towards your spouse in marriage will ALWAYS require your attention&#8221;. As my pastor preached on &#8220;reclaiming the virtue of love&#8221;, we learnt that in the bible, love always goes with service. So when I say &#8220;I LOVE you&#8221; in actuality I mean &#8220;I SERVE YOU&#8221;. This is an investment that yields high returns. This will happen through three things, TREASURING, GUARDING and NURTURING.<\/p>\n<p>TREASURE is considered precious and valuable. For you to have a successful marriage, you have to learn to treasure your spouse. You have to see her\/him as precious and valuable in your life and in your marriage. The moment you stop treasuring, there will be an element of withdrawal. There is a great need of acceptance as to who he\/she is. Loving (SERVING) him\/her in in a language he\/she understands rather than a language you understand. This goes far beyond feelings. Serve your spouse by treasuring him\/her.<\/p>\n<p>GUARD is to protect from harm. You can only guard what you treasure. Proverbs 4:23, &#8220;Keep (guard) your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life&#8221;. You can guard by what comes out of your mouth. We can be together and still feel vulnerable and exposed. Wives want to feel safe and guarded in the presence of their husbands. Harsh words springing from the heart fueled by anger strips that protection a wife craves for. Wives on the other hand can guard the self worth their husbands need. A husband&#8217;s number one supporter is his wife, the moment a husband feels exposed to critical attacks rather than being guarded by encouragements, there can be withdrawal. Who else can believe in him like his wife? How often do we hear husbands thanking their wives for believing in them and encouraging them to make it? You can serve your spouse by guarding him\/her<\/p>\n<p>What you TREASURE and GUARD requires NURTURING. NURTURING is the ability to help grow or develop. This is investing even more as you realize that you are not bound to stay in the same place forever. A travel in this life leads to discovery every day. Dreamers who want something better therefore they look for ways and avenues to explore as they discover more. Marriage is also a daily discovery. As a gardener nurtures the growing flower, digging around it, watering it, the gardener is giving the flower a chance to unfold it&#8217;s inner beauty that would not come if not nurtured. You can nurture hope, the expectation of good even in the midst of tough things. You can serve your spouse by nurturing him\/her.<\/p>\n<p>Trasuring, guarding and nurturing are some means of loving (serving). If married or in a relationship, ask yourself, do you treasure your spouse, marriage? Do you guard by all means? Are you nurturing each other that you may blossom even more? There is still more work to do, serve each other.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,Proverbs 4:23, &#8220;Keep (guard) your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life&#8221;.

I thank God that He gives us diversified gifts and when we talk about gifts, they are not things worked for or earned, but things bestowed to one. Some have been blessed by looks, energy to do massive works, have the capability to love the unlovable, can teach, good listeners, good encouragers, wisdom to name a few. All these are gifts and not everyone around us has all of them, the gift I have may not be the gift you have but all these gifts tie and bring us together that God maybe glorified. Peninnah is provoking Hannah in the wrong way, God sees this an opportunity to raise the un expected for that which He brings is already blessed.<\/p>\n<p>We might be mad at Peninnah for doing such horrible things but I would pause for a sec and thank God for her for doing such things. Your rivals put you in a better place to call on God even more, Hannah prayed more because she had a rival, She spent much time before God because of her rival. She learnt more about faith, learnt how to pray effectively and she learnt how to praise God more through her rival. When Joseph met his brothers after terrible things happened in his life and finally God elevated him and said, &#8220;you meant it for evil but God made it for good&#8221;. We know of how God remembered Hannah and blessed her with a male child and he became a prophet who anointed the first king of Israel and did great things. Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Peninnah did not provoke her? how about Leah who provoked Rachel day and night, she provoked her until God saw how she was being treated and remembered her by opening her womb and Joseph is born. Have you wondered what would have happened if Joseph was not born, sold into Egypt and becomes the no. 2 man in Egypt and later saving the entire Israel?<\/p>\n<p>I thank God for my rivals who provoke me by their words and some who provoke me by their actions, they have caused me to believe there is more that God wants to do, they have taught me more on faith, praying by faith, praying effectively and looking to God for whatever they are doing is working for my good. Romans 8:28, &#8220;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them that are called according to His purpose&#8221;. All things (good things, bad things), they all work together for our good but mark the last part of it, it only works for those who are called according to His purpose. Someone&#8217;s hate and anger could be your point of blessing. Someone&#8217;s backbiting could be the means God would raise you up for all they are doing is working for your good. It doesn&#8217;t just work for any one but to those who are called. I believe that after the episode of Hannah, Rachel, and Joseph, they must have said, we are glad we went through that, yes it was painful but we are better people now. Psalm 119:71, &#8220;It&#8217;s good for me to have been afflicted, that I might learn your statutes&#8221;, Psalm 34:19, &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord shall deliver him out of them all. You might not like your rivals but guess what, they are your best friends for they will shape you into the image of Christ and a what a blessing to know that someone pushed you to the next level with all their hate and anger, they actually made away for you to be used of God, helped you produce greater things the Lord always wanted to do in your life. Your rival only awakened you to a greater destiny, take the hint!!<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<br \/>\nEv<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,1Samuel 1:7, &#8220;So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, that she (Peninnah) provoked her&#8221; Peninnah is out to provoke Hannah who is more loved than her but on the other hand she is blessed by the fruits of the womb.

He set these things on motion cycle and gave them different seasons and He caused them to survive in every season they were in.<\/p>\n<p>We as believers have also been set on motion to go through different seasons. Just like we have winter, autumn, spring and winter we also have our own seasons. During summer time, we can see the leaves on the tree blossom and during winter time, we see the leaves fall off the tree and many times someone might think that the trees are dead but the truth of the matter is, they very a live preparing for their next season. There are times when spiritually we blossom and there are times when we are dry, there are times when everything we touch turns to gold and there are times when nothing is going right. I don&#8217;t know of anyone who has been in one season forever. The good thing about going through different seasons, you learn to survive and adapt with much or with little. Anytime you can go through different seasons and make it, you will always find yourself being content in whichever place you are at. Mark this, &#8220;Your move to the next season is determined by how you handle your current season&#8221;. I want to use some seasons as stepping stones to get me to the next season.<\/p>\n<p>Since all of us might not be in the same seasons, I would rejoice with them that are in their good season and trust God for my good season instead of questioning why I am in it and my friend is not. It&#8217;s amazing that God would trust me enough with such a tough season the reason I want to make the best out of it while still in it for I know I&#8217;m in motion. Not only will I want to rejoice with those who are in their good season, I want to be able to stand with those who are in their bad season too cause sure enough they need all the encouragement they can get from us. I believe that this is why the Lord brings His people together for He has set them up for different seasons to help each other make it. Eccle 4:9, &#8220;Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, one will lift up his companion. But woe to him who is alone when he falls, For he has no one to help him up&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Make good use of the season in which you are in.<\/p>\n<p>blessings<br \/>\nEv<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morningGenesis 8:22, &#8220;While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease&#8221; When God created the heaven and earth, He created some things once and let them reproduce over and over again.

They were limited by facts but here comes Caleb who is not denying the evidence of facts, he understands that faith goes beyond facts. His faith is based on the promise God gave to the children of Israel despite what the facts said. He says, &#8220;Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it.&#8221; A man of faith ready to exercise faith now in the presence of facts.<\/p>\n<p>Of late I have had facts stare me in the eye giving faith a little or no avenue.

What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me? Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers? Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, &#8216;Give us meat to eat!&#8217; I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.  If this is how you are going to treat me, put me to death right now-if I have found favor in your eyes-and do not let me face my own ruin.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Despite the fact that Moses felt that the burden was too heavy for him, God doesn&#8217;t tell Moses that He will remove the burden from Moses&#8217; shoulders.  Instead God is going to share the burden and take some of the weight of the burden off Moses shoulders.  God summons Moses and, &#8220;The LORD said to Moses: &#8220;Bring me seventy of Israel&#8217;s elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you. I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them. They will help you carry the burden of the people so that you will not have to carry it alone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>God knew that Moses&#8217; had the right spirit for the task at hand, but that Moses&#8217; spirit needed to be upon others if Moses was going to last in the long hall and not burn out.  Moses wanted the Lord to actually take his life &#8211; he wanted to die!  The spirit that was upon Moses was the Spirit of God fleshed out in the life of Moses.  By God&#8217;s Spirit Moses applied his faith and defied the Pharaoh, called down plagues, opened the Red Sea and went through it on dry ground. This was the spirit that God would place upon others to preserve His servant Moses.  Elijah&#8217;s spirit rested upon Elisha, and now Moses&#8217; spirit would rest upon the seventy.  Just as the proof of Elisha have Elijah&#8217;s spirit upon him shown in the parting of the Jordan, Moses spirit upon the seventy would be manifested in their prophesying.<\/p>\n<p>God saw fit to take Moses&#8217; spirit and place it upon others to accomplish His work.  Would God take your spirit and place it upon others?  What kind of spirit do you have?  Perhaps you&#8217;ve not defied a Pharaoh, or parted a sea, but there are some things perhaps that you have done by the hand of God that have been amazing.  This whole thing as well is the process of discipleship, ones spirit being imparted by the Lord upon another.  Allow God to work on your spirit that he may place it upon others.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<br \/>\nPastor Phil <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good Morning, &#8220;And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.

Every believer is vulnerable to attack. We saw Jesus being attacked by the devil in the wilderness. If a guy tells you that if you are going to be His disciple you have to pick up your cross and follow Him daily, check at what happened to Him when He picked His and you will understand what is going to happen to you when you pick up yours. When I looked at what Christ had to go through and I saw myself going through the same things I almost panicked because it was just too much but when rose from the grave I understood that if He could make it and come out, I too can because He has called me His own.<\/p>\n<p>When He died, He stormed into the kingdom of the enemy and made chaos in that kingdom, took the keys of death from the enemy and rendered him powerless. We have been equipped to storm into the devil&#8217;s kingdom and tear it down but if you are yoked, there is no way to break free. I don&#8217;t believe that Christians can be devil possessed but the truth is Christians can be devil oppressed. The difference between the two words is this, possessed in other words is owned or overcome while oppressed in other words is dominated which is the opposite of liberty. The bible says, &#8220;it shall come to pass in that day that his burden will be taken away from your shoulder&#8221; the burdens are the baggage&#8217;s, the heavy stuffs the enemy puts on believers to oppress them. Stuff put on the shoulder does not cause anyone to walk straight but walk bent. You cannot walk faster and you cannot be happy simply because you are so much oppressed by baggage&#8217;s of fear, anxiety, confusion, frustration, stress you name it. The good news is that there is hope for it will come PASS in that day which is now that the burden will be taken off our shoulders. But that is not enough, the next thing &#8220;And his yoke from your neck&#8221;. The yoke in the text is considered as a controlling device for when you look at the bulls with yokes on their necks, they are limited to directions they can go, not only that, they are yoked to something else that controls their movement and how sad it is to know that some believers are in the same dilemma being controlled by this kind of yoke.<\/p>\n<p>I thank God for the anointing that destroys the yoke of the enemy. I have been wondering why the bible did not use the word BREAK but DESTORY. I began to understand that if it&#8217;s broken, someone can put it back together but if it&#8217;s destroyed, it can never be put back together. Are you feeling like you are oppressed and need freedom, God is in control and He desires to set His children free from oppression. The bible says that whomsoever the son sets free is free indeed. I refuse to be the devils little toy he can control and manipulate partially because 2Cor 10:4&amp;5, &#8220;for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds, casting down imaginations and anything that exalt itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity under the obedience of Christ&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I could stop here with the anointing breaking the yoke and being free but I can&#8217;t for there is still a little problem leaving it at this stage. Remember Jesus was tempted and He overcame in the wilderness but the devil left him for a season? well if you are loosed from and not led to, the devil will only leave you for a season and then come back. We have been loosed from the yoke of the enemy, now lets take the yoke of the Lord, Mathew 11:28-30, &#8220;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. At times the devil does not mind someone being loosed from for he knows he can leave him for sometime and come back but when you decide to be led to, he can&#8217;t handle that.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<br \/>\nEv<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,Isaiah 10:27, &#8220;It shall come to pass in that day that his burden will taken away from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil&#8221; Saints, we are in a spiritual warfare whether you believe it or not.

(2 Kings 2:15)<\/p>\n<p>Elisha was like the vice-present prophet in the days of Elijah.  He was chosen by Elijah, and through the time spent together craved the spirit that was upon Elijah.  Before being taken up in a chariot of fire by a whirlwind of God, Elijah asked to Elisha, &#8220;Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?&#8221; To which Elisha replied, &#8220;Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit.&#8221;  Elisha didn&#8217;t want a material possession of Elisha.  He wanted that which can only come through impartation, Elijah&#8217;s spirit.<\/p>\n<p>Elijah has just been taken up by God, and Elisha &#8220;picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.  Then he took the cloak that had fallen from him and struck the water with it. &#8220;Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?&#8221; he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over.  WOW!  He wanted to know if God was going to be with him, in the power that God was with Elijah.  He craved Elijah&#8217;s spirit and wanted to know if he had received the double portion that he desired.  He had a cloak in is hand (tangible), but did he have the spirit (intangible)?  At one time Elijah had placed the cloak upon Elisha when he first chose Elisha to follow him as his disciple (1 Kings 19:19-21).  The cloak (mantle) was once placed symbolically upon him, but now it would be upon him permanently.<\/p>\n<p>Elisha retraces the steps of his master and goes back to the Jordan to perform the exact same miracle that Elijah had done by parting the waters of the Jordan (2 Kings 2:8).  He strikes the water with the cloak and the water divided.  Then the company of prophets who were watching said, &#8220;THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH IS RESTING UPON ELISHA.  And they went to meet him and BOWED TO THE GROUND.&#8221;  Elisha wasn&#8217;t trying to make a spectacle of himself, he was just exercising by faith the &#8220;proof&#8221; of the spirit that was upon him by putting his faith to the test.  If the spirit was truly upon him, it would be evident. Elisha didn&#8217;t brag or boast, he simply asked and believed.  The impartation was clearly recognizable to the prophets that knew Elijah. They bowed in reverence to the chief prophet Elisha.<\/p>\n<ul>Whose spirit do you have upon you?  Are there things in you good or bad that you have received from someone else imparting into you.  Do you like that character that you currently have?<\/ul>\n<ul>Whose spirit do others recognize to be upon you?  Is that spirit godly?   If the spirit upon your &#8220;Elijah&#8221; was godly, then the spirit imparted should reflect their spirit in you.  The phrase &#8220;I am with you in spirit,&#8221; certainly has some truth to it.  Just be wise as to the spirit that is upon you.<\/ul>\n<ul>Who are you imparting your spirit to?

When you apply for a job, you want to know whether there are<br \/>\nbenefits that come with the job package. So even with us Christians,<br \/>\nthere are benefits that come with salvation, all we need to do is know<br \/>\nwhat they are. As you read Psalms 103:3 going down, you will see some<br \/>\nof these benefits.

He will take out the corrupted<br \/>\nfiles, delete temp files as they are baggages, check for viruses (fear,<br \/>\ndoubt, anger, frustrations etc) that will hinder the software from<br \/>\nworking and do the job.

Blessed be my rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The God whom we serve is an Extraordinary God. He can take any shape or form and still be effective in whatever He has chosen to do at any given time. At one point He went before the Israelites by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire. Therefore if He is wind, He is moving wind; If He is waves, He is crushing waves; If He is water, He is living water and If He is fire, He is a consuming fire. The Lord is awesome to appear in anyway and still be effective in what He is doing. With this in mind, in the bible people especially David personalized Him in his situations and saw the Lord in a form to suit what he was dealing with at that given time. What is the Lord to you this morning?<\/p>\n<p>David learnt the secret of personalizing God in every situation he found himself in and over and over we hear him say &#8220;MY&#8221;, MY fortress, MY shield, MY comfort, MY salvation, MY horn, MY strength. Sounds selfish but not quite because when you know who your God is to you and you begin to personalize your relationship to Him, you are convinced of His cares for you. When He looks at the world, yes He does see people as collective but right in the middle of it, He can see you exactly where you are. He is concerned about your needs and problems. The bible says that He has curved us in the palm of His hands, He knows our down sitting and our up rising. He is familiar with our ways. Mathew 10:30, &#8220;But the very hairs in your head are all numbered&#8221;, this sums up everything that God knows about us. I can&#8217;t even tell when I loose one hair or if I saw hair on the floor, I wouldn&#8217;t tell if it came from my head but He does. I can&#8217;t even count them but He does and knows how many they are, He has numbered them. That is the God we serve, the God who knows everything about us from day one to the last day of our lives. He is the same God who has set up a destiny for each of us. Can you imagine someone who has already set up a place in history for you to fit in? From the day He thought about bring you into the world before anyone thought about it, He already set up a plan and a purpose for everyone not as a unit but as individuals.<\/p>\n<p>Because He knows us and we know Him, we can confidently personalize Him in every situation. If you are in need this morning, Philippians 4:19, &#8220;But MY God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus&#8221;. So God is the supplier of my needs. Psalm 3:3, &#8220;For thou oh Lord are a shield for ME, the glory and the lifter of MY head&#8221;, He is My shield and He lifts My head. Psalm 46:1, &#8220;God is MY refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&#8221;, Job 19:25, &#8220;I know MY Redeemer lives&#8221;, O Lord MY God, In You I put my trust&#8221;, Psalm 16:5, &#8220;O Lord, You are the portion of MY inheritance and MY cup; You maintain MY lot&#8221;. God is for us, He is ours. Everything we need He has and because of that, the relationship I have with Him causes me to understand that as just as He is something to someone else, He is the same to me. He maybe YOUR healer this morning because you need healing, to me, He might be MY peace because I need peace.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 46:18, &#8220;The Lord lives! Blessed be my rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted&#8221;. I love the way this verse starts, &#8220;The Lord Lives (TLL)&#8221;, this is powerful as we are reminded that we are not dealing with a dead God but a living God who knows what it feels to deal with situations, He cares, He has compassion, He has feelings. I know God is a live and well, because I spoke with Him this morning. He is not in the tomb anymore but a live forever more concerned with the affairs of MY life. Following, &#8220;Blessed be my rock&#8221;, David might have been dealing with something that He did not require healing or joy or confidence. All he needed at this particular time was for God to be his rock, with that he personalized it &#8220;MY ROCK&#8221;. His rock could prevent winds from sweeping him away, a place of refuge, a place to hide, the rock that crushes the enemy&#8217;s head, the rock that cannot be moved or shaken. David needed all these so He called His Lord MY ROCK. What are you dealing with today that you will want the Lord to be for you? call on Him!!. David called him a blessed Rock knowing that when God shows up, everything will be alright. &#8220;Let the God of my salvation be exalted&#8221;, meanwhile while He is to me what I am dealing with, Let Him be exalted. Who will exalt Him but the person in the situation. The bible says that if we don&#8217;t praise Him, the rocks will cry out in our place. The rocks don&#8217;t need Him. For David in return was to exalt the Lord, Psalm 34:1, &#8220;I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in MY mouth&#8221;. Can you see that because He personalized the Lord in His situation, when it came to time of praise, He didn&#8217;t have to wait for a crowd to show up to help Him praise Him, he did it himself. Watch this, MY stands for &#8220;ME, YOU (LORD)&#8221;. LET HIM BE YOUR&#8230;. blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,Psalm 18:46, &#8220;The Lord lives!

Godliness is not an option, but a command from the Lord.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>2.\u00a0\u00a0Emotional Health<\/h2>\n<p>It is important to ensure that both are in good emotional health in preparation of marriage. Share your thoughts, experiences and concerns in this area.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comfort and encouragement : How do you receive comfort? How do you give encouragement? You should know how to comfort and encourage each other.<\/li>\n<li>Death and grieving : Is either of you currently going through a time of grieving following the recent loss of a loved one? If so, do not rush into a relationship, but allow time for the one grieving to come to terms with the situation.<\/li>\n<li>Depression : Is either one of you prone to recurring\/frequent bouts of depression? What cause this? What remedies are being taken? How will this be handled after marriage?<\/li>\n<li>Overcoming the past : Does either of you come from a troubled past (e.g. child abuse, broken family, traumatic childhood experiences, previous relationships, etc.)? Have these been dealt with? How will these affect your marriage?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When guilt gets a hold of you, it can make you feel like you&#8217;re trapped in a tunnel of despair. Feelings of anger or pain often lead to bitterness, and they can keep you from attaining goals, achieving intimacy with others and finding peace. But past trauma or suffering does not have to lead to a lifetime of failure.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stress : How does each of you relieve stress (e.g. taking a quiet walk, listening to music, need to be left alone, etc.)? Understand how to allow the other person to de-stress.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>3.\u00a0Finances, Time and Career<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Choosing\/changing careers : Will either of you be taking on\/changing careers after or just prior to marriage? Discuss these plan openly, to the extent things are known at this point in time, so that there are no \u201csurprises\u201d after marriage.<\/li>\n<li>Debt : Is either of you in debt? If so how much? How will this debt be paid of? Will the other person have to contribute financially to help pay off the debt, after marriage?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Debt hinders our ability to live freely, and it can affect everything from our personal relationships to our physical, emotional and spiritual health.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Money management<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8211; Move away from the &#8220;his and hers&#8221; mentality and toward a more unified approach to money<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Set realistic financial goals<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Discover the joy in honoring God with your finances. Both must be committed to giving your tithe to the local church.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Who will be primarily responsible in handling money? How will the income be distributed and shared? How will household and other expenses be met?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time management<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8211; Daily Devotional Time : How will each of you maintain your daily devotional time?<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Set goals : set realistic goals for yourselves e.g. when you would like to have children, when you would like to invest in property, etc.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Be organized<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Keep the Lord&#8217;s Day : Commitment to be at the local church regularly.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Maintain balance between work, family and Christian ministry : discuss how you will plan to do this together.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working at home : Will either of you be working from home? Then set guidelines to permit this to happen, making it clear what are \u201coffice\u201d hours and what are \u201cfamily\u201d hours.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>4.\u00a0\u00a0HealthyMarital Relationships<\/h2>\n<p>Communication<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; A common reason for frustration in marriage is a breakdown in communication.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Communication in a marriage is crucial to its success.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Share with each other your strengths and weaknesses in this area? How can you improve? How can the other person help you communicate? What are your likes\/dislikes with the other person\u2019s way of communication at this point in time?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In-law relationships : Clearly define boundaries in your relationships with each others family after marriage. The general guideline is to maintain a \u201chealthy distance\u201d with family members. No family member must be allowed to interfere with your marriage and decision making. This is especially important if either one comes from a home where parent(s) have been key decision makers and the \u201cumbilical cord\u201d has not been cut yet!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Will you be living with family members? If so what guidelines can you set to ensure that others do not intrude (knowingly or unknowingly) into your marriage?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>Marriage is for a lifetime : Understand that you are about to enter into a commitment for a lifetime. Marriage in not an experiment and divorce is not an option.<\/li>\n<li>Managing anger : How will either of you express your anger or dissatisfaction about something in your marriage relationship?<\/li>\n<li>Roles in marriage : Clearly define and understand each other\u2019s roles in marriage. The husband is the head, but the wife is a co-heir and must be heard and involved in decision making. How will responsibility be distributed for various things, e.g. to provide for the home, for the spiritual growth of the family, for running of the home, for the bringing up of the children, etc.<\/li>\n<h2>5.\u00a0\u00a0Relationship Challenges<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Abuse : Understand that no form of abuse \u2013 physical, mental or other wise is acceptable. Make a commitment that under no circumstance will either of you resolve to abuse of the other in your marriage.<\/li>\n<li>Employment separation : Will either of you have to relocate or live separately after your marriage due to employment reasons? As a general guideline, we suggest that at no point in your marriage should husband and wife live separately for any reason (employment, vacation, etc.) for a period beyond 3 months at a stretch. Many extra-marital affairs happen simply because this general guideline is not followed.<\/li>\n<li>Addictions (drugs\/alcohol\/gambling, etc.) : is either of you bound to any form of addiction, those listed here or any other? You must make a decision to renounce these before you enter into marriage.<\/li>\n<li>Infidelity : Unfaithfulness in marriage is unacceptable.<\/li>\n<li>Separation \/ Divorce : These are last resort measures in the worst situations and must not be a part of your thought or speech. Refuse to make such statements \u201cleave this house now\u201d or \u201cget out of this house\u201d, \u201cI will divorce you\u201d or \u201cI will leave and go stay with my parents\u201d, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>6.\u00a0\u00a0Sexuality<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Intimacy : Once you are married, you must learn to enjoy sex with each other. Sex was designed by God for enjoyment and fulfillment. It is a godly thing when performed within the boundaries of marriage. You must learn to give yourself unreservedly to your spouse.<\/li>\n<li>Pregnancy : Discuss when you would like to have children, and how many? Discuss measures you will take to avoid pregnancy until such time. What measure you would take to avoid pregnancy once you have had the desired number of children?<\/li>\n<li>Infertility and miscarriage : Decide what you would do in the case of infertility or marriage. The most important thing to do is to believe God for an answer.<\/li>\n<li>Abortion : Understand that abortion is not acceptable to God and must be allowed only when the life of the mother is in danger.<\/li>\n<li>Sexual addiction (pornography\/masturbation\/homosexuality\/sexually explicit movies\/etc.) : Once you are married, all your sexual needs are to be met within your marriage and by your spouse. You must make a commitment not to look elsewhere \u2013 to other people or to other things for sexual fulfillment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>7. Christian Calling &amp; Ministry<\/h2>\n<p>As a Christian, this is the most important are where you need to ensure agreement. While the minimum requirement is that the other person also be a believer &#8211; this is insufficient to build a strong Christian marriage. We firmly believe that both must be spiritually compatible, that is of similar spiritual passion, intensity, maturity, calling and desire to serve God. While there may be slight differences in maturity levels, ideally you should find some one who is of same spiritual passion, intensity, calling to serve God as yourself.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spiritual growth : Plan how you will ensure continued spiritual growth of each other and your children (when they come).<\/li>\n<li>Calling : As believers, each one has a place and function in the Body of Christ. Share with the other what you have come to understand as God\u2019s calling on your life. How can the other help you fulfill that calling?<\/li>\n<li>Ministry couples : Are there areas of your individual callings that are complementary \u2013 where you can work together in doing things for God\u2019s kingdom? This is very important, because together you can do a lot for God\u2019s kingdom. Determine these areas and develop ideas on how you can serve\/minister together.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amos 3:3\u00a0 \u201cCan two walk together, except they be agreed?

Elisha requested one things of his master, &#8220;Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,&#8221; he said.  In short Elisha said, &#8220;I want to be like you, and continue to have the influence that you had.  I want to have a double portion of your spirit, your character, your influence.  Give me your spirit that I may magnify you, and others will recognize your spirit in me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Is there anyone that you admire such that you would like to be like them?  What is it about their character, their influence, their treatment of others, their words, etc&#8230; that draws you to them?  Do you spend a lot of time with them?  This is where Elisha found himself with Elijah.  In an age that is very set on self, it is unpopular perhaps to want to have ones life modeled after another.  Elisha was not losing his identity in light of Elijah&#8217;s in wanting to have his spirit, but rather his identity was influenced by a godly man and he was not ashamed to show it.<\/p>\n<p>Is there anyone that desires to be like you?  Is there anyone that looks up to you with such high esteem?  Apart from titles, positions, do you see that there are those that seem to hang around you often?  Is there someone that seems to &#8220;pick your brain,&#8221; a lot, do some want to hear how you would handle a matter?  To say again, &#8220;the greatest form of emulation is imitation.&#8221;  Who are you spending time with to influence.  Who is gaining your spirit, and is your spirit worth gaining.

We hope the Lord has continued to bless each of you through morning devotions. We are blessed to minister to hundreds of you all over the world. We will back with you next Tuesday. Be blessed, stay blessed Ev  But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law\u2026\u201d Gal 4:4  God\u2019s timing is truly an awesome thing.    During this Christmas time, may the story of the birth of Christ never grow old for you, because there is so much that I am realizing lately in the account that we miss.   I pray each of you is reading God\u2019s word daily and therefore these things will bear witness wit your spirit.  \u201cWhen the fullness of time was come, God sent forth His son\u2026\u201d  God saw fit, that the time had come to NOW send forth Jesus to fulfill the three offices of the Old Testament which are the prophet, the priest, and the King.  God brought Jesus into the world to fulfill three offices, which were initially executed by three different persons, by One person, the person of Jesus Christ.  The prophet was the one that spoke to the people on behalf of God.  God would choose someone from among the landscape of His people that he would use as a sound system to bring His word to their ears.  The prophet was involved in foretelling (future) and forth telling (current).  When Jesus Christ came on the scene He was both the prophet and the Message itself, as the Scripture reads, \u201cAnd the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (Jn 1:14).\u201d  There were many prophets through history, but they all died, and therefore God would need to raise a new prophet.  But when Jesus came into this world He fulfilled the office as the eternal prophet.  Not only did Jesus fulfill the prophetic role, but also the office of priest.  The priest spoke to God on behalf of the people. It was the priest that brought the sacrifice to God for the people, so that God could grant forgiveness for the sin of Israel.  In Hebrews the author proclaims of Jesus that \u201cCalled of God a high priest for ever after order of Melchisedec.  The many former OT priests died as well, \u2018But this man [Jesus] because he continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood\u2026Who needs not daily, as those high priests to offer sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people\u2019s:  for this he did once, when he offered up himself (5:10; 7:24,27).\u201d  Jesus didn\u2019t only offer the sacrifice as the priest, but He was the sacrifice once and for all which is why he said, \u201cIt is finished on the cross.\u201d           Finally besides fulfilling the office of prophet and priest, he also fulfilled the office of King. Matthew 2 tells us that the wise men (kings) came from the east to Jerusalem to worship \u201cHe that is born King of the Jews.\u201d  Jesus&#8217; participation in the Davidic dynasty has already been established by the genealogy, but God would bring a King out of little Bethlehem (see Mic. 5:2, Isa. 9:6, 7).  The King had both authority and glory.  Paul writes, \u201cNow to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen (1 Tim 1:17).\u201d He was the King and the glory and ultimate authority of the King.  Viewed theologically, however, it may also be said that the time was full because God himself had filled it with meaning.  Jesus is the Eternal Prophet, Eternal Priest, and the Eternal King.  Application:  Because Jesus fulfilled the three offices of priest, prophet and king will you respond to Him in these ways.  First confess your sin daily and pray for others, second share your faith regularly, and thirdly worship the King daily in intimacy and adoration.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Pastor Phil, Dad Boaz and myself would like to take this time to wish you all a Merry Christmas.

Spinal cord is part of the nervous system cordlike structures, which are made up of nerve fibers. They are the nerves that carry most of the messages from the brain to the body and vice versa. We can tell that it&#8217;s a communication system of the body which includes sensory, motor and autonomic functions. Whoever has spinal injury is always left paralyzed from the waist down. This would mean that the command center has no communication with the legs. The command is there but the communication is missing hence leading to loss of motion or feeling in the lower parts of the body especially on the legs. It looks and sounds small but very vital.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell what the man in the scriptures had but we can conclude that he had some type of spinal injury and because of that, he was impotent. He could think, reason, and know the season when the water was troubled but his condition would not allow him to move. There was a command but no communication, and that left him in his condition for many years. He gambled with his life hoping that one day he would be lucky to jump in the pool when water was troubled but for 38 years nothing happened, waited to hit a jackpot but year after year he was in the same place. At times I find myself in places and situations for too long. I want to move, I send commands to move but the communication to that part is missing. Paul says, &#8220;The things I should do I don&#8217;t do but the things I shouldn&#8217;t do are the ones I do&#8221;(paraphrased).<\/p>\n<p>This is being impotent, want to be free from certain things of the world. You promise yourself that next time you will rise but the command is not sending the message to the legs to move and change locations, how frustrating. What happens when you have waited for too long and nothing is happening? Discouragement comes in and before long if nothing completely happens one gets numb to the situation.<\/p>\n<p>However long someone has been into a situation like this, there is still hope. There is hope for the hopeless; there is no need to fear. When all hope is gone, Christ will be there. When you can&#8217;t reach Him, He will find and reach you by the pool where you are waiting for luck. The impotence can be made important because the Lord is not done with you yet. What has been carrying you will be the thing that you will carry when it&#8217;s said and done. He can restore that spine and the command will cause the communication to reach that part which was impotent. That is why I thank God for prayers &#8217;cause it allows Him to restore me to the point that every part of my being  can function effectively. When I pray, my faith is boosted to attempt the impossible, resist sin, make wise moves and be responsible. This causes me be an asset and not a liability. Prayer is the communication that activates God&#8217;s commands in a situation, Psalms 37:23, &#8220;The steps (goes with legs) of a good man are ordered (commanded) by the Lord, and He delights in his way,&#8221;. I can now see that when I have that communication, the commands from Him will reach my legs and cause me to move. Those who have no prayer life have spinal injury and need healing. It may look small and insignificant but check again. Without a prayer life, one becomes impotent sitting in place forever. You could do greater things that you could never do by yourself because you have a communication through prayer, Mark 11:24, &#8220;&#8230;whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The command (from God) is always there, all you and I need is that communication (prayer) restored that our impotent prayer life can be made important.

We are blessed to know that God has given us favor with you and around the world. Do not cease to pray for Pastor Phil and I. This is a great task and we need God&#8217;s intervention everyday. We&#8217;ve been blessed to have typed over 800 messages, God receives all the glory. Even with that, we still need a fresh word from the Lord to share with you. Let me share with you a devo I shared back in 2002, I pray you will be blessed<\/p>\n<p>Please enter with into transformation chamber with me. I remember a couple of years back there was a cartoon always on TV called the transformers. My brothers loved it cause of how these cartoons would transform themselves into something extraordinary, supernatural, and powerful. This transformation allowed them to fight more powerful enemies. Transformation was the process of developing them from something they were (small) into something they were not (Big), 1John 3:2, \u201c\u2026Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. This verse talks about how we shall be like Him when He appears meaning we shall be transformed into His image that we may see things as He sees them, treat people like He does, be holy as He is and the like. He continues to say in John 15:15&amp;16, \u201c Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you\u201d. We\u2019ve passed being other people\u2019s door marts (servants) or in some other word slaves to be in the level of being called friends. A friend is always let inside, he is shown around, he is cared for, loved, respected and knows the secrets. Our zeal and drive now is not to please man anymore but God. When we understand who we are, what we are destined to be, we are transformed to be what Creator wants us to be. All the transformation begins in the mind as Paul tells the Romans, \u201c\u2026but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind\u2026. Paul understood that if the mind can be transformed, the entire body and destiny could be changed. The bible says that as a man thinks in his heart so is he. Think defeat and you will be, think failure and boy it will come. Think victory, sure enough it will knock on your door for once again the word of God says in, 1John 5:4, &#8220;He that is born of God overcomes the world, this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith&#8221;.\u00a0 If you can begin to call those things which are not as though they were and begin to allow yourself to go through the process of transformation, you are in the right track my friend. I shall be what the Lord said I will be in spite of who I am today, for who I am today is not my end but my beginning. I\u2019m not designed to remain in the same place forever, I am a transformer!!!<\/p>\n<p>I pray that you will begin to think about what you have read, prove them to be true, adjust your life and get in line for your life is in God\u2019s hand. People may change the name of the package but they can never change it\u2019s content. You and I are called to be transformers, let us be transformers.Blessings Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, There is a website in India posting our devotions <a href=\"http:\/\/mahalife.com\/CMS\/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/mahalife.com\/CMS\/index.php<\/a>.

Some we bring upon ourselves and some find us but regardless of how it comes about, the answer is till the same.<\/p>\n<p>Jonah decided to disobey God by going the opposite direction as to what the Lord had instructed him. And the Lord would not let him go because He had invested in him to be the one to carry the word to Nineveh. Upon deciding to go to Tarshis, later we find that the Lord sent a storm in the sea and later he was thrown into the sea. Some could say the Lord was trying to kill him but I see that God was trying to show Him who is God. The sea should have killed him but listen to this Jonah 1:17, &#8220;Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights&#8221;. What a way to humble a man of God, being swallowed by a fish. His freedom taken away, his pride crushed, his sense of ability limited and all he is left with is to focus on the One he was running away from. He was running away because he got it together, with situation being unbearable, he called on God. Why did he not call on God when the storm was fears, or when they threw him into sea or the first or second day in the belly of the fish? Because man has a tendency of still trying to lead and fix their lives till they come to a dead end then they remember the Lord.\u00a0 Jonah says, &#8220;I cried out to the LORD because of my affliction&#8221;, I thank the Lord because my afflictions allow me to get closer as I call on Him. Now Jonah did cry in the midst of the yuck (belly of a fish) and God heard him and out of the belly of the fish did Jonah come forth. Vs 4, Then I said, &#8220;I have been cast out of Your sight;\u00a0 Yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>He went to Nineveh to fulfill his assignment, he believed God to bring Him out of the situation and now He was going to be an ambassador for the Lord, John 7:38, &#8220;&#8230;as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water&#8221;. His belly did not have the right water till he found himself in another belly, a belly of death yet preserved.\u00a0 The reason he did not want to go to Nineveh was because though he was going to preach future punishment, he knew if the people repented, God would pardon their sins. He did not want that for the people of Nineveh until he also found himself in a place where he messed up and where he had to cry to the Lord to be pardoned. I don&#8217;t know about you but my living water of ministry, encouragements, teaching, preaching came about after having an experience in the belly of some type of fish. The experience taught me new and valuable lessons I could never learn in a classroom. I can now preach for God to pardon people&#8217;s sins because mine has been pardoned. Out of me can flow living water because He flows in and through me. So if you are in the belly of some fish this morning, cry out to Him for deliverance, let Him set the living water out of that experience and then be an ambassador for Him in whichever Nineveh He places you in because out of a belly you came forth and from your belly you shall flow.

It just happened to be a 2000-step process&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1940s, another young inventor named Chester Carlson took his idea to 20 corporations, including some of the biggest in the country. They all turned him down. In 1947, after 7 long years of rejections, he finally got a tiny company in Rochester, NY, the Haloid Company, to purchase the rights to his invention&#8211;an electrostatic paper-copying process. Haloid became Xerox Corporation.<\/p>\n<p>A little girl&#8211;the 20th ! of 22 children, was born prematurely and her survival was doubtful.

In the blockbuster movie Braveheart, William Wallace played by Mel Gibson Director of the Passion of the Christ was speaking to the people of Scotland that he is rallying together. He said, &#8220;Aye, fight and you may die, run, and you&#8217;ll live&#8230; at least for a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing&#8217; to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they&#8217;ll never take&#8230; OUR FREEDOM!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Our enemies will try and take things from us sometimes those enemies may be our own family members or those that are close to us. This is precisely the predicament that Joseph found himself in twice during his life. Joseph was the favored son, and jealousy brewed among his brothers toward him. Eventually his brothers sell him as a slave and take the robe he was wearing. Joseph was unlike his brothers both in his attitude and character. Although they took his robe, they couldn&#8217;t take Joseph&#8217;s character or attitude from him. People can take the temporal things, but they cannot take the eternal things, such as our character from us.<\/p>\n<p>Then Joseph is brought to Egypt as a slave and his gift and godly character cause him to rise up in Pharaoh&#8217;s ranks, second only to Pharaoh. He found himself in a compromising position with the Pharaoh&#8217;s wife who wanted to have sex with him. Genesis 39:10 reads, &#8220;And it came about as she spoke to Joseph day after day, that he didn&#8217;t listen to her to lie beside her her, ot be with her.&#8221; However, one day &#8220;She caught him by his cloak and said, &#8220;Come to bed with me!&#8221; But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Like Joseph&#8217;s brothers she took a piece of clothing from Joseph. When he ran from her he had his character and integrity fully in tact, because that she couldn&#8217;t take, because it was not for the taking in Joseph&#8217;s estimation. The only way she could have received that, was if Joseph gave it away, and that was not an option in his mind. This is a lesson to take from Joseph. He was not giving up the character that had been developed within him through his trials. I&#8217;ve heard it rightly said, &#8220;Character is what you are in the dark, when no one is looking.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Joseph teaches us:<\/p>\n<p>1. People (even those close to us) will try to take things from us. 2. People may and can take temporal material things from us, but they cannot take eternal things. 3. People can&#8217;t take our character unless we give it away! 4. God is more concerned with our character then our possessions. 5. Our godly character is a staple of God working through our lives despite situations, status, or earthly possessions. 6. God allows trials to build character. 7. Your response to trials will reveal your character!<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230; Blessings,<br \/>\nPastor Phil<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors that was on him.&#8221; (Gen. 37:23)People can take temporal things from us such as houses, cars, jobs, money, etc&#8230;, but there are some things that nobody can take.

Hannah just in one chapter shares her deepest heart chamber with God, because it seemed that only He would understand. She was a woman who was misunderstood by those around her. The Lord had closed her womb which in OT times was viewed as a curse by. She was provoked severely by Peninnah, Elkanah&#8217;s other wife, for it and her heart was deeply grieved. She would only weep and not even eat, and bitterness of soul built up within her. Not even her own husband nor Eli the priest (the spiritual one) understood her sorrowful spirit. So what did she do? Did she set out to kill her husband or the other wife, because she couldn&#8217;t conceive a child? Did she verbally try and abuse the other wife or try and defend her situation? Did she verbally attack Eli the priest, for not being able at first to understand her condition, for even he thought her to be drunk as she prayed her prayer No, she did none of these things that were possible reactions by any other in her situation. What would you have done?<\/p>\n<p>How did Hannah finally respond to her sorrowful situation, of no one understanding her, and being labeled as cursed by God Himself? She prayed a prayer. What, that&#8217;s it, she didn&#8217;t take up arms and go postal, run away, or even take her own life? No, she prayed a powerful, real, heartfelt, from the guts of her desperation, prayer.<\/p>\n<p>Just then, the Lord remembered (not that He ever forgot) her, answering her prayer. And granted her a son, the prophet Samuel. God has answered her prayer, bigger and greater than she could have ever imagined. But isn&#8217;t God like that, we ask for something in His will, and He goes above and beyond what we had seen through our, many times, lack of faith. Even recently the Lord blessed me with a vehicle beyond what I dreamed in prayer for. Praise God!<\/p>\n<p>She responds to God in a way that we need to when God blesses us, in worship and thanksgiving, lest we worship the blessing, and not the Blesser! &#8220;For this child I have prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of Him: Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshiped the Lord there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>*This child &#8211; Samuel *I have prayed &#8211; she labored in prayer *The Lord hath given me &#8211; she acknowledges that God alone blessed her *I have lent him to the Lord &#8211; she, and no one else, gave him back to God unconditionally in dedication to the Lord&#8217;s work. She was a mom of faith. She didn&#8217;t&#8217;t give up something for lent (40 days give it to God then take it back), she gave completely open handed to God.<\/p>\n<p>\u00d8 What about you are you in a desperate situation, then pray, He hears as He remembered Hannah, He will remember you.<\/p>\n<p>\u00d8 When God blesses you, in His way, will you give back to Him open handed?<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00d8 Self check &#8211; The USA chokes on the blessings of God greatly. Is there anything God gave you that you are worshiping, instead of giving back to Him? One must be painfully honest to break free from any idolatry.<\/p>\n<p>\u00d8 Remember &#8211; God loves us to give back to Him what He has given up, but He most desires us to lend Him a life, our life, and lead others to Him that they might lend their lives to the Lord as well.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,1 Samuel 1:11 &#8220;O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget think handmaid, but wilt give unto think handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-70","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-18","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/70","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=70"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/70\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=70"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=70"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=70"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":384,"date":"2006-02-20T04:13:29","date_gmt":"2006-02-20T04:13:29","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/02\/20\/203-word\/"},"modified":"2006-02-20T04:13:29","modified_gmt":"2006-02-20T04:13:29","slug":"203-word","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/02\/20\/203-word\/","title":{"rendered":"#203 WORD"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>WORD.

A young boy growing up in times as difficult as they can every possibly get witnesses the Healing mercies of the Lord Jesus Christ, when his father is miraculously healed of cancer. After seeing the Lord turn the impossible into possible, the little boy joyfully accepts Jesus into His heart and life, and there begins his quest to know more about God. An elderly Christian in the village tells the boy about a Book that reportedly contains Jesus&#8217; own words. Bibles are banned in China &#8211; anyone found with one is executed for treason. It takes the boy 60 days of prayer followed by another 60 days of steadfast fast and prayer before He actually gets to see a Printed Bible. Mind you He only gets to see it, not even touch it, thanks to a former pastor who has one hidden in a earthen pot in his back yard. He has been arrested several times, but this boys determination moves him to showing him the old copy. The Gracious Lord miraculously provides the little boy a copy of his own soon after. The WORD starved kid soon learns the first four books of the New Testament. A month later he is asked to speak at an underground Church in a neighbouring village. Nervous and not knowing what to say to an entire audience of mixed age groups, this boy closes his eyes real tight and recites the entire Gospel of Mathew and Mark. A\u00a0 couple of hours later, he opens his eyes to find the entire congregation in tears, repenting aloud their sins. I didn&#8217;t make this up. This is based on real life incidents from Bro Yun&#8217;s life. Try to get and read the Heavenly Man, the 2003 international best seller, and also the book of the year.<\/p>\n<p>When you hear a testimony like that, you get so fired up that you immediately make a list of quick resolutions ::<br \/>\nYou suddenly dust your Bible at home, even read it regularly for a few days..

Prioritization. But guess what?<br \/>\nWith out bread, our mortal being will perish (as is seen all over the world &#8211; people die of starvation)<br \/>\nAnd with out the WORD our souls\/ our spiritual being will perish.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t starve yourself to death.

Catherine was a Junior Miss pageant judge that year. She seemed almost disappointed at how we contestants expressed our ambitions. She challenged us to take whatever each of us had and start thinking beyond our limited horizons. She dared us to dream big. She hated waste, most of all, waste of human capacity.

It\u2019s sometimes hard to remember that terrorism comes from just a handful of people. It\u2019s not the religion.

If you can wake up each day and say, there is going to be such excitement, and at the same time say, you have done some good for someone\u2014that\u2019s it for me. Heaven knows I\u2019m so blessed by the doors that have opened and the options I\u2019ve had. But, really, there just has to be one thing, one thing that moves you.

In the midst of it all, there was one person who stood at the center\u2014at least my psychological center\u2014 someone I viewed as an island in an ocean of anxiety. She was one of the judges. A well-known writer. A woman whose sea-gray eyes fixed on you with laser penetration. Her name was Catherine Marshall.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the rehearsal on the last day of the pageant, the afternoon before it would all end, several of us were waiting backstage when a pageant official said Catherine Marshall wanted to speak with us. We gathered around. Most of us were expecting a last-minute pep talk, but we were surprised.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She fixed her eyes upon us. \u201cYou have set goals for yourselves. I have heard some of them. But I don\u2019t think you have set them high enough. You have talent and intelligence and a chance. I think you should take those goals and expand them. Think of the most you could do with your lives. Make what you do matter. Above all, dream big.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not so much an instruction as a dare. I felt stunned. This woman I admired so much was disappointed in us\u2014not by what we were but by how little we aspired to be.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I won the America\u2019s Junior Miss contest that year. I graduated in 1967 with a B.A. degree in English and a complete lack of inspiration about what I should do with it. I went to my father. \u201cWhat is it that you enjoy doing most?\u201d he asked.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWriting,\u201d I replied slowly. \u201cAnd working with people. And being in touch with what\u2019s happening in the world.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He thought for a moment. \u201cDid you ever consider television?\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that time there were few if any women journalists on television. The idea of being a pioneer in the field sounded like dreaming big. That\u2019s how I came to get up my nerve and go out to convince the news director at Louisville\u2019s WLKY-TV to let me have a chance.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He gave it to me. For the next two and a half years I worked as a combination weather and news reporter. Eventually, though, I began to feel restless. I\u2019d wait for the revelation, the sign pointing in the direction of the Big Dream. What I didn\u2019t realize is what Catherine Marshall undoubtedly knew all along\u2014that the dream is not the destination but the journey.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today I\u2019m coeditor of CBS\u2019s <em>Sixty Minutes<\/em>. I keep a suitcase packed at all times so that I can fly out on assignment at a moment\u2019s notice. When I go out into the world, I can almost hear a wonderful woman prodding me with her fiery challenge to stretch farther and, no matter how big the dream, to dream a little bigger still. God, she seems to be saying, can forgive failure, but not failing to try.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" size=\"1\" \/><font face=\"garamond\" color=\"#ff6600\" size=\"5\"><strong>An excerpt from Bird on My Shoulder<\/strong><\/font><br \/>\n<strong>by Diane Sawyer, Guideposts, March 1964<\/strong>A friend was telling me that he believes the Holy Spirit daily tries to reach each one of us with his perfect counsel. \u201cThe key,\u201d my friend said, \u201cis our obedience. As long as we obey that subtle prompting, it will come ever clearer. But if ever we begin to stop our ears, it will grow faint and then disappear.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That made sense to me, because nine or ten months before there had come a moment when I was sure the Holy Spirit had revealed a new truth to me. It was during a period in my life when I had pulled away from the religious training I\u2019d received as a child.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think most teenagers go through a time like this, and when adults ask why, the nearest I can come is the word \u201cembarrassment.\u201d Teenagers are terribly self-conscious. And Jesus represents a kind of simplicity and humility that is not at all attractive if you\u2019re primarily concerned with what people think of you.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, I\u2019d use the word \u201cvulnerability.\u201d There is something about Christ\u2019s life of sacrifice and service that made him totally vulnerable to people. Whether we admit it or not, young people pull away from situations where we can be hurt. And so we pull away from identifying with Christ who was hurt.<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\u00a0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0 Still Dreaming Big Q &amp; A with Diane Sawyer By\u00a0Sandy \u00a0LeSourd Diane Sawyer is the only person to appear on the cover of Guideposts three times.

You laugh, but it\u2019s the truth. So how did I end up with two popular shows on the Food Network? Well, it\u2019s like they say, you\u2019ve got to work with what you\u2019ve got. With what you\u2019ve been given. It\u2019s true in cooking. It\u2019s true in life. Here\u2019s a few lessons I learned about both along the way.<\/font><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif\" size=\"2\"><strong><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"#993300\">Keep it simple.<\/font><\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Baking, to me, is like conducting a science experiment. All those precise measurements and exact times and temperatures. I don\u2019t have the patience for it. I don\u2019t even own a set of measuring cups. Not being able to bake doesn\u2019t bother me. (Besides, my sister is a fantastic baker, so if I want some apple and cinnamon cake, I know where to go.) But coffee? I break out in a sweat at the mere thought of making a pot. Is it two spoonfuls or one? Table or teaspoon? Per cup or per pot? I can never remember. I make the lousiest coffee in North America!<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All that coffee-making trauma has taught me something. What might be a breeze for one person can send someone else into a panic. So I try to stick to the basics when I\u2019m writing a recipe. I want to make sure even an inexperienced cook can pull it off. See a way to save time? I\u2019ll put in a tip. Catch myself including too many ingredients? I\u2019ll pare down the list. Don\u2019t overload your brain. Keep it simple. Focus on the essentials and you\u2019ll get results, in and out of the kitchen.<\/font><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif\" size=\"2\"><strong><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"#993300\">Choose happiness.<\/font><\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grampa Emmanuel always said, \u201cYou can laugh or you can cry. Just be sure to choose what you\u2019re going to cry about carefully.\u201d Grampa didn\u2019t cry about much, though he didn\u2019t have the easiest life. He grew up in Sicily, one of 14 children. They all worked in a pottery yard. Then one of his brothers was killed on the job. Grampa came to America and became a stonemason. He settled down in Cape Cod.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grampa\u2019s real passions were gardening and cooking. Every Sunday he\u2019d pick fruits and vegetables and cook up a storm for the family. There were too many of us to fit in the house, so he set up a big table outside. Pasta, meat, salad, melon, ice cream. Oh, what a feast! Grampa\u2019s dinner table was where I first saw\u2014I guess I should say, tasted\u2014the power of cooking. It can fill you up. With food and with contentment. Think of how you feel after a good dinner. Is there any more peaceful feeling?<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s why I think one great way to happiness is cooking. Say you\u2019re worn out from a long day at the office, frazzled from juggling your kids\u2019 activities. Sure, it\u2019s easy to hit the drive-through or get takeout. But you\u2019ve got another choice. How about putting on some music and making dinner? Nothing complicated. Just good fresh food. Try that one night. I think you\u2019ll be surprised at how satisfying it is.<\/p>\n<p><strong><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"#993300\">Be real.<\/font><\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mom, Elsa, is only 4 feet 10. But don\u2019t let that fool you. She has a big personality. Everything I know about cooking I learned from her. She\u2019s a brilliant businesswoman too. At one point she ran nine restaurants simultaneously. Whenever she talked to employees, she\u2019d stand in front of them on a milk crate. Why? So she could look them straight in the eye, really connect with them.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These days my mom is my business manager, my researcher, my morale officer and so much more. Sure, we fight sometimes. Besides, my family is Italian and Cajun\u2014not exactly the quietest people. I think it\u2019s terrific to be open and honest and let things out. If you have the senses God gave you, then you\u2019re going to have opinions and, of course, they\u2019re not always going to agree with everyone else\u2019s.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day a woman named Vicky was helping me prepare caponata, an Italian eggplant dish, for a cooking class. \u201cYou forgot the sugar and vinegar,\u201d Vicky pointed out. They\u2019re ingredients in most caponata recipes, so I explained, \u201cIn my family, we don\u2019t add sugar and vinegar to our caponata.\u201d She said, \u201cWe do in my family. And our caponata is <em>good<\/em>.\u201d \u201cYeah? Well, ours is <em>great!<\/em>\u201d I shot back. Back and forth we went. We both got so worked up we burst into tears. <em>What are you doing?<\/em> I asked myself. <em>You\u2019re practically coming to blows over a recipe! Shouldn\u2019t you be happy that Vicky feels as passionate about food and family as you do?<\/em> I grabbed Vicky and threw my arms around her. She hugged me right back. We\u2019ve been best friends ever since. If we\u2019d been stingy with our words or our emotions, we would\u2019ve missed out on a wonderful friendship.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be real. Make connections with people. Look them in the eye. Tell them how you feel. Don\u2019t be afraid to say what you mean. When you let go of the stuff you hold inside, you\u2019ll be amazed at what comes back to you.<\/p>\n<p><strong><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"#993300\">Savor life.<\/font><\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Okay, no one really likes school cafeteria food. Me, I couldn\u2019t stand it. I cried at having to eat it. I was brought up on squid and sardines and anchovies and garlic. All those good Italian things. To me, school food had no taste. So Grampa made me a sack lunch. The smell of it cleared the cafeteria. But I didn\u2019t care. I was too busy savoring every bite.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think we\u2019re born with our minds open to everything the world has to offer. Too bad sometimes we learn to close them. One day I was doing a cooking demonstration in a grocery store. A Cajun specialty. That time jambalaya. A woman pushed her shopping cart past me. A little boy was sitting in the seat. \u201cWhat\u2019s she cooking, Mom?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan I have some?\u201d They came back and stopped in front of me. \u201cIt smells yummy, Mom.\u201d The woman peeked into the pot and crinkled her nose. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t like that,\u201d she told her son, and wheeled him away. <em>She wouldn\u2019t even let him have a taste<\/em>, I thought. <em>And he really wanted to<\/em>. It made me sad.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Try new things. Not just foods, but experiences. Travel to that faraway country even if you\u2019re scared of flying. Take a different route home from work. Stop to talk to your neighbor. Don\u2019t waste time worrying about what you might be getting yourself into. God has packed life full of interesting flavors, ideas, people. Savor it all!<\/p>\n<p><strong><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"#993300\">A little goes a long way.<\/font><\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That goes for lots of things. Spices. Success. Think you\u2019re not up to the task, whatever it might be? There\u2019s a way you can knock those feelings of inadequacy right out of your head. How? Make dinner. Really! It\u2019s the greatest therapy I know. Just give it a shot. Cooking is easier than you think. Plus, it gives you an incredible payoff.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You take a pile of raw ingredients and\u2014presto, chango\u2014turn them into something that appeals to your senses. <em>Oh, that looks good<\/em>, you\u2019ll tell yourself the first time you make a nice dinner. And then you\u2019ll be like, <em>Wow! I did that. What else can I do?<\/em> That\u2019s how I felt the first time I helped my mom make lasagna. There\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do if we set our minds to it. Well, except maybe make coffee. Which gets me back to where I started.<\/p>\n<p><strong><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"#993300\">Work with what you\u2019ve been given.<\/font><\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I grew up in restaurants\u2014Mom would hold me in one arm and stir the pot with the other\u2014but I didn\u2019t set out to be in the food business. My majors were literature and communications. After college I took a job managing a candy counter at the marketplace in Macy\u2019s. Not because I had a great love for candy. I needed to pay the rent, and it isn\u2019t cheap to live in New York City. Then the guy in charge of the fresh foods department got fired. \u201cCan you sit in?\u201d I was asked. \u201cIt\u2019ll only be for a little while, till we find someone qualified.\u201d The manager of the marketplace took a liking to me. He taught me all about cheese, p\u00e2t\u00e9, imported this and exported that. I took to it like a fish to water. They let me keep the job. A job I was supposedly unqualified for.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I left Macy\u2019s to become a buyer for a gourmet supermarket uptown. But I missed Mom and home. I moved to the Adirondacks and\u2014wouldn\u2019t you know it?\u2014kind of fell into a job at a supermarket. The store did a good business in prepared foods, but regular groceries just weren\u2019t moving. The manager came up with an idea: Give cooking classes using fresh produce and meat. People would buy more if they knew what to do with it.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Great idea, but every chef we talked to demanded an outrageous salary. <em>I could do this myself<\/em>, I thought. <em>Why not?<\/em> That\u2019s where my 30-minute meals got their start. A local news report landed me on the <em>Today show<\/em>, and that led to my own show on the Food Network.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I really believe there\u2019s no such thing as accidents, only opportunities. God gives everyone the ingredients to a good happy life. It\u2019s up to us to make the most of them.

I\u2019m what you might call a weather geek. I am very passionate about the weather. Growing up in White River Junction, Vermont, I\u2019d often get calls from my schoolmates for weather forecasts. \u201cHey, Jim, it\u2019s supposed to snow. Are we gonna have school tomorrow?\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would think, <em>If only I could make a living spending all of my time studying the weather\u2014what a dream that would be<\/em>.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou can, Jim,\u201d my dad encouraged me, and then gave me the best advice of my life. \u201cPeople always want to know what the weather is going to be. You can be the guy to tell them.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact is everyone worries about the weather. As long as humans have been on this earth we\u2019ve been trying to predict it and, of course, control it. We\u2019ve gotten pretty good too. The predicting part, that is. But it\u2019s not perfect. Life\u2019s a little like that sometimes. Things don\u2019t always turn out the way we predict.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I landed my dream job right out of college\u2014working for The Weather Channel (TWC), a burgeoning cable network out of Atlanta, Georgia. That\u2019s where I met two people who would have a huge influence on my life: my mentor and friend, the late John Hope, and my wife-to-be, Tamra.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0John was our hurricane expert for many years and the face of The Weather Channel. He was also everybody\u2019s honorary grandfather. When he had something to say, we all listened. I will never forget the day John told me that my tropical updates left something to be desired. I was crushed, but that drove me, through his example, to become the best communicator, teacher and meteorologist I could be.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tammy was director of affiliate sales and a TWC veteran. She caught my attention immediately. Like me, she was passionate about her job and a fireball of energy. She was a fantastic skier, played tennis, was involved with her church, you name it. Maybe best of all, she understood my need to be right in the middle of the action. Whether it was a blinding snowstorm or a major hurricane, she knew I needed to get in on it to be happy. I proposed to Tammy during a snowstorm in Colorado (I know you\u2019re probably not surprised by this) and we married in Vermont in the fall of 1990, at the peak of leaf season. Our daughter, Christina, came along in July of 1993 (during a record-breaking \u201cHot-lanta\u201d summer day). Ben followed in July of 1995 (another \u201cHot-lanta\u201d day). Having the kids hardly slowed Tammy down. In fact, nothing seemed to slow her down.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But shortly after Ben\u2019s second birthday in July of 1997, Tammy made an appointment with our chiropractor, Dr. Robert Schlampp, to figure out what was behind some symptoms she\u2019d been experiencing. Her hand twitched and her gait had become a bit tentative. Tamra was a vice-president at The Weather Channel by this point, but she had no trouble handling the double load of kids and work responsibilities. At least, until recently. Suddenly, she was edging through her day instead of roaring through it.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI must have pinched a nerve from carrying Ben around so much,\u201d she told Dr. Schlampp. Tammy carried him most everywhere. Christina had been slow to walk too, so I tried not to worry.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Schlampp sent her to a neurologist. More specialists came in. Finally, a diagnosis: early onset Parkinson\u2019s disease. Parkinson\u2019s is a chronic, progressive disorder of the central nervous system caused by the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Neurons fire out of control, leaving patients unable to direct their movements normally. From the little I knew about it, the disease affected older people. Tammy wasn\u2019t even 40 yet.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doctors tried to put a good spin on it for us\u2014a little like I do when I\u2019m giving folks a rainy forecast for the weekend. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get this disease,\u201d one of them told Tammy, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t have picked a better time. Breakthroughs are happening every day. We could even be very close to a cure.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tammy took the news better than I did (naturally). She dove into the new challenge, learning about the disease, getting active with fundraisers and lobbying for more research dollars. She even surprised the organizers of a Washington, D.C., event by bringing her tennis racket along with her.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTamra,\u201d one of the facilitators told her when she asked if the hotel had any courts, \u201cpeople with Parkinson\u2019s don\u2019t usually spend much time playing tennis.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maybe they hadn\u2019t till Tammy came along. \u201cGod\u2019s never given me more than I could handle,\u201d my wife declared.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I needed the kind of frontline faith my wife had, but it was hard to see Tammy struggle. It was more than I thought I could handle sometimes. On a bad day she couldn\u2019t even brush Christina\u2019s hair, her hands shook so bad.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And speaking of Christina, there were still lingering doubts about what was going on with her and Ben, healthwise. At an age when most kids are tearing around like little tornadoes, Ben was barely walking. Christina had near-constant ear infections. One day we had to walk out of a movie because Ben was being so disruptive. When we took a break from all our worries about Tammy\u2019s health, we realized something was wrong with the kids\u2019 health too. It\u2019s a scary feeling when your kids lag behind their peers and you can\u2019t figure out why. We had to do something.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A genetic counselor had Tammy, the kids and me get some blood work done. His findings blew me away. Ben had something called fragile X syndrome, a disorder that affects the X chromosome and causes cognitive and behavioral problems. Tammy was a silent carrier. Fragile X symptoms vary from mild learning disabilities to severe mental retardation. Ben and Christina both suffered from it, but because the syndrome affects males more strongly than females, Christina\u2019s had escaped notice until now.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Talk about a change in forecast. In a few short years, our lives had gone from full of sunshine to dark and ominous, as if two storm systems had collided overhead.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My in-the-field work is both the least favorite and the most favorite part of my job at The Weather Channel. I have seen hurricanes, floods and tornadoes reduce beautiful neighborhoods to unidentifiable rubble. Human lives are turned upside down overnight. We saw it just last year when hurricanes ripped through Florida one after another and brought the entire state to its knees. Recovery will take years. I now felt a whole lot like one of those weather victims myself. Our family had been hit by an invisible super-storm: a category five crisis that left me as stunned as a Florida homeowner looking at the empty lot where his house had stood just hours before.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day I was watching Tammy and Christina play with Barbies. Christina has a big collection, and loves it when her mom can help dress them. Tammy was fumbling with the buttons on one of the dolls\u2019 jackets.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHere, Mom,\u201d said Christina. \u201cThose buttons are small. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tammy looked up at me. Her eyes met mine. <em>Don\u2019t worry<\/em>, Tammy\u2019s eyes seemed to say. <em>We\u2019ll get through this<\/em>. How many times had her eyes delivered that message to me over these last difficult months? All too often I had just rolled mine.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I often think back to something John Hope said to me years ago. I had no idea when I began my career at The Weather Channel how crucial the coverage of violent weather events would be to our future. But, somehow, John did. People have a deep fascination with extreme weather. John knew the reason for it. \u201cPeople care about other people,\u201d he said one day. \u201cThat\u2019s why they are never going to stop being interested in tornadoes, floods and hurricanes. This channel is about Mother Nature, but it\u2019s just as much about human nature. It\u2019s when circumstances are at their worst that you are going to see people at their best. That\u2019s where you will really see the human spirit in action.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Time and again I\u2019ve seen proof of what John was talking about. People can lose everything they have in a matter of hours. Yet, somehow, they always bounce back. Why? Because they believe in a power greater than nature itself. They reach deep inside themselves and they find a way to go on.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s still not possible to predict bad weather exactly, but the ability of people to triumph over adversity is one thing that will always be in my forecast. That\u2019s the best part of my job.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So now you know my Storm Story. I guess everyone has at least one. Even with the stormy times, I find my life very fulfilling in many ways. Truth is, none of us can nail the forecast in life every time. But we can remember a time long ago when it rained for 40 days and 40 nights and how Noah and his family must have felt when that first ray of sunshine hit the Ark.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sun will always shine after the storm. You just have to look for it. God knew when he created us that we would have the storms of life to deal with. Isaiah said it best: \u201cFor thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This summer will bring many anniversaries with it\u2014my children\u2019s tenth and twelfth birthdays (they\u2019re doing great, by the way) and my nineteenth year at The Weather Channel. It will also be the eighth year our family has been dealing with Parkinson\u2019s.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I won\u2019t say that the sky is always sunny, because many times it isn\u2019t. Come hurricane season, I know people won\u2019t want to see me on their coastlines. But if history holds I know I will see four things. There will be adversity, but more important there will be heroism, triumph and hope. How do I know? Trust me, I\u2019m a weatherman.\u00a0<br \/>\n<\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Surviving the Storm Life is like the weather.

Picture a three-bedroom ranch house on West Church Street, just down the block from Our Lady of Lourdes where our family went to mass every Sunday. Across the street was a convenience store. The house next door was so close we could tell from our kitchen table what they were watching on TV. Not that there was much choice. We only got two stations in Elmira. Today we have the 24-hour news cycle, and hundreds of cable channels. Back then the 6:30 P.M. national news was with either Huntley and Brinkley or Walter Cronkite.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now imagine an eight-year-old boy sitting on the living-room floor, his legs crossed, watching a black-and-white TV with the foil-tipped rabbit ears perched on top. He\u2019s not the best student in the world, but he\u2019s fascinated by the news. He\u2019d never miss a broadcast and he takes in everything said about the war in Vietnam, the space race, the Civil Rights movement, and in his heart he knows he\u2019s seeing history in the making.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Night after night, listening to Cronkite\u2019s magisterial tone or Huntley and Brinkley\u2019s seamless teamwork, he thinks, <em>That\u2019s what I want to do someday.<\/em> It\u2019s an audacious thought for a boy, especially one who\u2019s never been much of anywhere in his life and whom no teacher has ever singled out for public speaking. He keeps his desire inside and nurtures it.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As you\u2019ve no doubt guessed, I was that boy, and today when I think of that goal, I am astounded that I reached it. There were so many others more gifted or with more advantages. I was the fourth child in a middle-class family in a small upstate town where Dad was in business and Mom stayed home. Sure, I had a goal and a certain drive. But more than that, I had the power of a dream.<\/font><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif\" size=\"2\">My dad is a taciturn Calvin Coolidge-type, a frugal New Englander. A captain in World War II, he\u2019d worked with the Army to help rehabilitate returning soldiers. Back in civilian life, he was in marketing and retailing. Even if he didn\u2019t say much, he still gave us kids the feeling that we could do anything we put our minds to. I grew up knowing that the biggest risk you face in life is not risking anything at all.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One day I announced that I was going to write the President to cheer him up. Dad smiled sagely as he watched me scrawl my note at the kitchen table, ornamenting it with a picture of the American flag. I sent it off, imagining President Johnson reading my letter in the oval office. Soon enough I got a letter back on official presidential stationery. \u201cSee, my letter did cheer him up!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHe wrote right back.\u201d Talk about feeling important.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m sure Dad noticed what I didn\u2019t: the response was a form letter, the signature done by a machine. LBJ himself probably had never read my letter. Still, my parents knew I wanted to believe I was important enough for the President of the United States to read my every word. Not long ago, I wrote to the Johnson Library in Texas and asked if they had my letter. To my amazement, they found it in the archives with a red check in the corner. \u201cWhy the red check?\u201d I asked. It was included in the small sampling of letters the president read every night, I was told. My letter, one of thousands. Dad was right.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Soon as I could hold a job, I tried to follow my hardworking father\u2019s example. I was willing to do anything\u2014and I did. I sold Christmas trees out of a van. I bused tables at the local pancake house. I worked in the hardware department at Sears. During college in Washington, D.C., I interned at the White House, wearing the blue blazer I\u2019d bought with my employee discount at Sears. But money was tight and after the internship ended, I dropped out of school. I was anxious to start my career. I still had that burning vision that I never told anyone about. I wouldn\u2019t let it go. Working on student newspapers gave me enough experience to know that journalism was indeed what I wanted.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Truth to tell, my launch into broadcasting wasn\u2019t auspicious\u2014a job as a clerk-typist with the National Association of Broadcasters, a trade group. I learned to be a pretty good personal assistant, yet I yearned to be reporting the news. When I came back home and watched the local news in the kitchen with Mom and Dad (they\u2019d finally gotten rid of the old black and white with the rabbit ears), I\u2019d think, \u201cYes, I can do that.\u201d Mom and Dad agreed.<\/font><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif\" size=\"2\">One evening in D.C. I went to dinner with a man who ran a station in Pittsburg, Kansas. We talked about a million things before I got up the courage to tell him: \u201cI\u2019d like to try my hand at being a broadcaster.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome to Pittsburg,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay your own way.\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What he offered me was a very basic salary \u2014barely enough to live on even in Kansas \u2014and the chance to work as a reporter. I rented a bright yellow Ryder truck, brought my cocker spaniel, Charlie, along with me for company and headed for the heartland. A lot of people thought I was crazy. What was I thinking\u2026trading a decent job with the chance of advancement for a pipe dream in Kansas? If I really wanted to be a reporter, who would ever see me there? But I knew it was what I had to do. This was the experience I needed. I ate little and slept less. Seven days a week I was writing, reporting, broadcasting. If I made mistakes \u2014and I made plenty \u2014I learned from them and moved on. After 13 months, I had a stack of videotapes and no new job. But with a sense of accomplishment, Charlie and I headed back to D.C.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By fits and starts, my career took off thanks to the brave gut decision of a news director at WTTG, a local station in D.C., where I met my wife, Jane. We later moved to Philadelphia, where she worked at the local PBS station. Finally, I made it to New York to do the local news at WCBS. Most of the time I was out in the streets, sometimes anchoring the five o\u2019clock or six o\u2019clock news. Then one day out of the blue I got a call from NBC News. \u201cWould you meet with Tom Brokaw?\u201d<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We sat at a small alcove at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, sharing a large bottle of water. And we talked. He wanted me to think of coming to NBC News. At that very first meeting Tom said he was at an age where he was starting to think about a successor. If I came to NBC, I would be considered for that spot.<\/p>\n<p>The halls of network tv are littered with the bodies of men and women who have held out hopes for the next big job \u2014or so they say. But over a 12-year period, Tom Brokaw was absolutely true to his word. Every step of the way, Tom made sure I was getting the experience I needed. There weren\u2019t any big talks. Just a consistent confidence in me and one opportunity after another.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As much as Tom was a role model on the job, he was also an example off duty. I asked him how he handled the formidable pressure of the job. He said that you have to force yourself to get as much from life\u2019s relaxing moments as you can. One look at Tom\u2019s private side, his wonderful wife, Meredith, and his terrific and successful children, and you have a living example of how to conduct a life in a public job.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the invasion of Iraq, I was flying as part of an armada of Chinook helicopters when Iraqis hit the helicopter in front of ours with a rocket-propelled grenade. We were forced down, and then an epic sandstorm blew in. We were stuck on the desert floor for three days. Because it was a secret mission I was unable to tell anyone where I was. Our one satellite phone call went to the NBC News assignment desk to report that we were okay and that an Army platoon had taken up positions around us.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My family was on spring break vacation, and Tom took it upon himself to call my wife and reassure her that everything possible was being done to keep me safe and get me back. That one call cemented Tom\u2019s iconic standing in my household. It was leadership by comforting.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a business known for its egotism and selfishness, Tom was selfless. If I had dropped the baton, it would have been my doing. That the handoff went as smoothly as it did is thanks to Tom.<br \/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I often think about that eight-year-old. He never told anyone about his dream, but he never gave up. He had parents who believed in him. And he had the perfect role model in a tireless, selfless colleague. Someday there will be someone who comes along to take the baton from me. The best way to repay those who have helped me is to make sure it is passed smoothly, from one generation to the next.\u00a0\u25aa<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p \/><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>He always knew what he wanted to be.

Take it from me, though, the fancy makeup is just highlighting what\u2019s for real. And that\u2019s true happiness, the kind that comes from the inside. Lately I\u2019ve been giving it some thought and I\u2019ve come up with five things that make mine a happy life. Five things that make just about anyone\u2019s life joyous. Yours too, I bet.<\/p>\n<p>1. I love my friends and family. I grew up poor, so poor my daddy paid the doctor who delivered me with a sack of cornmeal. Yet my family was rich in so many ways too. Each and every one of us 12 kids knew we were precious in the sight of God and cherished by our mother and father. Maybe you\u2019ve heard my song \u201cCoat of Many Colors,\u201d about a girl who wears her coat of rags proudly. That came right out of my childhood in the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. Someone gave us a box of rags, and Mama sewed them together to make a coat for me. The kids at school teased me, but I knew Mama put her love into every stitch. I felt proud to have that coat, and blessed. Blessed as I felt the day I met Judy Ogle in third grade. My family had just moved to Caton\u2019s Chapel from another town in the Smoky Mountains. I walked into school, the new girl, too shy to make a peep. Until I noticed someone else quietly looking on. A girl with bright green eyes and a copper-colored ponytail. Something told me to go over and say hi. Almost 50 years later, Judy and I haven\u2019t stopped talking. (Just ask my husband, Carl, who\u2019s always shaking his head at how we tie up the phone line.) If I get an idea for a tune while I\u2019m picking at a guitar, Judy\u2019s there to write everything down before it goes out of my head. Whenever I need a dose of country air, Judy\u2019s there to drive out to the mountains with me. At the heart of every close friendship I have, there\u2019s what I discovered with Judy back in third grade\u2014the magic of having someone in your life who understands where you\u2019re coming from and where you\u2019re going, who just knows.<\/p>\n<p>2. I love what I do. My daddy likes to say I was singing before I could talk. That might be a bit of a tall tale, but I can barely remember a time I wasn\u2019t making music. At age six, I was shaking the rafters at church. But our little country church could only fit so many people, and Sunday only came once a week. Mama said God had put his hand on me and given me my voice, so I decided he must have bigger plans for me. Boy, did I want to be ready for them. I took up guitar at age seven, making my first instrument out of an old mandolin and two bass strings. I put on concerts right on our porch. To look the part of a glamorous singer, I used Mercurochrome for lipstick, crushed pokeberries for rouge and a burnt match for mascara. I\u2019d collect my brothers and sisters who were too young to run away, sit them down in the dirt, then get up on the porch and belt out songs into a tin can on a stick like I was at the Grand Ole Opry. If I couldn\u2019t round up any of my brothers and sisters, there were always the pigs and chickens to serenade. I landed my first professional gig on the Cas Walker Radio Show in Knoxville (I\u2019ll tell you all about it later). I was 10. I\u2019ve been making a living doing what I love ever since. Is it any wonder that I feel incredibly fortunate? Not to mention grateful.<\/p>\n<p>3. I love to laugh. People often compliment my voice, my songwriting, my business acumen, and yes, my distinctive fashion sense. But I\u2019ve always felt that my greatest gift is my positive attitude and sense of humor (they go together like biscuits and gravy). It\u2019s like the Bible says, \u201cA merry heart doeth good like medicine.\u201d These past 38 years with Carl have been one fun ride. He should hire himself out as a professional practical joker. I never know what he\u2019s going to pull next, but I do know it\u2019s going to leave me laughing. I remember one concert in Louisville, Kentucky. My backup singers sounded kind of off. I glanced over my shoulder to see what was the matter. There was Carl at one of the microphones! And he had the audacity to wink at me. I decided to do him one better. I sauntered over to a policeman working security. \u201cThat man back there in the white shirt isn\u2019t part of our group,\u201d I told him. The cops hauled Carl away. It was all I could do not to crack up. (Don\u2019t worry, someone from our crew let the officers know who Carl was before they got too far.) Having a live-in personal humor trainer like Carl is a big help. There are things I do on my own too, to keep my attitude in shape. I close my eyes and picture angels surrounding me. I tell them whatever\u2019s troubling me, then I envision them trampling those burdens to powder. If my attitude needs more adjusting, I visualize God holding me upside down and shaking all the negative stuff\u2014fears, doubts, insecurities\u2014right out of me. Try it. Ask God to turn you upside down! It\u2019s a surefire pick-me-up.<\/p>\n<p>4. I love to pray. Getting up close and personal with God is something I learned in his house. Not the way you\u2019d expect, though. I used to explore the old church my town, Caton\u2019s Chapel, was named after. It was a ruin\u2014shattered windows, buckled floor, graffiti-splattered walls. Saturday nights teenagers partied there. Mama was aware of the not-so-wholesome goings-on and warned us to steer clear of the place. But for some reason I was drawn to it, during daylight hours anyway. I\u2019d hunt for doodlebugs in the cool earth under the floorboards, daydream at the broken piano in the corner. And I\u2019d pray. I would tell God how I wanted to see the world that lay beyond the Smoky Mountains. To make it as a country music star and have a whole building full of folks to sing to. To do Mama and Daddy proud. Was God listening? I couldn\u2019t quite tell. Then one day I was sitting in a pew, talking to him, when suddenly, something changed in the very air around me. Something changed inside me too. I felt like I would bust with happiness. God was right there with me. I was absolutely sure. I didn\u2019t have to jump up and down or shout or even sing to get his attention. I could just whisper. He heard every word. Something I would have done well to remember in the early 1980s, when I was going through the darkest time. Not that I had any real reason to be unhappy. I had a strong marriage, tons of family and friends, a well-established career. But a movie I\u2019d made hadn\u2019t turned out well. I had some serious medical issues. Judy was going through a crisis of her own, so I couldn\u2019t lean on her like usual. And poor Carl was so worried about my health I didn\u2019t want to put any more on him. For the first time in my life, I felt all alone. Like no one was listening, not even God. It was more an act of desperation than inspiration, but I grabbed for the only lifeline I could think of. The Bible. I sat down and read it cover to cover, a little every day. Pretty soon verses jumped out at me. Like that line in I Thessalonians that always had me stumped: \u201cPray without ceasing.\u201d How on earth was anyone going to do that? Coming out of that dark time, that\u2019s when I finally got what those words meant. No matter where I go or what I\u2019m doing, a part of me is talking to God. And a part of God is listening.<\/p>\n<p>5. I love you. I believe God put the dream in my heart to become a country music performer so I could share the love he poured into my life with as many people as possible. I know you might think, That\u2019s just Dolly being outrageous again, but why else would God have let me discover what I did the first time I sang in front of an audience? This gets back to that first gig I mentioned. I landed it thanks to my uncle, Bill Owens. I was 10, and he took me to Knoxville to meet Cas Walker, the host of a live music radio show. Cas said hello and stared down at me like he expected me to say something back. Well, I did. I said, \u201cMr. Walker, I want to work for you.\u201d He shook my hand and said, \u201cYou\u2019re hired. A lot of people come to me and say, \u2018Mr. Walker, I want a job,\u2019 but you\u2019re the first one that ever said, \u2018I want to work.\u2019\u201d The show was recorded in an auditorium that seated maybe 60 people. I walked up to the microphone and looked out at the audience. All those strangers! Whoa, this was a whole lot different from getting up in front of the pigs and chickens on our farm. The first notes were kinda squeaky. Pretty soon, though, the sheer joy of singing took over. I finished with a flourish. Everyone clapped and stomped their feet. They wanted an encore, but I didn\u2019t have one. I looked over at Uncle Bill, and he mouthed, \u201cSing it again.\u201d So I did\u2014and they cheered all over again, even louder. I never knew I could feel so close, so connected, to a bunch of strangers. That was the moment I fell in love with the people I sing for. With you. I\u2019ve loved y\u2019all ever since.

He eventually came to his senses, humbled himself, and repented to God and his father. However, another character in the same parable upon seeing the younger son repent also choked on the blessing. That\u2019s right, the older son too choked on the blessing, although he didn\u2019t take his inheritance and squander it, his heart toward his father was not right. How did he choke on his blessing?<\/p>\n<p>1. <strong><u>Comparisons produce winners and losers<\/u><\/strong>. &#8220;\u2018\u2026<strong><em>I\u2019ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders\u2026 But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him.&#8221;<\/em><\/strong> I love sports and the competition involved. However in families when there is competition and comparison a dividing line is established. The older compared his loyalty to his brothers\u2019 disloyalty toward the father. He was accurate in what he said, but he was not right in the attitude of which he said it. When we say look at how great I am, and what a loser this other person is, we\u2019ve established the winner and the loser in life which is NOT a game. Imagine if Mary would have said to her other children, &#8220;Why can\u2019t you be perfect like your brother Jesus?&#8221; With Satan trying so hard to destroy the family, why should we play according to his tune? Satan almost destroyed the younger son in the parable, but the older brother didn\u2019t care about him, only himself. If he wanted accolades then he should allow the father to say them. Proverbs 27:2 says, &#8220;<strong><em>Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips<\/em><\/strong>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2. <strong><u>Attitude is everything<\/u><\/strong>! <strong><em>I\u2019ve been slaving for you \u2026 never gave me \u2026 this son of yours.&#8221; <\/em><\/strong>I\u2019ve heard it said that life is ten percent of what happens to you and ninety percent of how you respond to it.

Our attitudes determine a lot. Jesus was God, yet became a servant. We are not God yet we don\u2019t have the attitude Christ displayed. <\/sup><sup>Have you been playing the comparison games?

It&#8217;s suppose to be coming to Jesus Christ in His terms but it has been reduced to coming to Jesus Christ in my terms. &#8220;I will serve You Jesus as long as I can still do what I used to do&#8221;, &#8220;I will serve You as long as I am still in control of my life&#8221;. I will allow You to be the Savior but not My Lord. It may not come out of your mouth as indicated but your action will reflect whether Jesus is both the Savior and the Lord of your life.<\/p>\n<p>Amos 3:2, &#8220;Can two walk together, unless they are agree? There can be only one Lord and not two, there can only be one driver and not two. The moment the introduction of who the boss is in your life is wrong, you will go no where. You and I can only walk together in agreement when we have defined who the Boss is. When we gave our lives to Christ for those who have, we said, &#8220;Lord, it is no longer about me but about You&#8221;. Before then we were the drivers of our own lives but when we received the gift of eternal life, we transferred our trust from what we used trust in and gave Him everything and said, &#8220;take over my life&#8221;. We took the passenger&#8217;s sit and the Lord took the driver&#8217;s sit. If He is the driver and He knows the way, why do you and I want to dictate Him on how He should do His job? We gave Him our lives because we trust Him. And He has been running our lives since then with our permission cause HE PAID THE PRICE TO BE THE BOSS. It&#8217;s sad to see people who had Jesus become the driver but in the process of Him driving, they went through bumpy holes and rocks and they said to the Lord, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like where this is going and Your leading, I will take over from here&#8221;. And the Lord being a gentlemen as He is let you run your life like you wanted to.<\/p>\n<p>On a serious note, I would like to introduce the Man who paid the price to be the boss. In Titus 6:15, the bible calls Him the Lord of lords. He is above every lord that is living and has ever lived, never forget that. In Ephesians 4:5, He is the one Lord, who is Mighty. When John the Baptist talked about Him, He did not introduce Him as a friend, He said, &#8220;There comes another One who is Mightier than I, whose shoes I&#8217;m not worthy to carry. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire&#8221;. He is Sovereign, He is glorious, He is all that I am not. Acts 2:36, &#8220;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ&#8221;. He did not make Himself but His Father in heaven made Him Lord and Christ and not only that He was given dominion over the things in heaven, on earth and beneath the earth, that at the mention of the name Jesus, every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. If you thought that He is just the Lord over some things, let this be a reminder to you that He is the Lord over all. Mark 2:28, &#8220;Lord also of the Sabbath&#8221;. How will He be the Lord over you in some areas and not be the Lord over the Sabbath too? if you are not plugged in a church where you can worship the true Lord, I wonder whether He is the Lord of the Sabbath in your life.<\/p>\n<p>Romans 14:9, &#8220;For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living&#8221;. If the Christ had died and not come back to life, it would have been a different case, but He died and then rose and now lives again forever and ever. He did this that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. You can see the word &#8220;might&#8221; underlined, this to me shows that He never forced Himself to be the Lord of the living (saved). If He was just our Savior then we would get saved and then die and go to heaven, His Lordship part of it reminds us that getting saved is not the end but a beginning and in this life we need the Lord to go through it. Getting saved means. &#8220;I&#8217;m no longer in charge of my life but He is&#8221; Galatians 2:20, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me&#8221;. It may look like I&#8217;m in control but I&#8217;m not for He is. He is the engine, the steer wheel, the brakes, the windshield, the driver etc. In short He is my everything, He is my Lord, I&#8217;m no longer in charge of my life. As long as I was in charge, I was messing things up, now my life is under NEW MANAGEMENT. I don&#8217;t want Him just to be the Savior but also the Lord of my life. David writes in Psalm 31:15, &#8220;My times are in thy hand&#8221;, that sums up the Lordship of Jesus Christ in our lives for it&#8217;s showing that everything I do which involves time are in His hands.<\/p>\n<p>Stop giving the Lord what is LEFT and start giving Him what is RIGHT, Let Him be the LORD of LOADS.

Abram had become <u>very wealthy<\/u> in livestock and in silver and gold. From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier and where he had first <u>built an altar<\/u>. There Abram <u>called on the name of the LORD<\/u><\/em>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><\/strong>Are you content with what God has given you? Solomon wrote, &#8220;<strong><em>Death and Destruction are never satisfied, and neither are the eyes of man<\/em><\/strong>&#8221; (Prov. 27:20). There is something about the majority of us that always wants more then God has given us. Let me ask you another question. When do you seek God most? Is it when things are going smooth or when things are not going so well? Many seek God when they are not content with the way things are going in their lives. Are we not to seek God at all times, even during times of contentment?<\/p>\n<p>The great prophet Abram (Abraham) is called by God to take all of his things, and his family and to journey to a place that God would show him. Abraham obeys God, leaves all that is familiar to him, and starts on his journey to &#8220;God knows where.&#8221; When he arrives at a place between Bethel and Ai he builds and altar and calls upon the name of the Lord. Although Abram was rich in cattle, gold and silver, he didn\u2019t choke on the blessing God gave him. Why not?<\/p>\n<p>1. <strong><u>Abram was content<\/u><\/strong>. Abram didn\u2019t try to fight God\u2019s call, but rather took up his household and lived a nomadic lifestyle in his obedience to God. He didn\u2019t go on a journey for more of what he &#8220;wanted,&#8221; but rather more of what God wanted for him. Paul wrote that &#8220;<strong><em>godliness with contentment is great gain<\/em><\/strong>&#8221; (1 Tim 6:6). Are you one that is content, or always wanting for more of what God is not calling you to? Are you content with what God has given you, in your job, your home, your friends, your family, your appearance, or do you yearn for more.<\/p>\n<p>2. <strong><u>Abram built an altar<\/u><\/strong>. What comes to mind when you hear the word altar. Perhaps words like sacrifice, sacred, special, offering, incense, prayer, are some of those words. An altar was a place designed for worship. Pagans set up their altars to worship their false gods many times made of wood, stone. God designed humanity to be worshipers, the only question remains is who or what will one seek to worship. Whatever the case, man will build an altar of worship either with his hands or his mind. Where is your altar, where is the place that you seek God? No one built the altar for Abram, he built it and so should you establish a place whereby you seek God daily. The New Testament refers to the prayer closet as the place to seek Him. When two people are going to meet they establish a meeting place. Where is your established meeting place with God? If you don\u2019t have a place, establish one today, as a sacred meeting place between you and God.<\/p>\n<p>3. <strong><u>Abram called upon God<\/u><\/strong>. Abram didn\u2019t allow his wealth to hinder his worship. It\u2019s not enough to build an altar; one must meet with God there. Do you meet with God daily at the altar, in the prayer closet? Prayer is a conversation between two people that love each other -you and God. Do you daily meet with God in prayer and read His word, because He is the Word (John 1)? Some never bother to &#8220;pick up the phone&#8221; to even call God, or if they do, it is a one-sided conversation. What has God been saying to you lately? If you\u2019re drawing a blank, then perhaps you have not been calling upon His name and listening to his response as Abram did. If so are you content with that? <strong><em>If God has blessed you don\u2019t choke on the blessing.

However when Israel was in the desert having come out of Egypt, it wasn\u2019t too long before Israel would choke on the blessing that God gave to them through their discontentment. Although they had an all-you-can-eat manna buffet in the middle of the wilderness provided by God they were not happy. \u201cThe rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, \u201cIf only we had meat to eat! 5 We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost-also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic. 6 But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!\u201d They never see anything is right! They didn\u2019t see God\u2019s provision, God\u2019s protection, God\u2019s guidance, and God\u2019s grace, although God did set a table for them in the desert. How will you To keep from choking on the blessing?<\/p>\n<p>1. Don\u2019t loose your appetite. They Israelites physically lost their appetite, because they were not focused on the Lord\u2019s provision. Some however loose their appetite spiritually as well. Some stop seeking God and the good things He is giving them. The Psalmist wrote, \u201cTaste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. Israel didn\u2019t take refuge in God\u2019s blessing after awhile. Where are to TASTE and SEE that the Lord IS GOOD, not that He might be good, or that He is good for some and not for others, but for all. How is your spiritual appetite been lately?<\/p>\n<p>2. Appreciate and partake in God\u2019s blessing. There was plenty of manna to go around for everyone. The rabble (non-Israelites) that came out of Egypt benefited by Israel\u2019s relationship with God too. Instead of being grateful Israel complained about what they didn\u2019t have rather then appreciate what they did have. They had miraculous manna, but craved meat. Do you appreciate what God has given you, or do you want something else. Many want the bigger, \u201cbetter,\u201d latest, and top of the line, because \u201cDeath and Destruction are never satisfied, and neither are the eyes of man.\u201d If God has given you your home, job, spouse, children, finances, abilities, spiritual gifts, personality, material goods, one must first be thankful, because He can take it all away if He desired. Job had it all, and then for a time everything was taken away.<\/p>\n<p>3. Fear the Lord. God sent the meat, quail, because he was fed up with the complaining of the Israelites. Ps 34:9 reads \u201cFear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him lack nothing.\u201d The Israelites thought they were lacking, but really their needs, not their \u201cgreeds\u201d were provided for. God is a Father that provides. Again God can take everything away should He so desire as He did to Job. What Israel craved in meat which they anticipated to bring satisfaction to their coveting hearts, actually brought death. \u201cWhile the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.\u201d All those who died also left behind relationships with friends and family that were affected by their lust for meat. If they would have walked in the fear of the Lord they would have lacked nothing. Ps 84:11 reads, \u201cFor the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t lose your appetite for the things God has given you. Appreciate and partake of His blessings. Fear the Lord, and see that you will lack nothing, nor with God withhold any good thing He has for you.

I saw a huge sign on the highway that read this which made me think of the power of that statement. The program endeavors to offer a fresh and engaging approach to archaeology, and to dig for the truth and go to extremes to do it-whether it&#8217;s trekking through Ethiopia in search of the lost ark of the covenant, tackling the jungles of the Amazon while searching for the hidden treasures of the Incas, or descending into the volcano Vesuvius to solve the puzzles of Pompeii. WOW! In thinking of the concept digging for truth, what comes to your mind? Perhaps trying to get the real story from a child, teenager on what really happened. Perhaps a court room scene comes into mind like Law and Order, or CSI perhaps.<\/p>\n<p>When archeologists dig for artifacts, they only discover what is beneath the surface of the land. As a Christina approaches God&#8217;s Word he or she should go with the same mindset as the archeologist, which is digging for truth. As you dig into God&#8217;s truth, the Holy Spirit will illuminate words, phrases, passages, chapters, etc&#8230;to you. His Job is to lead you into all truth, because He is the Spirit of truth (John 16:13). When an archeologist finds a bone during a dig, he doesn&#8217;t think, &#8220;that&#8217;s nice,&#8221; and walk away. No way, he digs, and tries to see if there are others treasures around that same area. When you hear a truth that someone has dug up, where from a Pastor, Teacher, Evangelist, a book, radio, TV, etc&#8230;, from the Word of God, do you walk away or do you return to the site (passage, verse, story, etc&#8230;) and start digging for truth?<\/p>\n<p>When we go to God&#8217;s Word, we should go as students desiring to learn from the Heart of the Master. The Bereans were avid students and &#8220;archeologists&#8221; of God&#8217;s Word. They examined the Scriptures as if they were going to find gold. Here are some tips we can learn from the notable Berean Church.<\/p>\n<p>1. Be Zealous for God&#8217;s Word &#8220;they received the message with great eagerness&#8230;&#8221; Do you crave God&#8217;s Word, are you zealous for His truth in your life.<\/p>\n<p>2. Be consistent in God&#8217;s Word. &#8220;&#8230; [they] examined the Scriptures every day. The Bereans not only read daily, but examined it daily. They put God&#8217;s Word under a microscope truly desiring not just to know what it said, but also what it meant, and how they could live God&#8217;s Word. Do you read God&#8217;s Word today, what about yesterday? Do you read EVERY DAY? If not why not? Isn&#8217;t God&#8217;s Word valuable enough to dig into daily to you?<\/p>\n<p>3. Be purposeful with God&#8217;s Word. &#8220;&#8230;[They] examined&#8230;to see if what Paul said was true.&#8221; The Bereans went into the Word of God for a purpose not just religious duty. They were seeing if Paul&#8217;s Word&#8217;s were accurate according to God&#8217;s Word. Knowing God&#8217;s Word this way gives one discernment, as one can gain the ability to filter what is preached, through God&#8217;s to see if what &#8220;Reverend&#8221; is speaking truth.

Why is it that we live in a world that shows less or no kindness. Fathers show no kindness to their wives and vise versa, kids are not kind to each other, parents are not kind to their kids, people are not kind to other people, some reasons why we have murders, abortions, rapes, robbery to mention a few. If everyone was kind as the bible puts it, we wouldn&#8217;t have any of these issues to deal with, we would all live in peace and harmony.<br \/>\nKind is the state of friendly, generous or warm hearted nature. A state of showing sympathy, understanding, charitable and considerate. Treating the way you would want to be treated. The bible says in Proverbs 19:22, &#8220;What is desired in a man is kindness&#8230;&#8221;. How true is this, something that God would want in every man and woman. We know that kindness warms the heart, it brings a smile. It gives a sense of value and belonging. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be shown kindness? Everyone desires for someone to treat them nicely and say nice things about them. We all want to be affirmed, someone to believe in you and speak it out. There is power in words spoken therefore you never know what you speak today could impact an individual&#8217;s life for a long time. Words of encouragements have a way of melting away fear and doubts in a person, hence creating avenues for healing and restoration. We have to learn to be sensitive to each other&#8217;s needs and not blinded by our own.<br \/>\nEphesians 4:32, &#8220;And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you&#8221; Paul in writing to the Ephesians told them to replace all bitterness, anger, clamor and evil speaking by being kind to another, having a soft sport of forgiveness. Being the one to step out and do something that is not always seen or experienced in situations that fight kindness. You and I could brightens someone&#8217;s day at work because we showed kindness, we said something nice about what someone wore, or said, or did, or how they smiled. We can affirm our spouses, appreciating them for who they are, what they mean to our lives instead of looking for things of that bring strife. We can encourage our kids in their day to day walk, believing in them and speaking it into their lives. The power of words can begin a process of greatness in the young life. We can also teach them kindness by demonstration between mom and dad on how they treat each other. We all have point of references, something to fall back to. If we all understand that what is desired of us is kindness, we will show more of it on a day to day basis in our homes, in church, community, in our jobs, wherever we go.

When you know the restoration to your life depends on an extraordinary thing, you will not care about what people say or think. A woman with the issue of blood is in a situation where she has spent everything to fix her condition for 12years She has spent money, visited worthless physicians with no improvement. Her condition has robbed her of freedom, relationships, comfort, joy, peace and even money but she is determined to get well. At times you just need assurance that there is still hope in the midst of hopelessness and knowing that whatever is impossible with man is possible with God. She gets to hear about many things Jesus had done and she perceives in herself that her health will only come back through Jesus Christ. She is ashamed of herself and her condition that all she can say is that, &#8221; if I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole&#8230;&#8221;. Her faith is so much boosted to the extent that she knows that if just His name is a strong tower, then even power would flow through what He is wearing. I see her telling herself how she doesn&#8217;t even have to talk to Him or get noticed after all no one wants her around or be around her anyway. In my life I have seen areas that I really needed to touch the hem of His garment because I knew what I was going through and not every one would understand my situation. A desperation propelled me find Jesus and touch His garment. I believe that many times you will not have someone to help you find Him but yourself and you have to be strong enough to encourage yourself. &#8220;It shall be well&#8221; ought to be your attitude. She encouraged herself in the midst of hell and her encouragement helped her make the first move. Crawling under people trying to find her way to Jesus was her move. We don&#8217;t hear her telling people how she is too sick and she needs special help to reach to the Master, she decides to find her own way. When there is no one to carry you to the Master, calm and encourage yourself, crawl if need be, push the obstacles aside and make it to the Master. Something amazing is that everyone had been walking with Jesus and I bet there was no distance between Jesus and those that walked with Him. With that in mind, at least people touched Him whether they wanted to or not and Jesus never questioned them, but when this woman touched Him, He felt power leave Him and He stopped, looked around and asked, &#8220;WHO TOUCHED ME?&#8221;. Isn&#8217;t it funny that many people can walk around the Lord and even touch Him but there is no great impact but someone who has an extraordinary faith who needs something encourages herself just to touch His clothes and be made whole? When I have a desperate situation and I execute a desperate measure, I know that when I touch Him, He will stop and turn around to find me. Make prayers that causes heaven to be in motion and hell to be in chaos. All of sudden all attention is on a woman of faith. She was not even suppose to be there, she wasn&#8217;t even looking for attention to make the matters even more interesting, she wasn&#8217;t even expecting Jesus to look around and be concerned about her life but there she was. She has just touched His garments, she is made whole according to her faith and now the process is about to end. When she confesses that she is the one who touched Him, He turns around and says, &#8220;Daughter, your faith has made you well, go in peace and be healed of your affliction&#8221;. Can you imagine being called son or daughter when you were hopeless at one point? His love goes beyond our afflictions and He does care about what we go through. If He was able to pause for a second when He was on a journey and attend to this hopeless lady, don&#8217;t you think He will do the same for you? One last thing, if she touched His garment and got healed, why would Jesus tell her again to be healed? This was to let her know that it wasn&#8217;t a temporary healing but eternal and not only that, her sins were forgiven and complete restoration of all things were called back to her life (money, relationships, peace, joy etc). Dig your way through today and touch His garments.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Mark 5:25-34, &#8220;&#8230;For she said, if I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole&#8230;&#8221; Desperate people do desperate things if they know that whatever they&#8217;ve got to do will make an impact and a difference in their lives.

Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#8221; Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ&#8217;s power may rest on me. (2 Cor. 12:7 &#8211; 9)<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever had a demonic attack upon your life? The Apostle Paul was demonized, oppressed, but not possessed. Upon hearing the word demon, many think of spiritual warfare, exorcism, prayer, etc&#8230;. However, the one word that most do not think of is the word that the Lord gave to Paul as an answer to his attack, his thorn in the flesh-his trial. Jesus said that what Paul needed was not more anointing, more faith, or even more prayer. He only needed grace, and not even need more grace, but the grace already supplied to him by Christ. He needed grace plus nothing! Paul was praying diligently so his prayer, his faith, and his commitment were not lacking. Why then would God allow an attack on his Apostle? Why does God allow you and I to be attacked?<\/p>\n<p>First to one must understand grace as unmerited favor upon the ill-deserved or God&#8217;s Riches At Christ&#8217;s Expense. His grace was seen perfectly extended toward humanity at the cross. So why would God allow his beloved Apostle to be attacked.<\/p>\n<p>1. God grace is unlimited. &#8220;My grace&#8221; Everything God has is perfect and limitless. He has perfect and limitless love, mercy, wrath, judgment, and power to heal and deliver. Grace belongs to God and He pours it where He wills. Romans 5:20 instructs, &#8220;Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.&#8221; The law makes sin abound, but sin makes grace abound. Where one finds Satan, one will find sin, and where one finds sin, that&#8217;s where God&#8217;s grace abounds. God humbles the sinner, and gives grace to the humble (1 Peter 5:5). Did you forget He is unlimited?<\/p>\n<p>2. God&#8217;s grace is sufficient. &#8220;My grace is sufficient&#8221; One can only fill up a glass of water so much before it overflows. God&#8217;s fills us up with his grace and it is enough, sufficient, all that we can house in our lives. However even with that, the emphasis is on the grace supplier, not upon the vessel to whom it is supplied. God gave Samson grace after Samson ruined his life by telling the secret of his strength and having his eyes plucked out. However God gave him grace, to which he didn&#8217;t deserve (Judges 16), but you and I don&#8217;t deserve his grace either. Are you satisfied with His grace alone?<\/p>\n<p>3. God&#8217;s grace is for the humble. &#8220;&#8230;my power is made perfect in weakness.&#8221; &#8220;God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble (1 Pt. 5:5).&#8221; God wanted to keep His Apostle humble, lest Paul think it was his own power and ability that was the reason for the gospel going forth. God didn&#8217;t want him falling through pride in his calling.<\/p>\n<p>The demonic attack kept Paul humbly seeking His God. Paul\u00a0eeded to remain small in his own eyes. Satan fires at those who have great potential for the Kingdom of God, especially in these last days. How is your pride and humility level? How&#8217;s your potential, are you capitalizing on it like Paul?<\/p>\n<p>4. God&#8217;s Grace is to shine through you. &#8220;&#8230;that Christ&#8217;s power may rest on me.&#8221; We are to make grace amazing to the word, by shining His grace through our lives (Matt 5:16).

The bible says that even the dung of a dove was considered precious and rare commodity that it had to be bought at a high price. This alone gives me a picture that there was such a great famine in this land. Now that we know of the situation, lets look at four men in vs. 3. These are men that have are just unfortunate in the society for no.1 they are lapours that makes their situation unbearable. Anyone who had leprosy in the olden times was out cast of the city and lived in caves, mountains or right out of the city. The lepers were always required to chant &#8220;I&#8217;m unclean, I&#8217;m unclean&#8221;. Situation number one looks severe then comes situation number two which is as lethal as number one and that is famine. Sick and no food, How much can a man take? They are aware of their situation as they are outcasts and they know that sooner or later they would die either by sickness or starvation or both. I love how they reason, vs. 3&amp;4&#8243;&#8230;and they said one to another, why sit here until we die? if we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also&#8221;. I thank God that during some tough times He still allows us to think and reason for though we may be handicapped in some areas, we are reminded that there are certain parts of our lives that still functions. I don&#8217;t want to throw everything out of the window simply because part of me is not functioning like it should. I maybe struggling in some areas and to me that is a leprosy and I might be going without the spiritual food for some unknown reason but I know that I am not dead yet so devil don&#8217;t bring me no casket for God has allowed other part of me to function. The other part of me will bring life at one point to the rest of my being. I see many beat themselves because what was working for them at one stopped. I believe that there are tanks God reserved for a time like this. You might have not known that you had a filled tank but what you are in right now allows Him to open this new tank to let you know you haven&#8217;t lost it all like you think. This is the time you see that you could do more with something you never thought you had. They lost friends, food, health, family but they did not loose their senses, the ability to reason. Yes they were limited but that did not stop them from thinking of the next move, it&#8217;s a risky move but they looked at every thing and they saw that either it could happen or fail. Four feeble men decided to match to the enemies camp in vs. 5, &#8220;And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians&#8221;. They have no weapons, they are sick but they matched to the enemies camp. I know that there are times when God requires us to do the ridiculous things that He may show Himself as God in tough situations. There things He will not accomplish until we make the first move, until we want it badly that we are willing to do anything it takes to get it (pray, fast, seek, knock, ask). There are times when I feel that I have lost so much to function effectively, but those are the times I am reminded that I&#8217;m not dead yet, God had put a tank on reserve for a time like this therefore I will rise up again, take a step of faith and make a move.

For the Lord had made the host<\/p>\n<p>of the Syrians to hear a noise of Chariots, even the noise of horses,<\/p>\n<p>even the noise of great host: and they said one to another, Lo, King if<\/p>\n<p>Israel has hired against us the kings of Hittites, and the kings of the<\/p>\n<p>Egyptians, to come upon us&#8221;. Very interesting, these men made a move<\/p>\n<p>and God took over. You make a move and God will take over, think of<\/p>\n<p>that something that you always wanted to accomplish but because of your<\/p>\n<p>limitations you put it aside cause you saw that there was no way in the<\/p>\n<p>world it could happen. Maybe you desired a promotion or a different job<\/p>\n<p>but you did not have all the required stuff and you thought to<\/p>\n<p>yourself, boy it cannot be mine. Well may I remind you of something,<\/p>\n<p>you see the world crowns success while God crowns faithfulness, you may<\/p>\n<p>not be successful but you can be faithful and that could be a great<\/p>\n<p>strength an employer could be looking for. In God&#8217;s eyes we are not<\/p>\n<p>dealt with by who we are and what we have accomplished but by what we<\/p>\n<p>will be when He is done with us. It&#8217;s good to have the qualifications<\/p>\n<p>but it&#8217;s a greater blessing when the Lord fights for you till the end.<\/p>\n<p>I speaking this principle from experience. Somewhere in Romans 8 it<\/p>\n<p>says, &#8220;them that He called, He justified and them that He justified,<\/p>\n<p>He also glorified&#8221;. This is what faith is all about, hoping for those<\/p>\n<p>things which are not seen and yet believing that they can happen. 2Cor<\/p>\n<p>12:10, &#8220;Therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities, in reproaches and<\/p>\n<p>necessities, in distresses for Christ&#8217;s sake: for when I am weak, then<\/p>\n<p>I am strong&#8221;. The verse is very true that when you are not that&#8217;s when<\/p>\n<p>you are. The bible tells me that the moment they made a move, the Lord<\/p>\n<p>multiplied the sound of their feet and they sounded like a mighty army.<\/p>\n<p>Pause for a sec here, God did not change their condition but He changed<\/p>\n<p>the way the enemy perceived them, God may not change your situation or<\/p>\n<p>circumstance but He may allow the other person to see you not as a<\/p>\n<p>whimp but as an asset. They are weak almost dying, they don&#8217;t have war<\/p>\n<p>clothes and to make it worse, they are just four and yet they sound<\/p>\n<p>like a mighty army? God I don&#8217;t know how you do it but it works. I may<\/p>\n<p>never understand how you operate but I love to be part of your<\/p>\n<p>operations.<\/p>\n<p>The enemy did not care to check whether actually these were warriors<\/p>\n<p>coming after them or not, they just fled leaving their tents, their<\/p>\n<p>horses and everything fleeing for their lives. Greater is He that lives<\/p>\n<p>in side of us than He that is in the world 1John 4:4,. Read the rest of<\/p>\n<p>the story and you will see how they ate and drunk and had a good time,<\/p>\n<p>they came and also mentioned it to the king of Israel of what happened.<\/p>\n<p>The king of Israel thought the Syrians were playing a trick on them and<\/p>\n<p>the Syrians thought Israel came to attack them while we know for sure<\/p>\n<p>that God was in control of the destiny of these four men. All my life I<\/p>\n<p>never got what I deserved or qualified for but what I desired to which<\/p>\n<p>when I made a move, God stepped in and made the sound of my feet sound<\/p>\n<p>like a mighty army and instead of being judged by what I had, I was<\/p>\n<p>judged by what God could offer through me. So the things I have not yet<\/p>\n<p>accomplished will not cause my dreams and desire to die. Though it<\/p>\n<p>looks like nothing is happening and the conditions are getting bad,<\/p>\n<p>part of me maybe affected and may not function effectively but that<\/p>\n<p>will not hinder me from rising up and moving, I may be feeble and I may<\/p>\n<p>not walk well but that is a good sign that I&#8217;m not dead yet, Psalm<\/p>\n<p>118:17, &#8220;I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>My life in Christ is a book yet to be written, a song yet to be sung, a<\/p>\n<p>testimony yet to be testified, a desire yet to be fulfilled, can&#8217;t go<\/p>\n<p>under just because I have leprosy in my life. I encourage you too not<\/p>\n<p>to go down, thou something in your life maybe sucking life out of you<\/p>\n<p>and at times you feel like this is it, well until God says it&#8217;s over<\/p>\n<p>it&#8217;s not over yet, so check the other tanks you did not know you had,<\/p>\n<p>rise up and use that gas to fuel you to the next destination for you<\/p>\n<p>are not dead yet.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Kings 7:1-20, &#8220;And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?&#8221; Vs 5&amp;6.&#8221;And when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.

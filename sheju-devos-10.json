I mentioned recently how we often measure the success of our walk by what we accomplish rather than what He has accomplished for us on the cross. We say something like this, \u201cdying on the cross for our sins was something we could never do, but living the life of a Christian is something we are most capable of doing\u201d. I come across many sermons preached on \u201cHow to\u201d rather than what \u201cHe has\u201d. A while back I was in a Christian book store, it\u2019s shelves were filled with self-help books, filled with \u201chow to\u201d, examples \u201chow to write your ticket with God\u201d, \u201c7 steps to being blessed\u201d, \u201chow to get God\u2019s attention and favor\u201d. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">We say we are saved by grace but behave like our salvation is kept by the law.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">If you are kept by \u201chow to\u201d, you will be discouraged the days you do not pray, read the word, or reach others like you should. If anything, you become an idolater because your joy comes and depends on your accomplishments. Jesus speaking, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cTo some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, \u2026\u201d<\/span> in<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Luke 18:9 <\/span>told of a parable<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. <\/span>While this was addressing those who looked down on others, I see another side of the coin in addressing those who measure their Christian walk by others as the standard. In other words saying something like this, \u201cI do not pray like so and so, maybe I need to try harder etc.\u201d. In giving this parable, Jesus said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. \u201c10 Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">11 The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: \u2018God, I thank you that I am not like other men\u2014robbers, evildoers, adulterers\u2014or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.<\/span>\u2019 His accomplishments, I fast twice in the week &#8211; So did all the strict Pharisees: every Monday and Thursday. I give tithes of all that I possess &#8211; Many of them gave one full tenth of their income in tithes, and another tenth in alms. This was the strictest sect among the Jews; they were men that prayed, and fasted much, and were great sticklers for the ceremonies of the law, and the traditions of the elders, and did all they did to be seen of men. This Pharisee trusted to himself that he was righteous. Most of us may not do it to be seen of men, but we do it to be seen of God and use it as \u201chow to\u201d get blessings from the Lord. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">The Pharisee felt justified, he was no hypocrite for they were the most righteous people by man\u2019s standards. To give a list of his accomplishment was to prep him as a candidate for greater things. The bible says, he prayed about himself, he prayed about his accomplishments, he was the center of his prayer and using a tax collector as his measuring stick for his righteousness. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">In this regards, there were people who tried their best to measure up to them, one could have been the tax collector who found that he fell short he therefore prayed directly to God. It must have been mind boggling when Jesus dropped a bombshell in addressing those who wanted to be righteous as these people, Jesus response,&nbsp; <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Matthew 5:20, \u201cFor I say to you, that unless your righteousness <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">exceeds the righteousness<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven\u201d. <\/span>In other words, unless your righteousness surpasses the righteousness of the most righteous people, you will by no means enter the kingdom of God. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">If we could never attain the righteousness on our own, how do we expect to maintain it unless we fall back on the One who called us in the first place. Paul begins by telling us how we attained the righteousness<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, 2Corinthians 5:21, \u201cFor He (God the Father) made Him (Jesus Christ) who knew no sin to be sin for us (lost sinners), that we might become the righteousness of God (traded places) in Him (completed by Him and in Him). <\/span>Emphasis mine in brackets. Paul then&nbsp; tells us what is required of us to do now that we are made righteous and qualifies it with this statement, it has to be by God for God in us, through us for His glory, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Philippians 2:12-13, \u201c12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure\u201d. <\/span>&nbsp;You bear out what He has produced within.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">We cannot work for what He has already accomplished, we can only bear it. He is the true Vine, we are the branches (John 15). The branches do not produce, they only bear what He has produced. Our job is to bide. Jesus said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Luke 12:32, \u201cDo not fear, little flock, for it is your Father\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">good pleasure to give you the kingdom\u2019\u201d<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.&nbsp; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Acts 17:28, \u201c28&nbsp; for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, \u2018For we are also His offspring<\/span>\u201d. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&nbsp;We are saved by hope, purified by it, blessed by it, kept by it, favored by it.

The lifting up meant being glorified, He says as recorded in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">John 12:23, \u201c\u2026\u201cThe hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified\u201d<\/span> The cross was the means by which the Son of Man be glorified by men when He draws them to Himself. That is why we preach Christ crucified.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Christ, bringing the world to God by the doctrine of His cross, broke the power of sin, and cast out Satan as a deceiver. The soul that was at a distance from Christ, is brought to love Him and trust Him. There is power in the death of Christ to draw souls to Him. That by the cross, we have victory and in that victory is Christ lifted up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">After His death, burial, resurrection and ascension, Jesus left His disciples and those who will believe in Him to continue to lift Him up. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Acts 3<\/span> is one example, as Peter and John were going to the temple to pray, vs. 2 says, a certain man lame was carried by the gate of the temple daily to ask for alms. On this day, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 3-7, \u201c3 who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms. 4 And fixing his eyes on him, with John, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Peter said, \u201cLook at us.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> 5 So he gave them his attention, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">expecting to receive something from them\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Then Peter said, \u201cSilver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> 7 And he took him by the right hand and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">lifted him up<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength\u201d. <\/span>Wow, what a great testimony, Peter presented what they had, Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He proclaimed healing and right then by his hand lifted him up. While it appears that this man was the one lifted up, it was Christ in this miracle lifted up, because right after the miracle, this man was not rejoicing over Peter and John, He was rejoicing over God, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 8. <\/span>Says<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, \u201cSo he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">walking, leaping, and praising God. 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Acts 3:12-16, \u201cSo when Peter saw it, he responded to the people: \u201cMen of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? 13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">glorified His Servant Jesus,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let Him go. 14 But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, 15 and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">which we are witnesses<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. 16 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">in the presence of you all<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d<\/span>. Peter and John had a mission and that is of lifting Christ up and Christ did the rest drawing not only this man but also those who by this means heard the gospel.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">There have been times I have found myself troubled that in my prayer time, I did not lift all the needs I planned to pray for. Then there are those times, people say to me, \u201cthank you for praying for me, I had a break through\u201d While they say such, in the back of my mind I am thinking, \u201cI do not recall praying for that need\u201d. And while sometimes I beat myself that I did not, I come to learn the truth that as I spend more time lifting up Jesus, His cross, as I pray, He draws those in need to Himself. He draws the unsaved, the broken marriages, the sick, etc. because He is more important than all these. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">As Paul Washer said, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cThe priority of prayer in Jesus life, the great majority of His words dealt with one thing, a passion for God to be glorified throughout the world<\/span>.\u201d Prayer is about passion, zeal, drive, hunger, burden to lift Him up, make His name great and advance His kingdom and not ours. In Matthew 6:25-34Jesus talks about worry concerning our needs and how He knows them before we even ask. This was not suggesting that we should not ask because He knows, but rather we ask what we need the most and that is to lift Him up by seeking His kingdom first and His righteousness. That as we lift Him up in our prayers, He will draw you and your needs to Himself for His glory. Who is most lifted up in your prayers, you or Christ? Choose this day who you will lift up. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Blessings <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>John 12:32-33, \u201c32 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to Myself.\u201d 33 This He said, signifying by what death He would die\u201d &nbsp; Jesus thrice speaks of his death as a lifting up, a euphemism for being crucified.

You are not always going to be on top of the mountain. And if you find yourself in the valley, praying will not necessarily mean God will take you out of the valley. This is not an indication of His lack of care or teaching you a lesson. This and all things ought to be about God making much of Himself in the life of believers wherever they may find themselves.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">One common error I constantly see with our walk is trying to make a deal with God. I do this so that you can do that for me.&nbsp; And many of teachings are based on how to get stuff by working something right (mostly working faith). If you are not getting it, it is because you are not working it right. I ask myself many times, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">why do we try so hard to work for the things the Lord already paid for on the cross?<\/span>\u201d We ran back to the summary of the law (love God, love people) and present it to the Lord by saying something like this, \u201cI have done this and that, hopefully you are pleased, now I am a candidate for blessing, bless me\u201d. \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Love God, love people is what the gospel produces not what it commands. It\u2019s not addition to the gospel<\/span>\u201d, Voddie Baucham.

You cannot live the gospel and gain merits for blessings and you cannot live without it and make. It is not a formula for provisions. You and I don\u2019t pray to get God closer to our will, we pray to get closer to His will. The harbor does not move closer to the boat, it is the boat that moves closer to the harbor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">In the former psalm, the past wonders which God had wrought were recounted to His honor. In this Psalm, the psalmist is entreating the Lord to glorify Himself again, he says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. \u201c1 Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, But to Your name give glory, Because of Your mercy, Because of Your truth\u201d. <\/span>The heathen presuming upon the absence of material blessings at a given time led them to ask, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Where is now their God?&#8221;<\/span> It grieved the heart of the godly that God was not honored the way He should, and they beseeched the Lord at least to vindicate His own name. David in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 23:4, <\/span>talks of the Lord leading him in His path of righteousness for <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">His name sake<\/span>. Joshua also used the like argument when he said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Then what will You do <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">for Your great name<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">?\u201d, Joshua 7:9<\/span>. So was Moses when God was ready to wipe out the Israelites for the complaining and murmuring, Moses said, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Exodus 32:12, \u201cWhy should the Egyptians speak, and say, \u2018He brought them out to harm them, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth\u2019? Turn from Your fierce wrath, and relent from this harm to Your people\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">These men had one thing in common,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201cthe glory of God\u201d. <\/span>And the desire of their heart was not to make a deal with God and gain something from Him but God to make much of Himself through their lives even if it meant blessing them or not. Their drive to serve and glorify God was based on \u201cHE IS WORTHY\u201d. That is why they came, that is why they were concerned for His name. They were concerned for His honor and that is why they prayed for victories in their own lives that the heathens\u2019 mouths would be silenced. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">About a year ago after long time of praying and waiting, our later diagnosis showed that for my wife and I to have children naturally was not possible.&nbsp; Through the means of medicine and the aid of insurance we started a process. The IVF done pointed to good promises, at one point we were declared pregnant only for it to be terminate after a short time taking us back to ground zero. Recently as we were checking with our insurance as to what is next, our fears were confirmed when we were told we had maxed our coverage for pregnancy, therefore we are on our own. The first thing that ran through my mind, \u201cbut Lord we have been praying, waiting, trusting. What will those who see us pray think when they see or think our prayers are not answered\u201d. I was concerned for what our prayers should do rather than be concerned with God\u2019s great name for His glory. It also sounded like I was trying to make a deal with God. I should seek God for who HE is, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cNot unto us, O Lord, not unto us, But to Your name give glory\u201d&nbsp; <\/span>because<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> vs. 3, \u201c\u2026our God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases\u201d, <\/span>for His own glory. We are in the valley, however our drive is, \u201cjust because of who You are will we praise You\u201d. We pray because He is worthy of it. We seek for this miracle that He may glorify Himself through it. If He does not bless us, He will still gain glory in our valley.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">In such manner, let us pray when no other plea is available because of our sense of sin; for the Lord is always jealous of His Honor, and will work for His name&#8217;s sake and no other motive will move Him.

Here He further defines those who should come to Him, because in fact not all do come to Christ and there is surely a reason for that.&nbsp; He states, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Come to Me, all who labor and are heavy laden&#8230;&#8221;<\/span>&nbsp; Who are those He was speaking of that are laboring and heavy laden?&nbsp; Is it those with abundance of worldly problems?&nbsp; Is it those who are tired in this life?&nbsp; Perhaps it is those who have such burdens upon them that they literally feel weighed down by such.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard all of these and more as a reason why Christ calls us to come.&nbsp; However, if this is truly the case, then one would surmise that the Donald Trumps, and Bill Gates of the world would not need to come.&nbsp; There are those in this life that are not experiencing worldly labor, and many who don&#8217;t feel heavy laden.&nbsp; To these, Jesus said it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reformation Study Bible shares, &#8220;<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">How difficult it will be for those who have wealth. The difficulty is not because riches in themselves are evil and disqualify those who possess them, but because the rich are tempted to depend upon their riches and may be unable to admit their need of God<\/span>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">Those who labor and are heavy laden are those that see their spiritual bankruptcy illuminated to them by the Lord.&nbsp; These people have labored to keep the Law of God and are heavy laden under its weighty demands.&nbsp; This is why Christ calls such persons to Himself and then says, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Take my yoke upon you and learn of me..<\/span>.&#8221;&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t take them back to the Law they already know their guilt of, and also in addition, and perhaps compounds the problem is that the oral traditions of the scribes and Pharisees went far beyond the demands of God and became a heavy burden on the people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">&#8220;When the law was understood as a way of salvation, it became a \u201cyoke of slavery\u201d (Gal. 5:1). By contrast, the yoke of Jesus, while demanding, is \u201ceasy\u201d because it is from One who is \u201cgentle and lowly in heart\u201d and can provide true rest for the soul (The Reformation Study Bible).&#8221;<\/span>&nbsp; Coming to Christ is therefore refreshing, because one can then rest in the only One who has ever fully, and completely kept the Law along with all of its demands.&nbsp; The realization that Christ has fulfilled the Law, and paid the price for sin makes for a light burden, because Christ becomes, and is the burden bearer.&nbsp; This is what happened to the woman at the well (John 4), the woman caught in adultery (John 8), the publican (Luke 18), Nicodemus (John 3), and the disciples of Christ.&nbsp; He is the only road and door to the Father (John 14:21), and the Father has extended His kindness toward us <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;&#8230;in that while we were yet sinners [Lawbreakers] Christ died for us.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Application<\/span>:&nbsp;

I am working on a blog to post most if not all the messages we have shared with you all. The neat thing about the blog, the messages will be marked by categories dealing with different subjects like marriages, biblical discernment, prayer, faith etc. with that, it will be easy to go back to some of the past messages and find one that suits your interest. Also, you can post your comments and testimonies for each message you like. Family and friends can be directed to it. I intend to add beneficial links, top rated messages, commented messages and other cool stuff. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">If you would like to assist in any way to make this possible, please let me know.

No sensible person would want to labor in a field they feel will not yield anything to them. How can you have a dream that appears to give you a dead end promise yet still hold on? I want to understand what kept Joseph standing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Joseph had a dream as described in Genesis 37, a dream of greatness. A dream showing that his family would one day bow before him. It was a dream that suggested that people would serve him. A dream that was full of life and hope. What was there to stop this dream from coming to pass? At that time there seamed nothing to stop it until his angry brothers tried to kill him only to sell him as a slave. As a slave, he served Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, a dream going the opposite direction (serving instead of being served). Later he is thrown in prison after being lied on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The last place a person with a dream wants to find him or herself is in prison. Prison takes away your freedom, puts a restraint on you, slows you down, puts you on halt, limits you. It appears to be a dead end, something you may be feeling today concerning your job, marriage, ministry. Like Joseph, you found yourself in some type of prison while in pursuit of your dream with no hope to progress any further. You can see God elevating everyone but you. Instead of the Lord sending people to help you, He is sending people to you to help them and some that you have helped forgot about you. Joseph interpreted dreams for Pharaoh&#8217;s butler and baker and their dreams came true while his dream had not been fulfilled. He told the butter, Genesis 40:14, &#8220;But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house&#8221;. The bible says in vs. 23, \u201cYet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him&#8221;. In prison for two more years after the first dreams were fulfilled and the butler restored to his position. He is finally remembered Joseph when Pharaoh had a dream and no one could interpret it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">What is the message behind this story, I believe Joseph was learning about serving and not being served. This is in line with Isaiah 40, &#8220;But they that WAIT upon the Lord&#8230;&#8221;, I used to think that the wait here meant to continue as one is in expectation, then I learnt that &#8220;WAIT&#8221; here was equivalent to a waiter or waitress waiting (serving) people. Joseph&#8217;s strength was in the waiting (serving) knowing he was serving God in every state. If you read the story again, you will learn that his blessing did not come about till he had served others. Which tells me that God cares about us putting other people&#8217;s needs first. That if you want to be great in God&#8217;s kingdom then you have to learn to be a servant of all. God referred to the prophets and leaders in the bible not by their titles but called them servants. That is where their strength was, that is what kept them standing, that is what renewed their strength. &#8220;&#8230;they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint&#8221;. Joseph learnt to sow above what he was facing and not fly away. He could not be weary in his run, neither could he faint in his walk, he learnt to wait. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">When he got to the top, guess what he continued to do?, he waited on people. Some today cannot go any further because they have not learnt to serve others which is selfishness if you look at it. I have learnt that whatever God is doing in our lives, He has someone else in mind to tap into what He is doing. If God is going to bless you, raise you, fulfill your dream, it&#8217;s not just about you but about some people He has in mind also. If God is going to anoint you, it&#8217;s not for you to feel good about being anointed, the anointing is to serve others. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">God First, Others second, You third.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Blessings <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Isaiah 40:31, &#8220;But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint&#8221;. &nbsp; It is easy to do something when what to expect as the outcome especially if you know it is [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-3101","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-O1","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/3101","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=3101"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/3101\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3102,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/3101\/revisions\/3102"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=3101"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=3101"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=3101"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":3099,"date":"2012-11-27T20:42:00","date_gmt":"2012-11-27T15:12:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=3099"},"modified":"2012-12-07T05:23:51","modified_gmt":"2012-12-06T23:53:51","slug":"updates-magnify-his-word-blog","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2012\/11\/27\/updates-magnify-his-word-blog\/","title":{"rendered":"Updates: Magnify His Word&nbsp;Blog"},"content":{"rendered":"<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Good morning,<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Some more good news to share, I uploaded another 100 categorized messages yesterday, praise God.

In as much as some may have had a tough year, the truth of the matter is, God has blessed you in so many areas if you took time to reflect on them. Count your blessings one by one and you will be amazed what the Lord has done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">I have an exciting project coming up I am trusting God to use to even reach more people and strengthen those who are already part of our devotions. I am working on a blog to post most if not all the messages we have shared with you all. The neat thing about the blog, the messages will be marked by categories dealing with different subjects like marriages, biblical discernment, prayer, faith etc. with that, it will be easy to go back to some of the past messages and find one that suits your interest. Also, you can post your comments and testimonies for each message you like. Family and friends can be directed to it. I intend to add beneficial links, top rated messages, commented messages and other cool stuff. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">If you would like to assist in any way to make this possible, please let me know.

In as much as some may have had a tough year, the truth of the matter is, God has blessed you in so many areas if you took time to reflect on them. Count your blessings one by one and you will be amazed what the Lord has done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">I have an exciting project coming up I am trusting God to use to even reach more people and strengthen those who are already part of our devotions. I am working on a blog to post most if not all the messages we have shared with you all. The neat thing about the blog, the messages will be marked by categories dealing with different subjects like marriages, biblical discernment, prayer, faith etc. with that, it will be easy to go back to some of the past messages and find one that suits your interest. Also, you can post your comments and testimonies for each message you like. Family and friends can be directed to it. I intend to add beneficial links, top rated messages, commented messages and other cool stuff. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">If you would like to assist in any way to make this possible, please let me know. I could use some help since there is so much.

The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.\u201d This is what the LORD Almighty says: \u201cIt may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?\u201d declares the LORD Almighty.\u201d Zechariah 8:4-5<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">When reading this verse what comes to mind? Perhaps for many may reminisce about your own childhood. As a child, I remember a neighbor sitting out on his deck often with his wife. I also recall playing on one particular dead end street where I formed many childhood friendships. It was great because there were only two houses on the street so traffic was not an issue. The sight of the aged sitting outside and children playing paints a vivid picture of tranquility and safety. Many seniors today are placed in nursing homes, and many children are not playing in the streets but are, as we say in New York City, \u201crunning the streets.\u201d When will this picture become a reality? In the hit movie, The Lord of the Rings, the King returned to take his throne, and peace reigned in the land. When our King Jesus returns the picture painted by Zechariah will be an authentic one. When Christ returns, the prophet tells us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">1. Wisdom is visible. The aged will sit in the streets, each with cane in hand. Proverbs 16:31 tells us, \u201cGray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained by a righteous life.\u201d Many today are too busy to listen to the wisdom of the aged righteous. However at Christ\u2019s return, I believe, there will be seniors sharing their wisdom to ears ready to listen. When the aged speak do you listen to their wisdom?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">2. Fun is visible. Children were depicted playing in the streets. Many of the streets nowadays are not as safe to play in. Kids are \u201crunning the streets,\u201d getting into trouble, instead of playing. As children many of us laugh, play, dream, and have fun, but as adults we seem to let those things fade into the background, and fall by the wayside by the voice of \u201cresponsibility\u201d and work, to which many follow its tune. Work and responsibilities never seem to end, but it\u2019s time to laugh again, dream again, and yes even to play again. The old saying goes, \u201cAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\u201d Keep the fun flowing in your life. When Christ returns kids will once again be able to play again and perhaps we will all be able to \u201cbe a kid again\u201d ourselves. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">3. Enjoyment is visible. With the aged sitting in the streets and children playing in the streets, life has peace, prosperity, and security. The prophet Isaiah shares similarly in 65:20 \u201cNever again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years\u2026\u201d Praise the Lord, for this time that we have to look forward to of unhindered enjoyment with our Savior, and fellow believers. However there are plenty of things in our lives to enjoy now as we wait.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">A few years back during Christmas season my young nephew Antonio and I got to spend a few quality days together. We played together, laughed together, and even wrestled around in some Star Wars light saber battles. My five year old nephew \u201cTones\u201d as we call him taught me a lot of things that I forget at times, and inspired this message. As we wait for our Savior, let us appropriate wisdom, fun, and enjoyment into our Christian lives, because in His presence is fullness of JOY! <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cThis is what the LORD Almighty says: \u201cOnce again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with cane in hand because of his age.

I know of people who walk and talk as though God owes them something, it&#8217;s like they gave God something to keep, or they did God a favor and now God owes them and should pay them back. God owes you nothing, as a matter of fact, you owe it all to Him. The fact that you breathe is an indication that you owe Him. If that is not enough many walk around accusing God for doing evil things in their lives, well may I remind you that God does not tempt any one and does not bring any calamity in one\u2019s life, He may permit but He will not author it for God is not evil and He cannot tempt anyone with evil.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In Job chapter 1 talks about a conversation God had with Satan, the bible says that the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came along with them. First point to note, the devil is not always in hell as people think, he is called the prince of the air, he also reigns in the heavenlies and he has access to the throne of God and that is what happened. So when God asked him where he came from, he said that he had been roaming back and forth on earth. He is the accuser of the brethren for he came to the throne to accuse Job. God talked highly of Job, Satan said that the reason Job was loyal to God was because of the blessings God had bestowed upon him and the covering. Satan says, &#8220;take away all that he has and he will curse you&#8221; and God gives him permission to touch him and everything that he has but not kill him. God may allow up to a certain level of attack to come our way but He will not allow more than we can handle <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1Cor 10:13, There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above all that you are able;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\"> but with temptation also make a way of escape, that you may be able to bear<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. <\/span>With temptation, with that which you are dealing with, God will make a way of escape, He will use that which we go through to work for our good.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In Job 19 we see how one of Job&#8217;s friends who should be an encouragement to him during his tough time is attacking him. No servants to command to do things, the wife to stand by him has already asked him to curse God and die. He has boils all over his body, he stinks, he is broken. He has lost all his possessions, respect, children I mean all that he could need in life was all gone. He does not feel the presence of the Lord. Ever been in a situation where everybody you thought would stand with you were nowhere to be found? and all the help was gone? This is kind of Job&#8217;s experience. Next time you think you have had it bad, try getting hold of Job and he will show you how your situation is nothing. Job has complained, has murmured, has desired that he would not have been born, he wished he could die but still after every scene and after every episode, he encourages himself <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Job 13:15, &#8220;Though He slay me, yet I will maintain mine own ways before him&#8221;, Job 23:10, &#8220;He knows the way that I take, after He has tried me, I will come forth as gold&#8221;. <\/span>When no one could encourage him, he encouraged himself during his tough times. You are your best encourager when it comes to hard times. Build your own foundation of encouragements. Let someone come and help you build the wall but be the one to lay a foundation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">After talking about what they have done to him in Job 19 nearly at the end of the chapter he encourages himself in vs.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> 25&amp;26 &#8220;For I know that my Redeemer lives; And He shall stand at the last on the earth.

After going through everything, all you got is God. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The word Redeemer comes from the word redeem which means to recover ownership of by paying a specified sum, it also means to set free, rescue or ransom<\/span>. Jesus Christ redeemed us from the law of sin and death by shading His blood on the cross. We were once worthless yet bought with the highest price, the blood. He paid more than we cost and so even with Job, he knew that his <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Redeemer (rescuer lived) after going through everything the Redeemer would stand on earth in him because 1John 4:4, &#8220;Ye are of God ye little children for you have overcome them, for greater is He that lives (Redeemer) inside of you than he that lives in the world&#8221;. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">And after my skin is destroyed, this I know, that in my flesh I shall see God<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, 1Peter 5:10, &#8220;But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">after you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish you, strengthen you, settle you<\/span>&#8220;. All this can only happen because our Redeemer lives, He\u2026 <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 103:5, &#8220;Who redeems my life from destruction&#8221;. <\/span>Can you imagine someone paying a price for you not to be destroyed, not to fail, not to perish? I thank God for He is my Redeemer, I haven&#8217;t earned it and I will never but I&#8217;m glad that He has Redeemed me. When no one could buy me back and free me, the same God whom I thought forgot about me is the same God who came and rescued me. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">He owed me nothing yet He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood<\/span>.

There are days everyone is so overwhelmed by things that you just can&#8217;t take it no more. Frustrations have pushed you to the edge that how to deal with them are nearly impossible. You have tried to strengthen yourself but you find yourself back to worrying, helpless and confused. Tears roll down your cheeks and you just can&#8217;t help stop it. You wish that the people you love are around to help you overcome what you have to deal with but still that doesn&#8217;t happen. What do you do? I have been there, felt it, wanted to run away, cried myself to sleep but in all I learnt more about the one who knows my down sitting and my uprising, the one who is familiar with my ways. He knows when I am so weak and just need to stop and cry.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">It&#8217;s easy to see someone stand strong as a soldier but like a song goes, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">they don&#8217;t know that I would go running home when I fall down, they don&#8217;t know who picks me up when no one is around, I drop my sword and cry for a while, cause deep inside this armor, the warrior is a child<\/span>&#8220;. Many people tend to see the armor but let them take a deeper look and see that inside that armor, the person in it has the heart of a child. A heart that can melt, be broken, be scared but that is okay because it teaches you more on who to depend on. God does bring us to those seasons so that our confidence is not in any man but in Him. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 94:17, &#8220;Unless the Lord had been my help, My soul would have settled in silence<\/span>&#8220;, Had it not been for the Lord&#8217;s help, whatever I do or what other people have done would have either failed or just became a temporary solution to my problem. In a case like this, who can give peace apart from God? Many times it&#8217;s the peace that is needed to endure. If you had peace inside, even if the situation did not change, adapting to it made you comfortable. Comfort does not mean you are okay with but it means you can deal with it without it dealing with you. God helps us so that we are at peace because His peace surpasses all human understanding. The bible says in<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Philippians 4:7, &#8220;And the peace <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">OF<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> God&#8230;&#8221;, <\/span>it&#8217;s the peace that originates from above, no one can give it but Him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 18, &#8220;If I say, &#8220;My foot slips,&#8221; Your mercy, O Lord, will hold me up<\/span>&#8220;. Mercy and grace tends to work together, when you have peace inside, God gives the grace to endure. Paul after praying three times for something to be removed, God&#8217;s word came to him in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2Corinthians 12:9, &#8220;And He said to me, &#8220;My grace us sufficient for you, My strength is made perfect in weakness&#8221;<\/span>.

What should frustrate you, He has given you peace to ride it out. Sooner or later, you are taught more on how to encourage yourself like Paul and David that even if there is no one around, you can encourage yourself in the Lord. When God has taught you more of it, don&#8217;t be surprised if He brings people your way who will need the same encouragement because His words made a difference in your life.

Is it not I, the LORD?\u201d (Exodus 4:11). <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In other words, behind all disease and disability is the ultimate will of God. Not that Satan is not involved\u2014he is probably always involved in one way or another with destructive purposes (Acts 10:38). But his power is not decisive. He cannot act without God\u2019s permission. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">That is one of the points of Job\u2019s sickness. The text makes it plain that when disease came upon Job<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">\u201cSatan<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u2026struck Job with loathsome sores\u201d (Job 2:7)<\/span>. His wife urged him to curse God. But Job said, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Shall we receive good <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">from God<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> , and shall we not receive evil?\u201d (v. 10)<\/span>. And again the author of the book commends Job by saying, \u201cIn all this Job did not sin with his lips.\u201d <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In other words: This is a right view of God\u2019s sovereignty over Satan. Satan is real and may have a hand in our calamities, but not the final hand, and not the decisive hand. James makes clear that God had a good purpose in all Job\u2019s afflictions: <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cYou have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful\u201d<\/span> (James 5:11). <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">So Satan may have been involved, but the ultimate purpose was God\u2019s, and it was \u201ccompassionate and merciful.\u201d <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">This is the same lesson we learn from 2 Corinthians 12:7, where Paul says that his thorn in the flesh was a messenger of Satan and yet was given for the purpose of his own holiness: \u201cTo keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me\u2014to keep me from exalting myself! <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Now, humility is <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">not <\/span>Satan\u2019s purpose in this affliction. Therefore, the purpose is God\u2019s.

His tribulations, longsuffering came about through open enemies and persecutors of the Gospel, and towards them that were within, the brethren, whose infirmities he bore. To the Philippians he writes, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;\">12 But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel, 13 so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my chains are in Christ; 14 and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear\u201d Philippians 1:12-14. <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;\">Biblical manhood calls for endurance, a biblical perspective in relations to longsuffering.

This underscores the importance of trusting God\u2019s purposes in the midst of suffering, even when we don\u2019t know what those purposes are. In the end, we learn the lesson that we may never know the specific reason for our suffering, but we must trust in our sovereign God. That is the real answer to suffering.

He encouraged believers to pray, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;\">1Timothy 2:1-3.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;\"> Paul also surrounded himself with men who he encouraged (sharpened) and encouraged (sharpened) him in this journey, for example&nbsp; with Onesiphorus,<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Calibri;\">2 Timothy 1:16-17, \u201cThe Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; 17 but when he arrived in Rome, he sought me out very zealously and found me\u201d. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Paul\u2019s manner of life was driven by diligence, excellence and hard work.

He even says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2Thessalonians 3:10, \u201c\u2026: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat\u201d<\/span>.

Today a number of things would be considered in defining a real man. Some by climbing mount Everest, more toys, are in higher leadership positions, or has killed a lion by certain tribes etc. Biblical manhood puts the focus on other greater things, spiritual things that affect our human response and behaviors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Paul in vs. 10 of this chapter highlights things that made him a man, and more so a man of God.

Behavior is an extension of theology, and there is a direct correlation between what we think and how we act.&nbsp; &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Theology<\/span>&#8221; simply means &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">the study of God<\/span>.&#8221; Christian theology is simply an attempt to understand God as He is revealed in the Bible. No theology will ever fully explain God and His ways because God is infinitely and eternally higher than we are. Therefore, any attempt to describe Him will fall short (Romans 11:33-36). However, God does want us to know Him insofar as we are able, and theology is the art and science of knowing what we can know and understand about God in an organized and understandable manner. Some people try to avoid theology because they believe it is divisive. Properly understood theology unites believers. Proper, biblical theology is a good thing; it is the teaching of God&#8217;s Word (2 Timothy 3:16-17).<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">The study of theology, then, is nothing more than digging into God&#8217;s Word to discover what He has revealed about Himself. When we do this, we come to know Him as Creator of all things, Sustainer of all things, and Judge of all things. In this we glorify Him through our love and obedience. Notice the progression here: we must get to know Him before we can love Him, and we must love Him before we can desire to obey Him. Paul urges his other son in the faith Titus to embrace and teach sound doctrine , <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Titus 1:9, \u201cholding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict<\/span>\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Titus 2:1,\u201dBut as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine: .Titus 2:6\u201d Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded, 7 in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, 8 sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">It is easy to get side-tracked in the Christian life. We have to keep our eyes on the prize being rewarded in heaven by Jesus Christ (2 Timothy 4:8). We must strive to avoid both false doctrine and ungodly practices. This can only be accomplished by being grounded in our knowledge of God\u2019s Word and firm in our refusal to accept anything that is unbiblical. A man of God who is to lead and protect his wife, children, the body must be biblically sound, embracing the doctrine of Christ as his.

Therefore not the angels of God only, but the God of angels himself will come to his rescue in all perilous times, and will effectually deliver him. No one has ever loved God with a perfect love apart from Christ, but Hebrews 11 talks about the heroes of faith who loved God but not with a perfect love and God came to their rescue many times. It is love, love set upon God, which is the distinguishing mark of those whom the Lord secures from all trouble<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c\u2026..

You would not feel comfortable going to another father to ask for something, but with your father who you have close relationship with, who you know his name and nature, you feel comfortable asking him anything you need.

It depicted how the jeep could dodge things coming at it to destroy it. Up on the mountain, you would see rocks, trees etc. coming at it, yet they were falling on its side none destroying it. One of their main points (though not accurate in my judgment) was that it could survive in that environment because they built it to.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">While the jeep manufactures can exaggerate what their car can do, the life of a believer is built and secured by His maker. He is built to be an overcomer, a conqueror through Christ who strengthens him (<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Philippians 4:13).<\/span> He is made to survive in his surrounding whether things change or not. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1John 5:4<\/span>, qualifies it when it says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">4 \u201cFor whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world\u2014our faith\u201d. <\/span>This is a huge struggle for us as believers because even though we know this truth, we feel deficient and paralyzed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;\">The man who communes with God is not affected by this infection and corruption; he holds the truth when falsehood is all the fashion.

While the Egyptians were plagued by it, not with the Israelites, a thousand were falling on their on their side and ten thousand on their right hand side however none of the plagues including the one that claimed the lives of the first born had effect on them. &nbsp;This shows both the great devastation made by the plague where it came, and the special care and providence of God in preserving His people from it. The Lord assured them that , \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;\">8&nbsp;Only with your eyes shall you look,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Calibri;\"> And see the reward of the wicked\u201d. <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;\">They did see and hear but none of it descended on them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Vs. 9.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201cBecause you have made the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, your dwelling place 10 No evil shall befall you, Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;\u201d. <\/span>The Israelites took the Lord at His word and applied the blood of the lamb on the door post of their homes so that when the angel of death appeared, they would be protected from what was about to befall others. The Psalmist here may have looked back to those days and learned a valuable lesson of making the Lord His trust, His refuge, His dwelling place for safety in the midst of danger. Ascribing all this safety to the Lord; whose providence was in a peculiar manner over him, whose power protected him, and he was as an asylum or city of refuge to him; so that nothing could hurt him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;\">Vs. 11 \u201cFor He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways\u201d, <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;\">I think we minimize the ministry of the angels, we forget that God has set His angels (notice the plurality) over His children.

If there is anything about the mother hen, she is very sensitive to the presence of danger especially that of hawks. She has a way of sensing its presence and then alerting her chicks of the danger so that they come around her or hide. She opens her wings ready to fight for her chicks. God does the same, He alerts us of the dangers of life and brings us close to Him as He fights the snare of the fowler on our behalf. We are foolish and weak as poor little chicks, and are very apt to be lured to our destruction by cunning foes, but if we dwell near to God, He will see to it that the most skillful deceiver shall not entrap us. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">The Lord who is our refuge and fortress, demonstrates it by what He will do for His children, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 3 <\/span>\u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler And from the perilous pestilence\u201d<\/span>.&nbsp; \u201cSurely\u201d is an absolute word, the psalmist who knew his God would not use any doubting words but rather assuring words. Assuredly no subtle plot shall succeed against one who has the eyes of God watching for his defense.&nbsp; Even when it looks like the enemy is winning, he has no chance. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. \u201c4 He shall cover you with His feathers, And under His wings you shall take refuge; His truth shall be your shield and buckler\u201d. <\/span>Something interesting about the mother hen is gathering her chicks under her wings, sometimes you wouldn\u2019t know that there are chicks hidden under her wings. The mother hen fiercely guards the chicks, and will brood them to keep them warm. She leads them to food and water; she will call them to edible items, and feeds them indirectly. What has God done with us, He has given us the truth of Himself to feed us, lead us, to keep us warm, and to shield us from danger.&nbsp; Jesus lamenting over Jerusalem tells us of how we have wanted to treat them like a mother hen does to her chicks, He says <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c37 \u201cO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!

The terrible things that happen in the night; as fire, storms and tempests, invasion of enemies, murders, thefts, and, robberies, a righteous man, when he has committed himself and his family to the care and protection of God by prayer and His word, has no reason to be anxious because he knows he is under God\u2019s care. In addition, neither pestilence that walks in darkness nor destruction that lays waste at noonday creates terror to those who make the Lord their trust. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Isaiah 59:19 <\/span>verse among others gives us that assurances, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">So shall they fear The name of the LORD from the west, And His glory from the rising of the sun; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">When the enemy comes in like a flood<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">The Spirit of the LORD will lift up a standard against him<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">We live in a crazy world, we sometimes see the dangers coming and sometimes we don\u2019t.

It\u2019s a very important number to call when there is emergency, many times due to injuries, abuses, life threatening etc.&nbsp; You call that number because you need assistance, your life at that point depends on it because you need rescue over what is beyond you. No one dials the number for fun. While this is good and vital, we believers have another 911 number we can call Psalm 91:1.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;\">Psalm 91:1, \u201cHe who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty\u201d.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;\"> When you talk about dwelling, you talk about residing. That is where you live, that is where you shoot for when you have had a long day. I always look forward to going home after hard work, vacation, trips etc. They say there is no place like home. We have a dwelling place, secret dwelling place in the Lord. I know not of a better way to make it a secret place in the Lord but in communing with Him in prayers. Jesus said as recorded in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;\">Matthew 6: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Calibri;\">6,\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;\">But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-family:Candara;\">pray to your Father who is in the secret place<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;\">; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Calibri;\">\u201d.&nbsp; <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;\">It\u2019s in this secret place of the Most High shall we abide (remain) under the shadow of the Almighty. His shadow alone ought to be comfort to know He is near those who trust in Him. I tie this with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;\">John 15:7<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;\"> where Jesus said, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;\">7 If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;\">\u201d. The condition of this blessed promise is that we abide, dwell in the Vine. The prayer is the means by which I believe we abide and that is where the word of Christ takes root in our hearts. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-family:Candara;\">Faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God, and prayers lays and establishes the foundation by which these two are secured<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Candara;\">. This abides when it comes in power, and becomes the engrafted word; and may be said to do so, when such, in whose hearts it has a place, and has taken deep root, continue to have a relish and savor of it. A true and hearty affection for it, stands fast in it, steadfastly abiding by it, and constantly attending on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">He that by faith chooses God for his protector, speaks these words in confidence, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 2, \u201c I will say of the Lord, \u201cHe is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.<\/span>\u201d And those who have found the comfort of making the Lord their refuge, cannot but desire that others may do so, they therefore for them to have such experience. The spiritual life is protected by Divine grace from the temptations of Satan, which are as the snares of the fowler, and from the contagion of sin, which is a noisome pestilence. Great security is promised to believers in the midst of danger. Wisdom shall keep them from being afraid without cause, and faith shall keep them from being unduly afraid. Whatever is done, our heavenly Father&#8217;s will is done; and we have no reason to fear. God&#8217;s people shall see, not only God&#8217;s promises fulfilled, but his threatening against all that threatens His children. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">When the call is made, the person who calls knows help is on the way. They take comfort that they matter otherwise who would rescue a person who does not matter. Everything stops and attention is given to the one who needs it.&nbsp; This is the same with us, when we call our heavenly emergency line, we are brought under His care and there can we reside, making it our dwelling place.

Every account of miracle Jesus performed always pointed to a bigger picture with spiritual lesson mostly behind the miracles. A number had questioned the reasons behind this man\u2019s blindness as if to show that sin was the cause. They questioned whether it was his or his parents sins the reason he was born blind. The Lord\u2019s response, \u201cit\u2019s not because of any of their sins but that the work of the Lord might be revealed\u201d. Many are condemning themselves right now because of what they believe they did, the reason they are dealing with difficult times. Part of it could be true, but do you know that <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Jesus does not bless us on the merit of what we have done, He does it on the basis of what who He is, what He can do and has done?<\/span> That is the story of this blind man.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">We then see how Jesus spat on the ground, made clay and anointed the blind man&#8217;s eyes and then asked him to go and wash at the pool of Siloam. Is this not amazing that the Lord can use what is despised to get the job done. That whatever is despised, if it\u2019s in His hands, He can do extra ordinary out of the ordinary. We also take a notice that He does not ask any one for permission to do it, not even consult with His disciples. When God begins to bless you, He will not seek any man\u2019s input or approval, He will do it because He has chosen to. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">The man is sent down I believe by himself to go and wash his eyes. Another amazing thing, when the Lord begins to do something in your life, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">He will ask you to do the impossible because He has already made impossible possible<\/span>.&nbsp; Remember this man is blind and to make matters worse, he has heavy clay in his eyes and yet he is told to find his way to the pool. God will guide His children in right direction to the right place without them even knowing how to get there and without them interfering with His plans.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">So the man goes and does as he is instructed and he comes back seeing. The experience humbled him to do what we would call silly. God uses the smallest things to confound the biggest things that many may know that He can do anything at any time using any means. The man who had just received his sight comes back rejoicing and I would think that everyone would be happy for him but that&#8217;s not the case. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I have discovered that when God begins to bless and raise you, you will discover that you don&#8217;t have a problem with God but you have a problem with people because people have a problem with you being blessed<\/span>. As long as this man was blind, everyone was okay with his condition but the moment he gains his sight, his blessings became an issue. This man could not stop testifying of what the Lord had done in his life. The more he testified, the more they were against him. When God begins to raise you, you&#8217;ve got to rise up even if you are by yourself, folks may murmur and complain but you got to rise up. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Your destiny is not determined by someone else&#8217; actions<\/span>, it&#8217;s for you and I to forget those things behind us and press on forward. Your hope and my hope should be built on NOTHING LESS THAN JESUS. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Do not forfeit your blessings just because someone does not like it<\/span>. Give God all the glory, praise Him, testify, let people know what the Lord has done and is doing in the midst of all the criticism.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">When they continued to question the man about his healing and even suggested that the One who have healed him was a sinner and a nobody, the once upon a time blind man\u2019s faith could not be shaken.

We have been given an awesome opportunity as believers not just to accept anything without first testing and approving and that&#8217;s why we become vessels God can use to reach His people as we have known the truth. Some believers have also fallen on the trap as they were not well equipped enough to differentiate or discern between what was an error and what was right. Some of the wrong things have been presented in such a way that they appeared true.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">A man of God by the name of Elijah was the only prophet in Israel. Many of the prophets had been killed because they did not follow Baal. Baal was the most popular god of the Canaanite, he was a god of lust, power and fertility. He was known to be a god that supplied the rain to the crops when there was draught. In his time, Elijah called the draught into existence, and the only way to override the call was not too look to Baal but God. Baal had 450 prophets who faithfully served him and Elijah got so sick seeing people worship something that had no power. No wonder Paul writes in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2Tim 3:5, &#8220;having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof&#8221;, <\/span>some believers have a form of godliness and denies the power in the sense that they are faithful about going to church, worshipping, and walking with God but that&#8217;s about it, they don&#8217;t see God as Almighty who can do anything. In the world, people have a form of godliness but they deny the power, they are doing everything about keeping commandments and know about God but deny the power to save and forgive their sins. Elijah was dealing with the same kind of people only that these ones worshiped a false god. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">It&#8217;s time to prove that whoever answers by fire is the true God. One man against 450 prophets, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">it&#8217;s time to prove that it&#8217;s not by might nor by power but by His Spirit says the Lord<\/span>. So Elijah challenges the men to meet him on mount Carmel, he advises them to bring two bulls, one for them and one for him. One man was not threatened by the number. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Truth is never threatened by the number, it always stands alone<\/span>. He decides to give them the first chance to prepare their sacrifice. The true people of God are not intimidated by what&nbsp; the false religion has to offer before them. I have seen people from other religions tremble when we challenged their doctrines why? they have no foundation of the truth to build their beliefs on. They have been trained on how to respond to certain questions and if challenged they quiver with fear. Finally the prophets have set their sacrifice on the altar and began to call on their god. They made their own god, they prayed to, today their god is put to a challenge (test) . The whole day they cry and weep and chant the name of their god, meanwhile Elijah is watching and making fun of them, he knows that at one point he will need to call on his God but it will not take hours before He answers him. After they prayed all day and nothing happened, they gave up, their god failed them big time. I don&#8217;t know about you but if I was to pray to a god all day and nothing happens, I would change to a god who answers and that is where the Almighty God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Elijah takes his sacrifice and sets it on the altar, he goes even ahead and pours overflowing water on the sacrifice. Now we know that water and fire don&#8217;t work together and my concern is how will a wet sacrifice burn especially when we know that wet wood cannot catch fire?. He knew that this people might say that he did something that caused the fire but that wasn&#8217;t going to be the case. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 36, &#8220;Lord of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">that this people may know that You are God<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">and that You have turned their hearts back to you again<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;. Vs. 38.&#8221;Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench&#8221;.<\/span> This kind of prayer reminds me of lost people I will meet. As lost people, they have something they are worshipping that needs to be challenged. I will need to pray the kind of prayer that will cause God to send fire from heaven to consume their wet hearts, confusion and darkness in their lives. This is God&#8217;s work, all I need to do is to represent Him and He will take care of the rest. God is a consuming fire and when He begins to consume, He consumes everything including the things that in natural that cannot be consumed by fire. I believe that God has placed us in different positions to be <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">us against the world<\/span>. How will they know unless they are told, how will they come out unless they are challenged, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;for I am not a shamed of the gospel cause it&#8217;s the power of God unto salvation&#8221; Rom 1:16. <\/span>The only way we will challenge the unbelievers is by knowing who God is, what He can do and availing ourselves to be used at any given time to bring people to Him. If you look at the story, you will see how the prophets began to worship the true God but still Elijah killed all of them because they were false prophets injecting lies in the minds of people. Be God&#8217;s instrument He can use you to challenge and bring people to the full knowledge of Him.

I am talking about beyond our usual prayers, prayers that causes heaven to stop and listen. The prayers that sends hell into chaos. Daniel made these kind of prayers and what did Daniel have that we don\u2019t have at our disposal? If there is one mission the enemy has, it is to stop believers from praying and I think he has succeeded in many levels. He is afraid of weak men on bended knees. I have purposed in my heart to make prayers that move heaven and prayers that shake hell, my life depends on it. I have found that the times I prayed these kind of prayers, the more I was able to fight my battles effectively, my faith was elevated to the next level&nbsp; and&nbsp; the more I was encouraged for I knew I had brought all my cares upon Him who cares, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1Peter 5:6&amp;7.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">Be anxious for nothing in&nbsp; other words be careful, nervous, moody, worried, concerned, restless, fretful, fearful, frightened <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">for nothing <\/span>for all these are a hindrance to effective praying. When these things begin to creep in, faith and confidence in Christ is paralyzed. With prayer and supplication, which are the praying stages, we understand the reason we pray is because we know<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> GOD CAN. <\/span>I used to get frustrated because when I prayed at times to God sometimes it felt like my prayers were not being answered and I became discouraged. I later realized with God\u2019s help that the first thing why I should pray is because <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">God can<\/span> (able). I should not pray primarily because <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">God will<\/span>, I should pray because <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">God can<\/span>. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Whether He does it or not should not be my biggest concern. My concern should be, did I believe that He could do it to bring it to Him?<\/span> This kind of attitude humbles me to trust Him for something I know I\u2019m not qualified to have but because He has qualified me to have it, He will give it to me any way according to His will while I pray. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mark 11:24, &#8220;What thingsover you desire when you pray, believe you receive them and you shall have them&#8221; . <\/span>Let the priority of your prayer be that GOD CAN<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. <\/span>The leper who came to Jesus in Mathew 8 did not come because Christ was willing to heal him but rather because he believed Christ had the ability to heal. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">He said, \u201cLord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.\u201d 3 Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d Immediately his leprosy was cleansed\u201d, Matthew 8:2-3. <\/span>He did not say \u201cif you CAN\u201d, that was settled in his heart.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201cGod can\u201d leads to \u201cGod wills\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">This is good stuff knowing that instead of worrying, we can come to the Lord in prayer and supplication. I believe that for a prayer to be complete,&nbsp; praises and thanksgiving must be incorporated. David tells us that he will come into His gates with praises and thanksgiving in his heart. I don&#8217;t need to wait for a thanksgiving dinner to give a one minute thanks, it is a daily thing. Here thanksgiving could be in two ways, giving thanks for the things He has done and thanking Him in advance for the things not yet done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">Prayer is vital for it paves away for God to move in our lives, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">but we have stop worrying about the outcome<\/span> and pray because Christ has called us to pray <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2Chro 7:14, &#8220;If my people which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and forgive their sins and heal their land&#8221;<\/span>. No way can one survive and make it without prayers. If you are not praying for whatever reason, adjust your attitude, take time to pray effectively, earnestly, constantly and by faith.

As much as what people do destroy, what people say can do even a greater damage and it&#8217;s because what has been may quickly heal unlike what has been said stays in the memory. Friendships have been broken due to what came out of the tongue. Husbands and wives have ended up in great fights because of the tongue.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 18:22, says &#8220;Death and life is in the power of the tongue&#8230;&#8221;, <\/span>as you can see, the tongue is a very small instrument in our bodies but has power. James gives us an example of how powerful the tongue is vs. 4 where he says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;&#8230;ships: although they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires&#8221; <\/span>and so is the tongue, it has power to control the entire body. The tongue can start fire and spread it like wild fire fast. The fire is never satisfied when it is consuming and so is the tongue. In school as a teenager, my mouth always landed me in trouble. I never had strength to physically fight so I fought with my tongue. I always got beaten because of my mouth. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James again says in vs. 6, &#8220;And the tongue is a fire of world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature&#8221;<\/span>. It&#8217;s by the tongue that cussing and swearing comes about; backbiting and gossip; all lies are spread by the tongue; deception and misleading mostly come through the tongue; persuasion is another result of what the tongue can do. There is so much that the tongue can do and yet <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James 3:8, says &#8220;But no man can tame the tongue&#8221;. <\/span>We use the tongue to scold, to nag, to slander, to quarrel, can no man tame. Under pressure and anger, people have said things that should have not come out of their mouths at all. What was released by the tongue damaged big time in small amount of time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">The bible does not say that the tongue cannot be tamed, it only tells us man cannot tame it. This instrument of speech can be used destructively or employed constructively., <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James 3:9, &#8220;With it (tongue) we bless our God, and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God&#8221; vs. 10 &#8220;Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing&#8221;. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">I&#8217;m not just talking about what you say that affect others but what you say that affects you. Many speak death in their own lives, they speak defeat, and they speak curses in their lives. Instead of being an encouragement to themselves like David for the sake of God\u2019s destiny, hope and courage for them, they use it as knife cutting their own throats. No wonder many fall in depression and sickness for they have taken their tongue and used it as a lethal weapon to bring destruction to themselves. You can tell the outworking of the internal by what someone has inside. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Luke 6:45, says &#8220;&#8230;of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks<\/span>&#8221; and with this verse you can tell what someone has inside as that is what will come out. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The tongue is the manifestation of what is inside, it brings out what is harbored inside.<\/span> As said earlier, man cannot tame the tongue but God can for what gets out of men&#8217;s control does not get out of God&#8217;s control. My tongue and your tongue ought to be used to build and not tear; bless and not curse; promote and not demote; uplift and not bring down. It&#8217;s in the process of yielding to the Lordship of Jesus Christ that we learn the art of using our tongue to glorify God. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">You will never bring your tongue under God&#8217;s control until you realize you need it controlled. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Isaiah 6:5, &#8220;So I said, woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips (tongue), And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts&#8221;<\/span>. Isaiah could not see the damage his tongue was doing until his eyes saw the Lord of hosts and how Holy He is and then realized who he was. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Isaiah 6:7, &#8220;And he touched my mouth with it (live coal), and said: &#8220;Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged&#8221;. <\/span>With his admission and confession, he humbled himself and the Lord touched his lips (tongue) with a live coal. Live coal will burn however it will do you and I good. Isaiah was not ready for service until a transformation took place in his life. Where are you with your tongue? what damages has it done? have you asked for forgiveness from those that you hurt with your words? are you gossiping behind someone&#8217;s back? &#8220;Remember that he\/she who tells you about others, tells others about you&#8221;.

Even the judge before he delivers a verdict first listens to the case. Listening lets you process what goes in, then applying&nbsp; wisdom as to how it will come out. Those who are quick to speak lack the wisdom that is required to process what will come out of the mouth. You know of those times things came out of your mouth you wished you took time to process in your mind before speaking them out. One of the barriers to communication in marriages is couples tend to be quick to speak and slow to listen when it should be the other way round. What happens is that our mouths are loaded with words ready to fire. We want our points to come across first and therefore what is being said is not being taken in to be processed and brought out in wisdom. Under pressure we speak words we don&#8217;t mean and once they are fired, they cannot come back. We can also do this with our kids. There are parents who just want to tell their kids what they must do neglecting the opportunity to listen to what their kids have to say. Some have belittled their kids by what they say to them. The kids should get their definition from home. Mom and dad who are raising them are the ones to affirm them. Listening may not mean you do what they say but giving them a place to air their voices, this would also let you know which areas they are growing in and which areas you need to help them develop. Parents say, &#8220;kids don&#8217;t listen&#8221;, and now kids are saying, &#8220;parents don&#8217;t listen&#8221;. Listening is hard but vital. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">Then James says, &#8220;slow to speak&#8221;, The order of things, &#8220;quick to listen&#8221; then &#8220;slow to speak&#8221;. This is not talking about speaking slowly but being careful about what you say and how you say it. This requires wisdom for in the process of being hasty to speak, corrupted words may be close. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 10:19, says, &#8220;In the multitude of words sin is not lacking, But he who restrains his lips is wise&#8221;. <\/span>There is safety in listening than speaking.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;color:black;\">If we become great listeners and slow to speak, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if offenses and being angry would be minimized because of the order of things. Listening shows you value what someone has to say and without listening, we will continue to battle without great solutions. Be quick to listen and slow to speak, you could save yourself a lot of heartache.

And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.&#8221; (Acts 8:29-30; 38-39)<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">During war time in the military, when a platoon is trying to find the enemy and the military leader suddenly places his hand in the air and closes his fight, all his troops immediately stop. Why because their eyes are on their leader, and one more step could be a landmine that could blow off their leg, or end their very life. Even towns and cities know the value of stopping which is why they have placed stop signs and stop lights to better control traffic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">There are times when God wants us to stop and not take another step forward. Perhaps one is reading God&#8217;s word and a certain truth seems to bring off the page into your spirit and it stops you in your tracks. If you&#8217;re like most, you stop for a moment because it&#8217;s like a stop light, and then you envision a green light and you go. However, when God stops you as you are reading His word, it is because there is a truth, a warning, an encouragement, a piece of wisdom, etc&#8230; that He has for you now. In our church one member was reading the Scriptures and the words from Genesis, &#8220;Who told you that,&#8221; seemed to leap off the page at them. This in turn caused her to weigh the words others said to them, or perhaps even their own thoughts that came into their mind. Have you said to yourself, &#8220;I&#8217;m a failure,&#8221; or were you ever told hurtful words such as &#8220;you&#8217;ll never amount to anything.&#8221; Who told you that! Did God say that to you? When we are stopped in our tracks as we read God&#8217;s word, there is a reason and God knows that reason, and failure to stop at that verse, passage, question, word, command will result in a consequence. A soldier failing to stop could be killed, a car failing to stop at a light may crash, a Christian failing to stop will feel the effect and it could be disastrous. Just as the military leader signals stop because he senses grave danger ahead, how much more should we as Christians stop, because when God says &#8220;STOP,&#8221; He sees what is ahead for us, and failing to stop when He says stop will not turn out in our favor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">The Spirit told Philip to go and STOP at the chariot, but never gave the reason to Philip. Philip ran and STOPPED hearing the eunuch reading the Scriptures, and Phillip shared Jesus with him. Imagine if<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Philip didn&#8217;t STOP. Who would have explained the passage of Scripture to the eunuch? Then the newly converted eunuch gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. However when they came up out of the water the Holy Spirit had translated Philip 30 miles away to another town. This may be difficult to fathom, but if Jesus can be taken from death to life, then Philip can be taken from town to town. Imagine if they had never stopped for the baptism and at specific time the Holy Spirit was going to take Philip away, then who would have baptized the eunuch.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">When God tells you to STOP it is for your own good, so that you can GO right! Is there a verse, passage of Scripture, habit, etc&#8230;, that God has said STOP? What are you moving for? Today is the day to STOP in your tracks, because the next step may be something that you can&#8217;t handle without receiving what you need when you are stopped. Even a car stops for gas, can&#8217;t God&#8217;s people stop from Him!

In Judges 15:16 we read about how Samson kills thousands of Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. In 1 Samuel 17 we read of the lowly shepherd boy, David, killing the giant Goliath.

How many pieces of sand are on the combined islands of Hawaii?&nbsp; How many times did you turn over last night when you slept?&nbsp; There are many things that we don\u2019t know.&nbsp; If we don\u2019t know so many things as Christians, how much more do the unsaved struggle with all the questions about the things of God that they can\u2019t figure out with their intellect nor with state of the art technology?&nbsp; When Christ came on the scene, it really baffled the Jews and the Greeks (Gentiles).&nbsp; Paul said that Christ\u2019s crucifixion was a stumbling block to them.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Peter explains, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.&nbsp;

The Jews were the builders that rejected the most important piece of building material (namely the cornerstone) Jesus Christ.&nbsp; They had the most important piece for the construction of the building; however instead of recognizing Christ, they foolishly tripped over the very piece they so desperately needed.&nbsp; David wrote, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain<\/span> (Psalm 127:1).\u201d&nbsp;

The message we preach, Christ crucified, is still a stumbling block for the Jews.&nbsp; Let us use their stumbling stone as our stepping stone, to bring them the truth they heavily reject.&nbsp; The reason that people need Jesus is because they are disobedient toward God, showing their sin nature through the breaking of His Moral Law (The Ten Commandments).<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol style=\"margin-left:.375in;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;font-family:&quot;font-size:11pt;\" type=\"1\">\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;font-size:11pt;\">The Stone (Jesus) was rejected.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Jesus is the Cornerstone.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Many stumble at His Word to     repent and put their faith in Him.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Those stumbling are the     disobedient people in the world.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;vertical-align:middle;\"><span style=\"font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Jesus is the rock of offense;

While they are usually tougher to spot by others, they are easily identified if you are willing to look at yourself with sober judgment and a tender conscience. Here are a few things to ask yourself to see if you suffer from the subtle signs of pride. When writing a story, completing a project or doing something for someone else, do you inwardly crave the positive comments or praise from people? Do you normally concern yourself with what other people will think or say about something you&#8217;ve said or done instead of focusing on doing what you do unto the Lord? When someone shares something good that&#8217;s happened in their life are you genuinely happy for them or do you feel as if it should&#8217;ve happened to you or that it&#8217;s nothing compared to the great things you&#8217;ve seen God do in your life? Do you really listen and take a sincere interest to what others say or do you just wait until it&#8217;s your turn to talk? Do you find yourself inwardly being critical of other Christians or your pastor when they don&#8217;t embrace your views of evangelism? Do you esteem yourself more highly than you ought to or feel like you&#8217;re better than most other Christians because you share your faith and they don&#8217;t? Are you reluctant to ask someone for help or advice because you think you can do it yourself or you&#8217;ll figure it out on your own? Do you find yourself reluctant to be a part of a group because you may not get your way? Maybe you think you don&#8217;t need to be part of the group (GNN, the Church, etc.) to share your faith because you can do just as well on your own? Or occasionally do you find yourself feeling vindicated when someone else is proven wrong? When you open-air preach do you find yourself wishing the crowd was bigger or constantly focusing on finding new ways to build a bigger crowd? I&#8217;m sure if you think and pray about it for a while, God will reveal to you the elements of pride (if any) in your life. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Satan relentlessly uses pride as a powerful weapon to weaken, incapacitate and ultimately destroy the Evangelist <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">(When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom. &#8211; Proverbs 11:2)<\/span>. Almost always and without exception, when an Evangelist stumbles or falls it can be traced back to their pride. Whether it&#8217;s obvious or subtle, pride has a way of creeping into our lives and inhibiting us from being led by the spirit of God and ultimately leads to our demise <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">(Before his downfall a man&#8217;s heart is proud, but humility comes before honor &#8211; Proverbs 18:12)<\/span>. The single biggest thing any Evangelist must be on constant guard against is their pride. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">How do you fend off the arrows of arrogance and pride that the enemy will surely shoot at you? How do you remain free from your pride and sidestep the sin of self-righteousness? The antidote to your pride is to always give God all of the glory, trust not in yourself but acknowledge Him in all things and love others as much or more than you love yourself. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">(Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods &#8211; Psalm 40:4)<\/span>. One thing that love is not is proud! If you want to remain humble in your walk, focus on the grace and mercy that God showed you when He saved your soul from Hell <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(see James 4 &amp; Philippians 2)<\/span>. Count all your blessings and then recall all the sins that you&#8217;ve been forgiven of. Remember, he who has been forgiven much, loves much <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(Luke 7:47)<\/span>. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">I think a great biblical illustration of the attitude an Evangelist should try to maintain and how to do it is when the seventy-two returned from witnessing. They were all proud, pumped up and boasting about how they had power over the demons. Jesus&#8217; response to them was <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">\u201cdo not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven&#8221; &#8211; Luke 10:20<\/span>. This is a perfect example of how to be bold in your witness while remaining humble in your walk. Don&#8217;t think or boast about the power God&#8217;s given you over the circumstances of life, others or even the enemy. Just be grateful that by God&#8217;s grace you&#8217;re headed for Heaven! Another great thing any Evangelist can do to fend off their pride is to surround yourself with others who will help to keep you accountable to humility and those who understand how to recognize the tell-tale signs of pride <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(see &#8211; 1 Peter 5)<\/span>. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">So, the next time you&#8217;re feeling like Superman and start thinking you&#8217;re invincible and nothing can stop you, examine yourself to see if there&#8217;s any Kryptonite (pride) hiding in the lead box of your heart. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">Blessings <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">by Darrel Rundus, <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">Founder\/President of The Great News Network<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; (If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.

This is the only weakness of the Man of Steel. He may be faster than a speeding bullet, stronger than a mighty locomotive and able to leap tall buildings with a single bound; but when faced with Kryptonite, he becomes incapacitated and weak. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">Every Evangelist I know also has such a weakness. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Pride is to the Evangelist what Kryptonite is to Superman<\/span>. While pride is destructive to anyone and everyone, it&#8217;s particularly a problem for most Evangelists. You see, if Satan can&#8217;t stop you from sharing your faith and teaching others to do the same, he&#8217;ll try to make you proud that you&#8217;re doing it! Yes, the all-powerful mighty Evangelist may be able to dodge the arrows from the enemy, quote scriptures faster than a TV preacher, jump over the traps that Satan sets and even have the ability to face their fears and boldly proclaim the gospel of Christ in a flash, but when confronted with the issues of pride, just like Superman, they become incapacitated and weak. Make no mistake about it, the fast track to fruitlessness as an Evangelist is to follow the path of pride <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">(A man&#8217;s pride brings him low, but a man of lowly spirit gains honor &#8211; Proverbs 29:23)<\/span>. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">I find it interesting that if they truly want to be fruitful for the Lord, the Evangelist must be bold in their witness, but remain humble in their walk. What&#8217;s interesting about that, you ask? The two characteristics (boldness &amp; humility) are polar opposites. To be brave enough to face the wicked ways of the enemy and approach people with the message that has the power to save their soul from hell while walking the righteous road of humility is not an easy thing to do. Pride is a strange thing in that sometimes, the signs are obvious while all too often, the signs of pride in our life are not so easy to see. Ironically, when we are blinded by our pride, the pride itself causes us to refuse to even admit that we have a problem with pride in our lives. The fact that some who will read this will say, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t apply to me, I&#8217;m not prideful!&#8221; is proof positive that they most likely struggle with some elements of pride in their life <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">(If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else, for each one should carry his own load &#8211; Galatians 6:3-5)<\/span>. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;\">What are some of the indicators that you may struggle with pride? As I already mentioned, some of the signs are obvious while others are not. Refusing to listen to others who offer Godly or biblical advice, insisting you are right on a regular basis, not being quick to forgive others or to ask for forgiveness, outwardly being critical of others, being argumentative and boasting or bragging about what a great Evangelist you are or how many souls you&#8217;ve won to the Lord are a few obvious signs of pride. As an open- air preacher, I used to find myself boasting about how big the crowd was or when I heard about someone else preaching and asking, &#8220;How big was the crowd?&#8221; All these as well as many others are things that should make it easy to see that your pride has become a stumbling block to you, your walk with the Lord and your efforts as an Evangelist.

At this point, the Lord sends a message back to Hezekiah through Isaiah saying <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Isaiah 38:4\u201c\u2026I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; surely I will add to your days fifteen years. 6&nbsp;I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.\u201d&nbsp; <\/span>What a great testimony, the next chapter shows what can happen even in the midst of victory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">In this chapter, the ambassadors from Babylon heard of Hezekiah\u2019s sickness and miraculous healing.

You remember those days you spent time praying in humility trusting God to meet your needs. Now that blessings have flooded your life, yes you still pray but you come to realize that you dependence on God for healing, finances, protections have somehow taken a back sit. This was the effect of pride in Hezekiah\u2019s life, departing from simple reliance on God. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:11pt;\">Based on what he had done, the prophet told him that all he had shown the Babylonians will be taken by them.

Fear can be scary, horrific, dreading, frightening, alarming and even worrying.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Are you battling some fear in your life? Fear of tomorrow, life, rejection, failing, nightmares and many more. Many fear to share what they have learnt, inspiration, encouragement for they feel that it will rob them of what they already have. Fear of thinking that someone will be better than you when you share with them what you have. There is a fear of going to greater levels for there is a feeling of incompetence, fear to marry and who to marry and not feel like a mistake is made, fear of flying for what has happened in the past, fear of getting into ministry for you do not feel qualified. We have all kinds of fears circulating in our lives. Let&#8217;s look at one man who had so many fears to deal with.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Judges 6:11, &#8220;&#8230;Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide from the midianites&#8221;. <\/span>Gideon is hiding because he is afraid of the enemy, we have our own enemies who inflict fears in our lives but the bible says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 23:4, &#8220;Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me&#8221;. <\/span>The enemy is always out to kill, steal and destroy but we have a covering and assurance that no matter what we deal with, we will not fear evil for God is with us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Judges 6:23, &#8220;Then the Lord said to him, &#8220;peace be with you; do not fear, you shall not die&#8221;, <\/span>Here we see how Gideon has encountered with the Lord and he is afraid for we saw this many times when people encountered with God in the old testament, there would be such a fear for possibly losing a life because of God\u2019s awesome presence. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Judges 6:27, &#8220;&#8230;But because he feared his father&#8217;s household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night&#8221;. <\/span>As the Lord was directing Gideon and Gideon was beginning to know the Lord he had never known, he offers a sacrifice to the Lord which was good and the Lord gave him another instruction to tear down the altar of Baal which was the idol Gideon&#8217;s people worshipped. Because of the fear in his life, he does it but he does it at night and by morning all the idols are destroyed. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Judges 6:36, &#8220;So Gideon said to God, &#8220;If You will save Israel by my hands as You have said&#8221;, vs. 37, &#8220;look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is a dew on the fleece only, and it&#8217;s dry on all the ground then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said&#8221;. <\/span>Once again we see Gideon with another fear and that is the fear to trust. He has encountered with the Lord and so far everything looks good until the Lord tells him that he has chosen him to save Israel. For him to trust and believe, he asks the Lord to perform certain miracles and to my amazement, the Lord is patient with him and does as he has requested. I believe that as the Lord prepares us to be instruments, yes we might have fear but He will be patient enough with us to work with us and reveal to us what He can do that our total trust may strangle the fear inside of us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Judges 7:2, &#8220;And the Lord said to Gideon, &#8220;The people who are with you are too many&#8230;, vs. 3. &#8220;Now therefore proclaim in the hearing of the people saying, &#8220;whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn and depart at once from a Mount Gilead&#8221;. And 22,000 of the people returned&#8221;. <\/span>The Lord has a sense of humor for He is telling Gideon that the people he has are too many to fight the battle. God is more concerned about His glory. He tells him to release all the people who are fearful and afraid. Remember the leader is fearful and afraid and should be the first one to leave but he is not for the Lord is already dealing with his fear as time goes by. Through this, the Lord is building him up not to put his confidence and trust in man.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Judges 7:9, &#8220;It happened on the same night that the Lord said to him, &#8220;Arise, go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into you hand, vs. 10, &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp..<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.&#8221; vs. 11, &#8220;And you will hear what they say; and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp&#8221;.<\/span> I thought the Lord finished dealing with his fears. Gideon is still afraid but he is sticking with God, He is fighting scared and he keeps on moving, one last thing before his strike helps him see that what is fearful about is actually nothing for the Lord sends him to the camp and if you read the portion of the scripture you will find that in as much as Gideon was fearful of the enemy, the enemy was more fearful than him and his people. It is very possible that what we are really fearful about is actually afraid of God in us, meaning it can be conquered<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">We have a chance to fight scared, someone said that, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Courage is not the absence of fear, it&#8217;s the force that concurs it&#8221;. I want to overcome fear for God has not given me a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind<\/span>. I don&#8217;t want to leave and go back like the 22,000 who left, I want to move forward even if I am fighting scared so help me Lord.

If we based our salvation on feelings then we would be in trouble. If we are to feel God to know He is present then we still lack understanding that God is ever present. The one thing many ask in their difficult times &#8220;how come I don&#8217;t feel God in my situation?&#8221;. This is the whole reason why we can live a defeated life if our whole experience is based on feelings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">One evening as recorded in in Mark 39:35 onwards, Jesus tells the disciples to cross with Him to the other side. He had been teaching the multitudes maybe along the lines &#8220;faith&#8221;. The bible says, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God<\/span>&#8220;, faith learnt in classroom yet to be mastered in the sea of life. Some of the teachings were not new to them for they listened to the Master teach many times. To cross to the other side required a means of boat. And the bible says, in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">verse 37 that a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. 38 But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow\u201d. <\/span>In their sailing, they faced a situation that challenged their faith. Everything was okay when they left, Jesus was present with them but when the situation arose, Jesus was nowhere to be found. He was at the bottom of the boat peacefully sleeping. Imagine the boat beginning to fill with water as the bible mentions it, who would have been affected by the water first? Jesus. While in this tough situation, they tried to steady the boat on their own, they were getting hysterical. One thing they were lacking was PEACE and because they lacked PEACE, they could not have JOY.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Here is my point to all these, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 15:13, &#8220;&#8230; may the God of hope fill <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">you with all joy and peace in BELIEVING<\/span>. Mark that it&#8217;s not saying to be filled with joy and peace in FEELING. There are times feelings will fail you. Through His teachings, Jesus was filling them with hope that it might produce peace and joy in every tough time they would face in life. This might have been a little test to see if they could put into practice what they learnt. The disciples should have been filled with peace and joy in believing that the presence of Jesus on the boat was enough to make them sail through the windstorm. Just knowing that even if He was a sleep, even if they could not feel his presence in the middle of the windstorm, knowing that He was somewhere within the boat was enough to produce peace and joy. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">You might say, &#8220;how would that happen?&#8221;, well if Jesus was in this boat that was being rocked by the wind, water coming inside and He was peaceful, don&#8217;t you think that should have filled them with peace and joy? And if that was not enough, think about it, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">do you think Jesus who is 100% God could have drowned??<\/span>. What about you in your boat sailing in this sea of life, facing windstorm, you are losing your peace and joy because you might have based everything on feelings which go with happiness. Don&#8217;t you believe that God of hope can fill you with His peace and joy in believing that He is ever present in your boat? That as long as He lives inside of you you cannot drown because He can&#8217;t drown? <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1 John 4:4, says, &#8221; You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world\u201d. <\/span>This verse alone gives me peace and joy knowing that He is greater in me than the challenge before me. I can ride through the storm believing that He is present. If I don&#8217;t feel Him, that is still ok for I know He did not leave me. I can smile in the midst of the storm because His peace surpasses all understanding and his joy is unspeakable in me full of His glory. I can make it not because everything is in place but because <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2 Timothy 1:12, \u201c&#8230;I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day&#8221;.

He is blessed &nbsp;in turn blesses His people. Only God could be rich to bless His children, not once a year especially during Christmas, he does it every day and every year. He daily loads us with benefits (blessings). <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Look at how God promised His blessings upon the children of Israel, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Deut 28:1-3, &#8220;1 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: 2 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. <\/span>Please take time to read Deut 28 and you will see how God had prepared blessing after blessing if the children of Israel hearkened unto His voice.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Isaiah 1:19, &#8220;If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land&#8221;, <\/span>this is another promise of blessings if we do what the Lord requires of us. The Israelites were given guidelines to receiving their blessing. We too have been given guidelines to receiving our blessings. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 28:20, &#8220;A faithful man shall abound with blessings, but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent&#8221;, Ephe 1:3, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: &#8220;.<\/span> This is all about obedience<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Proverbs 10:22, &#8220;The blessings of the Lord makes one rich, and He adds no sorrow with it&#8221;, <\/span>What a bountiful blessing from the Lord that makes us rich. The riches here more than wealth and material things, if anything it would be at the bottom of the list. God makes us rich in spiritual blessings, physical blessings, emotional blessings, wisdom blessings, blessings in your walk with Him, blessings in your going out and coming in, everything you touch God blesses, your family is blessed, your children are blessed, your husband or wife is blessed, your boyfriend or girlfriend is blessed. You are blessed in your job, you are blessed in the ministry, blessings overtaking you. If you&#8217;ve been whining about what has not been done, can you stop for a second and look back and see the bountiful blessings the Lord has bestowed upon you? His love is a blessing, His touch is a blessing, His words are a blessing and come to think about it, we are more blessed than we think. I don&#8217;t have to receive Christmas gifts, birthday gifts, or people\u2019s appreciation to feel blessed. The Lord daily loads me with blessings. Mark this word, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">You are not only blessed when you have received blessings, you are blessed while you are on the verge of waiting for it<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;.

He says in<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> 1Chronicles 28:2, \u201c\u2026 I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and had made preparations to build it. 3&nbsp;But God said to me, \u2018You shall not build a house for My name, because you have been a man of war and have shed blood.\u2019 \u2026. 6&nbsp;Now He said to me, \u2018It is your son Solomon who shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be My son, and I will be his Father\u201d.<\/span>&nbsp; David must not build, but he would do all he could; he said, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it<\/span> \u201c . He prepared abundantly before his death. The consideration of his age and growing infirmities, which showed him his death approaching, quickened him, towards his latter end, to be very diligent in making this preparation for the magnificent work ahead of him. David had learnt that God\u2019s work must be done God\u2019s way and by God\u2019s Spirit if God was to bless it, he needed his son to get that and prepare the same. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">What David could not build in person, he would build through his son.

John 14:14 says, \u201cIf you love me, you will obey what I command\u201d (NIV).<\/span> <\/p>\n<p>Without actions, love is nothing more than a theoretical expression, a weightless euphoria that exists only in our minds. How can we prove that love truly exists if actions don&#8217;t transcend feelings? The empirical evidence that proves the validity our love for the Savior isn&#8217;t written in the confessions we make, but in tangible expressions\u2014obeying the Lord&#8217;s commandments and walking in ways that honor him. 1 John 5:3 reiterates the same point with these words, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commandments.

In the same token, Christ is more glorified in our actions than in our confessions. <\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that James instructs us to be doers of the word, and not hearers only that we may not deceive ourselves (James 1:22). The correlation between this scripture and 1 John 5:3 is evidence that the 10 commandments are God&#8217;s standard of perfection, and only through abiding in them can we truly be in love with the Savior. Don&#8217;t be deceived, Christ is more concerned about our actions than he is about empty confessions.

Before a priest in Israel could minister on behalf of others, he was obliged to present himself in a consecrated condition and the sacrifices he offered were to be without blemish (Mal 1:8-13).&nbsp; The priest offered God a dead sacrifice, while we are called to be a living sacrifice.&nbsp; A living sacrifice can crawl off the altar of obedience.&nbsp; Again Samuel wrote, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">To obey is better than sacrifice<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, and to heed is better than the fat of rams\u201d (1 Sam 15:22).<\/span>&nbsp; We are to offer our lives, our whole lives to the Lord as an offering to Him.&nbsp; What else can we really offer to the One that founded the entire world?&nbsp; Let me close with this illustration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">I recall a true story of a nine year old boy who lived in a rural town in Tennessee. His house was in a poor area of the community. A local church had a bus ministry that came knocking on his door one Saturday afternoon. The kid came to answer the door and greeted the bus pastor. The bus pastor asked the little boy if he and his parents ever went to church.&nbsp; The boy replied no.&nbsp; The bus pastor shared his faith with the young boy whose heart melted at the gospel story.&nbsp; The boy then went to church with the bus pastor.&nbsp; While at the church the little boy just sat there, clue-less of what was going on. A few minutes into the service these tall unhappy guys walked down to the front and picked up some wooden plates. One of the men prayed and the kid with utter fascination watched them walk up and down the aisles. He still didn&#8217;t know what was going on. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">All of a sudden like a bolt of lightning it hit the kid what was taking place. These people must be giving money to Jesus. He then reflected on the free gift of life he had received just twenty-four hours earlier. He immediately searched his pockets, front and back, and couldn&#8217;t find a thing to give Jesus. By this time the offering plate was being passed down his aisle with a broken heart he just grabbed the plate and held on to it. He finally let go and watched it pass on down the aisle. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">He turned around to see it passed down the aisle behind him. And then his eyes remained glued on the plate as it was passed back and forth, back and forth all the way to the rear of the sanctuary. Then he had an idea. This little nine year old boy, in front of God and everybody, got up out of his seat. He walked about eight rows back, grabbed the usher by the coat and asked to hold the plate one more time. Then he did the most astounding thing I have ever heard of. He took the plate, put it on the carpeted church floor and stepped into the center of it. As he stood there, he lifted his little head up and said, &#8220;Jesus, I don&#8217;t have anything to give you today, but just me. I give you me!&#8221;&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">We are to become the offering unto the Lord through our obedience.&nbsp; When you offer yourself fully to the Lord in your time (the way you spend your time), talents (the manner that you use the gifts God bestowed upon you), and treasures (your finances and material blessings), you become the living sacrifice that God desires of you.&nbsp; How are you spending you time; does your schedule reflect His Lordship?&nbsp; How do you use your talents for Him, the ones that He has given you?&nbsp; Does your check book, credit card statement, and spending, reflect that Jesus Christ is Lord of you?&nbsp;

One time while Christ was a sleep in a boat He and His disciples were sailing in, under heavy storm, they questioned Jesus\u2019 love and care because He was a fast sleep in the boat the hour they needed Him the most while they suffered to stabilize the boat.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In this climax, Paul wants to remind believers of God\u2019s love for them. He says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 35<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cWho shall separate us from the love of Christ?&#8230;\u201d, <\/span>This does not mean &#8220;our love to Christ,&#8221; as if, who shall hinder us from loving Christ? but &#8220;Christ&#8217;s love to us,&#8221; as is clear from the closing words of the chapter. &#8220;<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">It is no ground of confidence to assert, or even to feel, that we will never forsake Christ; but it is the strongest ground of assurance to be convinced that His love will never change&#8221;<\/span>, Hodge. There is nothing that you can do to make Christ love you more or less and there is nothing that can happen in your life to diminish His love for you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Paul goes ahead to outline some of the things when believers face find it easy to conclude God\u2019s love is missing otherwise they would not go through any of these stuff. He says,\u201d \u2026 <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword<\/span>?\u201d. He begins with the least and continues to the scary one. He also adds another element by which we face troubles , vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">36 As it is written: \u201cFor Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.\u201d <\/span>Quoted as descriptive of what God&#8217;s faithful people may expect from their enemies at any period when their hatred of righteousness is roused, and there is nothing to restrain it,. Vs. 37, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us\u201d. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">We are more than conquerers when what has been set to concur us especially to make us doubt the love of Christ is unable to convince us otherwise<\/span>. We are reminded in the midst of all these He loves us and that assurance is enough to silence the mouth of anything that appears to contradict to what we know of God\u2019s love. God\u2019s love brings contentment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">You would think that Paul would be done describing anything that would separate God\u2019s love to us, vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">38 \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">For I am persuaded<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come\u201d,<\/span> Another word I would us is \u201cFor I am convinced\u201d, &nbsp;Paul writing to brethren in Philippi demonstrates how convinced he was.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Philippians 4: 11, \u201cNot that I speak in regard to need, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">: 12&nbsp;I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 13&nbsp;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d. <\/span>How did Paul know the love of God even in the midst of all he was dealing with? <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Christ\u2019s love was Paul\u2019s strength<\/span>. He knew about the cross and every time he looked to the cross in the midst of all, he was reminded of God\u2019s love.

Read in these few verses that shows how we know Christ and how He builds upon the truth of His revelation and how that will always be under attack. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Matthew 16:16, \u201cSimon Peter answered and said, \u201cYou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\u201d 17 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Jesus answered and said to him, \u201cBlessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. 18 And I also say to you that you are Peter<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. 19 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\u201d <\/span>This does not mean that upon the life of Peter as many believe will Christ build His church, but rather on the confession of the truth of who Christ is revealed of the Father will Christ\u2019s church be built. And on this truth, there will be attack very much alive today, yet the attacks, the gates of hell will not prevail. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">To go even further, He told Peter and the rest who are His and those to come that He will give them keys to the kingdom of God to bind and lose.

On Pentecost, Peter first opened the doors and declared the conditions of which men could have their sins forgiven, be bound or loosed. And as they went about preaching the gospel, the enemy was on their case big time, yet in the light of these truths, the enemy stood no chance of prevailing against believers and the church as a whole. The devil through his agents tried to silence the gospel by killing Stephen and James, putting Paul, Peter, John in prison, however with God in control, everything the devil tried only fueled the fire of the gospel and he has never succeeded in containing or stopping the gospel. against us?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">If God be resolved and engaged to bring us through, all our enemies must be His; and &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Who would set the briers and thorns against Him in battle?

The whole human race deserved destruction; but for reasons not perfectly known to us, God determined to recover SOME by regeneration and the power of His grace. He foreknew us, He also predestined (predetermined, foreordained) to be conformed to the image of His Son. How God does it is mind boggling, our finite minds cannot comprehend it. Here is where David says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 37:39, \u201cBut the salvation of the righteous is from the LORD<\/span>\u201d.

It always means \u201cinternally, effectually, savingly called.\u201d It denotes the first great step in personal salvation and answers to \u201cconversion.\u201d Only the word conversion expresses the change of character which then takes place, whereas this \u201ccalling\u201d expresses the divine authorship of the change, and the sovereign power by which we are summoned, Matthew-like, Zaccheus-like, out of our old, wretched, perishing condition, into a new, safe, blessed life<\/span>\u201d, Jamieson, Faussett, and Brown.

I wonder sometimes if we fully grasp the verse to then apply it correctly. As we know this is true, I am a believer and I some may disagree that it\u2019s not the devil in control of a believer\u2019s life to be chased around, but rather God is in control and we therefore yield to Him. Yes the enemy may start and even frustrate a believer, but he is not in control. God controls the thermostat of all things, and if He lets it happens, it will all work good for His own purpose for His glory. This should be a drive for believers to constantly be in submission to God first then resist the devil and he will flee <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James 4:7<\/span>. While I see many Christians trying to cast the devil and chase him away, I see wisdom in James words when says submit to God, then you don\u2019t cast out the devil but rather resist him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">If we submit our understanding to the truth of God; submit our wills to the will of His precept, the will of His providence, He is ready us good. If we yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on the whole armor of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Let us then submit to God, and seek His grace and favor; resisting the devil. Faith, humble prayers, and heavenly wisdom, are the weapons of resistance. According to Jamieson, Faussett, and Brown, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cSubmit\u201d is a language taken from warfare. &#8220;Submit&#8221; as a good soldier puts himself in complete subjection to his captain. &#8220;Resist,&#8221; is to stand bravely against\u201d<\/span>. You can only resist because you are submitted. I love what David Wilkerson told a woman who came to him to tell him of how the devil was after her home, his response to her, \u201cwho let him in?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">If then a believer in the light of these words know that it\u2019s not the devil in control when he is going through hard times, he will take comfort in these words. vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">28, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">And we know<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose\u201d. <\/span>This verse becomes clear in the light of vs. 26 and vs. 27 which addresses the work of the Holy Spirit in our praying who helps us pray and He searches our hearts. Those who love God and are called according to His purpose, everything will work for good. I notice something here also, it does not say it will work for THEIR good but rather it will work FOR good, whose good is the question. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">In my judgment this verse addresses &nbsp;more than things working for our good in the long run,&nbsp; but rather it works good for us if it accomplishes&nbsp; His purpose regardless of the outcome before us. <\/span>All works to make God\u2019s name great and advance His kingdom.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cNow that all things do work together for good, the saints &#8220;know,&#8221; and are firmly persuaded of; both from the word and promises of God, and from the instances of Jacob, Joseph, Job, Stephen, John the Baptist, and others, and also from their own experience. Whether in things temporal or spiritual, work &#8220;together,&#8221; and make an intricate woven work in providence and grace; which will be viewed with admiration another day: one copy reads, &#8220;God works together,&#8221; or &#8220;causes all things to work together for good&#8221;; and so the Ethiopic version, &#8220;we know that God helps them that love him, to every good thing&#8221;: and to this agrees the Syriac version, &#8220;we know that to them that love God, he in everything helps them to good&#8221;; and certain it is, that God is the efficient cause, that makes all things work together for his people&#8217;s good. The persons to whom all things work together for good, are described as such\u201d<\/span> John Gill. A believer\u2019s submitted life is in God\u2019s sovereign control at all times regardless of whether things are going right or wrong, and all will work for good to accomplish His purpose. Whether we understand it or not is not the big issue, the issue is, in whose hands are we in.

Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ\u2019s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.\u201d&nbsp; <\/span>God knew that Satan was going to buffet Paul and allowed it to occur anyway.&nbsp; This buffeting means to beat black and blue, to smite so as to cause bruises and livid spots.&nbsp; This is like a boxer that buffets his body, handles it roughly, discipline it by hardships.

And while we groan and travail, we see His continuous work in helping our weakness and intercede for us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 26, \u201cLikewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought,\u2026<\/span>\u201d. This is one of the most comforting verses in my judgment in this chapter having learnt that prayer is the nucleus that holds all things together. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James 5:16, <\/span>tells us<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201c\u2026The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much\u201d, <\/span>this is only possible when the Holy Spirit is present<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. <\/span>It\u2019s one thing to pray, it\u2019s another thing to pray effectively.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span>&nbsp;The disciples desired to learn how to pray effective so the Lord gave them the guideline by which the Holy Spirit would pray effectively through them. The Lord\u2019s prayer puts everything into perspective, covering everything we should cover when we pray. Yet in all these, we are weak without the Holy Spirit to do it. Paul tells us in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Philippians 2:13, \u201cfor it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure<\/span>\u201d. The will and the ability is of God through His Son by the power of the Holy Spirit. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">While we are waiting in hope, but suffering, the Spirit is a helper of our weakness. He not only strengthens us, but helps us in prayer. We often do not know in our ignorance on how to pray what is best. In this He enables us to pray the will of the Father rather than our own will. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">James 4:3, \u201c&nbsp;You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures\u201d. <\/span>He strips us of anything that takes Christ of our focus and positions the spotlight back on Christ when we pray. This is especially true in the times of the greatest trial, our focus at this time would be woe me and how do I get out. In Matthew 26, three times Jesus prayed that the cup would pass Him and three times He yielded to God\u2019s perfect will. Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost and power, He depended on that power to bring Him through completely yielding to God the Father. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 26. \u201c\u2026but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered<\/span>\u201d Observe the climax: The creation groans; we ourselves groan; the Spirit himself groans. As Jamieson, Faussett, and Brown writes, \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">as we struggle to express in articulate language the desires of our hearts and find that our deepest emotions are the most inexpressible, we &#8216;groan&#8217; under this felt inability. But not in vain are these groanings. For &#8216;the Spirit Himself&#8217; is in them, giving to the emotions which He Himself has kindled the only language of which they are capable; so that though on our part they are the fruit of impotence to utter what we feel, they are at the same time the intercession of the Spirit Himself in our behalf\u201d. <\/span>This is all about travailing<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 27, \u201cNow He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God\u201d.<\/span>&nbsp; In spite of the Holy Spirit groaning for us and in us, He does not distract from the will of the Father. As the Searcher of hearts, He watches the surging emotions of them in prayer, and knows perfectly what the Spirit means by the groanings which He draws forth within us, because that blessed Intercessor pleads by them only for what God Himself designs to bestow.

In this does a believer take comfort that the suffering of any kind (persecution, loss, sickness etc.) is for a time. It&#8217;s not bound to last forever.&nbsp; By this word is meant not only exceeding sorrow, but also the fruit that follows from it. There is no worldview that addresses the dilemma of suffering and provides comforting answers&nbsp; like Christianity. It makes hope, the expectation of good to all those who are weary from its burden. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 19, \u201cFor the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">earnest expectation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> of the creation <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">eagerly waits<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> for the revealing of the sons of God. 20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; 21 because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the whole creation <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">groans and labors with birth pangs<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> together until now<\/span>\u201c. I consider this as one of the purposes God has given us the miracle of birth to demonstrate how in agony, labor pains, discomfort and even suffering for a while there is hope of a new life ushered into the world. It\u2019s an experience with an expectation, and what a mother goes through at that point cannot be compared to the joy of holding that baby when it\u2019s all been said and done.

Not only is Christ our Savior, He is also the Sovereign Lord over our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin to obey it\u2019s lusts, we are now slaves to righteousness. Paul says<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, Vs.&nbsp; 12, \u201cTherefore, brethren, we are debtors\u2014not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh<\/span>\u201d. We are indeed debtors but not debtors to the flesh, we owe it all to Jesus not to repay for what He has done, but a life of gratitude for what He has done. Once we were sold under sin (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblestudytools.com\/search\/?q=version=kjv&amp;passage=ro+7:14&amp;t=kjv\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 7:14<\/span><\/a>); but now that we have been set free from that hard master and become servants to Righteousness (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblestudytools.com\/search\/?q=version=kjv&amp;passage=ro+6:22&amp;t=kjv\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 6:22<\/span><\/a>), we owe nothing to the flesh, we disown its unrighteous claims and are deaf to its superior demands. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 13, \u201cFor if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live<\/span>\u201d. This is about who is the master. If you are no longer a debtor to the flesh, then you no longer live in its bondage but rather you live by the Spirit that gives you the drive and the ability to mortify (put to death) the flesh. The apostle is not only telling us what we are not under, he also encourages us to fight &nbsp;and not be entangled by the things believers have been freed from. In other words, \u201cif you do not kill sin, sin will kill you\u201d. This is the reason the life of a Christian is a battle, a battle to stay free by the power of the Holy Spirit we yield to.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs.14,\u201dFor as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God\u201d,<\/span> the previous verse apostle Paul speaks for the Spirit of God as simply the power through which believers mortify sin. He now speaks of Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit who leads believers, giving them identity, a confirmation that they belong. The Spirit of God leads from sin, from a dependence on self. He leads to the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, and to the fullness of grace in Him; into the presence of God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 15, \u201cFor you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d<\/span> Many outside the Christian circle see a Christian life as a life of bondage, however, those who are not saved are the ones in bondage. The Spirit received at the time of conversion is not a Spirit of bondage but a freeing Spirit. I believe this is seen clearly in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Matthew 11:28<\/span>, which reads \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is light<\/span>.\u201d What appears to be a yoke and a burden is light. In the light of this freedom, we cry \u201cAbba, Father\u201d who has adopted us. As a Father, His aim is not to put on us things that lead to destruction but things that lead to freedom. We find comfort in knowing that we are His children and He loves us and, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 16, \u201cThe Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, then heirs\u2014heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together\u201d,<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> \u201cThe testimony of our own spirit is borne in that cry of conscious sonship, &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221;; but we are not therein alone; for the Holy Ghost within us, yea, even in that very cry which it is His to draw forth, sets His own distinct seal to ours; and thus, &#8220;in the mouth of two witnesses&#8221; the thing is established. The apostle had before called us &#8220;sons of God,&#8221; referring to our adoption; here the word changes to &#8220;children,&#8221; referring to our new birth. The one expresses the dignity to which we are admitted; the other the new life which we receive. The latter is more suitable here; because a son by adoption might not be heir of the property, whereas a son by birth certainly is, and this is what the apostle is now coming to\u201d ,<\/span>Jamieson, Faussett, and Brown commentary<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">. <\/span>To continue, Blessings Ev<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp;

Standing boldly and demonstrating God&#8217;s blessing is sometimes not received well. To some who look at you blessed feel that you are filled with pride and to some you feel it creates jealousy and therefore keep blessings to yourself. And there are people who don&#8217;t feel that they can be blessed beyond salvation. It&#8217;s their opinion or they have been deceived into thinking that God only cares about our salvation, the only reason He died for us. God&#8217;s love is not just limited to salvation. Salvation is the beginning. It&#8217;s what gives you a sense of belonging.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">If we understand this concept, then instead of being frustrated with others being blessed, we call on God full of blessings to bestore upon us what He has. When we see other&#8217;s blessed, we won&#8217;t have envy or jealousy but we will bless them for when we bless them, we will be creating avenues of blessings for ourselves. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 12:3 says, &#8220;I will bless those who bless you, And I will curse him who curses you&#8221;. <\/span>God&#8217;s word is sure and strong. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">In our text Romans 8:31 says if God be for us, who can be against us. I often break this into two parts, 1. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">God before us<\/span>&#8221; which is God going a head of us, leading us. Watch how God led the Israelites from Egypt,&nbsp; <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Exodus 13:21 &#8220;And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night<\/span>&#8220;. Our heavenly Father leads us every day. The second part &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Go be for us<\/span>&#8221; sounds a like but the letters are put in strategic places to differentiate the meanings. This I would interpret as God who though mighty yet He is concerned about our daily affairs, He has decided to be on our side. How do we know this?, well He did not spare His own Son, He delivered Him up for us all as His demonstration of love. If He was able to without withholding His very best, His only Son from us, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? I would shout right here. If someone who is rich gave let&#8217;s say half of his riches freely, would you doubt his ability to do it again? If anything your faith would be built on the fact that he did it before therefore he can do it again. That is how God is to us, He showed us that there was nothing He can withhold from those that He loved. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Every believer has a way to tap into God&#8217;s blessings by calling on God and blessing others. I remember a hymn we would sing, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Pass me not, O gentle Savior, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling (blessing, lifting up), Do not pass me by&#8221;. <\/span>We may be withholding blessings from ourselves but He is not. If I know what to do to be blessed, I will not let the enemy use what others have to create envy and jealousy. I will not let him trick me into cursing them, if anything I will bless them and say to God, &#8220;while you are blessing them, do not pass me by&#8221;.

grievances and dilemma, and what gives them the greatest uneasiness in this life. He proceeds to encourage believers of the solid ground and foundation they have of spiritual peace and joy in Christ. This rises from their justification and adoption, the purposes and decrees of God, and particularly the everlasting and unchangeable love of God in Christ, the source, spring, and security, of all the blessings of grace.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In this this chapter he opens with these encouraging words, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit\u201d. <\/span>The \u201cTherefore\u201d points to the argument of chapter 7 which shows that in Christ we are delivered from sin and from the curse of the law. \u201c\u2026<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus\u2026\u201d, <\/span>these are the people who have died with Christ and have been raised with Him and in Him. They have in Him satisfied the demands of the law hence they are no longer under its control. Before salvation, we were married to the law as Paul indicates in Romans 7:1-6 and bound to the law as long as we lived (the way a marriage works). When we died in Christ, the law had no dominion over us anymore and therefore could be married to Christ, and in this, there is no condemnation or guilt. In this, we no \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit<\/span>\u201d. We have a new master, with new desires and we therefore yield in obedience to His leading and guidance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2\u201d&nbsp;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death\u201d.<\/span> The law of the Sprit as John Wesley beautiful declares is \u201cthe gospel\u201d which has freed us from the law of sin and death, the mosaic law. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 3&nbsp;For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">did<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: \u2026\u201d.&nbsp; <\/span>Note this, the law was not weak, it was only weak through the flesh. The law could only point the disease but could not cure. Like a mirror, it could only show the true nature of sin with no ability to clean. It was incapable of conquering our evil nature and that is why God sent his own Son in the likeness of the sinful flesh to be the perfect sacrifice to satisfy the demands of the law. The law giver was the Lord keeper that He may justify the law breakers. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">All that God has commanded in the law is all He has provided in the gospel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 3, \u201c\u2026Condemned sin in the flesh<\/span>.

In verse&nbsp; 34, we read that Jesus told Peter, &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I say to you, Peter, the&nbsp; cock will not crow today until you have denied three times that&nbsp; you know Me<\/span>.&#8221; Does God allow failure? Does He permit it? Is there&nbsp; a purpose in failure? Or is failure something that has no purpose&nbsp; at all in God&#8217;s perfect will and something that God cannot use&nbsp; to further his purposes! <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">When we read this passage, we see that&nbsp; God did not prevent Peter from denying Him. Why didn&#8217;t Jesus&nbsp; say &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Simon I have prayed for you that you will not deny Me even&nbsp; once<\/span>.&#8221; Why did the Lord pray only that Peter&#8217;s faith may not&nbsp; fail, even if Peter himself fell?? Isn&#8217;t it interesting that&nbsp; the Lord did not pray that Peter might not fall? Some of us would&nbsp; like the Lord to pray for us that we might never fall. We would&nbsp; like the Lord to say to us&nbsp; &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My son, my daughter, I have prayed for you that you will never fall and never fail.&#8221;<\/span> But interestingly enough, our Lord doesn&#8217;t pray such a prayer for us. What did Jesus pray for Simon? That when Satan tempted him, his faith would not fail. He didn&#8217;t pray that Peter should not fall in &nbsp;temptation, but that when he did fall, his faith in God&#8217;s perfect love would not fail him&nbsp; &#8211; so that even when Peter reached the bottom of the pit of failure, he would confess, &#8220;God still loves me&#8221;. That is faith &#8211; and that is the confession we must always have on our lips and in our hearts &#8211; no matter how low we may have sunk or fallen &#8211; that God still loves us, JUST AS WE ARE. That was the confession of the prodigal son. When he had reached so low that he could not go any lower, he still believed that his father loved him. I can&#8217;t imagine anyone reaching any lower than the prodigal son had reached &#8211; eating what the pigs eat. That boy was at rock-bottom. But when he reached rock-bottom, he remembered one thing: That his father still loved him. Otherwise he would never have returned home.&nbsp; Supposing he&#8217;d heard that his father had died and that his elder brother was now running the house, do you think he would have come back home? No. He knew what his elder brother was like. And knowing that, he would never have come back. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">There&#8217;s hope for all who&#8217;ve failed thoroughly, who&#8217;ve made a mess of their lives, and who&#8217;ve reached rock bottom. From there the Lord can pick you up and take you to the heights of glory. His prayer for us is that our faith in God&#8217;s love should not fail at any time. When you hit rock bottom. Remember one thing that God still loves you, no matter where you are, or how low&nbsp; you have fallen. May your faith in God&#8217;s love not fail in that&nbsp; hour.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">It was with a purpose that God allowed Peter to fail. That purpose was to sift Peter. What Satan really wanted was to destroy Peter altogether, but God would not allow him to do that. God does not allow us to be tested or tried beyond our ability. So Satan was allowed to sift Peter. As a result of his failure, Peter was cleansed of a whole lot of chaff in his life.&nbsp; That is the real purpose with which God allows us to fail too. Isn&#8217;t it a good thing for the chaff to be removed from our lives? Certainly. When a farmer harvests the wheat, he has to sift it before he can use it. Only then will the chaff be removed from it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The Lord uses Satan to remove the chaff from our lives. Amazingly enough, God accomplishes this purpose by allowing us to fail repeatedly!! God used Satan to fulfill that purpose in Peter and He will use Satan to fulfill that purpose in our lives too. There&#8217;s a lot of chaff in all of us &#8211; the chaff of pride, self-confidence and self-righteousness. And God uses Satan to make us fail repeatedly, in order to remove that chaff from us completely. Whether the Lord is succeeding in fulfilling this purpose in your life or not, you alone know. But if the chaff is being removed, you will be humbler and less self-righteous. You won&#8217;t look down on others who fail. You won&#8217;t consider yourself better than anyone else. As I said, God permits Satan to remove the chaff from us, by allowing us to fail repeatedly. So don&#8217;t get discouraged if you fail. You are still in God&#8217;s hand. There is a glorious purpose that&#8217;s being fulfilled through your repeated failures. But your faith in God&#8217;s love for you must not fail at such times. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">That was what Jesus prayed for Peter and what He&#8217;s praying for us today. He&#8217;s not praying that we may never fail, but He&#8217;s praying that when we do reach rock-bottom, our confidence in God&#8217;s love will still be unshaken. Only through many experiences of failure do we finally reach a &#8220;zero point&#8221;, where we&#8217;re truly broken. It was when Peter reached that point, that he had a second &#8220;conversion&#8221; (Lk.22:32 &#8211; KJV). He turned around. The proof that Jesus&#8217; prayer for Peter was answered is seen in the fact that when Peter hit rock-bottom, he turned around. He didn&#8217;t just lie down there discouraged. He didn&#8217;t lose his faith. He got up. God had let him go on a long leash. But when Peter reached the end of that rope, God pulled him back. It&#8217;s a wonderful thing to be a child of God. When God lays hold of us, He puts a rope around us to protect us. There&#8217;s a lot of slack in that rope, and you may slip up and fall many thousands of times and even drift away from the Lord. But one day, you&#8217;ll reach the end of that rope. And then God will pull you right back to Him. Of course, you can decide at that point, to cut off the rope and run away. Or you can choose to be broken by God&#8217;s kindness and mourn and return to Him. That&#8217;s what Peter did. He wept and turned back to the Lord. But Judas Iscariot&nbsp; didn&#8217;t do that. He cut away the rope &#8211; in rebellion against God&#8217;s authority over his life &#8211; and was eternally lost. But I trust you&#8217;ll do what Peter did. Jesus then told Peter, &#8220;When you turn back and are strong once again, strengthen your brothers &#8220;. It is only when we are broken that we can be strong enough to strengthen others. It was only when Peter was weak and broken, that he became really strong &#8211; so strong that he was able to strengthen his brothers and sisters. We could say that Peter&#8217;s preparation for Spirit-filled service came through his experience of failure. If he had been filled with the Holy Spirit, without this experience of failure, he would have stood up on the day of Pentecost as a proud man, as a man who had never failed, who could look down, despisingly, at the poor lost sinners in front of him. And God would have become his enemy, for God resists the proud!!

Who did better understand what mankind goes through than Jesus?, He was tempted, He was ridiculed, He lost His friend, attacked, betrayed, denied, rejected in His home town, His brothers doubted Him, carried heavy cross to the mountain, felt the pain of being crucified etc. So when we pray while facing some of the things He faced, He intercedes for us before Father by saying something like this, &#8220;I know how it feels to go without, to be in pain, to loose someone, to be rejected, I have been there&#8221;. When I face challenge and I just can&#8217;t find strength or words to pray, I say, &#8220;Jesus, please pray for me&#8221;. He understands my infirmities better, He has been in my shoes. And who understands better both sides of heaven operations and earthly operations than Jesus?, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1Timothy 2:5, &#8220;For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus&#8221;. <\/span>What are you facing today that you just don&#8217;t know or have no strength to pray about it? Do you know that you can call on the greatest intercessor to intercede for you because He knows your situation better? I am facing some challenges I need Him to pray for me when I just don&#8217;t know how to. Here is my cry and hope is yours too, Jesus, Please pray for me.

How should we do it? Does the offender even need to know that you forgave him? Whenever these questions start to haunt you, it may be an indication that the Lord is stirring up a spirit of forgiveness. Now don&#8217;t get me wrong; this does not mean you&#8217;ll wake up one morning to a chorus of &#8220;Oh Happy Day,&#8221; smiling at the birds chirping, feeling all happy and dandy saying, \u201cyes! yes, I have forgiven my offender, and I am finally letting go.\u201d Truth be told, that&#8217;s more likely on a utopia than the real world. On the contrary, forgiveness and letting go is a process that takes time; it can come to fruition if the desire is evident. When you read scriptures addressing un-forgiveness, you can clearly tell that it was intended to be a tough battle we must fight vigilantly and ferociously. The battle can only be won if we fight our pride to its last stand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"color:#262626;\">As I stated in the first part of this devotion, no one can tell you when or how you should go about forgiving. Anyway who attempts to is clearly out of touch with the reality of your hurt. Un-forgiveness causes restlessness and lack of peace. There&#8217;s no greater discomfort than when we are not at peace. But as we desire to forgive just as our heavenly father Forgives us of our countless sins, He starts a restoration process, which even begins to highlight just how irrelevant the offender actually is. You finally realize that you aren&#8217;t forgiving your offender for his sake, but for the Lord. Coupled with hurt, un-forgiveness is a heavy burden to carry. It gives your offender so much power over you. Choosing to run or hide only does so much to suppress these emotions, because just like the buoyancy that causes a log to float, these feelings will always resurface<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#262626;\">. In Matthew 11:28, the scripture says, \u201cCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest\u201d (NIV1984).<\/span><span style=\"color:#262626;\"> If you&#8217;re struggling with past hurts and un-forgiveness for months or even years, bring it to the Lord because there is rest for the weary. To paraphrase Philippians 4:6-7, the scripture says that whatever we ask in his name through prayer and thanksgiving he can do it and provide peace that surpasses all understanding.

This resonates even deeper if emotions were tied to a specific incident. We have all held on to things that have crippled, consumed, and literally sucked the life out of us. Betrayals, regrets, bad choices, emotional, and even physical hurt generally make up the past&#8217;s lexicon. More often than not, for many, the past is usually married to un-forgiveness. Like misery attracts company, the past walks hand-in-hand with un-forgiveness. Maybe at one time in your life someone broke your heart leaving you to scramble to put the pieces back together, or you faced betrayal&#8217;s sting in the worst possible fashion. For Christians and non-Christians alike, hurt, and primarily un-forgiveness unflinching aura has a way of scarring us to the point where the future seems like a distant uncertainty. In fact, one writer described un-forgiveness as \u201cspiritual poison.\u201d Getting past clouds of pain and emotional torment to see the light of forgiveness on a hill becomes more of an illusion than reality.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:#333333;\">Like many, I know how challenging un-forgiveness and letting go of the past can be. I know what it&#8217;s like to look betrayal, hurt, and frustration in the eye. As depicted in The Lion King, un-forgiveness for ourselves and others will always plague us until we finally let go. While chants of \u201cHakuna Matata,\u201d as highlighted in the popular animated movie does nothing to relinquish this burden, we can only let go of the past once we submit to forgiveness. Bearing the burden of un-forgiveness follows men even in their dying days. In <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ephesians 4:32, the Bible says, \u201cBe compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you\u201d (NIV1984).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:#333333;\">For many, a scripture such as this has no meaning because even the most powerful literature ever written has little effect if we haven&#8217;t reached a place of brokenness to forgive and let go. Sometimes scripture makes forgiveness seem easier said than done right? Off course; however, there isn&#8217;t a writing on a wall, a self-help book, or a motivational speaker that can persuade you to forgive. When we get hurt, our heart&#8217;s undeniable fragility leaves us hardened, and often as cold as ice. For some, not even love can penetrate this icy exterior because the walls we build hold off anything and everyone. Like the burning desire to love and be loved, we all know that we should forgive. Even though it&#8217;s written on the tablets of our conscience, only a broken heart can lead to such an epic conclusion. Unless the Lord breaks this hardened shell and softens our hearts as he declares in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ezekiel 36:26<\/span>, we will always wallow in our past hurts with this immense cloud hovering over us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:#333333;\">To be concluded&#8230;, blessings by Kefa<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp; Ephesians 4:32, the Bible says, \u201cBe compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you\u201d (NIV1984).

If there\u2019s been a murder in the tribe, what they do is line up the suspects, and the guy who can\u2019t spit is put to death as the guilty party.&nbsp; And the reasoning is this:&nbsp; The human conscience is so strong \u2013 that knowledge of when we do wrong \u2013 and what happens is when you line a guy up, his conscience accuses him of his guilt; the guilt produces a fear and the fear makes his mouth go dry so he is spit less.&nbsp; So he\u2019s the guy who dies for the crime.&nbsp; Conscience is a very powerful thing.&nbsp; Let me illustrate further.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">An old drunk was once walking home, staggering on the sidewalk, when his dog came out and watched him coming toward him.&nbsp; The dog loved his master.&nbsp; The drunk walked up his pathway.&nbsp; The dog snuggled up behind him, and followed him into the house.&nbsp; The drunk collapsed on the floor, and the dog snuggled up to his hand and waited for that moment when his master would awaken, so he could lick him and have fellowship with him, because he so loved his master.&nbsp; Around midnight, the dog began to bark and bark.&nbsp; The drunk awoke and thought, \u201cMan, the last thing I feel like hearing is a barking dog.\u201d&nbsp; He reached down and grabbed a wooden chair and threw it at the dog, and then collapsed on the floor.&nbsp; In the morning, however, when the drunk awoke, he opened his eyes and saw a sight he could hardly believe.&nbsp; Everything was taken from his house.&nbsp; During the night, thieves had broken in and stolen all his possessions.&nbsp; Only two things were left in the house.&nbsp; One was a broken chair, and the other was a dead dog.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The dog had heard the thieves breaking into the drunk\u2019s home, and tried to warn his master, and his master had killed his very best friend \u2013 the one that was trying to warn him of the thieves breaking into his home.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Your conscience is like that.&nbsp; It\u2019s a barking dog.&nbsp; It isn\u2019t pleasant when it barks at you, but realize that your conscience is your friend not your enemy.&nbsp; The Apostle Paul was standing before a council of Pharisees and Sadducees as one stands on trial.&nbsp; Now the purpose of a trial is to determine if one is innocent or guilty.&nbsp; Paul\u2019s\u2019 accusers had been in great abundance, but when Paul did a check in his conscience, his conscience did not accuse him, it did not bark, he was not spit less. Why?&nbsp; Paul knew according to the Scriptures, his conscience was in good standing with God until this day!&nbsp; Up to this day Paul was in good standing with God.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Therefore, having this assurance he was able to stand with courage and confidence being ready to deal with whatever came his way.&nbsp; Because of Paul\u2019s relationship with God, the enemy couldn\u2019t seem to throw a curve call at Paul and fool him, because Paul\u2019s God knew all things and therefore knew all the scheming pitches of the enemy before they were thrown.&nbsp; After Paul stood his ground, the council was divided in disagreement among themselves some siding with Paul and some against him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Listen to your conscience now that God gave you.&nbsp; Is it barking or quiet?&nbsp; Can you stand before your boss, your spouse, your friends, your God and say with Paul \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day?<\/span>\u201d If not, don\u2019t throw a chair trying to silence your conscience, let it awaken you to action.&nbsp;

Tell them to me, please.\u201d Genesis 41: 16 So Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, \u201cIt is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Josephs\u2019 story is one of the most fascinating stories in the bible. Moses spends 13 chapters in telling this magnificent story. Today we look at a man who had interpretations of dreams for others but himself. If you are like me, then you will recall those days you needed answers, direction, comfort, encouragement. Instead of being the one on the receiving end, the Lord sent someone your way and what you shared with them, and was a confirmation of what God was going to do in their lives, however you were left puzzled about your situation without answers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">This was the story of Joseph who had a dream as recorded in Genesis 37. He had gone through life not understanding it and most likely not realizing it due to his life situations. After many episodes, he ends up in prison, there joined him two servants of the king, a butler and a baker. In the prison, they both had dreams and were bothered by it as they believed there was something significant about the dreams. Joseph inquired after seeing them sad, vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">8,\u201d And they said to him, \u201cWe each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter of it.\u201d So Joseph said to them, \u201cDo not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please.\u201d <\/span>Note something, Joseph who had not understood or realized his dream had faith that God was faithful. His confidence was in the God of the timing. He said God can and He will, giving God all the glory. Making God\u2019s name great in a land that served idols. You read further, one was restored and the other hanged as Joseph had interpreted. Then chapter 41, it was Pharaoh\u2019s turn to have his dream interpreted and again Joseph accredits the ability to God and then interprets.. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">When he had previously dreamed himself, he remained, for a while, in suspense and doubt respecting the divine revelation; but now he is a certain interpreter providing life answers to others but not his but God knows. Imagine a guy hired to build homes for people all his life. Good at what he does, he built beautiful homes, he worked hard and diligently but never had one for himself. As time went by, he became very frustrated with his situation and was ready to quit. The one who hired him did not know of his intentions but had something in mind for his next project. After sharing with him of the new house to be built, he was told the project was bigger than what he had done before. He showed him the land and provided him with all the materials he needed. Since he was frustrated with his situation, he purposed in his heart to do a poor job building it, after all it was for someone else.&nbsp; His employer expected him to do a magnificent job as he had always done. He finally completed the house and returned to his employer to report the job completed. Knowing his work ethic, his employer did not even go to inspect his work, he trusted that he would do a good job. It was at this point that he revealed the purpose for the last project. He said, \u201cbecause of great years of work, the house you built last was my gift to you. I had planned it long before, I had seen your years of toiling. I wanted to surprise you with it after you completed it. That is why I gave you a bigger land, with good materials. Without seeing, I believe you did a superb job\u201d. This man upon hearing those words, stood there stunned because the poor house he built thinking was for someone else, his employer had saved the best for last and he just blew it. And now he was stuck with the poorly done house.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Joseph appears to have been building a house for the baker, the butler and Pharaoh but God was preparing him, he was building his own house. Notice also, he built them well in spite of him not having one (dream interpreted and fulfilled). <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1 Corinthians 4:2, \u201cMoreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.\u201d 49.Galatians 6:9, \u201cAnd let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart\u201d. 2 Thessalonians 3:13, \u201cBut as for you, brethren, do not grow weary in doing good\u201d. <\/span>God may send someone your way for ministry, to provide answers while you need the same, be faithful till the end.

It is utter foolishness to doubt God in anyway, He is Faithful and True. But what about us? Are we faithful to Him? Is our heart given over to the Lord? Are we truly seeking God with all our heart? And this is not dead works, but the true desire of my inner being for God alone. Works always follow the one truly born of God, they don\u2019t make you a Christian(see Matthew 7:21-24). John gives us clear teaching here, in line with James 1:22, Romans 2:13. It is not the hearers of the word, nor the readers, but the doers that are just in the sight of God. This brings in the question of our faithfulness, if we claim to be His followers, are we following Him? Are we faithful to Jesus? When confronted, do we testify of Him? We refer to prayer, to the Bible, to many things in front of people, but what about Christ? He is the center of all existence, the source of all things, it is Him alone that can save souls, the Bible doesn\u2019t save people, nor does prayer in themselves, only Christ can. Jesus said the one who keeps His word, it is he that truly loves Him. All else is dead religion. Jesus Christ came into the world to make sinful men and women holy as He is holy, not to just make us better and moral. He came that He might be glorified in and through me as I abandon my life to Him, but I often wonder how many have truly come to Him this way. But this is the only way. I must lose my life if I will gain His.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Friends, the time is near, Jesus is coming. Paul tells us in Ephesians 5:27 who he is coming back for, a bride that is holy and without blemish. Not religious, holy. A bride that walks and talks with Him, and that keeps His word, not when convenient, always. Not on Sundays, everyday. He is coming for a bride that loves Him above all else, not one who compartmentalizes the Son of God and fits Him in between classes and TV if they have time. That is not devotion. True devotion comes when my eyes have been thrown open by the majesty of a holy God, true devotion surrenders entirely that He might be glorified in my life. True devotion adores this precious, beautiful Savior in the manner He deserves, but how many truly know and practice this devotion? John tells us the time is near, Jesus tells us to watch and pray, for we know not the time of His coming, or when we ourselves shall meet Him. Are we ready? We who claim to be Christians, are we walking in the holy, pure, imparted righteousness of Christ? Is Jesus Christ absolutely paramount in your life above all else? Above your spouse, your job, your children, your education, your career? He must be everything. I know my heart is challenged, I pray yours is as well. I pray in these last hours that God would open our eyes to behold the glory of His being, the spotless majesty of His purity. I pray we would all see Him as Isaiah did, that we would be undone before Him, and that we would never be the same again. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">May you be found in Him this day, Blessings, Bro.

There are at least three reasons that make prioritizing our children over our marriage both foolish and dangerous:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">1. Our children will eventually leave home. Prepare your marriage for the empty nest:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">To my knowledge, I\u2019ve never talked to a person who divorced after twenty-five or thirty years who didn\u2019t say something like this: \u201cOnce the kids were gone, we realized we really didn\u2019t have much of a marriage.\u201d Building a marriage on the foundation of the preeminence of children is like building a house on a rented removable slab. You may have days or even years when you feel completely secure, but the day is coming when the lease will be up and the foundation upon which your home stands will be taken away. A family shepherd must not allow his family to fall into this trap.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">2. Our marriage forms the cornerstone of our children\u2019s security:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Ironically, those who prioritize their children above their marriage are not only jeopardizing their marriage, they\u2019re actually depriving their children of the very thing they desire to provide them. The greatest source of security our children have in this world is a God-honoring, Christ-centered marriage between their parents. Putting the children first is like a police officer putting away his badge and gun in order to make the public feel more at ease. A family shepherd must put his marriage before his children in order to provide them with the security they both need and desire.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">3. Putting your marriage first will actually prepare your children for marriage:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Prioritizing your children above your marriage is both foolish and dangerous because it sets a precedent that contradicts one of the greatest lessons you\u2019ll ever teach your children\u2014how to be good husbands and wives. We must first and foremost model a commitment to marriage. Failure to do this will communicate ideas that are contrary to what we believe\u2014starting with the narcissism it tends to create in our children\u2014including the pitfalls that may follow them into their marriage. For example, if we prioritize our children above our marriage, we teach our children that marriage exists for children. If this is the case, how will our children react to the early months or years of their marriage when there are no children? How will they respond if, God forbid, they should struggle with infertility? If the heart of marriage is \u201cliving for the kids,\u201d these scenarios could be difficult at best.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Jesus our Savior\u2014and our example of what a bridegroom truly is\u2014laid down his life for his bride (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.esvonline.org\/Eph.+5.25\">Eph. 5:25<\/a>). He doesn\u2019t neglect her for another. And it\u2019s this relationship of our Savior to his bride that governs our understanding of our role as husbands and family shepherds. We must give ourselves to and for our wives. We must view them not only as ours but as us! As I often remind myself concerning my wife, \u201cShe\u2019s not just mine; she\u2019s me. She\u2019s bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.esvonline.org\/Gen.+2.23\">Gen. 2:23<\/a>); she\u2019s my body (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.esvonline.org\/Eph.+5.28%E2%80%9329\">Eph. 5:28\u201329<\/a>), and I am her head (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.esvonline.org\/1+Cor.%2011.3\">1 Cor. 11:3<\/a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.esvonline.org\/Eph.+5.23\">Eph. 5:23<\/a>).

I saw a huge sign on the highway that read this which made me think of the power of that statement. The program endeavors to offer a fresh and engaging approach to archaeology, and to dig for the truth and go to extremes to do it-whether it&#8217;s trekking through Ethiopia in search of the lost ark of the covenant, tackling the jungles of the Amazon while searching for the hidden treasures of the Incas, or descending into the volcano Vesuvius to solve the puzzles of Pompeii. WOW! In thinking of the concept digging for truth, what comes to your mind? Perhaps trying to get the real story from a child, teenager on what really happened. Perhaps a court room scene comes into mind like Law and Order, or CSI perhaps.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">When archeologists dig for artifacts, they only discover what is beneath the surface of the land. As a Christian approaches God&#8217;s Word he or she should go with the same mindset as the archeologist,<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">which is digging for truth. As you dig into God&#8217;s truth, the Holy Spirit will illuminate words, phrases, passages, chapters, etc&#8230;to you. His job is to lead you into all truth, because He is the Spirit of truth (John 16:13). When an archeologist finds a bone during a dig, he doesn&#8217;t think, &#8220;that&#8217;s nice,&#8221; and walk away. No way, he digs, and tries to see if there are others treasures around that same area. When you hear a truth that someone has dug up, from a Pastor, Teacher, Evangelist, a book, radio, TV, etc&#8230;, from the Word of God, do you walk away or do you return to the site (passage, verse, story, etc&#8230;) and start digging for truth?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">When we go to God&#8217;s Word, we should go as students desiring to learn from the Heart of the Master. The Bereans were avid students and &#8220;archeologists&#8221; of God&#8217;s Word. They examined the Scriptures as if they were going to find gold. Here are some tips we can learn from the notable Berean Church.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">1. Be Zealous for God&#8217;s Word &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">they received the message with great eagerness<\/span>&#8230;&#8221; Do you crave God&#8217;s Word, are you zealous for His truth in your life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">2. Be consistent in God&#8217;s Word. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;&#8230; [they] examined the Scriptures every day<\/span>\u201d. The Bereans not only read daily, but examined it daily. They put God&#8217;s Word under a microscope truly desiring not just to know what it said, but also what it meant, and how they could live God&#8217;s Word. Do you read God&#8217;s Word today, what about yesterday? Do you read EVERY DAY? If not, why not? Isn&#8217;t God&#8217;s Word valuable enough to dig into daily to you?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">3. Be purposeful with God&#8217;s Word. &#8220;&#8230;[<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">They] examined&#8230;to see if what Paul said was true<\/span>.&#8221; The Bereans went into the Word of God for a purpose not just religious duty. They were seeing if Paul&#8217;s Word&#8217;s were accurate according to God&#8217;s Word. Knowing God&#8217;s Word this way gives one discernment, as one can gain the ability to filter what is preached, through God&#8217;s to see if what &#8220;Reverend&#8221; is speaking truth. If you are a truth digger, then you will know when a counterfeit is spoken, because God&#8217;s Word is the truth standard. Be zealous for God&#8217;s Word, consistent in God&#8217;s Word, and purposeful with God&#8217;s Word.

I can imagine how his enemies could not figure him out. Whatever they tried to do to him, they found only worked to his advantage. When left to preach, he spread the gospel like wild fire. When they tried to contain him by locking him up, that did not stop him but rather fueled the fire of the gospel, jailers were hearing the gospel, one in particular being saved in Acts 16. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">While<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Paul could be chained, the gospel he preached could not be chained<\/span>. When they threatened to kill him, his response, \u201cfor me to live is Christ and to die is gain\u201d. What else would you do to him to diminish his joy? Absolutely nothing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the cross, he showed the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. While our time people would be casting out demons, Paul rejoiced in his suffering. He says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 12. \u201cBut I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel<\/span>\u201d. &nbsp;Not that it was preparing him for comfort or made him happy, but rather Christ was being magnified in the midst of it. These things made him known where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It\u2019s interesting to note that Paul always thrived in adversity more than he did in comfort. <\/span>That gave him such great joy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The other thing that gave him joy was brethren taking courage from his boldness while in bonds. They became engaged in preaching the gospel with greater zeal than ever before without fear, Vs. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c14&nbsp;and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear\u201d.&nbsp; <\/span>Pastor Phil\u2019s boldness to preach on the streets of New York City and the Bronx area has rubbed on me to fearlessly preach the gospel. I have witnessed him being ridiculed, heckled and threatened but that has never stopped him from preaching the gospel. Two of his buddies Ivan and Jose have gained boldness to preach on the streets because of what they see in him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">To add to his joy, he says, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 15, \u201cSome indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from goodwill: 16&nbsp;The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; 17&nbsp;but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel\u201d. <\/span>There are two classes here, those who preached Christ the right way with the wrong motive and in that he rejoiced. Paul would rather have the right gospel preached the right way by the wrong people than the right people preach the wrong gospel the wrong way.&nbsp; There were those who were envying Paul&#8217;s success, and striving to hurt him thereby. Now this would be a stumbling-block and discouragement to some. These were people who were secretly pleased when he was laid up in prison, that they might have the better opportunity to steal away the people&#8217;s affections to gain to themselves the reputation he had. As the gospel was not about him, he rejoiced that Christ was preached to which he responds in <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 18&nbsp;\u201cWhat then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Is the joy you have the kind of joy that confuses your enemies? By that I mean, whatever they try to do to silence you has no effect, if anything, it\u2019s advancing Christ where you are?. Many lose joy in the midst of suffering, can we trust Christ to make us joyous in the midst of what we go through to advance his kingdom?, Paul did and may we.

To the Philippians he wrote to exhort them in Christian experience. He wrote this epistle while in jail. And the drive for this message was joy (rejoice) even in hardship. While the church here could have been the ones to send Paul encouragement, you find that Paul being strong in his bonds to encourage them. Perhaps the church was discouraged because of what was happening to him and the thought of what might happen to them while they themselves serve Christ.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">What would have been the source of joy in remembering the Philippians and encouraging them of the same?

This is the object of which is God; to whom thanks is to be given at the remembrance of His name, and the perfections of His nature, and for all His mercies, temporal and spiritual. Remembrance of great things the Lord had done, the source of strength to keep his head up high. He wanted to encourage them with these words, \u201cI always think of you, you are dear to my heart and I pray for you\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The second thing <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 5 \u201cfor your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now\u201d.<\/span> This thought gave Paul such joy knowing that his suffering was not in vain. That through Christ he labored and the Lord allowed him to hear and experience the joy in knowing that their fellowship in the gospel was still present from the first day. This ought to have also served as an encouragement to them that their joy would not be in Paul but Christ having seen them continue in the faith in the absence of Paul.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">The third thing, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 6\u201d &nbsp;being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">it<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> until the day of Jesus Christ<\/span>\u201d. He had done what God wanted him to do, the joy he received was that he had commended these people to God\u2019s care trusting that God would keep them until the day He comes for them. Paul speaks with much confidence concerning the good estate of others, hoping well concerning them in the judgment of charity, and being confident in the judgment of faith that if they were sincere they would be joyous. Christ in you the hope of glory. What a joy we have that He who justified us, has begun to sanctify us, and will carry on this work till glory.

&nbsp;Oh that those we speak to that are bound by sin would too have the Gospel preached to them. &nbsp;Realize that God places us in seemingly horrible situations (they were beaten and placed in jail) and then will use his servants to boldly proclaim the Gospel. &nbsp; You may have a difficult time wrapping your brain around the fact that God would put his servants through pain, jail, and stocks (MacArthur shares, concerning &#8211;<a href=\"http:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Acts%2016.24\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Acts 16:24<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8211;&nbsp;inner prison\u2026in the stocks.&nbsp;<\/span>The most secure part of the prison.

Most people associate praise with being in a church building on a Sunday morning.&nbsp; Perhaps when you speak with another believer you affirm one another by saying, \u201cAmen\u201d or \u201cPraise God!\u201d&nbsp; It\u2019s much easier to praise God when things are going well, but do you put equal effort into praising God when things are not looking so promising.&nbsp; Paul and Silas praised God while they were sitting in prison.&nbsp; There are times when you and I feel like we are trapped in some sort of prison.&nbsp; Perhaps our problem or situation seems so big that we feel imprisoned by it.&nbsp; I have felt that way at times.&nbsp; At those times in our lives, if there was such a thing as a \u201cpraise-o-meter\u201d with 0 being little praise and 10 being total praise, how does our praise to the Lord measure at those times?&nbsp; Paul and Silas were thrown in prison for preaching the Gospel.&nbsp; Perhaps there are times, as I have experienced, when the Gospel has \u201cgotten you in trouble,\u201d but you were being obedient to the Lord.&nbsp; Perhaps you were asked to do something unethical, deceptive, or even immoral and because you stood for the Lord, your boss fired you, a relationship was broken, etc\u2026. &nbsp;However it was during the time when it was \u201cmost difficult\u201d to praise God that Paul and Silas praised God together.&nbsp; It wasn\u2019t just Paul and it wasn\u2019t just Silas, they partnered in praise.&nbsp; Perhaps many of us would have been praying for deliverance from the prison, but God used this praise to bring about great things.&nbsp; Don\u2019t forget that God is not the only one that hears our praises, but others do as well.&nbsp; We don\u2019t praise God aloud so show off, but simply because we love Him.&nbsp; This following illustration will display the power of praise.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Ira Sankey, before he became D. L. Moody\u2019s famous song leader (and a powerful preacher himself), was assigned to night duty in the American Civil War. While he was on duty, he lifted his eyes toward heaven and began to sing, praising the Lord while he was alone. At least, he thought he was alone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Years later, after the war had ended, Sankey was on a ship traveling across the Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp; Since he was now a famous singer, a crowd of people approached him and asked him to sing. He lifted his eyes toward heaven and sang a beautiful hymn.&nbsp; After his song, a man from the crowd asked him if, on a certain night during the Civil War, he had performed night duty for a certain infantry unit. \u201cYes, I did,\u201d was his reply.&nbsp; The man continued, \u201cI was on the opposite side of the war, and I was hiding in a bush near your camp. With my rifle aimed at your head, I was about to shoot you when you looked toward heaven and began to sing. I thought, \u2018Well, I like music, and this guy has a nice voice. I\u2019ll sit here, let him sing the song, . . . and then shoot him. He\u2019s not going anywhere.\u2019 But then I realized what you were singing. It was the same hymn my mother used to sing at my bedside when I was a child. And it\u2019s the same hymn you sang tonight! I tried, but that night during the Civil War, I was powerless to shoot you.\u201d&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Ira Sankey pointed that man to Christ. He and thousands of others were saved under Sankey\u2019s ministry. All this stemmed from the fact that Sankey praised the Lord at all times.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Whatever you are going through today, even if you feel like you are in a prison, praise Him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &nbsp;

Before sin entered into the world, all things were perfect.&nbsp; However, when we look at our land now, it can easily be seen how sin has left its ugly stain.&nbsp; In America there are 95% to 97% that profess to believe in God.&nbsp; Despite this belief abortion continues to rise, homosexuality and fornication increases, death and destruction appear to have no end in sight as the moral decay of the nation continues to spiral downward.&nbsp; What is God\u2019s remedy to the problem of moral decay in a nation?&nbsp; It is not through politicians, it is not through new programs, manipulative speeches, education, or financial growth.&nbsp; God points for His people to repent!&nbsp; Why do God\u2019s people need to repent?&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">There is a lack of humility<\/span>.&nbsp; \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Shall humble themselves<\/span>\u201d. Many of God\u2019s people do not read His word, nor submit to it.&nbsp; God is calling for His people to humble themselves.&nbsp; Why, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&nbsp; If we don\u2019t humble ourselves God will do it for us!&nbsp; Remember Jonah running away from his evangelistic responsibility, God humbled him.&nbsp; Will you humble yourself?&nbsp; God\u2019s promise for those that humble themselves is that he will lift you up.&nbsp; In God\u2019s economy, God will resist the proud hearted and welcome the humble hearted.&nbsp; Perhaps that is why the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">There is a lack of pray<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> \u201cHumble themselves and pray\u201d. <\/span>When God\u2019s people don\u2019t pray, what they are saying is that they don\u2019t need God.&nbsp; One normally doesn\u2019t talk to people what he does not know, and the reverse is true.&nbsp; Sometime back a professing believer shared that he did not see the efficacy of prayer.&nbsp; Jesus prayed and He was the Son of God, the Apostles prayed and they walked with the Master, what is your excuse if you have a prayer less life?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">There is a lack of seeking God<\/span>.&nbsp; \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">seek my face<\/span>\u201d. I\u2019ve heard it well said that many seek the hand of God but Jesus sought God\u2019s face.&nbsp; Jesus sought His Father many early mornings, when everyone was sleeping, he was seeking.&nbsp; Mark writes, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place<\/span>.\u201d&nbsp; Jesus spoke with His Father.&nbsp; I picture that Jesus not only prayed, He listened to his Father\u2019s voice, early in the morning, late at night, and sometimes all night he sought the Father.&nbsp; Like a thirsty traveler crawling through a desert seeking water, Jesus went alone to a solitary place.&nbsp; When one seeks God, one seeks His face, and upon seeing His face one seeks His will.&nbsp; Seeking God will result in seeking to do His will.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">There is a lack of seeking the lost. \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">and turn from their wicked ways\u201d<\/span>&nbsp;

Even though it&#8217;s been said that not all that glitters is gold, they never grow weary in search of priceless trinkets because that&#8217;s what their hearts beat for. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;color:black;\">Like pirates who will travel open seas through peril for a chest of gold, do you search for Christ with all your heart? Is he the treasure your heart longs for, or are you wasting away chasing after silly rainbows that fuel nothing more than the lust of the eyes. According to Matthew 6:19-20, we shouldn&#8217;t store for ourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust can destroy them, but in heaven where they are eternal. Pirates waste away to their death searching for trinkets because for every stolen trinket, their hearts lust for larger, pricier and more lavish pieces. To keep stolen treasure, they are also susceptible to betrayal, theft, and death because there is no honor among thieves.

You don&#8217;t have to live with yourself long before you see un dealt with flaws within you. You also know how people can change. People you never imagined could plan mischief against you are very much available and ready. This is life and if we never learn how to deal with these things, we will always live a defeated life trying to fit in with people, trying to please everyone only to find that you can only do so much. You will still find that there are people who don&#8217;t like you and your blessing; and some change for reasons unknown to you and I.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Let\u2019s learn something from King Ahab<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. Vs. 1, &#8220;And it came to pass after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard<\/span>&#8220;. King Ahab had power, he was married to the most wicked woman in history. Jezebel somehow had power over him running his life. Ahab was the type of king who was not satisfied with what he already had. He wanted to acquire more and more from even the people who had little. Naboth was a nobody compared to Ahab and had nothing apart from Vineyard. Vineyard is a plantation of vines producing grapes. Even though Ahab was the king, he was aware of his boundaries of what he could and could not do therefore he requested to purchase Naboth&#8217;s land for a price, however Naboth would not sell. I am yet to meet someone who says they have acquired enough needing no more. People can be driven by jealousy to desire what already belongs to others, hoping that they will step away from it so that they can have it. Pressure can be put on people to abandon what they have simply because the other person does not want them around or want what they already have. You begin to make progress and see if everyone will be pleased.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Ahab could not take what belonged to Naboth by force. This saddened him but then, Jezebel, his wife encouraged him to go against his conscious. I am troubled by people who encourage others to do wrong things coating it with good words to make it sound not too bad. Trying to influence others to go against you because they don&#8217;t want to see you blessed. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 7, &#8220;Then Jezebel his wife said to him, &#8220;You now exercise authority over Israel<\/span>&#8220;, We need to be very careful about who speaks into our lives and encourages us to do things, a good reason for discernment. Mostly we are not influenced by the outer but the inner circles as we see with Jezebel. Pushed by pressure to do something completely wrong. First mistake, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Ahab received wrong advise and took it<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 8. &#8220;And she wrote letters in Ahab&#8217;s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naboth&#8221;, <\/span>Second mistake, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">allowing Jezebel to do things in his name<\/span>. Though not acting directly, he is involved directly. If I can&#8217;t do my dirty work, I will have someone do it for me. If I can&#8217;t get what I want, I will show my pity to someone else that they step in and help me get it. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 13, &#8220;&#8230;and the scoundrels witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of people, saying, &#8220;Naboth has blasphemed God and the King&#8221;<\/span>, Third mistake, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">they lied on Naboth<\/span>. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 13, &#8220;&#8230;Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died<\/span>&#8220;, Fourth mistake, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">they killed Naboth<\/span>. Something that started very innocently escalated to greater evil. What amazes me is that Ahab was watching all these knowing they were wrong yet said nothing, he supported it. After Naboth had been killed, he took the vineyard but God had something to say about it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1Kings 21:20, &#8220;And he answered, &#8220;I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord<\/span>&#8220;. You give the enemy a room, he will want the whole house. Ahab sold himself to do evil. He yielded to that voice of Jezebel to take advantage of the situation. God did not send a message to Jezebel but to Ahab because Ahab had the power to do right and resist evil but he did not. That Jezebel spirit is causing havoc and must be silenced. Do you rejoice with those who are blessed or would you rather see them down, lie on them and speak about them to other people? Are you harboring hatred or jealousy over what they have and wishing it was yours? would you rejoice if they failed? Who do you allow to speak into your life? are they giving you good advice? Don&#8217;t sell yourself to do evil.

Envy is the grieving at the good of another, a sin that is hateful to God and hurtful to our neighbors and ourselves. This is where we fail to understand that we are all wired differently and God has placed certain things in certain people he may have not placed in others. If anything, we ought to celebrate our differences, our uniqueness and celebrate what God is doing us and others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Rachel and Leah being sisters, they were very different. It was God\u2019s doing to make them different, but instead of each celebrating their difference, they were both trying to walk in each other\u2019s shoes. The more they did, the more they were miserable. Rachel was more beautiful than Leah, she was more loved but her womb was shut. Leah on the other hand God had opened her womb and gave her children, by this time she had 4 sons when Rachel launched a complaint. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 30:1,\u201d Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister,..\u201d. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-weight:bold;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201c\u2026 and said to Jacob, \u201cGive me children, or else I die<\/span>!\u201d. I believe where there is envy, there is a misdirected approach to things. Our judgments are clouded, how we react and act is skewed and how we approach things tend to go wrong. Rachel having seen Leah her sister have children believed it was Jacob\u2019s fault she was not having children. She had forgotten that God is the author of good things. The one to call upon when there is a problem. How easy it is to turn our focus on man when things are not working out as we need them to work, and even blame others for the predicament we find ourselves in.&nbsp; <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Psalm 118:8-9 says, \u201c8 It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in man. 9 It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in princes<\/span>\u201d. Instead of trusting God, she concluded that her problems were caused by her husband. Her confidence was not in her God but in her husband.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs.&nbsp; 2&nbsp;And Jacob\u2019s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, \u201cAm I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?\u201d <\/span>Jacob is angry, because his wife ascribes nothing to the providence of God, and, by imagining that children are the offspring of chance turned on and off as man pleases. It is probable that Jacob had been already sorrowful on account of his wife&#8217;s barrenness. Jacob acknowledges God as the provider of children and uses this as an eye opener and encouragement to his confused, hurting, envious wife. He affirms that the Lord had shut her womb, he obliquely intimates that she ought to deeply to humble herself and trust God. Tragically, in vs. 3. she comes up with her own plan of giving her maid Bilhah to Jacob to have children with so as to call them her own. This is a shortcut means to blessings which is not God\u2019s way. As Matthew Henry rightfully puts it, \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Had not Rachel&#8217;s heart been influenced by evil passions, she would have thought her sister&#8217;s children nearer to her, and more entitled to her care than Bilhah&#8217;s. But children whom she had a right to rule, were more desirable to her than children she had more reason to love\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-style:italic;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">There someone right now who is envious of someone who has a better job,&nbsp; house, children, spouse etc. and it\u2019s killing you inside as you think that it\u2019s not right for them to have all that and not you. Now Moses, by exhibiting this evil in Rachel, would teach us that it is inherent in all; in order that each of us, tearing it up by the roots, may vigilantly purify ourselves from it.

He had weakness and strengths. Peter was an ordinary fisherman who walked with Jesus. His walk with Christ changed his life and I don\u2019t believe anyone can walk with Christ and not be changed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 29\u201d So He said, \u201cCome.\u201d And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus\u201d. <\/span>Jesus was (is) God to have walked on water; Peter was a man, the first man to ever walk on water. God walking on water was expected, He is God He can do anything.&nbsp; Greater testimony I see is when God takes an ordinary life and does something extraordinary in that life, glorifying Himself through that life. Even if it was for a short time due to little faith, he attempted something no man ever dared to try or even have faith in someone else to make him or her do it. Think about it, for that short time he walked on water, he gave God all the glory because he proved to the rest of the disciples and to us all that Christ is able to make us do the impossible if we believe. Also shows the Lord keeps His promises. Peter said, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">command me to come to You on the water<\/span>\u201d, the Lord said \u201cCome\u201d, a seal of His approval and the ability to make it happen. Peter took the Lord at His word, asking no questions and walked on water towards Jesus. That is daring faith, taking the Lord at His word even if it does not make sense.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">How is God glorified in us in such a daring faith? Here is something to ponder on <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u201cIf someone says to you, &#8220;You&#8217;re a man of great faith in God,&#8221; they may think that they are paying you a compliment. But they aren&#8217;t &#8212; <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">the compliment is to God<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">. For example if I said to you, &#8220;I&#8217;m a man of great faith in my doctor,&#8221; it&#8217;s actually the doctor I&#8217;m complimenting. If I have great faith in him, it means that I see him as being a man of integrity, a man of great ability -that he is trustworthy. I give &#8220;glory&#8221; to the man through my faith in him. The Bible says that Abraham &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.&#8221; (Romans 4:20-21)<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">. Abraham was a man of great faith in God. Remember, that is not a compliment to Abraham. He merely caught a glimpse <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">of God&#8217;s incredible ability, His impeccable integrity, and His wonderful faithfulness to keep every promise He makes. His faith gave &#8220;glory&#8221; to a faithful God.\u201d, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Ray Comfort<\/span>. And so was Peter\u2019s and so should us. This is the faith that is not comfortable with the normal territories; it\u2019s faith in action complimenting God. It\u2019s his faith finding an open heart seeking to please God, making Him His name great.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">To not have faith in God is to show He is not able and cannot be trusted to perform what He has promised, what an insult and that is sin, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 14:23, \u201c\u2026for whatever is not from faith is sin\u201d<\/span>.&nbsp; God has given us an awesome challenge to respond to. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Jeremiah 33:2 \u201cThus says the LORD who made it, the LORD who formed it to establish it (the LORD <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">is<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> His name): 3 \u2018<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u201d<\/span> Only those who have daring faith dare to respond to God\u2019s challenge. There are three responders to this challenge, The <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Jawbones<\/span> &#8211; they are talkers but no action, they make promises to one day respond to the challenge and never does. Then you have the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Wishbones &#8211;<\/span> the wishing ones, always wishing something would happen but never stepping out by faith. Then we have the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Backbones<\/span> &#8211; the ones who respond to the challenge, call on God and step out by faith. I want to be a backbone, I have chickened out of things I should have been trusting God to bring because I wanted to be on the safe grounds. Safe grounds did not demand much (prayer, faith, fasting). And I feel I have robbed God of the glory for Himself He could have gained if I only had the faith to operate in the unfamiliar territories. This is the prime product, the benefits are results from trust, the bible says, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him<\/span>\u201d <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Hebrews 11:6.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Two greatest things I have come across that the disciples ever requested of the Lord, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1. Teach us to pray<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Luke 11:1<\/span> and 2. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lord increase our faith, Luke 17:5<\/span>. To have asked for these two, they may have been tired of operating on the familiar and desired more, more of what the Lord had for them. They did not ask to be taught to preach, to relate, to even perform miracles. What are you asking of the Lord? You cannot pray without faith and you cannot have faith and not pray. In 2009 God performed a miracle, a plane with 155 passengers on board safely landed on Hudson River with no life lost. The plane did not even sink. The Lord has used this incident to increase my faith before, I need my faith increased again. He proved He is able to do even greater things. I am done with breadcrumbs faith; I am going for the whole bread, what He has promised. I have things I am trusting God for this year and I am believing God for daring faith, hope you join me.

The many faith teachings are more about what God can do for you financially and health wise. And if you\u2019ve listened to the same, be enlightened that there is more to faith than that. Teachings on faith today mostly dwell on the byproducts of faith. We find that often times too many of us have enough faith for breadcrumbs and not enough for a whole loaf, what He has promised. Faith enough to get us by and nothing to challenge us to grow more faith in God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Let me share on faith that\u2019s beyond getting us stuff, faith that brings glory to God<span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">. It&#8217;s not what you will gain from God that is priority, it\u2019s what God will gain for Himself through you, the rest are benefits<\/span>. That is where the Prime product supersedes the by product. Faith ought to distinguish us from the world,&nbsp; we walk by faith and not by sight and not by luck. Faith in what? <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Faith in God activated on unfamiliar territories<\/span>. If <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201cfaith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\u201d, Hebrews 11:1<\/span>, then how do we hope for what we see in the familiar territories? I believe that if we are not walking by faith,(trusting God for great and mighty things), we are robbing God of the glory He could gain for Himself through us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">In our text, Jesus fed 5 thousand men besides women and children with five loaves and two little fish. Right after, He made His disciples go by boat to the other side while He sent the multitude home. He later went to pray and meet them later<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. Vs. 24 &#8220;But the boat was now in the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">middle of the sea<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary&#8221;, <\/span>come to think of it and I could be wrong, most miracles that involved ONLY the disciples appeared to be happening in water (lake, sea) and that is fascinating to me. They were far from everyone else and the usual. In the sea, they had no one to trust in but God, they couldn\u2019t even put their faith in each other to bring them through. Everything they tried to do could not succeed. The obstacles they faced happened in the middle of the dark sea and not at the shore. These were places where they could not operate by sight but by faith. And I believe that we will never trust God for great and mighty things as long as we are trading on safe grounds, familiar territories where we have a backup plans to fall back on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vs. 25, \u201cNow in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea\u201d,<\/span> this must have been going on most of the night for when Jesus met them, between 3-6 AM, He had prayed all night while these men battled the wind all night. Jesus knew what they would be facing and still let them go. It was a faith learning class in the unfamiliar territory. He came walking on water prayed up while His disciples were hanging onto the boat for their dear lives with no avenue of escape. Then the disciples saw Him walk on water and they were afraid thinking He was a ghost. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Now the boat was just a little familiar, they had travelled by it many times and I believe that when all failed, all their little left faith (breadcrumbs) was on that boat to save them, and Here comes the King of kings, walking on water. No one had ever walked on water. And Peter all of a sudden forgets about what they went through the night&nbsp; and was still facing and said <span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">\u201cLord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d&nbsp; <\/span>It was Peter\u2019s idea to step out of the boat by faith, moved from asking for crumbs (wind to cease) to walk on water, while the rest were left in the boat. Stepping out to face what almost killed them and face it head on because of the presence of the Master. He\u2019s faith increased when saw Him do the impossible. And since he was His disciple and a disciple ought to learn from His teacher, he mastered faith in the Lord and attempted the impossible. It\u2019s assign that he was learning and growing. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">When was the last time you trusted God for something way bigger than you while in the middle of the sea? Salvation of a loved one, a miracle over what you perceived as way too bigger than your back up plan. We can\u2019t keep operating on the little faith we have when there is more we can trust God for. We got to have something, a middle of sea experience that awakens, challenges and increases our faith to even step out and concur by faith what has threatened to take our lives.

Experimentally and delightfully knowing what are the blessings which God has called you to hope for by his word and His Spirit. And in this inheritance, Paul plugs in the word riches which means abundance, the immense treasure of blessedness He has provided as an inheritance for holy souls. <\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Of course all this makes no sense until we know who we are. You cannot have inheritance unless you are an heir; for you to be an heir in this case, you have to be a son; knowing our nature, you are a slave who can only be made a son by adoption.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">How do we therefore know we are now sons? <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Romans 8:14<\/span>, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">14&nbsp;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15&nbsp;\u2026 you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d 16&nbsp;The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God<\/span>.\u201d Three things which confirms us as sons, 1.When you are led of the Spirit of God, 2. When the Spirit of adoption empowers you to cry \u201cAbba, Father\u201d which means \u201cMy Father\u201d. 3. When His Spirit bearing witness with your spirit reveals that you are His child. This is for us to understand that those converted, or born again, are adopted as children of God; upon those adopted He bestows His Spirit; this Spirit in their hearts produces a loving trust that enables them to address God as Father.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Abba, Father<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">For all these to make more sense, let\u2019s look at adoption in Genesis 48. Here is Jacob old and about to die. He is in Egypt having brought by his son Joseph. Joseph is the prime minister of Egypt, he married an Egyptian and had two sons,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span>Ephraim and Manasseh. These two boys are Jacob\u2019s grandsons who are not direct heirs of their grandfather\u2019s inheritance however watch what happens. Jacob begins by outlaying how God blessed him <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Genesis 48:3<\/span>, \u201c<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Then Jacob said to Joseph: \u201cGod Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">blessed me<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, 4 and said to me, \u2018<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d. <\/span>Then we learn why he spoke of the inheritance, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">vs. 5&nbsp;And now <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">your two sons<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">born to you<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;\">ARE MINE<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">; as <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">. 6&nbsp;\u2026; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Candara;font-size:12pt;\">Jacob adopted Joseph\u2019s two sons, he called them his.
